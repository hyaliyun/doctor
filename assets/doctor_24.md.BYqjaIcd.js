Background: Interprofessional collaboration is elementary in the intensive care unit, a success factor in difficult patient situations and complex therapies. The COVID-19-pandemic challenged newly composed treatment teams, however, experience does not exist. Aim: We analyzed personal experiences and views on inter- and intraprofessional collaboration in intensive care units during the COVID-19-pandemic and identified influencing factors. Methods: We used a qualitative, retrospective study design, collected data from physicians, nurses in intensive care, anesthesia and surgery and physiotherapists during group discussions using the story / dialogue method. We analyzed the data according to Mayring's Qualitative content analysis. Results: We identified two main categories, each with three sub-categories: 1. Mastering a exceptional situation actively (Recognizing a common goal; Acting in solidarity; Getting to know each other in inter- / intraprofessional collaboration), 2. Having overcome the exceptional situation in retrospect (Maintaining personal contacts; Gaining new knowledge and perspectives; Taking what has been learned into the future). The participants rated the interprofessional and intraprofessional collaboration as good to very good. Conclusions: Factors promoting collaboration and positive experiences are to be incorporated into everyday work. The intraprofessional management team thereby defines common goals and values for the best possible patient care.","output":"Inter- und intraprofessionelle Zusammenarbeit in Krisensituationen auf der Intensivstation am Beispiel von COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of harm reduction's most salient features is its pragmatism. Harm reduction purports to distinguish itself from dominant prohibitionist and abstinence-based policy paradigms by being grounded in what is realistic, in contrast with the moralism or puritanism of prohibition and abstention. This is reflected in the meme \\"harm reduction works\\", popular both in institutional and grassroots settings. The idea that harm reduction is realistic and effective has meant different things among the main actors who seek to shape harm reduction policy. Drawing on scholarly literature about harm reduction, as well as examples from recent harm reduction advocacy efforts in relation to drug policy in Canada, this paper argues that harm reduction distinguishes itself through a unique \\"way of knowing\\". Grassroots harm reduction advocates, particularly as they argue through human rights frameworks, do more than simply make claims for the provision of particular services-like needle exchange, safe consumption sites, safe supply and the like-on the basis that these are realistic paths toward the health and well-being of people who use drugs. Rather, as they marshal lived experience in support of these policy changes through peer-driven initiatives in contexts of prohibition, they make particular claims about what constitute valid, methodologically rigorous evidence bases for action in contexts where policies to date have been driven by ideology and have developed in ways that have excluded and marginalized those most affected from policymaking. In doing so, they advocate for the centrality of people who use drugs not only in policy-making processes, but in evidence production itself.","output":"Harm Reduction Works: Evidence and Inclusion in Drug Policy and Advocacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue virus, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, continuously threatens human health. Although several criteria for evaluation of severe dengue have been recently established, the ability to prognose the risk of severe outcomes for dengue patients remains limited. Mutant spectra of RNA viruses, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and defective virus genomes (DVGs), contribute to viral virulence and growth. Here, we determine the potency of intrahost viral population in dengue patients with primary infection that progresses into severe dengue. A total of 65 dengue virus serotype 2 infected patients in primary infection including 17 severe cases were enrolled. We utilized deep sequencing to directly define the frequency of SNVs and detection times of DVGs in sera of dengue patients and analyzed their associations with severe dengue. Among the detected SNVs and DVGs, the frequencies of 9 SNVs and the detection time of 1 DVG exhibited statistically significant differences between patients with dengue fever and those with severe dengue. By utilizing the detected frequencies/times of the selected SNVs/DVG as features, the machine learning model showed high average with a value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC, 0.966  0.064). The elevation of the frequency of SNVs at E (nucleotide position 995 and 2216), NS2A (nucleotide position 4105), NS3 (nucleotide position 4536, 4606), and NS5 protein (nucleotide position 7643 and 10067) and the detection times of the selected DVG that had a deletion junction in the E protein region (nucleotide positions of the junction: between 969 and 1022) increased the possibility of dengue patients for severe dengue. In summary, we demonstrated the detected frequencies/times of SNVs/DVG in dengue patients associated with severe disease and successfully utilized them to discriminate severe patients using machine learning algorithm. The identified SNVs and DVGs that are associated with severe dengue will expand our understanding of intrahost viral population in dengue pathogenesis.","output":"Assessment of the Risk of Severe Dengue Using Intrahost Viral Population in Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Patients via Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanoparticle assembly is a complex and versatile method of generating new materials, capable of using thousands of different combinations of particle size, shape, composition, and ligand chemistry to generate a library of unique structures.

METHODS Thirty 28-week-old male New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into control group (CON; n=14) and PE group (PE; n=16; 5 mg/kg body weight/day) after receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON. Before and after inductive protocol, Dynamic-MRI was employed on bilateral femora for local intra-osseous perfusion, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis and lipid-transportation, and marrow samples were quantified for adipogenesis-gene mRNA expression. Six weeks later, bilateral femora were dissected for Micro-CT-based micro-angiography, and then ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis and extravascular fat-cell-size were examined histopathologically. RESULTS The incidence of ON in the PE group (31%) was significantly lower than that in the CON group (93%). Compared to the CON group, local intra-osseous perfusion was maintained in the PE group. Blocked trunk vessels were seldom found in micro-angiography of the PE-treated rabbits. Thrombosis incidence and fat-cell-size were both significantly lower in the PE group than those in the CON group. During the early period after induction, indicator of coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation and adipogenesis-gene expression were found with significantly changing pattern in the PE group compared to the CON group.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to analyze the quality and usability of data dictionaries of HIV studies. METHODS: For the clinical domain of HIV, we searched data sharing platforms and acquired a set of 18 HIV related studies from which we analyzed 26 328 data elements. We identified existing standards for creating a data dictionary and reviewed their use. To facilitate aggregation across studies, we defined three types of data dictionary (data element, forms, and permissible values) and created a simple information model for each type. RESULTS: An average study had 427 data elements (ranging from 46 elements to 9 945 elements). In terms of data type, 48.6% of data elements were string, 47.8% were numeric, 3.0% were date and 0.6% were date-time. No study in our sample explicitly declared a data element as a categorical variable and rather considered them either strings or numeric. Only for 61% of studies were we able to obtain permissible values. The majority of studies used CSV files to share a data dictionary while 22% of the studies used a non-computable, PDF format. All studies grouped their data elements. The average number of groups or forms per study was 24 (ranging between 2 and 124 groups/forms). An accurate and well formatted data dictionary facilitates error-free secondary analysis and can help with data de-identification. CONCLUSION: We saw features of data dictionaries that made them difficult to use and understand. This included multiple data dictionary files or non-machine-readable documents, data elements included in data but not in the dictionary or missing data types or descriptions. Building on experience with aggregating data elements across a large set of studies, we created a set of recommendations (called CONSIDER statement) that can guide optimal data sharing of future studies.","output":"Analysis of data dictionary formats of HIV clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Documentation and evidence analysis are major components in forensic investigation; hence two-dimensional (2D) photographs along with three-dimensional (3D) models and data are used to accomplish this task.

Consequently, survivorship issues have received increased attention. One common sequela of treatment is chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI). CICI causes a range of impairments that can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Knowledge of the prevalence of this condition is required to inform survivorship plans, and ensure adequate resource allocation and support is available for sufferers. Objective To estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment following chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. Methods Medline, Scopus, CINAHL and PSYCHInfo were searched for eligible studies which included prevalence data on CICI, as ascertained though the use of self-report, or neuropsychological tests. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed. Findings were synthesised narratively, with meta-analyses being used to calculate pooled prevalence when impairment was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Results and discussion The review included 52 studies. Time-points considered ranged from the chemotherapy treatment period to greater than 10 years after treatment cessation. Summary prevalence figures (across time-points) using self-report, short cognitive screening tools and neuropsychological test batteries were 44%, 16% and 21-34% respectively (very low GRADE evidence). Conclusion Synthesised findings demonstrate that 1 in 3 breast cancer survivors may have clinically significant cognitive impairment. Prevalence is higher when self-report based on patient experience is considered. This review highlights a number of study design issues that may have contributed to the low certainty rating of the evidence. Future studies should take a more consistent approach to the criteria used to assess impairment.

Surprisingly, the role of DTs has been highlighted in people's life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several different challenges to implement and intervene in DTs during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, the present study extended a new fuzzy approach under Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS) approach using Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method to evaluate and rank the critical challenges of DTs intervention to control the COVID-19 outbreak.

The learned helplessness theory posits that perceiving life stressors as uncontrollable leads to depression. Evidence supports this theory for youth, but the impact of perceived control diverges based on stressor type: perceived lack of control over dependent (self-generated) stressors is associated with greater depression symptoms when controlling for the frequency of stress exposure, but perceived control over independent (non-self-generated) stressors is not. However, it is unknown how perceived control over these stressor types is associated with brain structure. We tested whether perceived lack of control over dependent and independent life stressors, controlling for stressor exposure, is associated with gray matter (GM) in a priori regions of interest (ROIs; mPFC, hippocampus, amygdala) and across the cortex in a sample of 108 adolescents and emerging adults ages 14-22. There were no associations across the full sample between perceived control over either stressor type and GM in the ROIs. However, less perceived control over dependent stressors was associated with greater amygdala gray matter volume in female youth and greater medial prefrontal cortex thickness in male youth. Furthermore, whole-cortex analyses revealed less perceived control over dependent stressors was associated with greater GM thickness in cortical regions involved in cognitive and emotional regulation. Thus, appraisals of control have distinct associations with brain morphology while controlling for stressor frequency, highlighting the importance of differentiating between these aspects of the stress experience in future research.","output":"Neuroanatomical Correlates of Perceived Stress Controllability in Adolescents and Emerging Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the deepening of economic integration, it is important to study the spillover effect of macroeconomic uncertainty among regions along with social network knowledge.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the quantitative contamination of protective eyewear during different dental treatments and the efficacy of the subsequent disinfection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three standardized protective eyewear shields worn by students, dentists and dental assistants during different aerosol-producing dental treatment modalities (supragingival cleaning, subgingival periodontal instrumentation, trepanation and root canal treatment and carious cavity preparation; within all treatments, dental evacuation systems were used) were analysed, using common forensic techniques. For detection of blood contamination, luminol solution was applied onto the surface of safety shields. A special forensic test paper was used to visualize saliva contamination. Further analysis was conducted after standardized disinfection using the same techniques. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. RESULTS: Macroscopically detectable contamination was found on 60.4% of protective eyewear surfaces. A contamination with blood (median 330 pixels, equivalent to 0.3% of the total surface) was detected on all shields after dental treatment. Between various dental treatments, the contamination with blood tend to be statistically significant (p = 0.054). Highest amount of blood was observed after professional tooth cleaning (median 1,087 pixels). Significant differences of saliva contamination were detected between the different measurements (p < 0.001) with contamination only after dental treatment. Due to the low variance and right-skewed distribution for saliva contamination, no statistical analysis between different treatments could be performed. After disinfection, 0.02% blood contamination and no saliva contamination were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Disinfection is effective against blood and saliva contamination. Macroscopically, clean protective eyewear contains up to 12% surface contamination with blood.

The new UK-National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend CT coronary angiography (CTCA) for all patients, while European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends functional tests. We sought to compare the clinical utility and perform a cost analysis of these recommendations in two UK centres with different primary investigative strategies. METHODSRESULTS We compared two groups of patients, group A (n=667) and group B (n=654), with new onset chest pain in two neighbouring National Health Service hospitals, each primarily following either ESC (group A) or NICE (group B) guidance. We assessed the clinical utility of each strategy, including progression to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and revascularisation. We present a retrospective cost analysis in the context of UK tariff for stress echo (176), CTCA (220) and ICA (1001). Finally, we sought to identify predictors of revascularisation in the whole population.Baseline characteristics in both groups were similar. The progression to ICA was comparable (9.9% vs 12.0%, p=0.377), with similar requirement for revascularisation (4.0% vs 5.0%.; p=0.532). The average cost of investigations per investigated patient was lower in group A (279.66 vs 325.77), saving 46.11 per patient. The ESC recommended risk score (RS) was found to be the only predictor of revascularisation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p<0.001). CONCLUSION Both NICE and ESC-proposed strategies led to similar rates of ICA and need for revascularisation in discrete, but similar groups of patients.

However, the characteristics of ACE2-positive cells and the expression of other SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes are still worthy of further investigation. Here, we performed singlecell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) analysis on 853 male embryo primordial germ cells (PGCs) and 2,854 normal testis cells to assess the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the male reproductive system from embryonic stage to adulthood.

We found that ACE2 expressing cells existed in almost all testis cell types and Sertoli cells had highest expression level and positive cells ratio. Moreover, ACE2 was also expressed in human male PGCs. In adulthood, the level of ACE2 expression decreased with the increase of age. We also found that ACE2 positive cells had high expressions of stress response and immune activation-related genes. Interestingly, some potential SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes such as TMPRSS2, BSG, CTSL and CTSB had different expression patterns in the same cell type.

Method Four independent samples of 9,325 individuals completed self-reported measures from three countries (the United States, Hungary, and Germany). The psychometric properties of the CSBD-19 were examined in terms of factor structure, reliability, measurement invariance, and theoretically relevant correlates. A potential threshold was determined to identify individuals with an elevated risk of CSBD. Results The five-factor model of the CSBD-19 (i.e., control, salience, relapse, dissatisfaction, and negative consequences) had an excellent fit to the data and demonstrated appropriate associations with the correlates. Measurement invariance suggested that the CSBD-19 functions similarly across languages. Men had higher means than women. A score of 50 points was found as an optimal threshold to identify individuals at high-risk of CSBD. Conclusions The CSBD-19 is a short, valid, and reliable measure of potential CSBD based on ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines.

The paper offers a comprehensive study on the role of digital technologies and its important impact on employees in the competitive world. A measure for the role of digital technologies and employee experience was built and tested for its reliability and validity. Descriptive statistics were used to understand the importance of digital technology and its impact on the employee experience in Indian firms. The results show that if a company has to thrive through these testing times, the only solution is through the integration of technology into their organizational structure. This has to be a permanent inclusion instead of a temporary solution for battling the side effects of the Covid-19 lockdown. The results also show that technological resolutions offer sustainable compensations across the business segments, and companies should emphasize investing in updating employees skill sets. Through the survey, it was also evident that organizations and institutions irrespective of their size or market share had to incorporate employee development including basic technological know-how apart from technical skill sets. These initiatives will help the organization and institutions to maintain their business models and profitability even in post-Covid times.

While many patients have clinically recovered, little is known about long-term alterations in T cell responses of COVID-19 convalescents. In this study, T cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a long-time COVID-19 clinically recovered (20C26 weeks) cohort (LCR) were measured via flow cytometry and ELISpot. The T cell responses of LCR were comparatively analyzed against an age and sex matched short-time clinically recovered (4C9 weeks) cohort (SCR) and a healthy donor cohort (HD). All volunteers were recruited from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China. Phenotypic analysis showed that activation marker PD-1 expressing on CD4(+) T cells of LCR was still significantly lower than that of HD. Functional analysis indicated that frequencies of Tc2, Th2 and Th17 in LCR were comparable to those of HD, but Tc17 was higher than that of HD. In LCR, compared to the HD, there were fewer IFN- producing T cells but more IL-2 secreting T cells. In addition, the circulating Tfh cells in LCR were still slightly lower compared to HD, though the subsets composition had recovered. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in LCR were comparable to that of SCR. Collectively, T cell responses experienced long-term alterations in phenotype and functional potential of LCR cohort. However, after clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses could be sustained at least for six months, which may be helpful in resisting re-infection.

METHODS: In this case control study, 159 women with a single pregnancy and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and randomly selected 332 healthy pregnant women with similar gestational ages were included. COVID-19 patients were classified as mild, moderate, and severe. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and 25-OH D vitamin <10 ng/mL was defined as severe vitamin D deficiency, also 25-OH D vitamin level between 20-29 ng/mL (525-725 nmol/L) was defined as vitamin D insufficiency. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels of the pregnant women in the COVID-19 group (12.46) were lower than the control group (18.76). 25-OH D vitamin levels of those in the mild COVID-19 category (13.69) were significantly higher than those in the moderate/severe category (9.06). In terms of taking vitamin D supplementation, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. However, it was observed that all of those who had severe COVID-19 were the patients who did not take vitamin D supplementation. CONCLUSION: The vitamin D levels are low in pregnant women with COVID-19. Also, there is a significant difference regarding to vitamin D level and COVID-19 severity in pregnant women.

A range of antibiotics with different dosage and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis as all included studies used this classification. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non-surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which involved individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2664 adult participants. 14 studies were at low, 8 at high, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk of bias. Seven trials did not contribute data to the analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the 10 comparisons which reported long-term follow-up (&#8805; 1 year). None of the studies reported data on antimicrobial resistance and patient-reported quality of life changes.

No serious adverse events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very low-certainty evidence (for long-term follow-up) to inform clinicians and patients if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are of any help for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis. There is insufficient evidence to decide whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside SRP. None of the trials reported serious adverse events but patients should be made aware of the common adverse events related to these drugs. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted clearly defining the minimally important clinical difference for the outcomes closed pockets, CAL, PD, and BOP.","output":"Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents an unprecedented situation in the most recent history. It has had a number of negative consequences for individuals and for whole societies. Individual effects of the pandemic include not only loss of life and of physical health, but also deteriorated quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effect of core self-evaluations (CSE), social support and fear of COVID-19 on the well-being of university students in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey on a nationwide group of 1,000 students of Polish universities. The survey was carried out between 1 and 15 March 2021. The respondents filled out the following set of tools: World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale, Core Self-Evaluations Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale. RESULTS: The findings showed that core self-evaluations (CSE) were significantly positively associated with well-being in each of the four domains studied: physical health (r = 0.519), psychological (r = 0.763), social relationships (r = 0.465) and environment (r = 0.496). Similarly, social support correlated positively with physical health (r = 0.277), psychological health (r = 0.306), social relationships (r = 0.552) and environment (r = 0.496). Fear of COVID-19 correlated negatively with well-being in the domain of physical health (r = 0.188), in social relationships (r = 0.042) and with regard to the environment (r = 0.071), the correlations were weak. However, the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and well-being in the psychological domain was not confirmed. CONCLUSION: The findings point to the significant role of CSE and the role of social support in the perceived quality of life of young people during the pandemic. They provide valuable data concerning individuals who are particularly vulnerable to the adverse psychological effects at the time of the pandemic. They also prove that research conducted to explore other factors protecting individual well-being in difficult situations, including that of the pandemic, should be continued.","output":"Well-being of Polish university students after the first year of the coronavirus pandemic: The role of core self-evaluations, social support and fear of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 continues to rage with devastating consequences on human health and global economy. The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. The roles of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, in which the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intracommunication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein.

For situations where a detention under mental health legislation is required to keep an individual safe, psychiatrists may consider whether to conduct an assessment in person or using video technology. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not stipulate that an assessment has to be conducted in person. Yet, the Code of Practice envisions that detention assessments would be conducted face to face in all circumstances. During the pandemic, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, a statutory body with a duty to promote best practice of the Act, has been asked whether it may be acceptable and indeed preferable for some assessments to be conducted via video technology. Where an assessment is needed to determine if a patient needs to be detained, and where there is a need for social distancing or the need for 'shielding', remote assessments may in some circumstances be preferable. In this article, we outline the modification of the Mental Welfare Commission's previous outright rejection of virtual assessments as the pandemic progressed and discuss the ethical and legal issues the possibility of remote assessments has exposed.

Thus, it offers guidelines for more sustainable value chains. Design/methodology/approach: While business strategies have focused on optimizing natural resource exploitation and on constructing global value chains to face sustainability issues, this study first explains why these strategies are not effective in preventing natural resource depletion. Second, it offers a model for anticipating resource depletion. The cut flower industry constitutes a central case to explain the model. Two other industry cases complement the demonstration. Findings: To anticipate natural resource depletion and thus improve industry sustainability, firms must shift from the exploitation of endangered natural resources to the use of alternative local ones. This shift, however, encourages firms to reconstruct value chains and rethink how they create value within these new value chains. It also has an impact on firms growth strategy: they must replicate value chains on a local scale instead of taking part in global value chains. Research limitations/implications: The findings rely on illustrations from the cut flower, fishing and textile fiber industries. Generalization to other industries may strengthen the argument. Originality/value: This study offers a model of sustainable growth for firms willing to anticipate natural resource depletion by offering a shift in value chains. It consists of exploiting alternative natural resources and of rethinking the value offered to consumers. Thus, it goes against current models that merely focus on optimizing natural resource exploitation within global value chains. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Disappearing natural resources: what flowers tell us about new value chains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic performance of rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFAs) compared with an ELISA and nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) in individuals with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Patients presenting to a Dutch teaching hospital were eligible between 17 March and 10 April 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The performances of six different LFAs were evaluated in plasma samples obtained on corresponding respiratory sample dates of NATs testing. Subsequently, the best performing LFA was evaluated in 228 patients and in 50 sera of a historical patient control group. RESULTS: In the pilot analysis, sensitivity characteristics of LFA were heterogeneous, ranging from 2/20 (10%; 95% CI 0%-23%) to 11/20 (55%; 95% CI 33%-77%). In the total cohort, Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test LFA had a sensitivity of 43/99 (43%; 95% CI 34%-53%) and specificity of 126/129 (98%; 95% CI 95%-100%). Sensitivity increased to 31/52 (60%; 95% CI 46%-73%) in patients with at least 7 days of symptoms, and to 21/33 (64%; 95% CI 47%-80%) in patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) &#8805;100 mg/L.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to correlate CT patterns of fatal cases of COVID-19 with post-mortem pathology observations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 70 lung lobes of 14 patients who died from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. All patients underwent ante-mortem CT and autopsy between March 9 and April 30, 2020. Board-certified radiologists and pathologists performed lobe-wise correlations of pulmonary observations. In a consensus reading, 267 radiological and 257 histopathological observations of the lungs were recorded and systematically graded according to severity. These observations were matched and evaluated. RESULTS: Predominant CT observations were ground glass opacities (GGO; 59 of 70 lobes examined) and areas of consolidation (33/70). The histopathological observations were consistent with diffuse alveolar damage (70/70), capillary dilatation and congestion (70/70), often accompanied by microthrombi (27/70), superimposed acute bronchopneumonia (17/70) and leukocytoclastic vasculitis (7/70). Four patients had pulmonary emboli. Bronchial wall thickening on CT histologically corresponded with acute bronchopneumonia. GGOs and consolidations corresponded with mixed histopathological observations including capillary dilation and congestion, interstitial edema, diffuse alveolar damage and microthrombosis. Vascular alterations were prominent observations in both CT and histopathology. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of GGO correlated with the pathologic processes of diffuse alveolar damage, capillary dilatation and congestion and microthrombosis.

The analysis of RNA or DNA helps to diagnose infectious diseases and identify genetic determined disorders or even cancer. Starting from mono-parametric tests within the last years, technologies have evolved that allow for the detection of many parameters in parallel, e.g., by using multiplex nucleic acid amplification techniques, microarrays, or next-generation sequencing technologies. The introduction of closed-tube systems as well as lab-on-a-chip devices further resulted in a higher automation degree with a reduced contamination risk. These applications complement or even stepwise replace classical methods in clinical microbiology like virus cultures, resistance determination, microscopic and metabolic analyses, as well as biochemical or immunohistochemical assays. In addition, novel diagnostic markers appear, like noncoding RNAs and miRNAs providing additional room for novel biomarkers. This article provides an overview of microarrays as diagnostics devices and research tools. Introduced in 1995 for transcription analysis, microarrays are used today to detect several different biomolecules like DNA, RNA, miRNA, and proteins among others. Mainly used in research, some microarrays also found their way to clinical diagnostics. Further, closed lab-on-a-chip devices that use DNA microarrays as detection tools are discussed, and additionally, an outlook toward applications of next-generation sequencing tools in diagnostics will be given.","output":"Microarrays as Research Tools and Diagnostic Devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Those with metastatic urothelial carcinoma generally respond more poorly to chemotherapy after they have progression on a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). There is interest in combining CPIs with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies as a strategy to exploit the efficacy and immunomodulatory effects of chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a single institution, retrospective analysis including all patients treated between May 2018 and May 2020 with carboplatin and paclitaxel, concurrently or sequential with pembrolizumab, after having progression on a CPI alone. Clinical characteristics, response by RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival, and safety/tolerance of the treatment are reported. RESULTS Median age was 80 years (64-85). Five patients (100%) had visceral metastases when starting carboplatin and paclitaxel. Chemotherapy was given with concurrent pembrolizumab (four patients) or following pembrolizumab (one patient) and continued until maximum response, significant toxicity, or progression. Two patients subsequently remained on maintenance pembrolizumab. There were four partial responses and one patient with stable disease. All patients on follow-up have progressed with median time to progression of 47 weeks (18-75). Two patients died from disease progression. CONCLUSIONS This case series suggests that the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab leads to durable freedom from progression in some with metastatic urothelial cancer, who have progressed on a CPI alone.

Hospitals face increasing risk of periods of scarcity of life-sustaining resources such as ventilators for mechanical respiratory support, as has been the case in Italy as of March, 2020. The National Academy of Medicine has provided guidance on crisis standards of care, which call for the reallocation of scarce medical resources to those who will benefit most during extreme situations. Given that this will require a departure from the usual fiduciary duty of the bedside clinician, we determined and mapped potential barriers to the implementation of the guidelines from stakeholders using an implementation science framework. Methods: A protocol was created to operationalize national and state guidelines for triaging ventilators during crisis conditions. Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted from July-September 2018 with clinicians at three acute care hospitals of an urban academic medical center. Respiratory therapists, intensivists, nursing leadership and the palliative care interdisciplinary team participated in focus groups. Key informant interviews were conducted with emergency management, respiratory therapy and emergency medicine. Subjects were presented the protocol and their reflections were elicited using a semi-structured interview guide. Data from transcripts and notes were categorized using a coding strategy based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. Results: Participants anticipated that implementing this protocol would challenge their roles and identities as clinicians including both their fiduciary duty to the patient and their decision-making autonomy. Despite this, many participants acknowledged the need for such a protocol to standardize care and minimize bias as well as to mitigate potential consequences for individual clinicians.

Given that depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, it could affect the use of healthcare. This study aims to examine the association between the severity of new-onset depression and unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults. METHODS: Data from 15,588 participants, derived from the 2014, 2016, and 2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were examined. Only individuals who were not diagnosed with depression was included to exclude those who visited hospitals to treat depression or were experiencing unmet healthcare needs due to depression. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and unmet healthcare needs acted as the dependent variable. A multiple/multinomial logistic regression analysis was built to analyze the association between the variables. RESULTS: Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs compared to those without (men: adjusted OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.40C3.00; women: adjusted OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.72C2.82). White-collar men with severe depression also had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs (adjusted OR = 9.72, 95% CI = 4.73C20.00). Individuals with severe depression had a higher risk of having unmet healthcare needs due to economic hardship than those without depression (men: adjusted OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.76C5.14, women: adjusted OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.96C4.38). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a significant relationship between the severity of new-onset depression and the risk of having unmet healthcare needs among South Korean adults.

Firefighter turnout gear is designed to protect against immediate fire hazards but not against chemical agents. Additionally, the decontamination of firefighter personal protective equipment remains unresolved. This study evaluated the feasibility of a screening method based on headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) in combination with chemometrics (cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis) for the assessment of the transference of volatile compounds through turnout gear. To achieve this, firefighter turnout gears exposed to two different fire scenes (with different combustion materials) were directly analyzed. We obtained a spectral fingerprint for turnout gears that were both exposed and non-exposed to fire scenes. The results showed that (i): the contamination of the turnout gears is different depending on the type of fire loading; and (ii) it is possible to determine if the turnout gear is free of volatile compounds. Based on the latest results, we concluded that HS-GC-IMS can be applied as a screening technique to assess the quality of turnout gear prior to a new fire intervention.","output":"Assessment of Volatile Compound Transference through Firefighter Turnout Gear."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Involving medical students in research in their undergraduate careers may increase the likelihood that they will be research active after graduation.

Following PHA technique and extensive investigation, the management team determined that the most recent problems at the Evergreen hotel are in marketing and human resources. The 39 parameters and 40 principles of TRIZ were used to determine the improvement solution and create a solution strategy that simultaneously simplified critical control-point (CCP) processes and improved the correctness of tasks, increasing CCP efficiency and supporting and satisfying customer demands in the COVID-19 pandemic in the world in general and in Taiwan in particular. The results revealed that customer bookings grew over the four quarters of 2020 due to adjusting the cancellation policy, discounting, and segmenting the market from international to domestic, increasing the CCP efficiency percentage and customer rating score from 19% to 40% and 8.3 to 8.5 score, respectively. Aside from that, changing the hotel structure with a partnership with the Taixie company assisted Evergreen in reducing various cost pressures to manage the business and recover after a difficult period.

Animals: Sixty Pugs with NME and 14 contemporaneous control Pugs with other intracranial diseases (non\\\\NME group). Methods: Pugs that were euthanized or died because of intracranial disease were prospectively obtained. All dogs had necropsy, histopathology, and testing for various infectious diseases and were subsequently divided into NME and non\\\\NME groups. Signalment, geographic distribution, seasonal onset, treatment, and survival were compared between groups. Results: In Pugs with NME, median age at onset of clinical signs was 18 months (range, 4C113 months). A greater proportion of female dogs were present in the NME group (40/60) compared with the control group (6/14). Pugs with NME had a significantly lower mean weight (7.81 kg) than control Pugs (9.79 kg) (P= .012). Mean survival in Pugs with NME was 93 days (range, 1C680 days), with dogs receiving any form of treatment living significantly longer than those that were not treated (P= .003). Anticonvulsive drugs were the only treatment significantly associated with longer survival (P= .003). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: NME appears to be a common cause of intracranial signs in Pugs, based on the high proportion of NME dogs reported in this population. Pugs with NME are most commonly young adult female dogs. Although further investigation is needed to determine the optimal treatment of NME, anticonvulsive drugs appear to beneficially affect duration of survival.","output":"Epidemiology of Necrotizing Meningoencephalitis in Pug Dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in late 2019, a novel coronavirus labeled SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world, affecting millions.

Exploring a method that can quickly and accurately analyze the content of key elements in ceramic raw materials is of great significance to improve the quality of ceramic products. In this work, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is used for rapid analysis of ceramic raw materials. The chemical element composition and content of ceramic raw materials are quite different, which leads to serious matrix effects. Building an artificial neural network model is an effective way to solve the complex matrix effects, but model training can easily lead to overfitting due to the high number of spectral features and the limited number of samples. In order to solve this problem, we propose a feature extraction method that combines the linear regression (LR) and the sparse and under-complete autoencoder (SUAC) neural network. This LR + SUAC method performs nonlinear feature extraction and dimension reduction on high-dimensional spectral data. The spectral data dimension is reduced from 8188 to 100 through the LR layer, and further reduced to 32 through the SUAC encoding layer. Further, a quantitative analysis model for the elemental composition of ceramic raw materials is established by the combination of LR + SUAC and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). Since the input data dimension and redundant information are greatly reduced by LR + SUAC, the overfitting problem of BPNN is greatly reduced.

Prior to concatenating with the WC1 co-receptor, æ T cells had clustering of TCR-CD3 complexes and exclusion of CD45. æ T cells may individually express more than one variant of the WC1 family of molecules and we found that individual WC1 variants are clustered in separate protein islands in quiescent cells. However, the islands containing different variants merged following cell activation and before merging with the TCR islands.

In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact of governmental action and public perception are incorporated as part of the time-varying transmission rate. The model simulation is performed using the two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data from Wuhan, China.

Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides were dominant (60-70% mean combined occupancy) at all ages. A low abundance of Bifidobacterium was observed in infants exposed to antibiotics at delivery and at 1 and 3 months, with no difference between delivery methods. A lower abundance of Bacteroides was observed after caesarean section than vaginal delivery, irrespective of antibiotic exposure. Additionally, occupancy by Bifidobacterium at 1 and 3 months and by Bacteroides at 3 months differed between infants with and without siblings. All these differences disappeared at 6 months. Infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics displayed altered Bifidobacterium abundance, whereas abundance of Bacteroides was largely associated with the delivery method.

Saudi Arabia not only plays an important role on the economical side because it is the leading country in oil production, but also because it is considered the heart of the Islamic countries. Although protective measures have been implemented in Saudi Arabia, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased. Aims of the study: This study aimed to employ SIR model to forecast the peak of COVID-19 progression and an estimation of it is end in Saudi Arabia. Method: Based on the World Health Organization data on COVID-19 progression in Saudi Arabia from March 3rd to April 29th, 2020, we reliably estimate the constant parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and potential ending time. Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered are the main components of the SIR model that were used to run the analysis. Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 20th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 20th of May. Then the cases will decrease until the 55th day, which is around June 20th.

In particular, we focused on whether this property is attributable to direct inhibition of reovirus attachment and/or inhibition of viral replication with the aid of time-of-addition (pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post-treatment) experiments. No significant antiviral activity of kuraridin was detected in the pre-treatment assay. In the simultaneous assay, the 50% effective inhibitory concentrations (EC50) of kuraridin were 15.3C176.9 M against human type 1C3 reoviruses (HRV1C3) and Korean porcine reovirus (PRV). Kuraridin completely blocked binding of viral sigma 1 protein to sialic acids at concentrations lower than 82.5 M in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Moreover, kuraridin inhibited HRV1C3 and PRV viral replication with EC50 values of 14.0C62.0 M. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis disclosed strong suppression of reovirus RNA synthesis at the late stage (18 h) of virus replication by kuraridin. The viral yields of kuraridin-treated cells were significantly reduced at 24 h post-infection, compared with DMSO-treated cells. Our results collectively suggest that kuraridin inhibits virus adsorption and replication by inhibiting hemagglutination, viral RNA and protein synthesis and virus shedding, supporting its utility as a viable candidate antiviral drug against reoviruses.","output":"In vitro anti-reovirus activity of kuraridin isolated from Sophora flavescens against viral replication and hemagglutination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Dysgeusia and anosmia have been liked to COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study is to study the prevalence of dysgeusia and anosmia in COVID-19 patients treated at the University of Florida Health Center and establish the odds of having an olfactory and gustatory disorder with a confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study utilizing the University of Florida Health Center patients' registry i2b2 platform to search for ICD 10 diagnoses of COVID-19 infection and taste and smell disturbances. We assessed the odds ratio for patients with dysgeusia and anosmia having a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection using a logistic regression model adjusting for gender, race, age, and comorbidity conditions. P < 0.05 was deemed significant. RESULTS: Out of 889 individuals that tested positive for COVID-19, 12.88% were diagnosed with taste and smell disturbances. The odds ratio for COVID-19 for people with dysgeusia and anosmia was 39.107. After adjusting for sex, age, and race, it was 41.9, 37, and 34.2, respectively. CONCLUSION: Taste and smell disturbances in COVID-19 are not anecdotal. It is paramount that oral and maxillofacial surgeons include taste and smell disturbances in the history and physical examination as these symptoms are suspicious of active COVID-19 infection. Patients presenting with an olfactory and gustatory disorder should undergo further evaluations for COVID-19 infection and oral and maxillofacial surgeons should enhance the personal protective equipment used when treating these patients to prevent further spread of the infection and protect other healthcare members.","output":"Should anosmia and dysgeusia be a concern for oral and maxillofacial surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the interaction strategies and the evolutionary game analysis of the actions taken by the government and the public in the early days of the epidemic are incorporated into the natural transmission mechanism model of the epidemic, and then the transmission frequency equations of COVID-19 epidemic is established.

These include government licenses, compulsory licenses, march-in rights for inventions created with federal funding, government use rights, enforcement restrictions, subject-matter restrictions, and a host of private governance regimes. Each has been discussed in various contexts by scholars and policymakers and some, in some degree, have been employed in different cases at different times. But scholars have yet to explore how each of these choices are subject toor removed fromdemocratic control. Assessing the range of democratic implications of these patent governance choices is important in understanding the social and political implications of controversial or wide-ranging technologies because their use has a significant potential to affect the polity. This paper seeks to unpack these concerns for genome editing, such as CRISPR, specifically. Patents covering genome editing make an interesting case because, to date, it appears that the polity is concerned less with certain kinds of access, and more with distribution and limits on the technologys particular uses, such as human enhancement and certain agricultural and environmental applications. Here, we explore what it means for patents to be democratic or non-democratically governed and, in so doing, identify that patents covering many of the most controversial applicationsthat is, ones most likely to gain public attentionare effectively controlled by either non- or anti-democratic institutions, namely, private restrictions on licensing. This may be effectivefor nowbut lawmakers should be wary that such restrictions could rapidly reverse themselves. Meanwhile, other choices, like compulsory licenses, more broadly touch on democratic deliberation but, as currently structured, are aimed poorly for particular applications. Insofar as the public wants, or perhaps deserves, a say in the distribution and limits of these applications, illuminating the ways in which these governance choices intersector fail to intersectwith democratic institutions is critical. We offer some concluding thoughts about the nature of patents and their relationship with democratic governance as distributed claims to authority, and suggest areas for scholars and policymakers to pay close attention to as the genome editing patent landscape develops.","output":"Governance Choices of Genome Editing Patents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entry into cells of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a prototype member of the paramyxoviruses, is believed to occur by direct fusion at the plasma membrane through a pH-independent mechanism. In addition, NDV may enter host cells by an endocytic pathway. Treatment of cells with drugs that block caveolae-dependent endocytosis reduced NDV fusion and infectivity, the degree of inhibition being dependent on virus concentration. The inhibitory effect was reduced greatly when drugs were added after virus adsorption. Cells treated with methyl beta-cyclodextrin, a drug that sequesters cholesterol from membranes, reduced the extent of fusion, infectivity and virus-cell binding; this indicates that cholesterol plays a role in NDV entry. Double-labelling immunofluorescence assays performed with anti-NDV monoclonal antibodies and antibodies against the early endosome marker EEA1 revealed the localization of the virus in these intracellular structures. Using fluorescence microscopy, it was found that cell-cell fusion was enhanced at low pH.

This study examined the incidence, time course and predictive value of PGD after living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT). METHODS We retrospectively investigated 75 patients (42 with LDLLT and 33 with CLT) who underwent lung transplantation from January 2008 to December 2013. Patients were assigned PGD grades at six time points, as defined by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: immediately after final reperfusion, upon arrival at the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after ICU admission. RESULTS The incidence of severe (Grade 3) PGD at 48 or 72 h after ICU admission was similar for LDLLT and CLT patients (16.7 vs 12.1%; P = 0.581). The majority of the LDLLT patients having severe PGD first developed PGD immediately after reperfusion, whereas more than half of the CLT patients first developed severe PGD upon ICU arrival or later. In LDLLT patients, severe PGD immediately after reperfusion was significantly associated with fewer ventilator-free days during the first 28 postoperative days [median (interquartile range) of 0 (0-10) vs 21 (13-25) days, P = 0.001], prolonged postoperative ICU stay [median (interquartile range) of 20 (16-27) vs 12 (8-14) days, P = 0.005] and increased hospital mortality (27.3 vs 3.2%, P = 0.02). Severe PGD immediately after reperfusion was not associated with ventilator-free days during the first 28 postoperative days, time to discharge from ICU or hospital, or hospital mortality in CLT patients. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative incidence of severe PGD was not significantly different between LDLLT and CLT patients. In LDLLT patients, the onset of severe PGD tended to be earlier than that in CLT patients. Severe PGD immediately after reperfusion was a significant predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality in LDLLT patients but not in CLT patients.","output":"Graft dysfunction immediately after reperfusion predicts short-term outcomes in living-donor lobar lung transplantation but not in cadaveric lung transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the standard of care in the management of clinically localized cancer, but is considered complicated due to the presence of adhesions, and the location of transplanted ureter/kidney. To date, a few case series or studies on RP in RTR have been published, especially in Asian patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety and report the experience with RP on RTR. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data of 1270 patients who underwent RP from January 2008 to March 2020, of which 5 patients were RTR. All available baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative data (operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of hospital stay, complication), pathological stage, Gleason score, surgical margin status, and pre/postoperative creatinine were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 5 RTR who underwent RPs (1 open radical prostatectomy (ORP), 1 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), 2 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALRP), and 1 Retzius-sparing RALRP (RS-RALRP)) prostatectomy, the mean age ( SD) was 70 ( 5.62) years. In LRP and RALRP cases, the standard ports were moved slightly medially to prevent graft injury. The mean operative time ranged from 190 to 365 min. The longest operative time and highest EBL (630 ml) was the ORP case due to severe adhesion in Retzius space. For LRP and RALRP cases, the operative times seemed comparable and had EBL of  300 ml. All RPs were successful without any major intra-operative complication. There was no significant change in graft function. The restorations of urinary continence were within 1 month in RS-RALRP, approximately 6 months in RALRP, and about 1 year in ORP and LRP. Three patients with positive surgical margins had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence at the first follow-up and 1 had later PSA recurrence. Two patients with negative margins were free from biochemical recurrence at 47 and 3 months after their RP.

METHODS A total of 245 clinical samples, which were negative either for diagnostic tests of human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3 by indirect immunofluorescence assay or human metapneumovirus by RT-PCR, were screened for HCoV-NL63 by nested PCR amplifying gene fragments located on the 1b and 1a genes. Amplicon of PCR from 1a gene of HCoV-NL63 was sequenced and the sequences were compared with those in GenBank nucleotide sequence database. RESULTS Three (1.2%) out of the 245 samples were positive for HCoV-NL63 by nested-PCR using primers on 1b gene. These three samples also showed positive results on nested PCR in which primers were designed with sequences complementary to 1a gene segments.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised year-to-date intervention analyses of in- and outpatient key procedures, machine occupancy, and no-show rates in calendar weeks 12 to 19 of 2019 and 2020 to evaluate effects of active patient flow management while monitoring nosocomial COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: Active patient flow management helped to maintain first-visit appointment compliance above 85.5%. A slight appointment reduction of 10.3% daily (pa?= 0.004) could still significantly increase downstream planning CT scheduling (pa?= 0.00001) and performance (pa?= 0.0001), resulting in an absolute 20.1% (pa?= 0.009) increment of CT performance while avoiding overbooking practices. Daily treatment start was significantly increased by an absolute value of 18.5% (pa?= 0.026). Hypofractionation and acceleration were significantly increased (pa?= 0.0043). Integrating strict testing guidelines, a distancing regimen for staff and patients, hygiene regulations, and precise appointment scheduling, no SARS-CoV-2 infection in 164 tested radiation oncology service inpatients was observed. CONCLUSION: In times of reduced medical infrastructure capacities and resources, controlling infrastructural time per patient as well as optimizing facility utilization and personnel workload during treatment evaluation, planning, and irradiation can help to improve appointment compliance and quality management.

We assessed exploratory associations between oxygenation index and Hb concentration at admission and clinical outcomes. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to evaluate the nonlinear relations observed and the classification and regression trees (CART) algorithm to assess the interaction effects found.Results: From March to July 2020, 643 patients were admitted, of which 52% were male. The median age was 60 years old, and the most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (35.76%). The median value of SpO2/FiO2 was 419, and the median Hb concentration was 14.8 g/dL. The mortality was 19.1% (123 patients). Age, sex, and history of hypertension were independently associated with mortality. We described a nonlinear relationship between SpO2/FiO2, Hb concentration and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with mortality and an interaction effect between SpO2/FiO2 and Hb concentration. Patients with a similar oxygenation index had different mortality likelihoods based upon their Hb at admission. CART showed that patients with SpO2/FiO2 < 324, who were older than 62 years, and had an Hb of >= 16 g/dl had the highest mortality risk (96%). Additionally, patients with SpO2/FiO2 > 324 but Hb of < 12 and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of > 4 had a higher mortality likelihood (57%).

Extreme values of Hb, either low or high, showed an increase in likelihood of mortality. However, Hb concentration modified the SpO2/FiO2 effect on mortality; the likelihood of death in patients with low SpO2/FiO2 increased as Hb increased.","output":"The interaction effect between hemoglobin and hypoxemia on COVID-19 mortality in a sample from Bogota, Colombia: An exploratory study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this manuscript, we formulated a new nonlinear SEIQR fractional order pandemic model for the Corona virus disease (COVID-19) with Atangana-Baleanu derivative.

Surprisingly, little is understood about what contributes to referral factors. Aims To gain new insight into the referral factors from primary dental care by interrogating the tri-speciality West Yorkshire managed clinical network (MCN) referral pathway data for a 36-month period (2016-2019). Methods Anonymised referrals from the electronic referral management system were collated for analyses. Results There were 98,671 referrals within the 36-month period, 12.3% of which were rejected. Of those accepted for triage, 76% were directed at oral surgery, with >60% accounted for by exodontia. In total, 10% of referrers accounted for 60% of all referrals. Peak referral occurred five years after General Dental Council registration. Discussion This is the first report of referral data from a tri-speciality MCN with exodontia referrals predominating. The data set demonstrates variation in referrer behaviours despite referral guidance. Referrals should be based upon patient need but patterns observed in this study suggested possible associations with high and low referral patterns which warrant further research. Conclusions Interrogation of the referral database suggests that there are interesting patterns of referral which may be associated with characteristics of the referrer as well as their patients' needs. Further investigation could inform improved processes and service design, as well as education delivery and workforce development.","output":"An evaluation of referrer factors for 98,671 referrals made to the West Yorkshire oral surgery managed clinical network over a three-year period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 38-year-old man presented with cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue He was diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) as well as Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia Imaging revealed a subaortic membrane with aortic valve endocarditis and severe aortic insufficiency He had successful aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis and subaortic membrane resection This case highlights some of the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges presented by COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Endocarditis Complicated by Severe Aortic Insufficiency in a Patient with COVID-19: Diagnostic and Management Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gross maxillofacial injuries are challenging to manage because they can be complicated by airway obstruction, injuries to the cervical spine, and cranial structures.

The emerging of novel escape variants of the influenza A virus is still a considerable challenge in the annual process of vaccine production. The evolution of vaccines ranks among the most critical successes in medicine and has eradicated numerous infectious diseases. Recently, multi-epitope vaccines, which are based on the selection of epitopes, have been increasingly investigated. RESULTS: This study utilized an immunoinformatic approach to design a recombinant multi-epitope vaccine based on a highly conserved epitope of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and membrane matrix proteins with fewer changes or mutate over time. The potential B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and CD4 T cell epitopes were identified. The recombinant multi-epitope vaccine was designed using specific linkers and a proper adjuvant. Moreover, some bioinformatics online servers and datasets were used to evaluate the immunogenicity and chemical properties of selected epitopes. In addition, Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico trial computational framework was run after influenza exposure and recombinant multi-epitope vaccine administration, showing a good immune response in terms of immunoglobulins of class G (IgG), T Helper 1 cells (TH1), epithelial cells (EP) and interferon gamma (IFN-g) levels. Furthermore, after a reverse translation (i.e., convertion of amino acid sequence to nucleotide one) and codon optimization phase, the optimized sequence was placed between the two EcoRV/MscI restriction sites in the PET32a(+) vector. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed Recombinant multi-epitope vaccine was predicted with unique and acceptable immunological properties. This recombinant multi-epitope vaccine can be successfully expressed in the prokaryotic system and accepted for immunogenicity studies against the influenza virus at the in silico level. The multi-epitope vaccine was then tested with the Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico trial platform. It revealed slight immune protection against the influenza virus, shedding the light that a multistep bioinformatics approach including molecular and cellular level is mandatory to avoid inappropriate vaccine efficacy predictions.

There are four identified factors that puts one at high-risk for infection and/or mortality creating a disparity: age, comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and gender. Data indicate that the older a person is, and/or the presence of obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease place one at higher risk for COVID-19. In the United States, specific race/ethnicities, particularly African Americans and Native Americans, are strong COVID-19 risk components. Male gender has also emerged as a severity risk factor. For age and racial/ethnicities, the accumulation of health comorbidities are common precipitating mechanisms. In particular, underlying socioeconomic structures in the United States likely drive development of comorbidities, putting affected populations at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Sudden cardiac death triggered by a common sodium channel variant in African Americans with COVID-19 has not been evaluated as a cause for racial disparity. There is no evidence that racial/ethnic differences for COVID-19 are caused by ABO blood groups, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or from amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There is growing evidence that androgen-enabled expression of ACE2 receptors and the serine protease TMPRSS2, two permissive elements engaging the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for infection, may contribute to severe COVID-19 in men.

DESIGN Randomised controlled trial. SETTING Eight teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. POPULATION One hundred women scheduled to undergo vaginal hysterectomy for benign conditions excluding pelvic organ prolapse. METHODS Women were randomised to vessel sealing or conventional surgery. The quality of life related to pelvic floor function was assessed using validated questionnaires before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Pain scores and recovery were assessed using a diary, including daily visual analogue scale scores, starting from the day before surgery until 6 weeks after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Visual analogue scale pain scores, surgery time, blood loss, complications, quality of life related to pelvic floor function and costs. RESULTS The evening after surgery, women in the vessel-sealing group reported significantly less pain (5.7 versus 4.5 on a scale of 0-10, P = 0.03), but after that pain scores were similar. Operation duration was shorter for vessel sealing (60 versus 71 minutes, P = 0.05). Blood loss and hospital stay did not differ. We observed no major difference in costs between the two interventions (2903 versus 3102 , P = 0.26). Changes in micturition and defecation symptoms were not affected by the surgical technique used.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) permits States to restrict rights by enacting permissible limitations on them at any time and by derogating from their protection in emergencies. This article argues that States should rely on the ICCPRs permissible limitations provisions rather than lodge formal derogations in times of crisis, unlike what many States have done during the COVID-19 pandemic. It draws upon New Zealands highly successful public health response to support this proposition. The article argues that the accountability machinery for compliance with States rights obligations is stronger when permissible limitations are enacted. Where States do rely on the right to derogate, the article suggests some improvements to existing international accountability mechanisms. These include enhancing the analysis to be contained in notices of derogation and advance capacity-building to enable States to better decide if derogation is necessary in the first place. Ultimately, the article argues that keeping States within the international human rights system is ideal. This can be achieved through reliance on the flexibility built into the ICCPR via its permissible limitations provisions rather than its right of derogation.

To inhibit mutation-based development of new escape variants, elements that are indispensable for the virus may be targeted. The 5-polyU tract of the antigenome offers one such target. Host cells do not harbor 5-polyU tracts on any of their transcripts, making the tract an attractive virus-specific target. We hypothesize that inhibiting the 5-polyU by complementary oligonucleotide can limit the use of the tract as template for virus to generate 3 polyA tails of RNA viruses. Here, we used a frameshift-inducing DNA oligonucleotide with 3 polyAs to target the 5-polyU tract of mouse coronavirus (MHV-A59). Results from assays for double stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis, infectivity of released virions, and syncytium formation indicate that the oligonucleotide treatment prevented generation of infectious virions. Our results show a unique mode of action of the designed 3-polyA oligonucleotide against mouse coronavirus which leaves host cells unaffected. This strategy can be adopted for the development of novel classes of oligonucleotide-based drugs that inhibit the production of infectious RNA viruses, including the coronaviruses. Since the 5-polyU tract is conserved and is essential for variants of coronaviruses, this strategy can potentially address coronavirus variant emergence as well.","output":"Crippled Coronavirus: 5'-PolyU targeted Oligo prevents development of infectious Virions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Low airway surface pH is associated with many airway diseases, impairs antimicrobial host defense, and worsens airway inflammation. Inhaled Optate is designed to safely raise airway surface pH and is well tolerated in humans. Raising intracellular pH partially prevents activation of SARS-CoV-2 in primary normal human airway epithelial (NHAE) cells, decreasing viral replication by several mechanisms. METHODS: We grew primary NHAE cells from healthy subjects, infected them with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020), and used clinical Optate at concentrations used in humans in vivo to determine whether Optate would prevent viral infection and replication. Cells were pretreated with Optate or placebo prior to infection (multiplicity of infection = 1), and viral replication was determined with plaque assay and nucleocapsid (N) protein levels. Healthy human subjects also inhaled Optate as part of a Phase 2a safety trial. RESULTS: Optate almost completely prevented viral replication at each time point between 24 h and 120 h, relative to placebo, on both plaque assay and N protein expression (P < .001). Mechanistically, Optate inhibited expression of major endosomal trafficking genes and raised NHAE intracellular pH. Optate had no effect on NHAE cell viability at any time point. Inhaled Optate was well tolerated in 10 normal subjects, with no change in lung function, vital signs, or oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled Optate may be well suited for a clinical trial in patients with pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is vitally important for patient safety that formulations designed for inhalation with regard to pH, isotonicity, and osmolality be used. An inhalational treatment that safely prevents SARS-CoV-2 viral replication could be helpful for treating patients with pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"A Treatment to Eliminate SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Human Airway Epithelial Cells Is Safe for Inhalation as an Aerosol in Healthy Human Subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to reveal the functioning of the Capital Markets Board rating activities and analyze their effects on our country's economy.

The exposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in public places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, office suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active patients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by doing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a different number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds. The system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate exposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved preparedness and precise responses for the pandemic.

While rare in the US, there have been cases located east of the Mississippi River. We will describe a case of typhus fever in an elderly male located in Dallas, Texas. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man with Parkinson Disease and hearing impairment developed acutely progressing weakness and encephalopathy. At baseline he was oriented to self and others and could ambulate with a walker. Now he was unable to ambulate, sit up in a chair and required a sitter due to disorientation. Initial labs were unremarkable save thrombocytopenia. He was admitted for progressing Parkinson vs infectious meningitis. The next day, he was less responsive and aphasic with a fever of 102.1F. An infectious work up and empiric antibiotics were started. By day 3, fever remained with negative cultures prompting an Infectious Disease consult. Head CT was unrevealing (cochlear implants precluded MRI). EEG revealed diffuse encephalopathy without epileptiform discharges. Lumbar puncture was deemed unsafe (thrombocytopenia). Repeat blood cultures, viral respiratory panel, COVID testing, strep pneumoniae, legionella and mycoplasma serologies, HIV, and a myriad of serologies for atypical sources of fever were drawn C all negative. Empiric treatment was broadened to include CNS dosing. On day 8, he required intubation for respiratory failure. Post platelet transfusion an LP was done, ultimately negative. On day 11, serologic Typhus Fever antibodies (IgM) resulted. At the time of diagnosis he had become ventilator dependent and prognosis was grim. Family withdrew life sustaining measures on day 13. DISCUSSION: Typhus fever occurs via louse feces which are highly infectious with Rickettsia and infect the host via injured skin or mucous membranes. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and rash. Neurologic manifestations include confusion, drowsiness, seizures, and coma. Diagnosis is made via serologic studies;immunofluorescent antibody tests or immunoblots. Treatment varies from days to weeks of doxycycline or chloramphenicol. Prognosis is dependent on patient demographics. Mortality is higher in males and increases with age. Prior to the development of antibiotics, prognosis was poor and mortality was high. With modern efficiency of testing and antibiotics, mortality has modestly improved (10-40%). CONCLUSIONS: While rare, Typhus fever is an important diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with encephalopathy regardless of location. Prognosis is fair in those promptly treated. Thus, high suspicion combined with early testing and empiric treatment is crucial for recovery. REFERENCE #1: Anderson, JO. Andersson, SG. A century of typhus, lice and Rickettsia.

This paper reports on a case study of the conditional connectives (CCs) wenn/falls if/when, if/in case in German. Using distributional evidence, I argue that wenn and falls differ in lexical pragmatics: They express different degrees of speaker commitment (i.e., credence) toward the modified antecedent proposition at the non-at-issue dimension. This contrast can be modeled using the speaker commitment scale (Giannakidou and Mari, 2016), i.e., (More committed)<WENN p, FALLS p>(Less committed). Four experiments are reported which tested the wenn/falls contrast, as well as the summary of an additional one from Liu (2019). Experiment 1 tested the naturalness of sentences containing the CCs (wenn or falls) and conditional antecedents with varying degrees of likelihood (very likely/likely/unlikely). The starting prediction was that falls might be degraded in combination with very likely and likely events in comparison to the other conditions, which was not borne out. Experiment 2 used the forced lexical choice paradigm, testing the choice between wenn and falls in the doxastic agents conditional thought, depending on their belief or disbelief in the antecedent. The finding was that subjects chose falls significantly more often than wenn in the disbelief-context, and vice versa in the belief-context. Experiment 3 tested the naturalness of sentences with CCs and an additional relative clause conveying the speakers belief or disbelief in the antecedent. An interaction was found: While in the belief-context, wenn was rated more natural than falls, the reverse pattern was found in the disbelief-context. While the results are mixed, the combination of the findings in Experiment 2, Experiment 3 and that of Experiment 4a from Liu (2019) that falls led to lower speaker commitment ratings than wenn, provide evidence for the CC scale. Experiment 4b tested the interaction between two speaker commitment scales, namely, one of connectives (including weil because and wenn/falls) and the other of adverbs (factive vs. non-factive, Liu, 2012). While factive and non-factive adverbs were rated equally natural for the factive causal connective, non-factive adverbs were preferred over factive ones by both CCs, with no difference between wenn and falls. This is discussed together with the result in Liu (2019), where the wenn/falls difference occurred in the absence of negative polarity items (NPIs), but disappeared in the presence of NPIs. This raises further questions on how different speaker commitment scales interact and why.","output":"Processing Non-at-Issue Meanings of Conditional Connectives: The wenn/falls Contrast in German"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Especially during global pandemics but also in the context of epidemic waves, the capacity for diagnostic qRT-PCRs rapidly becomes a limiting factor.

Obviously, people aim to shorten their isolation periods, hospitals need to discharge convalescent people, and re-employ staff members after infection. The aim of the study was to optimize retesting regimens for test-to-release from isolation and return-to-work applications. For this purpose, we investigated the association between Ct values at the first diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the period until test negativity was reached, or at least until the Ct value exceeded 30, which is considered to indicate the transition to a non-infectious state. We included results from the testing of respiratory material samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, tested from 01 March 2020 to 31 January 2022. Lower initial Ct values were associated with longer periods of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. Starting with Ct values of <20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, and >35, it took median intervals of 20 (interval: 14-25), 16 (interval: 10-21), 12 (interval: 7-16), 7 (interval: 5-14), and 5 (interval: 2-7) days, respectively, until the person tested negative.

Furthermore, the time to negativity was longer for adults versus children, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variant versus other variants of concern, and in patients who were treated in the intensive care units.

Alternatively, it can arise because of jurisdictional restrictions imposed by local authorities. We run reduced form models of social distancing as a function of county-level exogenous demographic variables and jurisdictional fixed effects for 49 states to assess the relative contributions of demographic and jurisdictional effects in explaining social distancing behavior. To allow for possible spatial aspects of a contagious disease, we also model the spillovers associated with demographic variables in surrounding counties as well as allow for disturbances that depend upon those in surrounding counties. We run our models weekly and examine the evolution of the estimated coefficients over time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. These estimated coefficients express the revealed preferences of individuals who were able to and chose to stay at home to avoid the disease. Stay-at-home behavior measured using cell phone tracking data exhibits considerable cross-sectional variation, increasing over nine-fold from the end of January 2020 to the end of March 2020, and then decreasing by about 50% through mid-June 2020. Our estimation results show that demographic exogenous variables explain substantially more of this variation than predictions from jurisdictional fixed effects. Moreover, the explanations from demographic exogenous variables and jurisdictional fixed effects show an evolving correlation over the sample period, initially partially offsetting, and eventually reinforcing each other. Furthermore, the predicted social distance from demographic exogenous variables shows substantial spatial autoregressive dependence, indicating clustering in social distancing behavior. The increased variance of stay-at-home behavior coupled with the high level of spatial dependence can result in relatively intense hotspots and coldspots of social distance, which has implications for disease spread and mitigation.","output":"Demographic, jurisdictional, and spatial effects on social distancing in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there has been a noticeable change in atypical presentations of several rheumatological diseases following COVID-19 infections.

Evidence from previous pandemics suggest that bariatric patients may experience increased emotional distress and difficulty adhering to healthy lifestyle changes post-surgery. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the impact of the novel COVID-19 public health crisis on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery. METHOD: In a nested-qualitative study, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 23 post-operative bariatric patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) at a Canadian Bariatric Surgery Program between 2014 and 2020. A constant comparative approach was used to systematically analyze the data and identify the overarching themes. RESULTS: Participants (n = 23) had a mean age of (48.82  10.03) years and most were female (n = 19). The median time post-surgery was 2 years (range: 6 months-7 years). Themes describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' post-bariatric surgery self-management included: coping with COVID-19; vulnerability factors and physical isolation; resiliency factors during pandemic; and valuing access to support by virtual care. The need for patients to access post-operative bariatric care during COVID-19 differed based on gender and socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted patients' ability to self-manage obesity and their mental health in a variety of ways. These findings suggest that patients may experience unique psychological distress and challenges requiring personalized care strategies to improve obesity self-care and overall well-being.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic is a consequence of international trade and globalisation, with the virus spreading along established trade and travel routes. However, the pandemic also affects international trade through reductions in both supply and demand. In this Viewpoint we describe the many implications for health and propose ways to mitigate them. Problems include reduced access to medical supplies (in particular, personal protective equipment and tests), budgetary shortfalls as a result of reduced tariffs and taxes, and a general decline in economic activity-leading, in many cases, to recessions, threats to social safety nets, and to increased precariousness of income, employment, and food security. However, in exceptional cases, the pandemic has also brought some transient benefits, including to the environment. Looking ahead, there will be great pressure to further liberalise rules on trade to encourage economic recovery, but it is essential that trade policy be informed by its many consequences for health to ensure that the benefits are maximised and threats are minimised through active identification and mitigation.","output":"COVID-19 and the collapse of global trade: building an effective public health response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains [Formula: see text] or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1).

This longitudinal study explored the frequency, severity and pattern of cognitive impairment and functional implications 1 year after hospitalisation with COVID-19 and its trajectory from 3 months after hospitalisation. Patients who had been hospitalised with COVID-19 from our previously published 3-months study at the Copenhagen University Hospital were re-invited for a 1-year follow-up assessment of cognitive function, functioning and depression symptoms. Twenty-five of the 29 previously assessed patients (86%) were re-assessed after 1 year (112 months). Clinically significant cognitive impairments were identified in 48-56 % of patients depending on the cut-off, with verbal learning and executive function being most severely affected. This was comparable to the frequency of impairments observed after 3 months. Objectively measured cognitive impairments scaled with subjective cognitive difficulties, reduced work capacity and poorer quality of life. Further, early cognitive impairments after 3 months were associated with the severity of subsequent depressive symptoms after 1 year. In conclusion, the stable cognitive impairments in approximately half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and negative implications for work functioning, quality of life and mood symptoms underline the importance of screening for and addressing cognitive sequelae after severe COVID-19.","output":"Trajectory of cognitive impairments over 1 year after COVID-19 hospitalisation: pattern, severity, and functional implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Currently, a large number of hospitalized coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients have met the clinical discharge criteria and have been discharged. Little is known about the sequelae and herd immunity, two important factors influencing the life quality and safety of COVID-19 survivors. Methods: Discharged COVID-19 patients from four medical facilities in Wuhan, China, were followed in order to record and investigate possible post-COVID-19 sequelae and herd immunity. After hospital discharge, patients reported to Fangcang shelter hospitals for an initial 14-day period of mandatory clinical monitoring. After release from these shelter hospitals, patients returned home for self-quarantine. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection. Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip assay (ICGSA) was used for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody testing. The data for this study are derived from case reports, medical records, and self-reports. Results: A total of 3,677 COVID-19 survivors [median age = 59 years, interquartile range (IQR) = 47C68, range = 10C98; 55.5% female] who were released from four hospitals in Wuhan, China, between January 18 and March 29, 2020 were followed for a median of 144 days (IQR = 135C157). During follow-up, 976 (26.5%) patients had at least one post-COVID-19 sequela. The incidence of post-COVID-19 sequelae among elderly COVID-19 survivors (age 60 years) was slightly increased compared to that of young COVID-19 survivors (age <60 years; relative risk = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02C1.10, p = 0.007). During follow-up, a dramatic reduction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (88.0%, 95% CI = 84.2C90.4) and IgM (93.2%, 95% CI = 88.5C96.4) antibodies was observed. Among these COVID-19 survivors, 1.2% (n = 45) retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1.0% (n = 37) died during follow-up. Of those who died during follow-up, 70.3% were male and all were negative for both IgG and IgM, except for one person who was IgG-positive. Conclusions: Our study documents significant post-COVID-19 sequelae that impair functions of multiple organ systems in COVID-19 survivors, suggesting that the long-term effects of this disease will negatively impact survivors' quality of life, continue to strain health care systems, and result in extended periods of lost productivity.

Some of the many contributing factors include mechanical strain, poor tissue-mesh integration, and degradation of matrices. The high recurrence rate witnessed with the use of acellular dermal matrices (ADM) for definitive hernia repair has reduced their use largely to bridging repair and breast reconstruction. Modalities that improve classic cellular metrics of successful VHR could theoretically result in improved rates of hernia recurrence; autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may represent one such tool, but has been underinvestigated for this purpose. METHODS Lewis rats (32) had chronic ventral hernias created surgically and then repaired with Strattice? mesh alone (control) or mesh + autologous PRP. Samples were harvested at 3 and 6 months postoperatively and compared for gross, histologic, and molecular outcomes of: neovascularization, tissue incorporation, peritoneal adhesions, hernia recurrence, and residual mesh thickness. RESULTS Compared to control at 3 months postoperatively, PRP-treated rats displayed significantly more neovascularization of implanted mesh and considerable upregulation of both angiogenic genes (vEGF 2.73-fold, vWF 2.21-fold) and myofibroblastic genes (SMA 9.68-fold, FSP-1 3.61-fold, Col1a1 3.32-fold, Col31a1 3.29-fold). Histologically, they also showed enhanced tissue deposition/ingrowth and diminished chronic immune cell infiltration. Peritoneal adhesions were less severe at both 3 (1.88 vs. 2.94) and 6 months (1.63 vs. 2.75) by Modified Hopkins Adhesion Scoring. PRP-treated rats experienced decreased hernia recurrence at 6 months (0/10 vs. 7/10) and had significantly improved ADM preservation as evidenced by quantification of residual mesh thickness. CONCLUSIONS PRP is an autologous source of pro-regenerative growth factors and chemokines uniquely suited to soft tissue wound healing. When applied to a model of chronic VHR, it incites enhanced angiogenesis, myofibroblast recruitment and tissue ingrowth, ADM preservation, less severe peritoneal adhesions, and diminished hernia recurrence.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed health care institutions; as a consequence, nurses' lives and psycho-physical health have been affected. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic forced nurses to work in physically and psychologically stressful conditions impacting on their life. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study. All narratives (texts and videos) posted by nurses from the 23rd of February 2020 to the 3rd of May (from the start of the outbreak to the end of the first lockdown) were analysed and published on the five most popular Italian professional social media platforms. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the 380 narratives explored: 'Sharing what is happening within myself'; 'Experiencing unprecedented working conditions'; 'Experiencing a deep change'; 'Failing to rehabilitate the image of nurses in society'; and 'Do not abandon us'. Even though nurses appreciated the recognition of their communities, they still felt devalued and not recognized as professionals. DISCUSSION: Several psychological, physical, social and professional implications emerged from nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being highly praised, nurses perceived they had failed in rehabilitating the image of nurses in society. CONCLUSION: The experience of working during the COVID-19 pandemic represented a traumatic event for nurses but it offered them personal and professional growth opportunities.

As we learn about the virus and the pandemic, it is becoming evident that it is an age-associated problem that affects the human population. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. These are large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses. Our knowledge of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is extremely recent but is growing daily. There are currently no antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention. The long term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain but extrapolations can be made about the potential effects of the virus on cellular lifespan as well as on organismal healthspan. Here, we posit that severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 infection may, in the long-term, lead to accelerated aging phenotypes in survivors, not only in affected tissues but also in other organs, including the brain. Since some of the effects could manifest months or years after infection, it will be necessary to follow carefully people affected by coronavirus disease 2019. Keeping accurate registries may enable us to, in the future, establish connections with aging-associated disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Scientists have been trying to acquire more knowledge on different aspects of COVID-19. This study attempts to determine the effects of COVID-19, on a large population, which has already been persistently exposed to various atmospheric pollutants in different parts of India. Atmospheric pollutants and COVID-19 data, obtained from online resources, were used in this study. This study has shown strong positive correlation between the concentration of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and both the absolute number of COVID-19 deaths (r = 0.79, p < 0.05) and case fatality rate (r = 0.74, p < 0.05) in India. Statistical analysis of the amount of annual fossil fuels consumption in transportation, and the annual average concentration of the atmospheric PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), in the different states of India, suggest that one of the main sources of atmospheric NO(2) is from fossil fuels combustion in transportation.

To enable host read removal for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data on low-specification laptops, we developed ReadItAndKeep, a fast lightweight tool for Illumina and nanopore data that only keeps reads matching the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Peak RAM usage is typically below 10MB, and runtime less than one minute. We show that by excluding the polyA tail from the viral reference, ReadItAndKeep prevents bleed-through of human reads, whereas mapping to the human genome lets some reads escape.

Early diagnosis is important to access supportive measures to maximise quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in NHS pathways; the majority of GP appointments now occur online with subsequent delays in secondary care assessment. Given the rapid progression of MND, patients may be disproportionately affected resulting in late stage new presentations. We used Monte Carlo simulation to model the pre-COVID-19 diagnostic pathway and then introduced plausible COVID-19 delays. Methods The diagnostic pathway was modelled using gamma distributions of time taken: 1) from symptom onset to GP presentation, 2) for specialist referral, and 3) for diagnosis reached after neurology appointment. We incorporated branches to simulate delays: when patients did not attend their GP and when the GP consultation did not result in referral. An emergency presentation was triggered when diagnostic pathway time was within 30 days of projected median survival. Total time-to-diagnosis was calculated over 100,000 iterations. The pre-COVID-19 model was estimated using published data and the Improving MND Care Survey 2019. We estimated COVID-19 delays using published statistics. Results The pre-COVID model reproduced known features of the MND diagnostic pathway, with a median time to diagnosis of 399 days and predicting 5.2% of MND patients present as undiagnosed emergencies. COVID-19 resulted in diagnostic delays from 558 days when only primary care was 25% delayed, to 915 days when both primary and secondary care were 75%. The model predicted an increase in emergency presentations ranging from 15.4%-44.5%. Interpretations The model suggests the COVID-19 pandemic will result in later-stage diagnoses and more emergency presentations of undiagnosed MND. Late-stage presentations may require rapid escalation to multidisciplinary care. Proactive recognition of acute and late-stage disease with altered service provision will optimise care for people with MND.

Diarrhea was observed in all control calves and 3/8 of inoculated calves (p = 0.03), but it did not occur in calves that tested positive for C. difficile toxins. Fecal toxins were identified only from two controls. PCR-ribotyping confirmed the presence of C. difficile PCR-ribotype 077 in samples of all inoculated calves, but not from controls. The identification of five other PCR-ribotypes in 3/8 (37.5%) and 2/6 (33.3%) of inoculated and control calves, respectively, indicated early natural infection (24 h of age). Five of 14 cecal samples had C. difficile (p = 0.01).

Cells treated with 18-GA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 100 M at 48 h. The cell growth inhibition resulted in induction of apoptosis and decreased the mitochondria membrane potential ((m)) and increased caspase-8, -9 and -3 activities. Furthermore, cytochrome c and AIF were released from mitochondria, as shown by western blotting and confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. Western blotting showed that 18-GA increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid and decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, furthermore, results also showed that 18-GA increased Fas and Fas-L which are associated with surface death receptor in HL-60 cells. Based on those observations, the present study supports the hypothesis that 18-GA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells involves the activation of the both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.","output":"18-Glycyrrhetinic Acid Induces Apoptosis of HL-60 Human Leukemia Cells through Caspases- and Mitochondria-Dependent Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immigration legal services providers (ISPs) are a principal source of support for low-income immigrants seeking immigration benefits. Yet there is scant quantitative evidence on the prevalence and geographic distribution of ISPs in the United States.

We use spatial optimization methods to analyze the geographic network of ISPs and measure ISPs' proximity to the low-income immigrant population. Because both ISPs and immigrants are highly concentrated in major urban areas, most low-income immigrants live close to an ISP. However, we also find a sizable fraction of low-income immigrants in underserved areas, which are primarily in midsize cities in the South. This reflects both a general skew in non-governmental organization service provision and the more recent arrival of immigrants in these largely Southern destinations. Finally, our optimization analysis suggests significant gains from placing new ISPs in underserved areas to maximize the number of low-income immigrants who live near an ISP.

Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) provides an accurate validated method for early detection of subclinical myocardial dysfunction. So far, long-term cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 are undetermined therefore several validated methods should be used for early diagnosis and intervention in those patients. PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to describe GLS as an indicator of myocardial injury in a case series of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients complaining of persistent dyspnea after resolution of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A total number of 18 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were not indicated for hospital admission due to mild symptoms presenting with residual persistent dyspnea following COVID-19 infection resolution. Through clinical examination and standard 2D transthoracic echocardiography with STE emphasizing on LV-GLS was performed using Philips Epic - Qlab 10 software. RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 37.446.33 years, the mean time from COVID-19 diagnosis was 48.115.45 days, all patients (100%) had persistent dyspnea grade II. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 62.93.46% while the mean LV-GLS was ?15.552.16%. Clinical and echocardiographic data is presented in Table 1. CONCLUSION: In a case series of non-hospitalized COVID-19 survivors who complained of persistent dyspnea, GLS was low in comparison to the normally reported values of LV-GLS although they had normal LVEF indicating the persistence of myocardial injury even in mild cases of COVID-19 long after infection resolution. Further close follow-up of even mild and moderate COVID-19 survivors is certainly required to detect long-term cardiovascular sequelae. 2D STE with LV-GLS can be used as a readily available validated technique to detect early or persistent myocardial dysfunction succeeding COVID-19 infection.

Although it is known that the risk of severe disease is increased in certain human populations, including the elderly, it remains unclear why others who consume contaminated food develop listeriosis. Here, we used a murine model to discover that pulmonary coinfections can impair the host's ability to adequately control and eradicate systemic Lm that cross from the intestines to the bloodstream. We found that the resistance of mice to oral Lm infection was dramatically reduced by coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), a bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract and can also cause severe infections in the elderly. Exposure to Spn or microbial products, including a recombinant Lm protein (L1S) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), rendered otherwise resistant hosts susceptible to severe systemic Lm infection. In addition, we show that this increase in susceptibility was dependent on an increase in the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) from Ncr1+ cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Lastly, the ability of Ncr1+ cell derived IL-10 to increase disease susceptibility correlated with a dampening of both myeloid cell accumulation and myeloid cell phagocytic capacity in infected tissues. These data suggest that efforts to minimize inflammation in response to an insult at the respiratory mucosa render the host more susceptible to infections by Lm and possibly other pathogens that access the oral mucosa.","output":"Pulmonary insults exacerbate susceptibility to oral Listeria monocytogenes infection through the production of IL-10 by NK cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Psoriasis is a chronic dermatological condition characterized by lesions on extensor surfaces, hands, feet, and genital areas.

However, it is unclear how disruption of the GARP complex leads to MN dysfunction. To better understand the role of Vps54 in MNs, we have disrupted expression of the Vps54 ortholog in Drosophila and examined the impact on the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Surprisingly, we show that both null mutants and MN-specific knockdown of Vps54 leads to NMJ overgrowth. Reduction of Vps54 partially disrupts localization of the t-SNARE, Syntaxin-16, to the TGN but has no visible impact on endosomal pools. MN-specific knockdown of Vps54 in MNs combined with overexpression of the small GTPases Rab5, Rab7, or Rab11 suppresses the Vps54 NMJ phenotype. Conversely, knockdown of Vps54 combined with overexpression of dominant negative Rab7 causes NMJ and behavioral abnormalities including a decrease in postysynaptic Dlg and GluRIIB levels without any effect on GluRIIA.

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Addebrooke Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Attentive Matrices (AM) were administered (N = 54, 34, 28, and 28 patients, respectively). RESULTS: Prevalence of defective (cutoff = 24.89) MMSE scores was 24.3% in RCD + patients and 5.9% in the RCD ? group. ACE-R-total below cutoff scores were less frequent (RCD + : 5.4%; RCD ? : 5.9%). Abnormal performances at the FAB an AM were respectively detected in 18.9% and 8.1% of RCD + patients and 0% and 11.8% of the RCD ? group.

After cochlear implantation, auditory training is necessary for the brain to adapt to new auditory signals transmitted by the cochlear implant (CI). To date, auditory training is conducted in a face-to-face setting at a specialized center. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemics impact on health care, the need for new therapeutic settings has intensified. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility of a novel teletherapeutic auditory rehabilitation platform in adult CI recipients and compare the clinical outcomes and economic benefits of this platform with those derived from conventional face-to-face rehabilitation settings in a clinic. METHODS: In total, 20 experienced adult CI users with a mean age of 59.4 (SD 16.3) years participated in the study. They completed 3 weeks of standard (face-to-face) therapy, followed by 3 weeks of computer-based auditory training (CBAT) at home. Participants were assessed at three intervals: before face-to-face therapy, after face-to-face therapy, and after CBAT. The primary outcomes were speech understanding in quiet and noisy conditions. The secondary outcomes were the usability of the CBAT system, the participants subjective rating of their own listening abilities, and the time required for completing face-to-face and CBAT sessions for CI users and therapists. RESULTS: Greater benefits were observed after CBAT than after standard therapy in nearly all speech outcome measures. Significant improvements were found in sentence comprehension in noise (P=.004), speech tracking (P=.004) and phoneme differentiation (vowels: P=.001; consonants: P=.02) after CBAT. Only speech tracking improved significantly after conventional therapy (P=.007). The programs usability was judged to be high: only 2 of 20 participants could not imagine using the program without support. The different features of the training platform were rated as high. Cost analysis showed a cost difference in favor of CBAT: therapists spent 120 minutes per week face-to-face and 30 minutes per week on computer-based sessions. For CI users, attending standard therapy required an average of approximately 78 (SD 58.6) minutes of travel time per appointment. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed teletherapeutic approach for hearing rehabilitation enables good clinical outcomes while saving time for CI users and clinicians. The promising speech understanding results might be due to the high satisfaction of users with the CBAT program. Teletherapy might offer a cost-effective solution to address the lack of human resources in health care as well as the global challenge of current or future pandemics.","output":"Tablet-Based Telerehabilitation Versus Conventional Face-to-Face Rehabilitation After Cochlear Implantation: Prospective Intervention Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are several uncertainties as to how we will conduct these clinical, didactic, business and social activities as this COVID-19 global pandemic abates and social distancing guidelines are relaxed.

Additionally, we will have to take into consideration the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs, personal protective equipment (PPE), the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, increase in overhead costs and possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths is likely to continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or next 12-24 months. We have to prioritize surgery balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain Covid-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment and, ethical values to continue to deliver high quality economical and accessible patient care.","output":"Considerations for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons in COVID-19 era: Can we sustain the solutions to keep our patients and healthcare personnel safe?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although preventable by vaccination, Measles still causes thousands of deaths among young children worldwide.

An MTT assay was performed to determine cytotoxicity effect, and antiviral activity was measured by syncytia reduction assay and confirmed by qPCR. PPs from Ecklonia arborea (formerly Eisenia arborea, Phaeophyceae) and Solieria filiformis (Rhodophyta) showed the highest Selectivity Index (SI), >3750 and >576.9 respectively. Both PPs extracts were selected to the subsequent experiments owing to their high efficacy and low cytotoxicity compared with ribavirin (SI of 11.57). The combinational effect of PPs with sulphated polysaccharides (SPs) and ribavirin were calculated by using Compusyn software. Synergistic activity was observed by combining both PPs with low concentrations of Solieria filiformis SPs (0.01 g/mL). The antiviral activity of the best combinations was confirmed by qPCR. Virucidal assay, time of addition, and viral penetration evaluations suggested that PPs act mainly by inactivating the viral particle.

METHODS An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in five-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds Ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and post-menopausal (>50 years). RESULTS The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in women than men (about +15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about +50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are also linked to age. Pre-adolescent girls had the same risk of infection and fatality rate as boys. Adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same five-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17{beta}-estradiol has a positive effect on expression of the human ACE2 protein--which plays an essential role for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry--propensity score matching was performed for the women's sub-cohort, comparing users versus non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women >50 yrs receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95 % CI [0.18, 0.62] and the Hazard Ratio was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 yrs), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels. CONCLUSIONS As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.","output":"Evidence for treatment with estradiol for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a response to the topic of how financial stability might be used to effectively finance for the mitigation of climate change and climate risks, it is important to look at the carbon risk that is still present in G-5 nations.

Steps involved in transfers of viruses to new hosts include contact between the virus and the host, infection of an initial individual leading to amplification and an outbreak, and the generation within the original or new host of viral variants that have the ability to spread efficiently between individuals in populations of the new host.

In this study, 7,832 compounds from 32 medicinal plants of India possessing traditional knowledge linkage with pneumonia-like disease treatment, were screened against the Homology-Modelled structure of SARS-CoV-2 M protein with the objective of identifying some active phytochemicals as inhibitors. The entire study was carried out using different modules of Schrodinger Suite 2020-3. During the docking of the phytochemicals against the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, a compound, ZIN1722 from Zingiber officinale showed the best binding affinity with the receptor with a Glide Docking Score of ?5.752 and Glide gscore of ?5.789. In order to study the binding stability, the complex between the SARS-CoV-2 M protein and ZIN1722 was subjected to 50 ns Molecular Dynamics simulation using Desmond module of Schrodinger suite 2020-3, during which the receptor-ligand complex showed substantial stability after 32 ns of MD Simulation.

This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with psychological distress, fear, and coping strategies for people living in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted in August-September 2020 using online platforms in Bangladesh. People residing in Bangladesh, aged 18 years, who were proficient in English and able to respond to online questionnaire. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to assess the psychological stress. Level of fear was assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and strategies to cope were assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Results: Of the 962 participants, half of them were aged between 30 and 59 years. Being born in Bangladesh, having graduate education, perceived distress due to employment change, effect of COVID-19 on financial situation, having multiple comorbidities, and visiting a healthcare provider in the last 4 weeks were associated with higher levels of both psychological distress and fear of COVID-19. Furthermore, higher psychological distress was associated with being a female (AOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.33C2.47, p < 0.001), being a frontline worker (AOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04C2.15, p < 0.05), having pre-existing psychiatric problems (AOR 4.03, 95% CI 1.19C13.7, p < 0.05), being a smoker (AOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.32C3.09, p < 0.01), providing care to a known/suspected COVID-19 patient (AOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.40C2.72, p < 0.001), having a recent overseas travel history and being in self-quarantine (AOR 4.59, 95% CI 1.23C17.2, p < 0.05), self-isolation without COVID-19 (AOR 2.63, 95% CI 1.68C4.13, p < 0.001) or being COVID-19 positive (AOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.19C5.34, p < 0.05), and having high levels of fear of COVID-19 (AOR 3.27, 95% CI 2.29C4.66, p < 0.001).

Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic, which renders neuronal tissue vulnerable to infection, especially in elderly individuals or in those with neuro-comorbid conditions. Complaints of ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, and headache; reports of diseases such as stroke, encephalopathy, seizure, and encephalitis; and loss of consciousness in patients with COVID-19 confirm the neuropathophysiological aspect of this disease. The brain is linked to pulmonary organs, physiologically through blood circulation, and functionally through the nervous system. The interdependence of these vital organs may further aggravate the pathophysiological aspects of COVID-19. The induction of a cytokine storm in systemic circulation can trigger a neuroinflammatory cascade, which can subsequently compromise the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia- and astrocyte-borne Toll-like receptors, thereby leading to neuronal tissue damage. Hence, a holistic approach should be adopted by healthcare professionals while treating COVID-19 patients with a history of neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychological complications, or any other neuro-compromised conditions. Imperatively, vaccines are being developed at top priority to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and different vaccines are at different stages of development globally.

Complications of dysphagia include aspiration leading to chest infection and pneumonia, malnutrition, increased length of hospital stay and re-admission to hospital. To date, most dysphagia interventions in acute care have been tested with acute stroke populations. While intervention studies in critical care have been emerging since 2015, they are limited and so there is much to learn about the type, the delivery and the intensity of treatments in this setting to inform future clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the evidence regarding the relationship between dysphagia interventions and clinically important patient outcomes in acute and critical care settings. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL and clinical trial registries from inception to the present. We will include studies conducted with adults in acute care settings such as acute hospital wards or units or intensive care units and critical care settings. Studies will be restricted to randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a new dysphagia intervention with usual care or another intervention. The main outcomes that will be collected include length of time taken to return to oral intake, change in incidence of aspiration and pneumonia, nutritional status, length of hospital stay and quality of life. Key intervention components such as delivery, intensity, acceptability, fidelity and adverse events associated with such interventions will be collected to inform future clinical trials. Two independent reviewers will assess articles for eligibility, data extraction and quality appraisal. A meta-analysis will be conducted as appropriate.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 58 patients (38 males and 20 females; median age, 62.5 years), who had been hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia, 60% with one or more comorbidities. IgG antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were measured by ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD69(+)-expressing-IFN-producing-CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were enumerated in heparinized whole blood by flow cytometry for ICS. RESULTS: Detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M-reactive CD69(+)-IFN- CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were displayed in 17 (29.3%) and 6 (10.3%) subjects respectively, at a median of 84 days after onset of symptoms (range, 58C191 days).

The current report is an analysis of the 5UTRs from 48 sequences deposited in GenBank representing the seven described genotypes, five in Africa and two in the Americas. The YFV 5UTRs consist of 118-120 nucleotides, 92% (110/119) of which are constant in all sequences. The constancy is impressive and suggests that many participate in significant viral functions. Remarkably, analysis of the non-constant nucleotides revealed that in some instances the non-constant nucleotide changes persisted in one or a restricted number of related genotypes and were from sequences isolated over a considerable span of years. This constant feature of non-constant nucleotides is consistent with the concept that the changes were in response to different environmental features such as changes in mosquito hosts or animal reservoirs, particularly as a consequence of spread of YFV from Africa to the New World. Constancy of 5UTR in general may be helpful in distinction of viral species. Lastly, the presence of sequences of constant nucleotides greater than 19 nucleotides suggests regions of the 5UTR that may be exploited for use as non-codon RNA as treatment and diagnostic agents in a variety of viral diseases. Importance The 5UTR is arguably the most neglected portion of the viral genome. It is frequently incomplete in the sequences deposited as otherwise complete sequences in GenBank. The current report is an analysis of complete 5UTR sequences selected from those deposited in GenBank and indicates that the 5UTR is 92% conserved confirming that it is a highly conserved portion of the viral genome and suggesting that each conserved nucleotide may be functionally significant. Repeated occurrences of even non-constant nucleotides belong to a restricted number of genotypes raising the possibility that adaptation to new mosquito hosts and animal reservoirs such as those that accompanied spread of yellow fever virus from Africa to the Western Hemisphere are relevant.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a qualitative process-tracing approach and combines inductive historical narratives and deductive reasoning to draw theoretical implications concerning the COVID-19 crisis' impact on the standard-setting process. Findings The paper shows a growing reliance on practical expedients in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to maintain the IASB's output legitimacy. While introducing some theoretical flaws, practical expedients increase the standards' flexibility and strengthen the IASB's ability to respond to the European political bodies' concerns. Indeed, an analysis of the IASB's response to the COVID-19 outbreak reveals the role practical expedients might play not only in reducing (ex ante) new IFRS transition costs but also in dealing (ex-post) with the broader economic impact of unexpected systemic crises to limit criticisms and controversies surrounding IFRS.

An analysis of the latest amendment to IFRS 16 in response to the COVID-19 crisis also confirms the role of practical expedients in strengthening the acceptance of IFRS in an increasingly complex economic reality and sheds some light on the new strategies adopted by the IASB to preserve its legitimacy in the EU.","output":"Practical expedients and theoretical flaws: the IASB's legitimacy strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the impact of earlier military combat on ability to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in 379 male Vietnam veterans who responded to surveys in 1984, 1998, and 2020.

We suggest technological advances in remotely sensed aerial imagery that have developed since 2004 will demonstrate their use in focusing such searches by informing a Geoforensic Search Strategy (GSS) and suggesting locations accessible by a perpetrator to identify a burial location using the still-existent analogue site. To test this, in the spring of 2020 a DJI Mavic Pro drone was flown over the control site containing the simulated 2004 burial. Aerial image processing included the creation of orthomosaics, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Visual Atmospheric Resistance Index (VARI), and photogrammetry. Conventional ground-based geophysical surveys using ground-penetrating radar, guided by this new type of information integrated into the GSS, confirmed that anomalies seen in drone data were the 16-year-old burial.

However, severe air pollution events still occurred frequently in Taiyuan, north China. To better understand this unusual phenomenon, O3 and other pollutants have been investigated before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown in the early 2020. Results show that PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO underwent a more marked reduction while O3 pollution was amplified during lockdown and the average concentrations O3-8hr during AL stage (101.92 g m-3) exceeded its Grade I limiting value (100 g m-3). O3 were negatively correlated with the other pollutants and positively correlated with temperature, visibility and the average solar irradiance during the daytime. The increase in daylight hours and average solar irradiance might be the key factors leading to the increase in O3 concentrations. The reduction of PM2.5 and NO2 promoted the rise in O3 during the lockdown. The majority of the O3 was likely formed by photooxidation in the shadow of Taiyuan and linked with air masses from the northern part of Shanxi Province before the lockdown and Henan, Hebei and Shandong during and after the lockdown. ? 2022, HARD Publishing Company.

There are few studies on consecutive monitoring of viral pathogens of ALRTI in a larger cohort during the past several years. The aim of this study was to investigate the viral pathogens of ALRTI in children of different age groups and to outline the epidemic feature of different viruses. METHOD (1) Totally 1914 (1281 male and 709 female) children with clinical diagnosis of ALRTI during the period of March 2007 to March 2010 were recruited into this study. These patients were hospitalized patients in department of internal medicine or outpatients in emergency department in Beijing Children's Hospital. The patients were divided into four groups, including 1072 patients < 1 year old, 326 patients 1- < 3 years old, 158 patients 3- < 6 years old, 358 patients  6 years old. One nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was collected from each patient. Reverse transcription (RT) PCR methods were applied to detect common respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus type A, B and C (IFA, IFB, IFC), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1-4, adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (HCOV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBOV). RESULT (1) The total positive rate of viruses was 70.3%. The positive rate was 83.0% (890/1072) in the group of < 1 year old, and 80.1% (261/326) in group of 1- < 3 years old, 60.8% (96/158) in group of 3- < 6 years old and 27.7% (99/358) in group of  6 years old, respectively. There was a significant difference in the positive rate among different age groups (2 = 2213.5, P = 0.000). The top three viruses were RSV, HRV and PIV; and the positive rates were 50.9%, 36.2% and 12.0% respectively in group of < 1 year old. (2) The epidemic seasons of RSV and HRV were winter and spring, and PIV infection was epidemic in spring and summer. (3) The detection rates of 2 or more viruses were 38.2%, 36.4%, 30.2% and 15.2% in groups of < 1 year old, 1- < 3 years old, 3- < 6 years old and  6 years old, respectively. There was a significant difference in the mixed infection rate among different age groups (2 = 1346.00, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION RSV, HRV and PIV were the most predominant pathogens in younger children with ALRTI. Different viral infections had different seasonal features. Mixed infections with two or more viruses were detected in substantial proportion of patients with ALRTI, but further studies are needed to explore the clinical significance of mixed infection with viruses in patients with ALRTI.","output":"[Three years surveillance of viral etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infection in children from 2007 to 2010]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several reports have determined that changes in white blood cell counts and inflammatory biomarkers are related to disease outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and they can be utilized as prognostic biomarkers.

A total of 13387 patients from 28 studies were included in this study. Six biomarkers containing leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, increased level of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and ferritin met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of the area under the curve (AUCHSROC) indicated that the PCT was the only applicable prognostic biomarker for critical condition and mortality (AUCHSROC=0.80 for both conditions). Pooled-diagnostic odds ratios were 6.78 (95% CI, 3.65-12.61) for prognosis of critical condition and 13.21 (95% CI, 3.95-44.19) for mortality. Other biomarkers had insufficient accuracies for both conditions (AUCHSROC< 0.80).

RESULTS: Among the sample of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester, there was no mortality or severe complications in the mothers nor newborns. Nearly 40% of the patients in the study were asymptomatic. The most common pneumonia-related symptom in symptomatic pregnant patients was cough. Asymptomatic patients had a significantly shorter duration of hospitalisation and a lower rate of positive RT-PCR testing compared with symptomatic patients. There was no statistically significant difference in antibody test results between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients during hospitalisation, while the positive rate of IgM antibody testing was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestation of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were atypical and concealed.

(2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shandong province, China in 2018 across three age groups: Middle-aged (45 to 59 years), young-old (60 to 74 years), and old-old (75 or above years). The information about socio-economic, health-related behaviors, HRQOL, and health service utilization was collected via face-to-face structured questionnaires. The EQ-5D-3L instrument, comprising a health description system and a visual analog scale (VAS), was used to measure participants HRQOL, and (2) tests and the one-way ANOVA test were used to analyze differences in socio-demographic factors and HRQOL among the different age groups. Logistic regression models estimated the associations between lifestyle factors, health service utilization, and multimorbidity across age groups. (3) Results: There were 17,867 adults aged 45 or above in our sample, with 9259 (51.82%) female and 65.60% living in rural areas. Compared with the middle-aged adults, the young-old and old-old were more likely to be single and to have a lower level of education and income, with the old-old having lower levels than the young-old (P < 0.001). We found that 2465 (13.80%) suffered multimorbidities of whom 75.21% were older persons (aged 60 or above). As age increased, both the mean values of EQ-5D utility and the VAS scale decreased, displaying an inverse trend to the increase in the number of chronic diseases (P < 0.05). Ex-smokers and physical check-ups for middle or young-old respondents and overweight/obesity for all participants (P < 0.05) were positively correlated with multimorbidity. Drinking within the past month for all participants (P < 0.001), and daily tooth-brushing for middle (P < 0.05) and young-old participants (P < 0.001), were negatively associated with multimorbidity. Multimorbidities increased service utilization including outpatient and inpatient visits and taking self-medicine; and the probability of health utilization was the lowest for the old-old multimorbid patients (P < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: The prevalence and decline in HRQOL of multimorbid middle-aged and older-aged people were severe in Shandong province. Old patients also faced limited access to health services. We recommend early prevention and intervention to address the prevalence of middle-aged and old-aged multimorbidity. Further, the government should set-up special treatment channels for multiple chronic disease sufferers, improve medical insurance policies for the older-aged groups, and set-up multiple chronic disease insurance to effectively alleviate the costs of medical utilization caused by economic pressure for outpatients and inpatients with chronic diseases.","output":"Health-Related Quality of Life and Health Service Use among Multimorbid Middle-Aged and Older-Aged Adults in China: A Cross-Sectional Study in Shandong Province"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twenty-eight states have provided nursing homes (NHs) with immunity from legal liability related to COVID-19.

Variables of interest include information on state political, socioeconomic, programmatic, and COVID-19-related characteristics as well as data on campaign contributions and lobbying activity at the state level. Factors significantly related to NH immunity provision adoption included measures of state fiscal health (unemployment), ideology (percent legislators Democrat), governing capacity (unified government), and NH characteristics (percent not-for-profit, hospital-based, and chain). Population density and Medicaid as a percentage of state general fund expenditures proved significant as well. Against these complex influences, organizations lobbying on behalf of NH residents and their families have found themselves ineffectual in creating avenues for accountability. Results indicate that enforcing accountability for NH deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex process, constrained by available policy tools and made more complicated by factors external to the NH environment that contributed to high death rates.

The study presents specific cases for biomedical waste, plastic waste, and food waste management - all of which have been a major cause of concern during this crisis. Further, without active citizen participation and cooperation, commingled virus-laden biomedical waste with the regular solid waste stream pose significant negative health and safety issues to sanitation workers. Single-use plastic usage is set to bounce back due to growing concerns of hygiene, particularly from products used for personal protection and healthcare purposes. It is expected that household food waste generation may reduce due to increased conscious buying of more non-perishable items during lockdown and due to concerns of food shortage. However, there is a chance of increase in food waste from the broken supply chains such as food items getting stuck on road due to restriction in vehicle movements, lack of workers in the warehouse for handling the food products, etc. The study also stresses the need for building localized resilient supply chains to counter such situations during future pandemics.

Natural compounds from plants are being widely explored for viral inhibitors due to their safety aspect. Therefore, the present study aimed at predicting the antiviral property of red rice phenolic metabolites (RRPM) from three Indian rice varieties against SARS-CoV-2 M-pro through metabolomics and in silico studies. The Indian red rice cultivars, i.e., Veethi vadankan, Samba mosanam and Kuzhiadichan, were subjected to Q-TOF-LC-MS analysis and eighteen abundant polyphenols were selected using hierarchical cluster analysis. The abundant RRPM were virtually screened using Swiss ADME, a web-based tool. All the abundant polyphenols obeyed the Lipinski's rule except for hesperetin 3'-O-glucuronide, thereby exhibiting drug likeliness. Based on ADME analysis, fifteen of the RRPM showed good oral bioavailability, high GI absorption and acceptable overall bioavailability score. The 15 RRPM were further subjected to molecular docking analysis using Auto dock 1.5.6 against SARS-CoV-2M(pro). The analysis revealed 7, 4'-dihydroxy flavone and eriodictyol to have strong binding affinity (>10 kcal/mol) higher than nelfinavir (-8.53 kcal/mol).

There is an unmet clinical need for a rapid screening platform for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D) determination without chromatographic separation that offers better precision and accuracy than immunoassays. Here, we introduce a high-throughput method for assessing vitamin D status from blood specimens based on direct infusion-MS/MS (DI-MS/MS) following click derivatization using 2-nitrosopyridine. We developed an optimized liquid-phase extraction protocol to minimize ion suppression when directly infusing serum or plasma extracts via a capillary electrophoresis system for quantitative determination of 25OH-D. Acceptable reproducibility (mean coefficient of variation = 10.9%, n = 412), recovery (mean = 102% at 15, 30, and 45 nmol/l), and linearity (R(2) > 0.998) were achieved for 25OH-D with lower detection limits (limit of detection 1.2 nmol/l, S/N  3), greater throughput (3 min/sample), and less bias than a commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay prone to batch effects. There was mutual agreement in 25OH-D concentrations from reference blood samples measured by DI-MS/MS as compared with LC-MS/MS (mean bias = 7.8%, n = 18). We also demonstrate that this method could reduce immunoassay misclassification of vitamin D deficiency in a cohort of critically ill children (n = 30).

This trend has accelerated with the growth in telemedicine, particularly after COVID-19. Optical fibre-based sensors are an ideal candidate technology to be included in such monitoring devices as they can measure a large number of parameters and they are easily integrated in wearables. However, their use has been limited due to their sensitivity being too low compared to the one needed to obtain information from the external perturbations of the human body. This requires highly deformable fibres. In this paper, we describe the use of a hollow polyurethane optical fibre sensor, operating through capillary guidance, to monitor breathing and cardiac activity. These fibres can be conformal to the skin and could potentially be incorporated into clothing. The extreme deformability of the material combined with the hollow nature of the fibre provide the necessary sensitivity to capture the pressure changes associated with breathing and arterial pulses. They allow us to recover and identify features of the cardiac pulse wave with high fidelity. In order to reduce sources of error and to increase the signal to noise ratio, we use black fibres. We discuss some unusual features of these fibre sensors, including the transfer function and how to configure for a monotonic response.

Methods We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection, symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation. The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts with different delays and coverages. We computed effective reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts. Findings In the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%) the effective reproduction number will be reduced with 50% from 1.2 (with social distancing only) to 0.6 (Rcts) by contact tracing. A testing delay of 3 days requires tracing delay or coverage to be at most 1 day or at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1, with the Rcts reduction being 15% and 17%, respectively. With a testing delay of 4 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below 1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with declining coverage of app use, but app-based tracing remains more effective than conventional contact tracing even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per index case that can be prevented depending on testing and tracing delay and isolation of index cases ranges from above 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 40% and 17% with testing delays of 3 and 5 days, respectively. Interpretation Minimizing testing delay is of key importance for the effectiveness of CTS. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology further enhances effectiveness of CTS, with a potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. The process of conventional contact tracing should be reviewed and streamlined, while mobile app technology may offer a tool for gaining speed in the process.","output":"Time is of the essence: impact of delays on effectiveness of contact tracing for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contaminated hospital surfaces have been demonstrated to be an important environmental reservoir of microorganisms that can increase the risk of nosocomial infection in exposed patients. As a consequence, cleaning and disinfecting hospital environments play an important role among strategies for preventing healthcare-associated colonization and infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether adenosine triphosphate (ATP) presence, measured by bioluminescence methods, can predict microbiological contamination of hospital surfaces. The study was carried out between September and December 2012 at the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo. A total of 193 randomly selected surfaces (tables, lockers, furnishings) were sampled and analyzed in order to assess ATP levels (expressed as relative light units or RLU) and aerobic colony count (ACC) or presence of S. aureus. ACC had median values of 1.85 cfu/cm(2) (interquartile range = 4.16) whereas ATP median was 44.6 RLU/cm(2) (interquartile range = 92.3). Overall, 85 (44.0%) surfaces exceeded the established microbial benchmark: 73 (37.8%) exceeded the 2.5 cfu/cm(2) ACC standard, 5 (2.6%) surfaces were positive for S. aureus and 7 (3.6%) showed both the presence of S. aureus and an ACC of more than 2.5 cfu/cm(2). ACC and bioluminescence showed significant differences in the different surface sites (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was found between ACC and RLU values (p-value < 0.001; R(2) = 0.29) and increasing RLU values were significantly associated with a higher risk of failing the benchmark (p < 0.001). Our data suggest that bioluminescence could help in measuring hygienic quality of hospital surfaces using a quick and sensitive test that can be an useful proxy of microbial contamination; however, further analysis will be necessary to assess the cost-efficacy of this methodology before requiring incorporation in hospital procedures.","output":"Comparison of ATP Bioluminescence and Aerobic Bacterial Count for Evaluating Surface Cleanliness in an Italian Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale Predictive models of mortality for COVID 19 related illness have yet to be sufficiently tested. We analyzed the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases to determine possible predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 related illness. Consideration was given to demographic information, pre-existing patient conditions and acute management. Methods We collected data from a convenience sampling of patients who received care at a multicenter healthcare system in southern California between March and August 2020. Data from this retrospective review of the electronic health record included demographics (age, gender, BMI and ethnicity), comorbidities (HTN, DM, CHF, chronic lung disease), lab values, certain medications (statins, antihypertensives, experimental therapies) and mortality risk by way of the updated Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI), which includes 12 categories of comorbidity predicting 1-year mortality (Quan et al., 2011). Cases were grouped as expired vs. survived. Chi square (categorical) and t-tests (continuous) were performed to determine statistical significance and Pearson r (categorical) and eta (continuous) were performed to test strength of association. Logistic regression was performed to test a predictability model for variables with the highest degree of statistical significance and correlation with mortality. Results Of 5,559 cases reviewed, 139 cases had complete data available for analysis. Of the total sample, mean age was 61(+/-16.1) and 38.8% female. Thirtyseven (26.6%) patients expired and 102 (73.4%) patients survived. Four variables were found to have a statistically significant, yet mild association with mortality. These four variables included: Betablocker use (p = 0.028, r = 0.186), CHF (p = 0.018, r = 0.200), chronic lung disease (p = 0.011, r = 0.217) and CCI (p 0.03, r = 0.216). Two variables had statistically significant and strong correlations to mortality;Age (p = 0.004, r = 0.636) and CRP (p = 0.003, r = 0.937). CRP and age accounted for 73.4% predictive value of mortality in our model. Conclusions Our analysis contributes further understanding of predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. HTN and DM were not associated with increased risk of mortality. Use of beta blockers, CHF and chronic lung disease had mild degree of association with mortality. Age and CRP served as strong predictors of mortality in our model. This retrospective convenience sample study was not conducted by way of a powered investigation. Findings should be confirmed by way of a well powered investigation before inferring utility of the model.","output":"Predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Profound endothelial dysfunction accompanies the microvascular thrombosis commonly observed in severe COVID-19. In the quiescent state, the endothelial surface is anticoagulant, a property maintained at least in part via constitutive signaling through the Tie2 receptor. During inflammation, the Tie2 antagonist angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2) is released from activated endothelial cells and inhibits Tie2, promoting a prothrombotic phenotypic shift. We sought to assess whether severe COVID-19 is associated with procoagulant dysfunction of the endothelium and alterations in the Tie2-angiopoietin axis. Primary human endothelial cells treated with plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 upregulated the expression of thromboinflammatory genes, inhibited expression of antithrombotic genes, and promoted coagulation on the endothelial surface. Pharmacologic activation of Tie2 with the small molecule AKB-9778 reversed the prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 plasma in primary endothelial cells. On lung autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients, we found a prothrombotic endothelial signature as evidenced by increased von Willebrand Factor and loss of anticoagulant proteins. Assessment of circulating endothelial markers in a cohort of 98 patients with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 revealed profound endothelial dysfunction indicative of a prothrombotic state. Angpt-2 concentrations rose with increasing disease severity and highest levels were associated with worse survival. These data highlight the disruption of Tie2-angiopoietin signaling and procoagulant changes in endothelial cells in severe COVID-19. Moreover, our findings provide novel rationale for current trials of Tie2 activating therapy with AKB-9778 in severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"Tie2 activation protects against prothrombotic endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 presents luxury hotels with an unenviable task of maneuvering to secure survival.

To this end, a short-type flexible endoscope with a working length of 600 mm was newly developed. In this animal experimental study, we aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of our new approach, single-incision multiport laparoendoscopic (SIMPLE) cholecystectomy, using this endoscope. METHODS Eight pigs were subjected to SIMPLE cholecystectomy using the short-type flexible endoscope. The endoscope was inserted through a 12-mm trocar in an SILS Port followed by the insertion of two additional 5-mm trocars in the SILS Port. Encirculation and ligation of the pedicle of the cystic artery and duct were carried out using laparoscopic instruments through the 5-mm trocars, while the dissection of the gallbladder from the intrahepatic fossa was predominantly performed using a cutting device through the endoscope. RESULTS A complete gallbladder excision, with complete encirculation and ligation of the pedicle, was completed in all cases. The mean operating time was 58 min (range 34-78 min). The endoscope provided a good view of the operating field, and it allowed some degree of freedom to the working laparoscopic instruments without compromising the field of view. Dissection of the gallbladder using the cutting device through the endoscope was much easier than that using the laparoscopic device, because the articulating instruments together with the endoscope enabled operation with triangulation. Furthermore, the water-jet and suctioning functions and the self-cleaning lens capability of the endoscope served the surgery well. CONCLUSIONS SIMPLE cholecystectomy using the newly developed short-type flexible endoscope is a technically feasible procedure. Using this flexible endoscope for various tasks, such as resection, suctioning, and smoke evacuation, can make the surgical procedures easier.","output":"Single-incision multiport laparoendoscopic surgery using a newly developed short-type flexible endoscope: a combined procedure of flexible endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pentatomids (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) are the third most speciose family within the Heteroptera or the true bugs.

However, the extremely low oral bioavailability of Pae (approximately 3%-4%) limits its formulation development and clinical application. This study aimed to develop micelles using the glycyrrhizic acid (GL) as the carrier to improve the oral absorption of Pae. METHODS: Pae loaded GL micelles were prepared by the ultrasonic dispersion method and its formulation was optimized by single-factor tests. Characterizations of Pae loaded GL micelles including particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL), morphology, and drug release in vitro were carried out. The single-pass intestinal perfusion and pharmacokinetic studies of Pae loaded GL micelles were also evaluated in rats and compared with Pae solution and the mixed solution of Pae and GL. RESULTS: The optimized Pae loaded GL micelles had EE of (42.21  0.89)%, particle size of (58.89  4.24) nm with PDI of (0.194  0.010), zeta potential of (-24.40  1.90) mV.

Sensitivities (95% CI) for Ct below 25 were 95.7% (92.4-98.9), 97.1% (94.4-99.8) and 97.1% (94.4-99.8) for GSD NovaGen, Bio-Rad and Aegle respectively but drastically dropped when Ct exceeded 27. Among samples with previously diagnosed viruses, 7 false positive results were found with GSD NovaGen only (specificity 85.7%). Equivalent, high sensitivities were observed with the highest viral load samples. The GSD NovaGen assay showed less specificity. Although the 3 kits tested in this study are inadequate for routine testing in a high throughput laboratory, they can help to quickly identify the most infectious patients and screen their close contacts in environment where molecular tests are not readily available.

Yet, such studies are hindered by imperfect viral detection. To address this issue, we used a community occupancy model C refashioned for the hierarchical nature of molecular-detection methods C to account for failed detection when examining how individual-level host traits affect herpesvirus richness in eight species of wild bats. We then used model predictions to examine the role of host sex and species identity on viral diversity at the levels of host individual, population, and community. Results demonstrate that cPCR and viral sequencing failed to perfectly detect viral presence. Nevertheless, model estimates correcting for imperfect detection show that reproductively active bats, especially reproductively active females, have significantly higher viral richness, and host sex and species identity interact to affect viral richness. Further, host sex significantly affects viral turnover across host populations, as females host more heterogeneous viral communities than do males. Results suggest models of viral ecology benefit from integration of multi-scale host factors, with implications for bat conservation and epidemiology. Furthermore, by accounting for imperfect detection in laboratory assays, we demonstrate how statistical models developed for other purposes hold promising possibilities for molecular and epidemiological applications.","output":"Accounting for imperfect detection reveals role of host traits in structuring viral diversity of a wild bat community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using data of online ticket sales for attractions in the seven provinces of South Central China, this study focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on tourists' destination preferences after the end of lockdown.

The Covid-19 pandemic has seen the unprecedented rapid demand for Public Health Reporting. The size, speed and scale of the pandemic led to governments, public health professionals, the media and citizens asking for up-to-date, accurate and accessible information and intelligence. One way that these demands were answered were through the creation and publication of Covid-19 dashboards to communicate to diverse audiences. Health Information Professionals were required to make significant decisions quickly. Which indicators to select? Which audiences to develop dashboards for? Which technologies to deploy? Decisions that would normally take a considerable length of time were abbreviated. There were no international standards and a variability of requirements for different commissioners of dashboards. Furthermore the public spotlight and democratisation' of health information created additional pressure and a lack of situational control. Some of the choices made will have a consequential impact for shared Health Service and Population Health Research as the pandemic continues. : The purpose of this presentation is to 1. Discuss the need for rapid health reporting as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. 2.

These competencies are necessary to ensure the appropriate categorization of a soldier's psychiatric readiness. There exists a need for a formal, comprehensive training curriculum accessible to all providers that is time- and cost-effective. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is are additional barriers of social distancing, remote virtual healthcare delivery, and geographic dispersion of healthcare personnel. To address these concerns, we developed a curriculum to target these competencies and deliver them virtually. The curriculum was developed and executed based on Kern's six-step approach to curriculum development, and the objective was to train military behavioral health providers on temporary duty limitations, administrative separations, and medical board referrals based on current US Army policies and procedures. The training was implemented virtually and conducted over the course of 3-hour training sessions to two separate groups. Evaluation of training objectives was conducted via a survey of paired before and after questions, analyzing the change in perceived confidence among learners. Among the 58 respondents, training resulted in statistically significant improvement in confidence in recognizing when a US Army soldier needs a temporary profile, writing a temporary e-profile, deciding when it is critical to contact a US Army soldier's commander, executing administrative separation, deciding when a US Army soldier is at medical retention determination point (MRDP), and in referring a US Army soldier to medical board. Results show the feasibility of virtual training to enhance medical readiness-related competencies of healthcare providers at the enterprise-level to help improve medical readiness.

METHODS We conducted a scoping review. Seven databases of journal articles were searched from their inception to June 2019. Eligible articles were literature reviews published in English and provided useful information for determining aspects of engaging patients and family caregivers in decision-making to evaluate. We extracted text under three predetermined categories: structure, process and outcomes that were adapted from the Donabedian conceptual framework. These excerpts were then independently open-coded among four researchers. The subsequent themes and their corresponding excerpts were summarised to provide a rich description of each theme. RESULTS Of 7747 unique articles identified, 366 were potentially relevant, from which we selected the 42 literature reviews. 18 unique themes were identified across the three predetermined categories. There were six structure themes: engagement plan, level of engagement, time and timing of engagement, format and composition, commitment to support and environment. There were four process themes: objectives, engagement approach, communication and engagement activities. There were eight outcome themes: decision-making process, stakeholder relationship, capacity development, stakeholder experience, shape policy/service/programme, health status, healthcare quality, and cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS The 18 themes and their descriptions provide a foundation for identifying constructs and selecting measures to evaluate the quality of initiatives for engaging patients and family caregivers in healthcare system decision-making within the organisation and system domains. The themes can be used to investigate the mechanisms through which relevant initiatives are effective and investigate their effectiveness.","output":"Themes for evaluating the quality of initiatives to engage patients and family caregivers in decision-making in healthcare systems: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a G proteinCcoupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a major role in inflammation and is involved in cancer, HIV, and COVID-19. Despite its importance as a drug target, the molecular activation mechanism of CCR5, i.e., how chemokine agonists transduce the activation signal through the receptor, is yet unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of wild-type CCR5 in an active conformation bound to the chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric G(i) protein. The structure provides the rationale for the sequence-activity relation of agonist and antagonist chemokines. The N terminus of agonist chemokines pushes onto specific structural motifs at the bottom of the orthosteric pocket that activate the canonical GPCR microswitch network. This activation mechanism differs substantially from other CC chemokine receptors that bind chemokines with shorter N termini in a shallow binding mode involving unique sequence signatures and a specialized activation mechanism.","output":"Structural basis of the activation of the CC chemokine receptor 5 by a chemokine agonist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Infections are a leading cause of refugee morbidity. Recent data on the rate of airway infections and factors influencing their spread in refugee reception centers is scarce. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of de-identified medical records with a focus on respiratory infections in underage refugees was conducted at two large German refugee reception centers. Results: In total, medical data from n = 10,431 refugees over an observational period of n = 819 days was analyzed. Among pediatric patients (n = 4289), 55.3% presented at least once to the on-site medical ward with an acute respiratory infection or signs thereof. In 38.4% of pediatric consultations, acute airway infections or signs thereof were present. Airway infections spiked during colder months and were significantly more prevalent amongst preschool and resettled children. Their frequency displayed a positive correlation with the number of refugees housed at the reception centers. Conclusions: We show that respiratory infections are a leading cause for morbidity in young refugees and that their rate is influenced age, season, status, and residential density.

After presenting a theoretical position on vulnerability and human rights, we draw on recent criticism of this approach in order to paint a more nuanced picture.

Methods From January 2017 to December 2019, a total of 106 patients underwent LNU by a single surgeon at our department, of whom 50 patients underwent standard technique and 56 patients underwent CRT technique. Relevant clinical data were collected including each patient's characteristics, surgical outcomes, and follow-up results. A comparative analysis between standard LNU cases and CRT LNU cases was performed. Results LNU was performed successfully on all 106 patients. There was no significant difference in patients' characteristics. Compared to the standard group, patients in the CRT group had shorter operative time (P=0.001), less estimated blood loss (EBL) (P<0.001), lower visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score (P=0.020) and less scarring (P=0.013). The median time of surgical drain stay decreased from 5 to 2 days (P=0.004) and median hospital stay after surgery decreased from 5 to 3 days (P=0.001).

The aim of this research was to prepare 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Lys(Nal)-Urea-Glu (99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA) obtained from lyophilized kit formulations and evaluate the in vitro and in vivo radiopharmaceutical binding to prostate cancer cells over-expressing PSMA, as well as the 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA normal biodistribution in humans and the preliminary uptake in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS 99mTc labeling was performed by adding sodium pertechnetate solution and a 0.2M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to a lyophilized formulation containing HYNIC-iPSMA, EDDA, tricine, mannitol and stannous chloride. The radiochemical purity was evaluated by reversed-phase HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. Stability studies in human serum were performed by size-exclusion HPLC. In vitro cell uptake was tested using prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) with blocked and non-blocked receptors. Biodistribution and tumor uptake were determined in LNCaP tumor-bearing nude mice with blocked and non-blocked receptors, and images were obtained using a micro-SPECT/CT. Whole-body images from three healthy men and two patients with histologically-confirmed prostate cancer (one of them with a previous 68Ga-PSMA-617scan) were acquired at 1h and 3h after 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA administration with radiochemical purities of >98%.

Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.

METHODS: A systematic review including the current evidence related to different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the related morbidity and mortality was conducted through a systematic search utilizing the keywords in the online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct; we retrieved all related papers and reports published in English from December 2019 to September 2020. RESULTS: A review of identified articles has shown three main genomic variants, including type A, type B, and type C. we also identified three clades including S, V, and G. Studies have demonstrated that the C14408T and A23403G alterations in the Nsp12 and S proteins are the most prominent alterations in the world, leading to life-threatening mutations.The spike D614G amino acid change has become the most common variant since December 2019.

A two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) study was designed to identify the causal direction between seven iron status traits and sepsis. Methods: Seven iron status traits were studied, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, transferrin, hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, and reticulocyte count. MR analysis was first performed to estimate the causal effect of iron status on the risk of sepsis and then performed in the opposite direction. The multiplicative random-effects and fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted, weighted median-based method and MR-Egger were applied. MR-Egger regression, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO), and Cochran's Q statistic methods were used to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Results: Genetically predicted high levels of serum iron (OR = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.13C1.29, p = 3.16  10(?4)), ferritin (OR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.07C1.62, p =0.009) and transferrin saturation (OR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.06C1.23, p = 5.43  10(?4)) were associated with an increased risk of sepsis.

RESULT: From the results of the study, it is found that the average recovery time of Covid-19 patients in India is 25 days (95% C.I. 16 days to 34 days). Only 4% of the patients get cured after 10 days of treatment. The recovery time of male and female patients is not statistically different. Recovery time of patients belonging to different age groups is also not statistically significant.

The reason for this being the fact; disease agents and their vectors each have particular environments that are optimal for growth, survival, transport, and dissemination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The WHO's website was accessed to look for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation dashboard and comprehensively study and assess the report. An attempt was made to look for countries, areas or territories with maximum and minimum number of cases of lab confirmed COVID cases. Further, we entered the words Climate in google for each of the aforementioned countries and searched for the results. A comparison was established by including countries from both the hemispheres (northern and southern). The preliminary analysis was based on the reports from countries with established testing facilities for Covid-19. RESULTS: The report suggests that countries with higher number of cases are the countries with cold weather. These are also the countries with low humidity which could be favoring the transmission and survival of the SARS-COV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The results though preliminary point to a pattern which favors the hypothesis that the extensive spread of Covid-19 maybe limited by temperature and humidity.","output":"Does temperature and humidity influence the spread of Covid-19?: A preliminary report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this investigation, positive impact of COVID-19 lockdown on heavy metals concentration and biological parameters in the groundwater samples of Coimbatore city of South India. The groundwater samples (n = 15) were obtained from shallow-open wells before lockdown (24C25 January 2020) and after lockdown (2C3 June 2020) periods. These samples were analysed for heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb) and biological parameters ( E. coli, Fecal coliforms, Fecal streptococci and Total coliforms ). Fe concentration was within the permissible limit but, the concentrations of Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb were above the allowable limits for drinking uses as per the WHO. However, after lockdown the number of samples crossing the cutoff limit had considerably decreased (Mn: 2 to 0;Ni: 13 to 10;Cr: 7 to 5;Pb: 13 to 8). The spatial distribution of heavy metal pollution index (HPI) revealed that 176.75 km 2 (67.4%) and 85.35 km 2 (32.6 %) areas fell under unsuitable and very poor categories, respectively, during pre-lockdown period, whereas 138.23 km 2 (52.6 %), 118.98 km 2 (45.3%) and 4.89 km 2 (2.1%) areas fell under very poor, poor and good categories, respectively, during post-lockdown period.

There is increasing evidence to support the use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) where en-bloc resection and lower recurrence rates may be achieved. However, ESD is associated with deep submucosal dissection when compared to EMR. This may increase the risk of complications including stricture formation with subsequent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of RFA following EMR and ESD as well as when RFA was used without prior endoscopic resection. The primary outcome measure was complication rates. Clearance of dysplasia (CRD) and clearance of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) were secondary outcomes. A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 91 patients referred for RFA from a single academic tertiary center was performed. The choice of endoscopic resection method was tailored according to the lesion type and morphology. Focal and circumferential ablation was performed after initial follow up endoscopy postresection. Patients proceeded straight to RFA in the absence of any visible lesions. In this study, the ESD group had a higher proportion of cancers compared to the EMR cohort (74.1% vs. 30.2%, P < 0.01) prior to RFA. All complications post RFA occurred in the groups with previous endoscopic resection. There was no significant difference in the total complication rate (7.4% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.78) and stricture formation rate (3.7% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.38) between the ESD and EMR groups. CRD was achieved in 96.3% in the ESD group, 88.4% in the EMR group, and all patients in the RFA alone group. CRIM rates were similar in the EMR and ESD groups (81.4% vs. 85.2%) but higher in the RFA alone group (90.5%). In conclusion, RFA following ESD is very effective and not associated with an increased risk of complications compared to EMR. This supports the application of RFA in the treatment algorithm of patients undergoing ESD for Barrett's neoplasia.","output":"The safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation following endoscopic submucosal dissection for Barrett's neoplasia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction As of 3rd June 2021, Malaysia is experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. In response, the federal government has implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under a series of Movement Control Orders and, more recently, a vaccination campaign to regain epidemic control. In this study, we assessed the potential for the vaccination campaign to control the epidemic in Malaysia and four high-burden regions of interest, under various public health response scenarios. Methods A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental model was developed that included two sequential incubation and infectious periods, with stratification by clinical state. The model was further stratified by age and incorporated population mobility to capture NPIs and micro-distancing (behaviour changes not captured through population mobility). Emerging variants of concern (VoC) were included as an additional strain competing with the existing wild-type strain. Several scenarios that included different vaccination strategies (i.e. vaccines that reduce disease severity and/or prevent infection, vaccination coverage) and mobility restrictions were implemented. Results The national model and the regional models all fit well to notification data but underestimated ICU occupancy and deaths in recent weeks, which may be attributable to increased severity of VoC or saturation of case detection. However, the true case detection proportion showed wide credible intervals, highlighting incomplete understanding of the true epidemic size. The scenario projections suggested that under current vaccination rates complete relaxation of all NPIs would trigger a major epidemic. The results emphasise the importance of micro-distancing, maintaining mobility restrictions during vaccination roll-out and accelerating the pace of vaccination for future control. Malaysia is particularly susceptible to a major COVID-19 resurgence resulting from its limited population immunity due to the historical success of the country in maintaining control throughout much of 2020.","output":"Sustaining effective COVID-19 control in Malaysia through large-scale vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prediction of stock groups values has always been attractive and challenging for shareholders due to its inherent dynamics, non-linearity, and complex nature.

We find that highly heterogeneous contact behavior is required to produce the extreme superspreading estimated from recent COVID-19 outbreaks. However, we show that superspreading estimates are noisy and subject to biases in data collection and public health capacity, potentially leading to an overestimation of superspreading. These results suggest that superspreading for COVID-19 is substantial, but less than previously estimated.

These measures limited population mobility especially for migrant women living with HIV (WLWH) and the provision of PMTCT services. The purpose of this research was to explore the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic on PMTCT provision by healthcare providers and understand what strategies could be implemented with lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for migrants to better manage the program. METHODS: Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with healthcare providers across city and provincial levels on how the changes to the healthcare system with COVID-19 affected highly mobile patients adherence and utilization of PMTCT services. A thematic content analysis was used for emerging themes and guided by The Utilization of PMTCT Services conceptual framework. RESULTS: Five main themes emerged: (1) Facilitators and barriers to adherence, which included the need for multi-month dispensing for the long term supply of antiretrovirals (ARVs) and the fear of contracting COVID-19 at the hospital that disrupted patients continuum of care; (2) Healthcare providers work environment, where participants felt overwhelmed with the high patient demand and the lack of infrastructural resources to follow social distancing protocols; (3) Financial challenges and opportunity costs, PMTCT proved difficult for migrants due to border closures and documentation required to receive care, this resulted in treatment interruption and left many unable to receive support at the facility due to capacity restrictions; (4) Interpersonal interactions, mistreatment, and xenophobic attitudes existed toward the migrant HIV population; and (5) Program sustainability revealed three key areas for strengthening: longer duration of time allocated with counseling for same-day initiation, the increased use of technology, and translation services for migrants. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to take what was learned during the pandemic and integrate it into routine service delivery, which includes long-term medication supply to reduce risk with multiple visits to collect medication, and the use of technology to alleviate the high-burden of patient demand.

In this review, we summarize advances in developing inhibitors of a variety of UPS components. In particular, we highlight recent work done on the protein engineering of ubiquitin as modulators of the UPS, a novel approach that may shed light on innovative drug discovery in the future.","output":"Development of inhibitors in the ubiquitination cascade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been often characterized as a respiratory disease. However, it is increasingly being understood as an infection that impacts multiple systems, and many patients report neurological symptoms. Indeed, there is accumulating evidence for neural damage in some individuals, with recent studies suggesting loss of gray matter in multiple regions particularly in the left hemisphere. There are a number of mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection may lead to neurological symptoms and structural and functional changes in the brain, and cognitive problems are one of the most commonly reported symptoms in those suffering from Long COVID--the chronic illness following COVID-19 infection that affects between 10-25% of sufferers. However, there is as yet little research testing cognition in Long COVID. The COVID and Cognition Study is a cross-sectional/longitudinal study aiming to understand cognitive problems in Long COVID. The first paper from the study explored the characteristics of our sample of 181 individuals who had suffered COVID-19 infection, and 185 who had not, and the factors that predicted ongoing symptoms and self-reported cognitive deficits. In this second paper from the study, we assess this sample on tests of memory, language and executive function. We hypothesize that performance on \\"objective\\" cognitive tests will reflect self-reported cognitive symptoms. We further hypothesize that some symptom profiles may be more predictive of cognitive performance than others, perhaps giving some information as to mechanism. We found a consistent pattern of memory deficits in those that had suffered COVID-19 infection, with deficit increasing with severity of self-reported ongoing symptoms. Fatigue/Systemic symptoms during the initial illness and ongoing neurological symptoms were predictive of cognitive performance.","output":"COVCOG 2: Cognitive and Memory Deficits in Long COVID: A Second Publication from the COVID and Cognition Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: China, which used to be an export country for migrants, has become a new destination for international migrants due to its rapid economic growth. However, little empirical data is available on the health status of and health service access barriers faced by these international migrants. METHODS: Foreigners who visited the Guangzhou Municipal Exit-Entry Administration Office to extend their visas were invited to participate in the study. Quantitative data were collected using electronic questionnaire in 13 languages. The participants were characterised by the income level of their country of origin (high-, middle- and low-income countries (HICs, MICs and LICs, respectively)), and the key factors associated with their health status, medical insurance coverage and perceptions of health services in China were examined. RESULTS: Overall, 1146 participants from 119 countries participated in the study, 57.1, 25.1 and 17.8% of whom were from MICs, HICs and LICs, respectively. Over one fifth of the participants experienced health problems while staying in China, and about half had no health insurance. Although the participants from HICs were more likely than those from MICs and LICs to have medical insurance, they were also more likely to have health problems. Furthermore, 43.0, 45.0 and 12.0% of the participants thought that the health services in China were good, fair and poor, respectively. Among the participants, those from HICs were less likely to have positive feedback.

Despite this disproportionate burden of infection, these neighborhoods have also lagged in COVID-19 vaccinations. To date, we have little understanding of the ways that various types of social conditions intersect to explain the complex causes of lower COVID-19 vaccination rates in neighborhoods. METHODS: We used configurational comparative methods (CCMs) to study COVID-19 vaccination rates in Philadelphia by neighborhood (proxied by zip code tabulation areas). Specifically, we identified neighborhoods where COVID-19 vaccination rates (per 10,000) were persistently low from March 2021 C May 2021. We then assessed how different combinations of social conditions (pathways) uniquely distinguished neighborhoods with persistently low vaccination rates from the other neighborhoods in the city. Social conditions included measures of economic inequities, racial segregation, education, overcrowding, service employment, public transit use, health insurance and limited English proficiency. RESULTS: Two factors consistently distinguished neighborhoods with persistently low COVID-19 vaccination rates from the others: college education and concentrated racial privilege. Two factor values together C low college education AND low/medium concentrated racial privilege C identified persistently low COVID-19 vaccination rates in neighborhoods, with high consistency (0.92) and high coverage (0.86). Different values for education and concentrated racial privilege C medium/high college education OR high concentrated racial privilege C were each sufficient by themselves to explain neighborhoods where COVID-19 vaccination rates were not persistently low, likewise with high consistency (0.93) and high coverage (0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Pairing CCMs with geospatial mapping can help identify complex relationships between social conditions linked to low COVID-19 vaccination rates. Understanding how neighborhood conditions combine to create inequities in communities could inform the design of interventions tailored to address COVID-19 vaccination disparities.

Five factors that are problematic are (a) a sustained systemic inflammatory response in the xenograft recipient, (b) thrombotic microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, (c) ischemia-reperfusion injury, (d) complement activation, and (e) vascular endothelial cell injury. In xenotransplantation, histones, which are positively charged proteins, are released into the extracellular space from damaged and activated cells, cause cell and tissue damage, and act as danger/damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that mediate inflammation, coagulation disorders, an immune response, and cytotoxicity. We have previously demonstrated that serum histones increase after pig-to-baboon organ transplantation and infection. Treatment of the recipient with tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor blockade) reduces the level of serum histones and C-reactive protein.

Then the mice were boosted with DNA vaccines encoding spike proteins of either the Wuhan strain or the Omicron variant. Specific antibody and T cell responses were measured at 4 weeks post boost. Our data showed that the Omicron-matched vaccine efficiently boosted RBD binding antibody and neutralizing antibody responses against both the Delta and the Omicron variants. Of note, antibody responses against the Omicron variant elicited by the Omicron-matched vaccine were much stronger than those induced by the ancestral S DNA vaccine. Meanwhile, CD8+ T cell responses against both the ancestral Wuhan strain and the Omicron strain also tended to be higher in mice boosted by the Omicron-matched vaccine than those in mice boosted with the ancestral S DNA vaccine, albeit no significant difference was observed.

Methods: A teaching package was designed with teaching in simulation for newly qualified physiotherapists about to go on the respiratory physiotherapy on-call rota focusing on common on-call scenarios. It was delivered by physiotherapists, an ACP and a consultant anaesthetist (who attended virtually). Scenarios were broken down into 3 competents: (1) do I have to go in? How to get the right information over the phone to decide. (2) what do I want done while I am travelling in? What advice to give to stabilise the pt while on route, what equipment to get ready, what PPE to get ready, etc., (3) What do I do when I get there C ACE assessment of the pt, treatment and ongoing management plan.

METHODS: We present a scalable, propagable, personalized, cost-effective adult stem cell-derived human lung organoid model that is complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia. Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived alveolar type II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19. RESULTS: Infected ALO monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection, whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both.

To date, however, no known study has examined the prevalence, risk and protective factors of psychiatric conditions among US military veterans who survived COVID-19. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 2019 to 2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 US veterans. Prepandemic and 1-year peripandemic risk and protective factors associated with positive screens for peripandemic internalising (major depressive, generalised anxiety and/or posttraumatic stress disorders) and externalising psychiatric disorders (alcohol and/or drug use disorders) and suicidal ideation were examined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 233 veterans (8.6%) reported having been infected with COVID-19. Relative to veterans who were not infected, veterans who were infected were more likely to screen positive for internalising disorders (20.5% vs 13.9%, p=0.005), externalising disorders (23.2% vs 14.8%, p=0.001) and current suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 7.6%, p=0.015) at peripandemic. Multivariable analyses revealed that greater prepandemic psychiatric symptom severity and COVID-related stressors were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic internalising disorders, while prepandemic trauma burden was protective. Prepandemic suicidal ideation, greater loneliness and lower household income were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic suicidal ideation, whereas prepandemic community integration was protective. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation are prevalent in veterans who have survived COVID-19. Veterans with greater prepandemic psychiatric and substance use problems, COVID-related stressors and fewer psychosocial resources may be at increased risk of these outcomes.","output":"Mental health and suicidal ideation in US military veterans with histories of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health emergencies threaten the lives of U.S. citizens, often in disproportionate ways.

Agricultural landscapes are complex, and the value of resource patches may vary substantially among species. The spatial extent at which landscape features affect populations (i.e., scale of effect) may also differ among species. There is a need for regional-scale conservation planning that considers landscape-scale and species-specific responses of grassland birds to environmental change. We developed a spatially explicit approach to optimizing grassland conservation in the context of species-specific landscapes and prioritization of species recovery and applied it to a conservation program in Kentucky (USA). We used a hierarchical distance-sampling model with an embedded scale of effect predictor to estimate the relationship between landscape structure and abundance of eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). We used a novel spatially explicit optimization procedure rooted in multi-attribute utility theory to design alternative conservation strategies (e.g., prioritize only northern bobwhite recovery or assign equal weight to each species' recovery). Eastern meadowlarks and field sparrows were more likely to respond to landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies than landscape-scale patch densities. Northern bobwhite responded to both landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies and densities and responded strongly to increased grassland density. Effects of landscape features on local abundance decreased as distance increased and had negligible influence at 0.8 km for eastern meadowlarks (0.7-1.2 km 95% Bayesian credibility intervals [BCI]), 2.5 km for field sparrows (1.5-5.8 km 95% BCI), and 8.4 km for bobwhite (6.4-26 km 95% BCI). Northern bobwhites were predicted to benefit greatly from future grassland conservation regardless of conservation priorities, but eastern meadowlark and field sparrow were not. Our results suggest similar species can respond differently to broad-scale conservation practices because of species-specific, distance-dependent relationships with landscape structure. Our framework is quantitative, conceptually simple, customizable, and predictive and can be used to optimize conservation in heterogeneous ecosystems while considering landscape-scale processes and explicit prioritization of species recovery.","output":"Optimizing conservation in species-specific agricultural landscapes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Filamentous fungi such as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, the main causative agents of onychomycosis, have been recognized as biofilm-forming microorganisms.

In this context, this work aimed to evaluate, for the first time, the in vitro anti-T. rubrum biofilm potential of NO-np using standard ATCC MYA-4438 and clinical BR1A strains and compare it to commonly used antifungal drugs including fluconazole, terbinafine and efinaconazole. The biofilms formed by the standard strain produced more biomass than those from the clinical strain. NO-np, fluconazole, terbinafine, and efinaconazole inhibited the in vitro growth of planktonic T. rubrum cells. Similarly, NO-np reduced the metabolic activities of clinical strain BR1A preformed biofilms at the highest concentration tested (SMIC(50) = 40 mg/mL). Scanning electron and confocal microscopy revealed that NO-np and efinaconazole severely damaged established biofilms for both strains, resulting in collapse of hyphal cell walls and reduced the density, extracellular matrix and thickness of the biofilms. These findings suggest that biofilms should be considered when developing and testing new drugs for the treatment of dermatophytosis. Development of a biofilm phenotype by these fungi may explain the resistance of dermatophytes to some antifungals and why prolonged treatment is usually required for onychomycosis.","output":"Nitric Oxide-Releasing Nanoparticles Are Similar to Efinaconazole in Their Capacity to Eradicate Trichophyton rubrum Biofilms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For drilling contractors, the moment of truth is the operations at the site.

The likelihood of foodborne infection of SARS-CoV-2 via the human digestive tract also was considered. Our analysis indicates that there is no evidence that foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, and we consider the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 via food and food packaging in Canada as low to remote.

The study included patients with transcutaneous saturation (SpO2) below 93% on spontaneous breathing, who required correction of respiratory alterations according to the Interim Clinical Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with COVID-19. All patients were divided into 2 groups of 30 patients each according to the nature of respiratory impairment. Group 1 included patients without breathing difficulties who had respiratory rate up to 25 per minute. Group 2 patients had breathing difficulties and respiratory rate over 25 per minute. In addition to SpO2, severity of respiratory difficulties, respiratory rate (RR), forced breathing (FB), heart rate (HR), acid-base balance (ABB) and arterial and venous blood gases, capillary refill time, blood lactate level were assessed. The severity of lung involvement was determined using chest computed tomography, and severity of disease was assessed using the NEWS score. Respiratory treatment required for ARF correction and the outcome of hospitalization were also considered. Results. In group 1, the mean age was 66 (56;67) years and the disease severity was 8 (7;10) points. Group 1 patients had minor tachycardia and tachypnoea, there were no lactate elevation or prolonged capillary refill time. Mean SpO2 was as low as 86 (83;89)%. Venous blood pH and pCO2 values were within normal reference intervals, mean BE was 6 (4;9) mmol/l, pO2 was 42 (41;44) mm Hg, and SO2 was 67 (65;70)%. Mean arterial blood pO2 was 73 (69;75) mm Hg, S2 was 86 (83;90)%, and O2 was 37 (35;39) mm Hg. Oxygen therapy with the flow rate of 5C15 l/min in prone position helped correct ARF. All patients of this group were discharged from hospital. In group 2, the mean age was 76 (70;79) years and the disease severity was 14 (12;18) points. Anxiety was observed in 15 patients, prolonged capillary refill time was seen in 13 patients, and increased lactate level in 18 patients.

Mean arterial blood pO2 was 57 (50;65) mm Hg, S2 was 74 (69;80)%, and pCO2 was 67 (58;74) mm Hg. In the group 2 patients, the standard oxygen therapy in prone position failed to correct ARF, and high flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive CPAP with FiO2 of 50C90% or noninvasive CPAP+PS were administered. Fourteen patients were started on invasive lung ventilation. There were 10 fatal outcomes (33%) in this group. Conclusion. Two clinical phenotypes of hypoxia in patients with COVID-19 can be distinguished. The first pattern is characterized by reduced SpO2 (80C93%), no tachypnoea (RR &gt;25 per minute) and moderate arterial hypoxemia without tissue hypoxia and acidosis (?silent hypoxia?). It is typical for younger patients and asso-ciates with less lung damage and disease severity than in patients with severe ARF. Hypoxemia can be corrected by prone position and oxygen therapy and does not require switching to mechanical ventilation. The second pattern of hypoxia is characterized by significant arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia with tissue hypoxia and acidosis. Its correction requires the use of noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation.","output":"Clinical phenotypes of hypoxia in patients with covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biliary glycoproteins are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and behave as cell adhesion molecules. The mouse genome contains two very similar Bgp genes, Bgp1 and Bgp2, whereas the human and rat genomes contain only one BGP gene. A Bgp2 isoform was previously identified as an alternative receptor for the mouse coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. This isoform consists of two extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail of five amino acids. In this report, we have examined whether the Bgp2 gene can express other isoforms in different mouse tissues. We found only one other isoform, which has a long cytoplasmic tail of 73 amino acids. The long cytodomain of the Bgp2 protein is highly similar to that of the Bgp1/4L isoform. The Bgp2 protein is expressed in low amounts in kidney and in a rectal carcinoma cell line. Antibodies specific to Bgp2 detected a 42-kDa protein, which is expressed at the cell surface of these samples. Bgp2 was found by immunocytochemistry in smooth muscle layers of the kidney, the uterus, in gut mononuclear cells and in the crypt epithelia of intestinal tissues. Transfection studies showed that, in contrast with Bgp1, the Bgp2 glycoprotein was not directly involved in intercellular adhesion. However, this protein is found in the proliferative compartment of the intestinal crypts and in cells involved in immune recognition. This suggests that the Bgp2 protein represents a distinctive member of the CEA family; its unusual expression patterns in mouse tissues and the unique functions it may be fulfilling may provide novel clues about the multiple functions mediated by a common BGP protein in humans and rats.","output":"Comparison of expression patterns and cell adhesion properties of the mouse biliary glycoproteins Bbgp1 and Bbgp2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Enhancement of peripheral circulation has been shown to be of benefit in many vascular disorders, and the clinical effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression is well established in peripheral vascular disease. This study compares the haemodynamic efficacy of a novel neuromuscular electrical stimulation device with intermittent pneumatic compression in healthy subjects. METHODS Ten healthy volunteers (mean age 27.1  3.8 years, body mass index 24.8  3.6 kg/m(2)) were randomised into two groups, in an interventional crossover trial. Devices used were the SCD Express? Compression System, (Covidien, Ireland) and the geko?, (Firstkind Ltd, UK). Devices were applied bilaterally, and haemodynamic measurements taken from the left leg. Changes to haemodynamic parameters (superficial femory artery and femoral vein) and laser Doppler measurements from the hand and foot were compared. RESULTS Intermittent pneumatic compression caused 51% (p = 0.002), 5% (ns) and 3% (ns) median increases in venous peak velocity, time-averaged maximum velocity and volume flow, respectively; neuromuscular electrical stimulator stimulation caused a 103%, 101% and 101% median increases in the same parameters (all p = 0.002). The benefit was lost upon deactivation. Intermittent pneumatic compression did not improve arterial haemodynamics. Neuromuscular electrical stimulator caused 11%, 84% and 75% increase in arterial parameters (p < 0.01). Laser Doppler readings taken from the leg were increased by neuromuscular electrical stimulator (p < 0.001), dropping after deactivation. For intermittent pneumatic compression, the readings decreased during use but increased after cessation. Hand flux signal dropped during activation of both devices, rising after cessation. DISCUSSION The neuromuscular electrical stimulator device used in this study enhances venous flow and peak velocity in the legs of healthy subjects and is equal or superior to intermittent pneumatic compression. This warrants further clinical and economic evaluation for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and exploration of the haemodynamic effect in venous pathology. It also enhances arterial time-averaged maximum velocity and flow rate, which may prove to be of clinical use in the management of peripheral arterial disease. The effect on the microcirculation as evidenced by laser Doppler fluximetry may reflect a clinically beneficial target in microvascular disease, such as in the diabetic foot.","output":"Haemodynamic changes with the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation compared to intermittent pneumatic compression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In late 2019, a new coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-was discovered in Wuhan, China, and the World Health Organization later declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic Numerous drugs have been repurposed and investigated for therapeutic effectiveness in the disease, including those from \\"Solidarity,\\" an international clinical trial (azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, the fixed combination lopinavir/ritonavir, and remdesivir) OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting for drugs when used in the treatment of COVID-19 compared with use for other indications, specifically focussing on sex differences METHOD: We extracted reports on COVID-19-specific treatments from the global ADR database, VigiBase, using an algorithm developed to identify reports that listed COVID-19 as the indication The Solidarity trial drugs were included, as were any drugs reported  100 times We performed a descriptive comparison of reports for the same drugs used in non-COVID-19 indications The data lock point date was 7 June 2020 RESULTS: In total, 2573 reports were identified for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 In order of frequency, the most reported ADRs were electrocardiogram QT-prolonged, diarrhoea, nausea, hepatitis, and vomiting in males and diarrhoea, electrocardiogram QT-prolonged, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain in females Other hepatic and kidney-related events were included in the top ten ADRs in males, whereas no hepatic or renal terms were reported for females COVID-19-related reporting patterns differed from non-pandemic reporting for these drugs CONCLUSION: Review of a global database of suspected ADR reports revealed sex differences in the reporting patterns for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 Patterns of ADR sex differences need further elucidation","output":"Sex Differences in Reported Adverse Drug Reactions to COVID-19 Drugs in a Global Database of Individual Case Safety Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to disruptions in health care in the perinatal period and womens childbirth experiences.

The challenge for clinical laboratories has been finding a high throughput, cost-efficient, and accurate testing method in the context of extraction reagents shortage on a global scale. To answer this need, we studied SARS-CoV-2 detection in oro-nasopharyngeal (ONP) swabs stored in Universal Transport Media (UTM) or in RNase-free water by rRT-PCR with Seegene Allplex? 2019-nCoV assay without RNA extraction. RESULTS: Optimal results were obtained when swabs stored in UTM were diluted 1/5 and 1/2 in RNase-free water. Thermal lysis before rRT-PCR testing slightly improved detection rate. In addition, proteinase K (PK) treatment allowed for a significant reduction of invalid results and increased sensitivity for detection of low viral load specimens. In a panel of positive samples with all 3 viral genes amplified and N gene Cycle threshold values (C(t) values) from 15 to 40, our detection rate was 98.9% with PK and 94.4% without. In a challenging panel of low positive samples with only the N gene being detectable at C(t) values > 30, detection rate was increased from 53.3 to 76.7% with the addition of PK, and invalid rate fell off from 18.3 to 0%. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method reliably detects specimens with C(t) values up to 35, whereas false negative samples become frequent above this range. Finally, we show that swabs should be stored at ? 70 C rather than 4 C when testing cannot be performed within 72 h of collection. CONCLUSION: We successfully optimized the unextracted rRT-PCR process using the Seegene Allplex? 2019-nCoV assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in nasopharyngeal swabs. This improved method offers cost savings and turnaround time advantages compared to automated extraction, with high efficiency of detection that could play an important role in the surveillance of Covid-19.","output":"Efficient SARS-CoV-2 detection in unextracted oro-nasopharyngeal specimens by rRT-PCR with the Seegene Allplex? 2019-nCoV assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics bring the specter of death, disruption, and despair, but historically they have also been engines for social transformations visible at almost every level of society For scholars interested in understanding contemporary surveillance dynamics, the COVID-19 pandemic encourages thinking about how different forms of monitoring have altered aspects of the global infectious disease response and what these developments might suggest about the evolving practices of surveillance and governance more generally Here, Cassiano et al focus on China, where the virus is assumed to have originated and where--given China's population profile--rapidly spreading infections pose stark morbidity and mortality risks","output":"China's Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Surveillance and Autonomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rubber gloves used for protection against chemicals or hazards are generally prone to tearing or leaking after repeated use, exposing the worker to potentially hazardous agents.

In this study, breakthrough time analysis and surface morphological observation were performed to determine the SH gloves ability to withstand dangerous chemicals. The chemical resistance performance of the fabricated SH glove was compared against four different types of commercial gloves at different temperatures. Using malathion as a model pesticide, the results showed that the SH glove presented chemical resistance ability comparable to those gloves made with nitrile and NR latex at room temperature and 37 C. The self-healing test revealed that the SH glove could be self-healed and retained its chemical resistance ability close to its pre-cut value.

Resorbable electrospun scaffolds represent a novel class of biomaterials, which may provide a unique platform for the design of advanced soft tissue repair materials. These materials are simple, inexpensive, nonwoven materials composed of polymer fibers that readily mimic the natural extracellular matrix. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate the physiomechanical properties of novel electrospun scaffolds to determine their suitability for hernia repair. Based on previous experimentation, scaffolds possessing  20 N suture retention strength,  20 N tear resistance, and  50 N/cm tensile strength are appropriate for hernia repair. METHODS Six novel electrospun scaffolds were fabricated by varying combinations of polymer concentration (10-12 %) and flow rate (3.5-10 mL/h). Briefly, poly(-caprolactone) (PCL) was dissolved in a solvent mixture and electrospun onto a planar metal collector, yielding sheets with randomly oriented fibers. Physiomechanical properties were evaluated through scanning electron microscopy, laser micrometry, and mechanical testing. RESULTS Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated fiber diameters ranging from 1.0  0.1 m (10 % PCL, 3.5 mL/h) to 1.5  0.2 m (12 % PCL, 4 mL/h). Laser micrometry demonstrated thicknesses ranging from 0.72  0.07 mm (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h) to 0.91  0.05 mm (10 % PCL, 3.5 mL/h). Mechanical testing identified two scaffolds possessing suture retention strengths  20 N (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h and 12 % PCL, 6 mL/h), and no scaffolds possessing tear resistance values  20 N (range, 4.7  0.9 N to 10.6  1.8 N). Tensile strengths ranged from 35.27  2.08 N/cm (10 % PCL, 3.5 mL/h) to 81.76  15.85 N/cm (12 % PCL, 4 mL/h), with three scaffolds possessing strengths  50 N/cm (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h; 12 % PCL, 6 mL/h; 12 % PCL, 4 mL/h). CONCLUSIONS Two electrospun scaffolds (12 % PCL, 10 mL/h and 12 % PCL, 6 mL/h) possessed suture retention and tensile strengths appropriate for hernia repair, justifying evaluation in a large animal model. Additional studies examining advanced methods of fabrication may further improve the unique properties of these scaffolds, propelling them into applications in a variety of clinical settings.","output":"Development of novel electrospun absorbable polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for hernia repair applications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 conducted a global survey to understand how biochemistry laboratories manage the operational challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and methods An electronic survey was distributed globally to record the operational considerations to mitigate biosafety risks in the laboratory. Additionally, the laboratories were asked to indicate the operational challenges they faced. Results A total of 1210 valid submissions were included in this analysis. Most of the survey participants worked in hospital laboratories. Around 15% of laboratories restricted certain tests on patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 over biosafety concerns. Just over 10% of the laboratories had to restrict their test menu or services due to resource constraints. Approximately a third of laboratories performed temperature monitoring, while two thirds of laboratories increased the frequency of disinfection. Just less than 50% of the laboratories split their teams. The greatest reported challenge faced by laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic is securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), analytical equipment, including those used at the point of care, as well as reagents, consumables and other laboratory materials. This was followed by having inadequate staff, managing their morale, anxiety and deployment. Conclusions The restriction of tests and services may have undesirable clinical consequences as clinicians are deprived of important information to deliver appropriate care to their patients. Staff rostering and biosafety concerns require longer-term solutions as they are crucial for the continued operation of the laboratory during what may well be a prolonged pandemic.","output":"Operational considerations and challenges of biochemistry laboratories during the COVID-19 outbreak: an IFCC global survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate usability and patient satisfaction with telemedicine in pediatric orthopedics using validated questionnaires and to identify demographic and clinical factors that may impact these ratings.

Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) and the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good and 4 = excellent) were used. Additional information regarding the level of education, mode of transportation, technology usage, demographics, visit diagnosis and length of visit were collected. Quantitative analysis was performed. A total of 68.6% (83/121) of the visits were done via telemedicine. Around 46 surveys were completed with a response rate of 55.4% (46/83).

However, no synthesis of this literature currently exists. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to: (1) describe the types of community-based mental health programs that have been delivered to Australian youth in the past 10 years; and (2) examine their impact in improving young peoples mental health symptomology and psychosocial functioning. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted. Studies were included if they evaluated the extent to which such programs improved mental health symptomology (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance use) and/or psychosocial outcomes (e.g., social functioning, school engagement, employment) for Australian youth aged 10C25 years. Thirty-seven studies were included. Four types of community-based youth mental health care programs were identified: therapy (n = 16), case management (n = 9), integrated one-stop-shop (n = 6) and lifestyle (n = 6) programs. The majority of therapeutic programs were effective in reducing mental health symptomology. Case management and integrated approaches consistently yielded significant improvements in both symptomology and psychosocial outcomes. Lifestyle programs were effective in alleviating depressive symptoms, but inconclusive for other outcomes. This review provides support for youth-friendly, systemic, multidisciplinary and integrated assertive outreach models of community mental health care to improve outcomes for young Australians experiencing mental health concerns.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Agency for Management of Life-sustaining Treatment retains records provided by doctors regarding patients subject to LST implementation. A total of 71,327 patients receiving LST were identified. We analyzed all nationally reported data between February 2018 and October 2019. Indicators such as the proportion of deaths, records for decision to terminate LST, implementation of LST records, and registration of Advance Statements on LST were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 67,252 (94.3%) end-of life decisions were implemented in South Korea. The proportion of deaths preceded by a LST plan, non-self-determination LST decision, and any advance statements was 33.5% (23,891/71,327), 66.5% (47,436/71,327), and 1.2% (890/71,327), respectively.

DESIGN: International time series, cross-sectional analysis. SELECTED COUNTRIES: Countries having 5500 or more cases (collectively including 85% of the world's cases) as of 16 April 2020 and that had reached 135 days into their pandemic by 30 July. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The initial severity and late-pandemic performance of countries can reasonably be ranked by COVID-19 cases or deaths per million population. For guiding policy and informing public accountability during the pandemic, we propose mid-pandemic performance rankings based on doubling time in days of the total number of cases and deaths in a country. Rank orderings then follow. RESULTS: At day 25 into a country's pandemic, cross-country performance variation was modest: in most countries, cumulative deaths doubled in fewer than 5 days. By day 65, and even more so by day 135, great cross-country variation emerged. By day 135, 9 of the 10 top-performing countries on deaths were European, although they were initially hard hit by the pandemic. Thus, rankings change rapidly enough to point to the value of a dynamic indicator. Five countries-Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia and Israel-were among the seven poorest performers at day 135 on both cases and deaths. Doubling times for cases and for deaths are positively correlated, but differ sufficiently to point to the value of both indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Readily available data support transparently generated rankings of countries' performance against COVID-19 based on doubling times of cases and deaths.

Design: Cross-sectional survey conducted from November 2020 to January 2021, nested within a longitudinal cohort study of the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among a general population-based sample of adults in six San Francisco Bay Area counties (called TrackCOVID). Study Cohort: In total, 3161 participants among the 3935 in the TrackCOVID parent cohort responded. Results: Rates of high vaccine willingness were significantly lower among Black (41%), Latinx (55%), Asian (58%), Multi-racial (59%), and Other race (58%) respondents than among White respondents (72%). Black, Latinx, and Asian respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents to endorse lack of trust of government and health agencies as a reason not to get vaccinated. Participants motivations and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination only partially explained racialCethnic differences in vaccination willingness.

These mRNAs are produced in different quantities, and their molar ratios remain constant during viral replication. We studied RNA elements that affect coronavirus transcription efficiency by characterizing a series of cloned coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs containing an inserted intergenic sequence, from which subgenomic DI RNA is transcribed in MHV-infected cells. Certain combinations of upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the intergenic sequence suppressed subgenomic DI RNA transcription, yet changing one of the flanking sequences to a different sequence eliminated transcription suppression. The suppressive effect of certain combinations of flanking sequences, but not all combinations, could be counteracted by altering the intergenic sequence. Thus, the combination of intergenic sequence and flanking sequence affected transcription efficiency. We also characterized another set of DI RNAs designed to clarify which transcription step determines the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs. Our study indicated that if subgenomic mRNAs were exclusively synthesized from negative-strand genomic RNA, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs were most likely determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA. If negative-strand subgenomic RNAs were templates for subgenomic mRNAs, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs probably were determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA used for subgenomic-sized RNA transcription but prior to the completion of the synthesis of subgenomic-sized RNAs containing the leader sequence. The relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs, therefore, seem to have been established prior to a putative replicon-type amplification of subgenomic mRNAs.","output":"Characterizations of Coronaviruscis-Acting RNA Elements and the Transcription Step Affecting Its Transcription Efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Prison populations around the world are ageing and numbers are rising, leading to greater demand for palliative care for prisoners approaching the end of life. This paper reports a survey that was undertaken by the European Association for Palliative Care Task Force on mapping palliative care provision for prisoners in Europe. The Task Force was established to begin to address the gap in research knowledge by exploring prison systems and care provision across different countries. METHODS The survey, developed by the Task Force Steering Committee, consisted of 40 questions in six sections. It was completed through online searches; only data that were publicly available on the internet were included. Numerical data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and thematic comparisons were made of free-text data. FINDINGS The survey was completed for eight countries: Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, England and Wales, France, Portugal, Scotland and Slovakia. Three main findings are reported here: healthcare and palliative care provision in prisons, deaths in custody and compassionate release. Despite increasing numbers of older prisoners, relatively few prisons provide inpatient care, and only one country has any prisons that provide dedicated palliative care services. Early release on compassionate grounds is extremely rare in most countries. CONCLUSION For the principle of equivalence to be adhered to, facilities for sick and dying prisoners need to be improved, or many more people need to be released on compassionate grounds at the end of life.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A case-series analysis was conducted in the presence of 10 patients with COVID-19 and mucormycosis co-infection (two men and eight women; mean age of 48.8 years) from March to October 2020. Demographic variables, signs/symptoms, and comorbidities of all patients were recorded. COVID-19 was confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab tests and high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT)_ scans. RESULTS: All patients had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Eight patients had a history of diabetes, while three of them exhibited a hypertension history. Remarkable laboratory findings were elevated fasting blood sugar in 6 cases and anaemia in four patients. A rhino-orbital-cerebral of mucormycosis in all patients was detected based on HR-CT scans and otorhinolaryngological or ophthalmological examinations. Neurological disorders including facial, trigeminal, optic, and oculomotor nerve involvement resulted in paraesthesia, pain, ptosis, no light perception, blurred vision, and papilledema in five cases. Maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were the most common sites of involvement.

METHODS: Plasma of 3 uninfected controls and 20 subjects exposed to, or recovering from, SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in the plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing capability of these plasmas was assessed with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus. ADCC activity was assessed with a calcein release assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were detected in all COVID-19 subjects studied. All but three COVID-19 subjects contained nAb at high potency (>80% neutralization). Plasma from 19/20 of COVID-19 subjects also demonstrated strong ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, including two individuals without nAb against SARS-CoV-2.

Recently, scientific research has widely demonstrated that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in modulating metabolic responses in the immune system. There is, in fact, a two-way interaction between lifestyle, infection, and immunity. The immune response is compromised if nutrition is unbalanced or insufficient, because diet affects the intestinal flora predisposing people to infections and, at the same time, the nutritional state can be aggravated by the immune response itself to the infection.

Mesenchymal stromal cells are cells with great immunomodulatory potential; therefore, their use in clinical and preclinical studies in a variety of diseases, including central nervous system diseases, increased in the last decade. Mesenchymal stromal cells can exert their beneficial effects through several mechanisms, such as direct cell contact, through surface receptors, and also through paracrine or endocrine mechanisms. The paracrine mechanism is widely accepted by the scientific community and involves the release of soluble factors, which include cytokines, chemokines and trophic factors, and extracellular vesicles.

The resultant gap in health care outcomes is largely twinned with suboptimal rates of anticoagulation prescription and adherence, deficits in symptom identification and management, and insufficient comorbid cardiovascular risk factor investigation and modification. In view of these shortfalls in care, the establishment of integrated chronic care models serves as a road map to best clinical practice.

Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their childrens vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of parents acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Parents acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.","output":"Parental Acceptability of COVID-19 Vaccination for Children Under the Age of 18 Years: Cross-Sectional Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2012 a novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, associated with severe respiratory disease emerged in the Arabian Peninsula.

Recently, two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes ZIKV. However, the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown.

Our novel PPIs associate cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells to microcephaly, and may also shed light on potential targets of ZIKV for host invasion by immunosuppression and cytoskeletal rearrangements.

Microvascular-epithelial exudation of bulk plasma proteins characteristically occurs in asthmatic patients, being especially pronounced in those with severe and exacerbating asthma. Healthy human and guinea pig airways challenged by noninjurious histamine-leukotrieneCtype autacoids also respond through prompt mucosal exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules. Contrary to current beliefs, epithelial permeability in the opposite direction (ie, absorption of inhaled molecules) has not been increased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis or in acutely exuding healthy airways. A slightly increased subepithelial hydrostatic pressure produces such unidirectional outward perviousness to macromolecules. Lack of increased absorption permeability in asthmatic patients can further be reconciled with occurrence of epithelial shedding, leaving small patches of denuded basement membrane. Counteracting escalating barrier breaks, plasma exudation promptly covers the denuded patches. Here it creates and sustains a biologically active barrier involving a neutrophil-rich, fibrin-fibronectin net. Furthermore, in the plasma-derived milieu, all epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch dedifferentiate and migrate from all sides to cover the denuded basement membrane. However, this speedy epithelial regeneration can come at a cost. Guinea pig in vivo studies demonstrate that patches of epithelial denudation regeneration are exudation hot spots evoking asthma-like features, including recruitment/activation of granulocytes, proliferation of fibrocytes/smooth muscle cells, and basement membrane thickening. In conclusion, nonsieved plasma macromolecules can operate on the intact airway mucosa as potent components of first-line innate immunity responses. Exuded plasma also takes center stage in epithelial regeneration.

Eighteen patients (37%) required hospitalization, 6 (12%) were treated with dexamethasone, and 3 (6%) required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Four patients (8%) died due to complications of COVID-19. On univariate analysis, neither age, sex, co-morbidities nor duration post-transplant were associated with risk of hospitalization. Conclusions In our national retrospective study, approximately 40% of patients required hospitalization with a mortality rate of < 10%. Previous studies have shown proximity to LT as an independent factor for mortality with COVID-19;the median time from LT for our patients was 5 years, which may explain the lower mortality rate. Of note, the median tacrolimus levels were much lower in comparison to the target of 8C10 ug/L used in the first year post-transplant. As the landscape of COVID-19 changes with vaccination, evolving treatments, and increasing rates of variant transmission, additional studies are required to continue identifying trends in clinical outcomes.

DESIGN AND SETTING Site visits to 24 long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Fulton County, Georgia, were conducted between June and July 2020 to assess adherence to current guidelines, provide real-time feedback on potential weaknesses, and identify specific indicators whose implementation or lack thereof was associated with higher or lower prevalence of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-four LTCFs were visited, representing 2,580 LTCF residents, among whom 1,004 (39%) were infected with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS Overall IPC adherence in LTCFs was analyzed for 33 key indicators across five categories: Hand Hygiene, Disinfection, Social Distancing, PPE, and Symptom Screening. Facilities were divided into Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups based on cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence to determine differences in IPC implementation. RESULTS IPC implementation was lowest in the Disinfection category (32%) and highest in the Symptom Screening category (74%). Significant differences in IPC implementation between the Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups were observed in the Social Distancing category (Higher-prevalence group 54% vs. Lower-prevalence group 74%, p<0.01) and the PPE category (Higher-prevalence group 41% vs. Lower-prevalence group 72%, p<0.01). CONCLUSION LTCFs with lower COVID-19 prevalence among residents had significantly greater implementation of IPC recommendations compared to those with higher COVID-19 prevalence, suggesting the utility in adhering to current guidelines to reduce transmission in this vulnerable population.

Identifying PCR-based viruses is a well-known and relatively stable protocol. Unfortunately, the high mutation rates may lead to widespread changes in viral nucleic acid sequences, and so using specific primers for PCR can be recommended. In this study, we evaluated the power of a conventional RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the five set primer sets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The five genomic regions of the Coronavirus SARS-2 virus including Nucleocapsids (N), Envelope (E), RNA depended RNA Polymerase (RdRp), ORF1ab and Spike (S) were selected for primer designing. A conventional RT-PCR was performed to compare sensitivity, specificity and other analytical characteristics of primers designed against two Real Time PCR commercial kits. RESULTS: The result of the comparative analysis showed that the ORF1ab, N and RdRp primers had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value higher than other primers. A significant difference in the analytical sensitivity between the studied primer sets in RT-PCR kits was observed. CONCLUSION: In this study, the ORF1ab, Nucleocapsid and RdRp regions have the best primers for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between different genes that have been suggested.","output":"Comparison five primer sets from different genome region of COVID-19 for detection of virus infection by conventional RT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the prevalence of smoking rates and comorbidities and evaluate the relationship between them and disease severity and mortality in inpatients with COVID-19 METHODS: COVID-19 patients were divided into the following groups: clinic group, intensive care unit (ICU) group, survivors, and non-survivors Non-COVID-19 patients were included as a control group The groups were compared RESULTS: There was no difference between patients with and without COVID-19 in terms of smoking, asthma, diabetes, dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, chronic renal failure and arrhythmia (p&amp;gt;0 05) Older age (Odds ratio (OR), 1 061;95% confidence interval (CI): 1 041-1 082;p&amp;lt;0 0001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 2 775;95% CI: 1 128-6 829;p=0 026) and CAD (OR, 2 696;95% CI: 1 216-5 974;p=0 015) were significantly associated with ICU admission Current smoking (OR, 5 101;95% CI: 2 382-10 927;p&amp;lt;0 0001) and former smoking (OR, 3 789;95% CI: 1 845-7 780;p&amp;lt;0 0001) were risk factors for ICU admission Older age (OR;1 082;95% CI: 1 056-1 109;p&amp;lt;0 0001), COPD (OR, 3 213;95% CI: 1 224-8 431;p=0 018), CAD (OR, 6 252;95% CI: 2 171-18 004;p=0 001) and congestive heart failure (CHF) (OR, 5 917;95% CI 1 069-32 258;p=0 042), were significantly associated with mortality Current smoking (OR, 13 014;95% CI: 5 058-33 480;p&amp;lt;0 0001) and former smoking (OR, 6 507;95% CI 2 731-15 501;p&amp;lt;0 0001) were also risk factors for mortality CONCLUSION: Smoking, older age, COPD, and CAD were risk factors for ICU admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19 CHF was not a risk factor for ICU admission;however, it was a risk factor for mortality RESUMO OBJETIVO: Buscamos explorar as taxas de prevalncia de tabagismo e de comorbidades e avaliar a relao entre elas e a severidade e mortalidade da doen?a em pacientes hospitalizados com COVID-19 MTODOS: Pacientes com COVID-19 foram divididos nos seguintes grupos: grupo clnico, grupo da unidade de terapia intensiva (UTI), grupo de sobreviventes e n?o-sobreviventes Pacientes sem COVID-19 foram includos em um grupo de controle Os grupos foram comparados RESULTADOS: N?o houve diferen?a entre os pacientes com e sem COVID-19 em termos de tabagismo, asma, diabetes, demncia, doen?a arterial coronariana (DAC), hipertens?o arterial, insuficincia renal cr?nica e arritmia (p&amp;gt;0,05) Idade mais avan?ada (odds ratio (OR), 1,061;95% de intervalo de confian?a (IC): 1,041-1,082;p&amp;lt;0,0001), doen?a pulmonar obstrutiva cr?nica (DPOC) (OR, 2,775;95% IC: 1,128-6,829;p=0,026) e DAC (OR, 2,696;95% IC: 1,216-5,974;p=0,015) estavam significativamente associados com a admiss?o na UTI O tabagismo atual (OR, 5,101;95% IC: 2,382-10,927;p &amp;lt;0,0001) e tabagismo prvio (OR, 3,789;95% IC: 1,845-7,780;p&amp;lt;0,0001) foram fatores de risco para admiss?o na UTI Idade mais avan?ada (OR;1,082;95% IC: 1,056-1,109;&amp;lt;0,0001), DPOC (OR, 3,213;95% IC: 1,224-8,431;p=0,018), DAC (OR, 6,252;95% IC: 2,171-18,004;p=0,001) e insuficincia cardaca congestiva (ICC) (OR, 5,917;95% IC 1,069-32,258;p=0,042) estavam significativamente associados com mortalidade O tabagismo atual (OR, 13,014;95% IC: 5,058-33,480;p&amp;lt;0,0001) e o tabagismo prvio (OR, 6,507;95% IC 2,731-15,501;p&amp;lt;0,0001) tambm foram fatores de risco para mortalidade CONCLUS?O: O tabagismo, a idade avan?ada, DPOC e DAC foram fatores de risco para admiss?o na UTI e mortalidade em pacientes com COVID-19 ICC n?o foi um fator de risco para admiss?o na UTI;no entanto, foi um fator de risco para mortalidade","output":"Smoking and comorbidities are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality in 565 patients treated in Turkey: a retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the Coronaviridae family.

We previously created an ecological daily needs assessment to capture microprocesses influencing user needs and preferences for mobile health treatment adaptation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to test the utility of a needs assessment anchored within a mobile app to capture individualized, contextually relevant user needs and preferences within the framework of a weight management mobile health app. METHODS: Participants with an iOS device could download the study app via the study website or links from social media. In this fully remote study, we screened, obtained informed consent from, and enrolled participants through the mobile app. The mobile health framework included daily health goal setting and self-monitoring, with up to 6 daily prompts to determine in-the-moment needs and preferences for mobile healthCassisted health behavior change. RESULTS: A total of 24 participants downloaded the app and provided e-consent (22 female; 2 male), with 23 participants responding to at least one prompt over 2 weeks.

We observed individually dynamic needs and preferences, illustrating daily variability within and between individuals. Qualitative feedback indicated preferences for self-adapting features, simplified self-monitoring, and the ability to personalize app-generated message timing and content. CONCLUSIONS: The technique provided an individually dynamic and contextually relevant alternative and complement to traditional needs assessment for assessing individually dynamic user needs and preferences during treatment development or adaptation.

However, the appearance of asymptomatic infected patients poses threats to public health, which might be infectious without clinical symptoms and only be detected by testing approaches. METHODS: Along with the appearance of one symptomatic case, a regional large-scale screening program was carried out in Shenzhen City charged by a regionally integrated healthcare system. After describing the screening program, a retrospective cross-sectional study for the screening outcome and efficacy was conducted. DISCUSSION: According to the screening results, the asymptomatic case was infectious and their close contacts should be quarantined cautiously as the close contacts of symptomatic cases. Besides, after integrating medical resources in Luohu district of Shenzhen, the medical capability of Luohu district improved greatly which could be demonstrated in inspection and organization abilities in this screening program. CONCLUSION: The large-scale screening contributed to preventing epidemic transmission. In the post-pandemic period, regular surveillance of asymptomatic cases and rapid response capability for emergent screening program are both crucial for the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.

Results: In the first and second weeks of Covid-19, hospitalized patients tested positive for urinary N-Ag (81.25% and 71.79%, respectively) and blood N-Ag (93.75% and 94.87%, respectively). N-Ag levels in urine and blood were moderately correlated with the number of days after the onset of symptoms (r=-0.43, p<0.0001; r=-0.55 p<0.0001, respectively). The follow up of seven SARS-CoV-2 infected patients confirmed the waning of N-Ag in urine and blood over the course of the disease. High urinary N-Ag levels were associated with the absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-IgG (N-IgG), admission in intensive care units, high C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Conclusion: Our study demonstrate that N-Ag is present in the urine of patients hospitalized in the early phase of Covid-19. As a direct marker of SARS-CoV-2, urinary N-Ag reflects the dissemination of viral compounds in the body. Urine N-Ag is a promising marker to predict adverse evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nucleocaspid antigen in urine of hospitalized patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The primary features of malignant glioma include high rates of mortality and recurrence, uncontrollable invasiveness, strong angiogenesis, and widespread hypoxia. The hypoxic microenvironment is an important factor affecting the malignant progression of glioma. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma adaption in hypoxic microenvironments are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The work presented in this paper focuses on the role of WNK3 gene in glioma invasion under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we aim to explore its role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). METHODS: ShRNA targeting WNK3 transfection was used to knockdown the WNK3 expression in U87 cells. We used western blot analysis to detect the relative expression of proteins in U87 cells. The effect of WNK3 on cell migration was explored using a transwell assay in the U87 cell line. We also evaluated WNK3 expression levels in glioma samples by immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: WNK3 expression was significantly higher in high-grade (III and IV) gliomas than in low-grade (I and II) gliomas. WNK3 expression was up-regulated in U87 cells when cultured in a hypoxic environment in addition; WNK3 knockdown inhibited the invasion of U87 glioma cells by regulating the EMT, especially under hypoxic conditions. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that WNK3 plays an important role in the hypoxic microenvironment of glioma and might also be a candidate for therapeutic application in the treatment of glioma.","output":"WNK3 promotes the invasiveness of glioma cell lines under hypoxia by inducing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an increase in known risk factors for mental health problems.

This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics with at least one patient with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from February to June 2020, treated by a mid-size national dialysis provider. PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregate setting, comorbid conditions, measures of frailty, and use of selected medications. OUTCOMES: COVID-19 defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19. RESULTS: 438/7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs. home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 was 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregate setting [OR = 17.10 (95% CI 13.51, 21.54)]. Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: No distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period.

She underwent right cervical endarterectomy (CEA) 16 yr prior. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Carotid Doppler ultrasonography revealed severely increased velocities of the right ICA. Cervical magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated 80% right ICA stenosis and 50% BTO stenosis. Digital subtraction cerebral angiography showed 80% right ICA stenosis and 70% BTO stenosis. The patient was not a candidate for standard carotid artery stenting because the BTO precluded endovascular access or for CEA because of the previous CEA; therefore, direct carotid access and flow reversal was an alternative. Under general anesthesia and systemic heparinization, the patient underwent right carotid artery surgical exposure. Under flow reversal using the Enroute System (Silk Road Medical, Sunnyvale, California), anterograde right ICA stenting angioplasty and retrograde BTO stenting and angioplasty were performed. Successful revascularization of the right ICA and BTO was obtained. No procedure-related complications occurred. The patient was discharged home 2 d postprocedure, neurologically intact. Direct carotid access with flow reversal is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for patients with ICA (or common carotid artery) stenosis who cannot undergo CEA or when endovascular access from the aortic arch is not possible.

While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible and actionable the information produced by these studies was. To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomenon related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility and clarity by independent reviewers. 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R0 (basic reproductive number) and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barr Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%) and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%) and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail allowing complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies. Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response, it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. Researchers published many studies which sought to predict and forecast important features of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections and their spread during the 2016-2017 ZIKV pandemic. We conducted a comprehensive review of such ZIKV prediction studies and evaluated their aims, the data sources they used, which methods were used, how timely they were published, and whether they provided sufficient information to be used or reproduced by others. Of the 73 studies evaluated, we found that the accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for improvement. We identified that the release of study findings before formal journal publication (pre-prints) increased the timeliness of Zika prediction studies, but note they were infrequently used during this public health emergency. Addressing these areas can improve our understanding of Zika and other outbreaks and ensure that forecasts can inform preparedness and response to future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.","output":"A systematic review and evaluation of Zika virus forecasting and prediction research during a public health emergency of international concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a global decrease in personal protective equipment (PPE), especially filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of decontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5  55  33 cm with three 15 W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58  41  15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3 M of dimensions 17  9  4 cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17  6  5 cm. An STN-SilverNova spectrometer was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps' plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.","output":"UV light dosage distribution over irregular respirator surfaces.

To overcome the increasing market demand, the transition to the intensification of shrimp farming is a reality in many countries. In addition, the desire to mitigate the risks posed by pathogens has driven many farmers to preference more controlled intensive systems with higher biosecurity. Shrimp nutrition and breeding are other areas that have directly enabled and improved intensification and will continue to be critical to ongoing growth in this sector. From this perspective, the aim of this review is to provide an update of the current production systems and strategies and explore the advances and key contributions that nutrition, breeding, and pathogen surveillance are having towards intensification and super-intensive shrimp culture. ABSTRACT: Intensification of the shrimp sector, also referred to as vertical expansion, has been predominately driven by consecutive incidences of global disease outbreaks, which have caused enormous economic loss for the main producer countries. A growing segment of the shrimp farming industry has opted to use production systems with higher density, biosecurity, and operating control to mitigate the risks posed by disease. However, successful super-intensive shrimp production is reliant on an advanced understanding of many important biological and economic parameters in the farming system, coupled with effective monitoring, to maintain optimal production. Compared to traditional extensive or semi-intensive systems, super-intensive systems require higher inputs of feed, energy, labor, and supplements. These systems are highly sensitive to the interactions between these different inputs and require that the biological and economical parameters of farming are carefully balanced to ensure success. Advancing nutritional knowledge and tools to support consistent and efficient production of shrimp in these high-cost super-intensive systems is also necessary. Breeding programs developing breeding-lines selected for these challenging super-intensive environments are critical. Understanding synergies between the key areas of production systems, nutrition, and breeding are crucial for super-intensive farming as all three areas coalesce to influence the health of shrimp and commercial farming success. This article reviews current strategies and innovations being used for Litopenaeus vannamei in production systems, nutrition, and breeding, and discusses the synergies across these areas that can support the production of healthy and high-quality shrimp in super-intensive systems. Finally, we briefly discuss some key issues of social license pertinent to the super-intensive shrimp farming industry.","output":"Intensification of Penaeid Shrimp Culture: An Applied Review of Advances in Production Systems, Nutrition and Breeding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2, has created an urgent need for its diagnosis and treatment. As a result, many researchers have sought to find the most efficient and appropriate methods to detect and treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus over the past few months. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is currently used as one of the most reliable methods to detect the new virus; however, this method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires trained laboratory workers. Moreover, despite its high sensitivity and specificity, false negatives are reported, especially in non-nasopharyngeal swab samples that yield lower viral loads. Therefore, designing and employing faster and more reliable methods seems necessary. In recent years, many attempts have been made to fabricate various nanomaterial-based biosensors to detect viruses and bacteria in clinical samples. The use of nanomaterials plays a significant role in improving the performance of biosensors. Plasmonic biosensors, field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methods are only some of the effective ways to detect viruses. However, to use these biosensors to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, modifications must be performed to increase sensitivity and speed of testing due to the rapidly spreading nature of SARS-CoV-2, which requires an early point of care detection and treatment for pandemic control. Several studies have been carried out to show the nanomaterial-based biosensors' performance and success in detecting the novel virus. The limit of detection, accuracy, selectivity, and detection speed are some vital features that should be considered during the design of the SARS-CoV-2 biosensors. This review summarizes various nanomaterials-based sensor platforms to detect the SARS-CoV-2, and their design, advantages, and limitations.","output":"Nanomaterials to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not only in developed countries, but as the population ages globally, staff resources are becoming increasingly scarce at medical and nursing care sites. Under such circumstances, COVID-19, which occurred in 2020, faced the crisis of collapsing medical practice on a global scale. What has made the world feel through the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic is the importance about the prevention of infection for medical and care staff. From this view point, it is considered to be extremely effective to recognize the condition of patients and care recipients without contact as much as possible. In this research, we will collect living behavior and vital data such as respiration and heartbeat in a facility without contact by combining sensing technology using 24GHz radar and multiple Wireless Sensor Network systems. We propose a hybrid wireless sensor network platform for medical and nursing care sites that can grasp the conditions related to patients and care recipients in each zone from the inside of the facility to the surrounding area and the suburbs. In the facility, a high-speed Wi-Fi mesh network will be used to build a network that can share the 24GHz radar signal data of each room in real time. One of our challenge is the detection of the behavior, respiration and heartbeat of the occupants by analyzing these radar signals without using a camera which is difficult to install in the field due to privacy protection issues, and without the subject wearing a wearable sensor directly. If it is detected that the patient or resident has gone out, the situation of the resident's walking area around the facility can be detected by using the Wi-SUN FAN mesh network in the area around the facility with a radius of about 500 m. In addition, in the suburbs area, GPS information using a LoRaWAN small terminal will enable centralized management of location information of residents without smartphones.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate, early in the epidemic, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in adults living in the six most affected districts in S?o Paulo city, and to assess potential associated risk factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional population-based survey of 1,152 households randomly selected from 72 census tracts. During the period May 4-12, 2020, 463 participants completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics and history of symptoms in the past two weeks, and provided a blood sample. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was the outcome of interest and was estimated based on results of two immunoassays, Maglumi SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence assay Immunoglobulin (Ig) M (IgM) and IgG, and Roche electrochemiluminescence assay total Ig. Serum samples reactive to either assay were considered positive. RESULTS: Weighted overall seroprevalence was 6% (95% CI 3.9C8.3%).

As of 30th June 2020, over 6,190 cases had been reported with a case fatality of 3.2%. Previous Coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of Cardiovascular disease. For COVID-19, however, there has been no direct reference to potential long-term cardiovascular effects, especially in Africa where atherosclerotic diseases are an emerging challenge. This article, therefore, aims at describing possible long-term effects on the burden of atherosclerotic disease among Kenyans. Available data indicate that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease share pathomechanisms and risk factors which include ACE2 receptor invasion and renin-angiotensin system signaling, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Further, SAR-COV-2 infection causes dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, kidney, and liver disease. These mechanisms and diseases constitute risk factors for the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis. In Kenya, the common risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 comprising Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity, Cigarette Smoking, Respiratory Tract Infections, Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Renal disease are not uncommon and continue to increase. In essence, the prevalence of the common risk factors/comorbidities, between COVID-19 and CVD occurrence of ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and hence pathomechanisms of SARS-COV-2 infection imply that COVID-19 may increase the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Kenya.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the reliability and feasibility of cloud follow-up in CIED patients. METHODS: A total of 325 CIED patients from 13 hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, were enrolled. Information on patients sociodemographic and basic clinical characteristics was collected. All devices were tested and programmed with 5G-cloud follow-up platform in a real-time manner. All patients were surveyed about their acceptance of and preferences regarding cloud follow-up compared to routine in-office visits. RESULTS: Compliance with routine in-office visits in this region was 60.6%. None of the patients were enrolled in remote monitoring services. Clinically important predictors of non-compliance were elderly age (75 years old), odds ratio (OR) 2.392 (95% confidence interval, 1.111C5.150); needing notification from a follow-up clinic, OR 2.518 (1.179C5.376); and being beyond 15 months post-implantation, OR 5.440 (2.563C11.543).

The wild-type (WT) viruses were attenuated through serial passages in embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Virulence of the attenuated viruses was then tested via the ocular route inoculation and the in vivo back passage in day-old SPF chickens. Efficacy against homologous challenge was investigated also in day-old SPF chickens. Results showed that the viruses were successfully adapted to the embryo by the 100th (IBM41 and IB2) and 110th passages (IBvar2). The attenuated viruses were safe and showed no change of virulence in day-old SPF chickens up to the 10th back passages. The efficacy experiment showed that the attenuated vaccines showed 90 to 100% protection against the homologous challenge based on ciliostasis score and protection percent. The att-IBM41 and att-IB2 vaccines were able to reduce the shedding of the challenge at 3 days post-infection (DPI) and no virus shedding was detected in both vaccinated groups by 5 DPI. In the att-IBvar2 vaccinated birds, only 20% of vaccinated birds shed the challenge virus with low titers (10(2.100.3) EID(50)/mL) at 3 DPI. In conclusion, the attenuated strains IBM41, IB2, and IBvar2 are efficient vaccine candidates against currently circulating classic and variant IB viruses, respectively. Further studies to evaluate the field efficacy and combining these attenuated IBV strains to induce a wider protection against heterologous IBV challenge are suggested.","output":"Safety and efficacy of attenuated classic and variant 2 infectious bronchitis virus candidate vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A subset of patients experience psychological distress following insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and ICD support groups are recommended, however access to these groups is limited. This study aimed: to gauge a better understanding of patients key ICD-related concerns; to determine patient interest in a support group and topics deemed helpful to address in a support group; and to examine factors which affect patient inclination to attend. METHODS: One hundred and thirty nine patients completed the ICD Patient Concerns Questionnaire C Brief (ICDC-B) and a semi-structured survey. Non-parametric tests were used to examine associations and differences in the quantitative data. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 42% of respondents said they would attend a support group and inclination to attend was associated with higher ICD concerns and a shorter time since implant. Topics considered important to address in a group were information about heart conditions and devices, the impact of an ICD on daily life and coping with fear of shocks. CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is interest in further support amongst many patients and that ICD support groups may be delivered efficiently by targeting patients who have higher levels of ICD concerns and within the first few years after implant.","output":"Delivering an efficient and effective support group for patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs): patient perspectives of key concerns and predictors of inclination to attend"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, an improved recovery method for target ssDNA using amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (ASMNPs) is reported.

Using the same peptide motif however does not guarantee more effective interactions with the host. Motif-mediated interactions require a flexible or disordered environment, with structural and dynamic features that should differ between the competing host and viral proteins. Using the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) database we analyzed the protein regions which contained the eukaryotic and viral motifs, including human and human virus ELMs with common target sites. We found that although the eukaryotic motifs are associated with a lack of structure, they are more stable than their flanking regions and can serve as molecular recognition elements. In contrast, eukaryotic viral motifs are often located in more ordered regions, but have increased local flexibility or disorder compared to their embedding environment. Most viral ELMs are devoid of stable binding elements and remain fuzzy after binding. Fuzziness reduces the entropic cost of binding and imparts versatile interaction modes to increase binding promiscuity and to compete with multiple host peptides. Fuzzy interactions confer further functional benefits such as the combinatorial usage of motifs, and a fine-tuning affinity via post-translational modifications.","output":"Fuzziness endows viral motif-mimicry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous post-translational modifications (PTMs) govern the collective metabolism of a cell through altering the structure and functions of proteins.

Although previous studies reported a lower rate of death in patients treated with heparin, the potential benefit of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between OAT with the risk of ARDS and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective Italian study including consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 22, 2020, at six Italian hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups according to the chronic assumption of oral anticoagulants. RESULTS: Overall, 427 patients were included; 87 patients (19%) were in the OAT group. Of them, 54 patients (13%) were on treatment with non-vitamin k oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and 33 (8%) with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). OAT patients were older and had a higher rate of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease compared to No-OAT group. The rate of ARDS at admission (26% vs 28%, P=0.834), or developed during the hospitalization (9% vs 10%, P=0.915), was similar between study groups; in-hospital mortality (22% vs 26%, P=0.395) was also comparable.

Age and cancer diagnosis are significant predictors of adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 infection. In this setting, GA is particularly valuable to drive decision-making. GA may aid estimating physiologic reserve and adaptive capability, assessing risk-benefits of either providing or temporarily withholding treatments, and determining patient preferences to help inform treatment decisions. In a resource-constrained setting, geriatric screening tools may be administered remotely to identify patients requiring comprehensive GA. Tele-health is also crucial to ensure adequate continuity of care and minimize the risk of infection exposure. In general, therapeutic decisions should favor the most effective and least invasive approach with the lowest risk of adverse outcomes. In selected cases, this might require deferring or omitting surgery, radiotherapy or systemic treatments especially where benefits are marginal and alternative safe therapeutic options are available.

The indirect impact of the pandemic on health care delivery in general and pediatric emergency department (PED) visits in particular has been widely reported. AIMS: To assess the impact of the pandemic and the social restrictions imposed in its wake on PED visits and hospitalization rates in our Israeli medical center. We also sought to track these data in relation to the variation in pandemic severity and social restrictions over time. A comparison of this data with that of the adult emergency department was also performed. METHODS: Data for this study were drawn from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC), Jerusalem, Israel computerized databank. The daily number of PED and adult ER visits as well as hospitalizations resulting from these visits during the months January-July during the years 2018, 2019, 2020 were recorded. We compared the risk ratio for hospitalization in 2019 and 2020, as well as the incidence rate ratio. RESULTS: During March and April there was a decrease in PED visits from 4,588 visits in 2019 to 2,527 visits in 2020 (ratio = .551, 95%CI [.52,.58]. Despite the drop in PED visits, the rate of hospitalizations rose with respect to 2019 (Risk Ratio = 1.31, p < .001, 95%CI [1.17,1.47]). Similar but more moderate trends were seen in the adult ED. From May-July 2020, after the lockdown was lifted, PED visits remained 30% below the same time period from 2018 and 2019, while the hospitalization rate returned to its pre-pandemic level. CONCLUSIONS: A significant drop in PED visits is seen to extend well beyond the peak of the pandemic and the lockdown period. This highlights the potential risk of children with serious emergencies becoming casualties of the pandemic by their not being brought to medical attention. Efforts should be made to raise public awareness among parents and other caretakers of children regarding this matter.","output":"The ongoing indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on a pediatric emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress management interventions can help to improve mental health for adults living with multiple sclerosis.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of FDG-PET/CT and SL in The Netherlands. METHODS Between 2011 and 2018, all patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer were included from the Dutch Upper GI Cancer Audit. The use of FDG-PET/CT and SL was evaluated before and after revision of the Dutch guidelines. Outcomes included the number of non-curative procedures (e.g. palliative and futile procedures) and the association of FDG-PET/CT and SL, with waiting times from diagnosis to the start of treatment. RESULTS A total of 3310 patients were analyzed. After July 2016, the use of FDG-PET/CT (23% vs. 61%; p < 0.001) and SL (21% vs. 58%; p < 0.001) increased.

Previous CAD studies have focused on peripheral blood samples since the processes of CAD may vary from tissue to blood. It is therefore necessary to find biomarkers for CAD in heart tissues; their association also requires further illustration. Materials and Methods: To filter for causal genes, an analysis of microarray expression profiles, GSE12504 and GSE22253, was performed with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Co-expression modules were constructed after batch effect removal and data normalization. The results showed that 7 co-expression modules with 8,525 genes and 1,210 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted. Four major pathways in CAD tissue and hub genes were addressed in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) and Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and isoproterenol (ISO)/doxycycline (DOX)-induced heart toxicity models were used to validate the hub genes. Lastly, the hub genes and risk variants were verified in the CAD cohort and in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

The rate of patients admitted to inpatient facilities upon discharge was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Conclusion: Admissions for mental health emergencies fluctuated during the period associated with the COVID-19 pandemic across an array of diagnoses. Increases in admissions and severity of mental health emergencies during COVID-19 may reflect a detrimental impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children, as well as unmet needs during this time.","output":"Mental Health Utilization in Children in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Requirements for physical distancing as a result of COVID-19 and the need to reduce the risk of infection prompted policy supporting rapid roll out of video consulting across the four nations of the UKEngland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Drawing on three studies of the accelerated implementation and uptake of video consulting across the four nations, we present a comparative and interpretive policy analysis of the spread and scale-up of video consulting during the pandemic. Data include interviews with 59 national level stakeholders, 55 health and social care staff and 30 patients, 20 national documents, responses to a UK-wide survey of NHS staff and analysis of routine activity data. Sampling ensured variations in geography, clinical context and adoption progress across the combined dataset. Comparative analysis was guided by theory on policy implementation and crisis management. The pandemic provided a burning platform prompting UK-wide policy supporting the use of video consulting in health care as a critical means of managing the risk of infection and a standard mode of provision. This policy push facilitated interest in video consulting across the UK. There was, however, marked variation in how this was put into practice across the four nations. Pre-existing infrastructure, policies and incentives for video consulting in Scotland, combined with a collaborative system-level approach, a program dedicated to developing video-based services and resourcing and supporting staff to deliver them enabled widespread buy-in and rapid spread. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, pre-existing support for digital health (e.g., hardware, incentives) and virtual care, combined with reduced regulation and light touch procurement managed to override some (but by no means all) cultural barriers and professional resistance to implementing digital change. In Northern Ireland and Wales, limited infrastructure muted spread. In all three countries, significant effort at system level to develop, review and run video consulting programs enabled a substantial number of providers to change their practice, albeit variably across settings. Across all four nations ongoing uncertainty, potential restructuring and tightening of regulations, along with difficulties inherent in addressing inequalities in digital access, raise questions about the longer-term sustainability of changes to-date.","output":"Achieving Spread, Scale Up and Sustainability of Video Consulting Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

We find that all three countries entered the COVID-19 crisis with common problems, including workforce shortages and underdeveloped and underutilized preventive and primary care. The countries reacted swiftly to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring a state of emergency in March 2020 and setting up new governance mechanisms. The initial response benefited from a centralized approach and high levels of public trust but proved to be only a short-term solution. Over time, governance became dominated by political and economic considerations, communication to the public became contradictory, and levels of public trust declined dramatically. The three countries created additional bed capacity for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the first wave, but a greater challenge was to ensure a sufficient supply of qualified health workers. New digital and remote tools for the provision of non-COVID-19 health services were introduced or used more widely, with an increase in telephone or online consultations and a simplification of administrative procedures. However, the provision and uptake of non-COVID-19 health services was still affected negatively by the pandemic. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed pre-existing health system and governance challenges in the three countries, leading to a large number of preventable deaths.","output":"A comparison of health system responses to COVID-19 in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania in 2020()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the global expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, social or physical distancing, quarantines, and lockdowns have become more prevalent.

We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that 1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and 2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support.

PCE and PCW (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) were orally administered to hyperuricemic Kunming mice (n = 8) to examine its hypouricaemic effect. Also, molecular docking was performed. RESULTS: P. cocos showed excellent hypouricaemic action, decreasing the serum uric acid of hyperuricaemia (HUA) control (526  112 mol/L) to 178  53, 153  57 and 151  62 mol/L (p < 0.01) by PCE and 69  23, 63  15 and 62  20 mol/L (p < 0.01) by PCW, respectively.

This approach may lead to sustained weight management because such energy-deficit goals are easier for people to integrate into their lives and then maintain. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials assessed the effectiveness of a small change approach for weight management; 21 trials were included.

Mutations near cleavage motifs, such as the S1/S2 and S2' sites, may alter interactions with host proteases and, thus, the potential for fusion. The biochemical basis for the differences in interactions with host proteases for the VOC/VOI spike proteins has not yet been explored. Using sequence and structure-based bioinformatics, mutations near the VOC/VOI spike protein cleavage sites were inspected for their structural effects. All mutations found at the S1/S2 sites were predicted to increase affinity to the furin protease but not TMPRSS2. Mutations at the spike residue P681 in several strains, such P681R in the Delta strain, resulted in the disruption of a proline-directed kinase phosphorylation motif at the S1/S2 site, which may lessen the impact of phosphorylation for these variants. However, the unique N679K mutation in the Omicron strain was found to increase the propensity for O-linked glycosylation at the S1/S2 cleavage site, which may prevent recognition by proteases. Such glycosylation in the Omicron strain may hinder entry at the cell surface and, thus, decrease syncytia formation and induce cell entry through the endocytic pathway as has been shown in previous studies.

Prosection and model-based courses, online and virtual reality approaches have been introduced over time, due to reduction in teaching time, and due to economic reasons with decreasing budget. In 2020, we were challenged by the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding COVID-19 public health measures. We had to change and adapt several times anatomy teaching and learning over the two semesters for the cohort of 112 first/second year undergraduate medical students. With the experience of this student cohort with various anatomy learning approaches, we wanted to know what anatomy teaching method was best perceived by the students. Methods 112 medical students were asked about their learning experience with various anatomy teaching approaches for 2020, including 1) dissection-based learning, 2) prosections and models-based demonstrations, 3) structured self-directed learning using written instructions and corresponding anatomical material, 4) structured self-directed learning using online instructions via Moodle and an online anatomy program (https://e-learn.anatomy.uzh.ch/Anatomy/Anatomy.html;German version). All students agreed to participate in the study. The questionnaire was administered by https://www.surveymonkey.com and done anonymously. To date 66/112 (59%) students replied. Results The majority of the students (92%) preferred the dissection course as their main anatomy learning method, 80% of students were happy with a demonstration course using prosections and anatomical models. Only a minority liked to have structured self-directed learning with either anatomical specimens and models (42%) or with online material (36%). Rather few students preferred learning with an online course (18%) or through unstructured self-directed learning using their own resources (12%). For the dissection course the students appreciated the 3 dimensional aspect (92%), the real size appearance of the structures (90%), the active explorative approach (81%), the topographical relationship of the structures (81%) and anatomical variability (72%). During complete lock-down of the COVID-19 measures when the students had to stay isolated at home for several weeks, the majority of students thought that the offered online structured self-directed course was most adequate under those circumstances (55%), but would otherwise not be the preferred replacement of a dissection course (55%). Conclusion Evaluation of student experience with a variety of anatomy learning methods clearly indicate that a structured dissection-based course with additional anatomical demonstration would be preferred by the majority of our students. Online material would be beneficial as additional learning support. However, the majority of students agreed that, under strict COVID-19 stay-at-home measures, the structured self-directed online course was the best way to learn anatomy.

The poults were observed daily for clinical signs, and their growth response, pathology, and pathogen shedding were examined at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days postinoculation (DPI). Body weights of eight poults in each group were recorded at each of these intervals followed by euthanasia. Dullness, depression, and diarrhea were observed in birds inoculated with supernatant or sediment suspension. All three treatments significantly reduced body weight gain of poults compared with the control group; average weight loss was 14%. Gross pathologic changes consisted of pale distended intestines with watery contents and distended ceca with frothy and watery contents. Astrovirus and rotavirus were detected in the inoculum by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, whereas Salmonella was identified on bacterial isolation. Both viruses were detected in treated poults by RT-PCR for up to 10 and 40 DPI, respectively. Of the three treatments, sediment suspension caused maximal decrease in weight gain as well as greatest pathologic lesions followed by unfiltered supernatant and filtered supernatant. These findings suggest a role for bacteria in increasing the severity of PES.

This study sought to determine baseline asymptomatic COVID-19 rates in secondary schools as students returned to full-time in-person learning with universal masking in place and to evaluate the logistical obstacles of implementing surveillance testing. METHODS: An observational cohort study lasting 11 weeks during spring 2021 included 2,288 students and staff in Wood County, Wisconsin. SARS-CoV-2 nasal polymerase chain reaction testing was done on consenting students and staff to determine baseline disease burden. Teacher surveys collected data on student masking compliance and classroom distancing. Information about percent positivity, secondary transmission, quarantine and distancing policies, screening participation, costs, and volunteer hour requirements were obtained. Modified quarantine for fully masked in-classroom exposures was evaluated. RESULTS: Percent positivity averaged 3.0% (0%-16.2% weekly) among students and 1.72% (0%-6.9% weekly) among staff. Two cases of secondary transmission were suspected out of 163 individuals quarantined. An average of 15.6% of the school population consented to participate each week. Minimum classroom distance between students ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 feet. Student masking compliance was greater than 87%. The cost of the program was $106,400 and required approximately 300 volunteer hours. The modified quarantine policy, where students were allowed to continue to attend in-person school after exposure to a case of COVID-19 if the infected and exposed parties were masking, did not result in additional transmission. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of relatively high student masking compliance and limited distance between students, weekly secondary school screening of students and staff in an area of high community disease spread was found to be low yield, costly, and burdensome for the school district. Surveillance participation was low. A modified quarantine policy was not associated with increased in-school transmission.

Complications of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been well reported. However, there is a paucity of data on COVID-19 related arterial thrombosis. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence, characteristics, treatment and outcome in patients with acute COVID-19 related arterial thrombosis in a large health maintenance organization (HMO). METHODS: A retrospective multi-center case review was performed from March 2020 to March 2021. Cases were identified through a questionnaire sent to vascular surgeons at each of the HMO associated hospitals. Patient characteristics, imaging, treatment and outcome were reviewed. Successful revascularization was defined as restoration of blood flow with viability of the end organ and absence of death within 30 days. Limb salvage was defined as prevention of major amputation (transtibial or transfemoral) and absence of death in 30 days. RESULTS: There were 37,845 patients admitted to our associated hospitals with COVID-19 complications during this time. Among this group, 26 patients (0.07%) had COVID-19 related arterial thrombosis. The mean age was 61.7 years (range 33-82 years) with 20 men (77%) and 6 women (23%). Ethnic minorities comprised 25/26 of cases (96%). Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was present in 4/26 (15%), active smoking in 1/26 (3.8%), and diabetes in 19/26 (73%). Most patients developed acute arterial ischemia in the outpatient setting, 20/26 (77%). Of the outpatients, 6/20 (30%) had asymptomatic COVID-19 and 14/20 (70%) had only mild upper respiratory symptoms. Distribution of ischemia was as follows: 23 patients had at least one lower extremity ischemia, one patient had cerebral and lower extremity, one had mesenteric and lower extremity, and one had upper extremity ischemia. Revascularization was attempted in 21 patients, of which 12/21 (57%) were successful. Limb salvage was successful in 13/26 (50%). Overall mortality was 31% (8/26). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience in a large HMO revealed that the incidence of COVID-19 related arterial thrombosis was low. The actual incidence is likely to be higher since our method of case collection was incomplete. The majority of arterial thrombosis occurred in the outpatient setting in patients with either asymptomatic or mild/moderate COVID-19 respiratory disease. Acute ischemia was the inciting factor for hospitalization in these cases. Acute lower extremity ischemia was the most common presentation and limb salvage rate was lower than that expected when compared to ischemia related to PAD. Arterial thrombosis associated with COVID-19 portends a significantly higher mortality. Education of primary care providers is paramount to prevent delayed diagnosis as most patients initially developed ischemia in the outpatient setting and did not have a high cardiovascular risk profile.","output":"COVID-19 Related Peripheral Arterial Thrombosis Treated in a Large Health Managed Organization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of different suture materials and techniques on soft tissue in relation to defined tensions and time points. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two bovine intestine samples, 4  4 cm size and ~3 mm thickness, were adapted with interrupted and continuous techniques using three types of suture materials: Vicryl (polyglactin 910), PDS II (polydioxanone), and V-Loc 180 (knotless, barbed polyglyconate). Four stitches or loops 9 mm apart with three knots, and 10 mm end length were performed by one gynecologist. Forces were applied from 6 newtons (N) to 14 N continuously. Outcome measures included breakage of tissue, tearing of thread, and shortening of the end length of thread. They were evaluated immediately and then at first, third, and fifth minute. RESULTS Tissue breakage using No. 3/0 suture materials appears in the applied force from 10 N. polydioxanone causes more tissue tearing than polyglactin 910. The least to withstand tension is knotless polyglyconate. Interrupted stitches hold the sutured sites better than continuous stitches in all groups of threads. Shortening of the knotless polyglyconate end length by half took place with 6 N force.

METHODS: We collected cross-sectional data from participants recruited in 41 pediatric emergency departments (ED) in 10 countries between March 2020 and June 2021. Participants were <18 years, had signs or symptoms of, or risk factors for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had nucleic acid testing performed. We utilized a multivariable conditional logistic regression model matched by study site to compare treatments administered based on SARS-CoV-2 test and disposition status and determined if SARS-CoV-2 test status was independently associated with corticosteroid administration in all study participants, and in the subgroup of those hospitalized. RESULTS: 30.3% (3,121/10,315) of participants were SARS-CoV-2-positive. Although remdesivir was more commonly administered to SARS-CoV-2-positive children, use was infrequent [25/3120 (0.8%) vs. 1/7188 (0.01%); P=0.001]. Corticosteroid use was less common among SARS-CoV-2-positive children [219/3120 (7.0%) vs. 759/7190 (10.6%); P<0.001].

Prior modeling suggested that before the COVID-19 pandemic, plans to stop the transmission of serotype 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) did not appear on track to succeed. METHODS: We updated an existing poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model for Pakistan and Afghanistan to characterize the impacts of immunization disruptions and restrictions on human interactions (i.e., population mixing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also consider different options for responding to outbreaks and for preventive supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). RESULTS: The modeling suggests that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, Pakistan and Afghanistan would remain off-track for stopping all transmission through 2023 without improvements in quality. CONCLUSIONS: Using trivalent OPV (tOPV) for SIAs instead of serotype 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2) offers substantial benefits for ending the transmission of both WPV1 and cVDPV2, because tOPV increases population immunity for both serotypes 1 and 2 while requiring fewer SIA rounds, when effectively delivered in transmission areas.","output":"Updated characterization of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the impacts of different outbreak response vaccine options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare orthopaedic trauma volume and mechanism of injury before and during statewide social distancing and stay-at-home directives.

Methods : Using data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large weekly online panel of UK adults from first three months of lockdown in the UK (n = 51,600), we tested whether within-person changes in confidence in government, mental wellbeing, social experiences and awareness of COVID-19 were longitudinally related to self-reported compliance levels with guidelines from authorities using random intercept cross-lagged panel models . Findings : We found evidence of a small longitudinal association between increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic and higher self-reported compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness were related to later compliance.

It is also having a significant impact on the national and global economy. As this crisis has a two-sided negative impact, health, and economy, this makes it hard to manage. A full lockdown of the society can help control the spread of the infection. However, the economy will suffer significantly. On the other side, allowing normal life activities will protect the growth of the economy. But, it will decisively increase the spread of the infection, and consequently, cause a collapse in the whole medical system. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper presents the development of a real-time crisis management system that is able to holistically control the country's resources at both micro and macro levels. The ultimate goal of this system is to assure the harmonic balance between crucial actions needed for the containment of the coronavirus spread and at the same time protect the national economy from the negative impacts caused by these actions. To achieve this goal, the system will privately monitor users' geo-social interactions to assist in applying a reasonable social distance when it is needed. The system will alert the people who were in interaction with an infected person or area and recommend the appropriate health care provider. In addition to the fine crafted mobile and web interfaces, the proposed system will be equipped with a set of infrastructures such as data warehousing, data mining, maps, and dashboards.

Previous studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human enterovirus infections may be associated with virus-induced asthma. For example, it has been suggested that HRV infection is detected in the acute exacerbation of asthma and infection is prolonged. Thus it is believed that the main etiological cause of asthma is ARI viruses. Furthermore, the number of asthma patients in most industrial countries has greatly increased, resulting in a morbidity rate of around 10-15% of the population. However, the relationships between viral infections, host immune response, and host factors in the pathophysiology of asthma remain unclear. To gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of virus-induced asthma, it is important to assess both the characteristics of the viruses and the host defense mechanisms. Molecular epidemiology enables us to understand the pathogenesis of microorganisms by identifying specific pathways, molecules, and genes that influence the risk of developing a disease. However, the epidemiology of various respiratory viruses associated with virus-induced asthma is not fully understood.

They face multiple challenges to restructuring their operations to build a resilient, cost-effective and sustainable supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the practice and the research gaps related to supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper is influenced by a literature review of the past decade. This review paper incorporates industry challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, including future steps toward developing resilient supply chains in the new normal economy. The research provides a detailed framework for designing cost-effective survivable supply chains that withstand disruptions for the long term. Findings: The proposed research focuses on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and attempts to bridge pre and post COVID-19 research and practice gaps. Post-COVID-19 resilient supply chains need to be transformed into survivable supply chains. The survivability of the supply chain can be achieved by combining both supply chain resilience and supply chain viability measures. To the best of the authors belief, this is the first study that grounds a theory to provide interconnection of five critical supply chain concepts to manage supply chain risk. This study is uniquely positioned to develop a theoretical framework to design a cost-effective, resilient and sustainable supply chain by establishing the interconnection among these concepts in supply chains. This framework helps practitioners to implement the key strategies at the operational, tactical and strategic levels that enhance maturity in supply chains. Research limitations/implications: The research findings are based on secondary reports such as industry reports, cases, research papers and expert opinions. The authors tried to consult with many companies. However, they were reluctant to share the recovery plan information from COVID. Also, as COVID still exists in many places in Canada, the authors could not gather every intended information from the companies. However, the authors have successfully shared the outcomes of this research with a reputed retail company in Canada. They recognized the importance of survivability in supply chains. Going forward, business organizations need to design cost-effective, sustainable and survivable supply chains. Originality/value: The study attempts to unify current research dealing with supply chain resilience. The study concludes with the limitations of the current research. It highlights the prospects of future research and bridges the supply chain practice gaps from the challenges faced by industries due to COVID-19. The study contributes to the literature by identifying gaps to bridge the supply chain practice and reiterating new research directions to develop a cost-effective, survivable and sustainable supply chain. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Bridging the supply chain resilience research and practice gaps: pre and post COVID-19 perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information technology service management (ITSM) driven by artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., AITSM, is likely to change business models and enterprise operations substantially, setting off a wave of enterprise AI transformation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The indicators of the level of anxiety were studied using the scale of self-assessment of thelevel of anxiety Ch.D. Spielberger, sleep quality was assessed using a standardized questionnaire for self-completionof PSQI and 137Cs content was measured in children. The main group consisted of 96 children who were quarantineddue to the COVID-19 pandemic and permanently lived in radioactively contaminated areas of Zhytomyr and Rivneregions with a soil contamination density of 137Cs from 18 kBq/m2 to 235 kBq/m2. The age of children ranged from10 to 17 years. Among them were 33 boys and 63 girls. The comparison group consisted of 52 children of similar age,including 26 boys and 26 girls. These children lived permanently in Kyiv and were not victims of the Chornobyl dis-aster. RESULTS It was found that children who were quarantined for COVID-19 (both residents of radioactively contami-nated areas and children who do not belong to the contingents affected by the Chornobyl disaster) had an increasedlevel of reactive (RA) and personal anxiety (PA). The comparative analysis showed that children of the same sex ofthe main group and the comparison group did not differ in terms of PA and RA. At the same time, studies have shownthat girls, both in the main group and in the comparison group, were characterized by higher levels of PA and RAthan boys. It was determined that poor sleep quality was common in both children living in radioactively contami-nated areas (42.71 %) and children in the comparison group (42.44 %). Among the sleep disorders in children ofboth observation groups, ?day dysfunction? was most often detected. CONCLUSIONS There was a direct correlation between the overall PSQI score and the level of reactive, personal anx-iety and the overall PSQI score.

Social networks and resources become fragile due to the changing family structures. A strong interprofessional team building and networking of the main actors in the nursing and healthcare systems become necessary. OBJECTIVE: A qualification program for students of medicine, social work and relevant study courses for nursing was established. In this program participants should collectively learn to deal with the concerns and needs of geriatric patients in a case-related manner and to develop suitable plans for treatment and interventions. METHOD: The qualification program for interprofessional team building was evaluated during the development phase as a pilot project and scientifically evaluated (n = 78) using the Freiburg questionnaire on interprofessional learning evaluation (FILE). RESULTS: The program experienced a high level of approval by approximately 98% of the participants. The measurement of change showed an improvement in team skills and ability to work in a team. CONCLUSION: Opening up a learning field for interprofessional learning and working to students of different disciplines and professions during their studies creates a good basis for successful interprofessional team building in the subsequent professional practice.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A single center, retrospective cohort study was conducted with transgender men who underwent surgical correction of their urethral stricture(s) between January 2013 and March 2020. The medical charts of 72 transgender men with 147 urethral strictures were reviewed. The primary outcomes were the success and recurrence rates after surgical treatment for urethral strictures. RESULTS: At last follow-up (median of 61 (IQR 25-202) months), 50/72 (69%) were able to void while standing (after one (60%), two (20%), three (6%), four (8%), five (4%), or seven (2%) procedures), 10/72 (14%) awaited further treatment, 2/72 (3%) sat to void in despite of good urodynamic function, and 10/72 (14%) had a definitive urethrostomy. Of 104 surgical treatments included in separate success rate analysis, 65 (63%) were successful (43/75 (57%) after phalloplasty, 22/29 (76%) after metoidioplasty). Highest success rates in short urethral strictures were seen after Heineke-Mikulicz procedure (6/7, 86%), and in longer or more complicated urethral strictures after two-stage with graft (4/6, 67%), two-stage without graft (10/12, 83%), pedicled flap (11/15, 73%), and single-stage graft (7/7, 100%) urethroplasties.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in acute situations where it is linked with more complications and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic information of AF in this population. METHODS: retrospective analysis of a cohort of 517 patients consecutively admitted in a tertiary hospital due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We divided the patients in two groups according the development of AF and compared the main features of both groups. An univariable and multivariable analysis of mortality were also performed. RESULTS: among 517 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in a tertiary center, 54 (10.4%) developed AF. These patients are older (81.6 vs 66.5 years old, p<0.001) and present more hypertension (74% vs 47%, p<0.001), cardiomyopathy (9% vs 1%, p=0.002), previous heart failure admission (9% vs 0.4%, p<0.001), previous episodes of AF (83% vs 1%, p<0.001) and bigger left atrium (47.8 vs 39.9 mm, p<0.001). AF COVID-19 patients present more acute respiratory failure (72% vs 40%, p<0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality (50% vs 22%, p<0.001). Predictors of AF development are age and previous AF.

Many pollutants are biologically active at low concentrations, resulting in sublethal effects, which makes it a highly complex situation and difficult to assess. In many places, such as the Akaki river in Ethiopia, the pollution situation has resulted in streams with minimal presence of invertebrates or vertebrates. As it is difficult to perform a complete chemical analysis of the waters, the present study focused on using gene expression analysis as a biological end point to determine the effects of Akaki river contaminants. The present study was conducted using the small planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna with toxicogenomic molecular markers. Daphnia magna neonates were exposed to Akaki water samples collected from two different sites on the river and analyzed for mortality and expression of genes involved in different biological pathways. Despite the poor quality of Akaki river water, 48 h acute toxicity tests showed no mortality. Interestingly, analysis of sublethal toxicogenomic responses showed that exposure to Akaki water altered the expression of 25 out of 37 genes involved in metal regulation, immune response, oxidative stress, respiration, reproduction, and development.

A total of 2790 electronic prescriptions for chronic pathologies collected from 18 community pharmacies in the western part of Romania (urban and rural zones) were included. All medicines had been prescribed by general physicians. We identified the following situations of medicine overuse: 15% of the analyzed prescriptions involved the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for >2 weeks, 12% involved the use of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) for >8 weeks, theophylline was the bronchodilator used as a monotherapy in 3.17% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cases, and zopiclone was the hypnotic drug of choice for 2.31% of cases. Regarding the misuse of medicines, 2.33% of analyzed prescriptions contained an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for patients with renal failure in addition to vitamin K antagonists (AVKs) and NSAIDs in 0.43% of cases. Prescriptions for COX2 NSAIDs for periods longer than 2 weeks for patients with cardiovascular disorders accounted for 1.33% of prescriptions, and trihexyphenidyl was used as a monotherapy for patients with Parkinsons disease in 0.18% of cases.

Documenting the extent of hantavirus biodiversity, and particularly their range of mammalian hosts, is critical to resolving this issue. Here, we describe four novel hantaviruses (Huangpi virus, Lianghe virus, Longquan virus, and Yakeshi virus) sampled from bats and shrews in China, and which are distinct from other known hantaviruses.

A phylogenetic analysis of the available diversity of hantaviruses reveals the existence of four phylogroups that infect a range of mammalian hosts, as well as the occurrence of ancient reassortment events between the phylogroups. Notably, the phylogenetic histories of the viruses are not always congruent with those of their hosts, suggesting that cross-species transmission has played a major role during hantavirus evolution and at all taxonomic levels, although we also noted some evidence for virus-host co-divergence.

Twelve patients underwent conventional selective cerebral perfusion during August 2015CDecember 2018 and seven patients underwent direct carotid artery perfusion during January 2019COctober 2020. We assessed patient characteristics, surgical courses, clinical outcomes, and neurological outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 69 (range 39C84) years; 17 patients were male (89%). Eight patients (42%) had neurological symptoms. Concomitant procedures, postoperative neurological symptoms, and late mortality were significantly associated with conventional selective cerebral perfusion. Five selective cerebral perfusion patients experienced worsened neurological symptoms and two died of broad cerebral ischemia. No direct carotid artery perfusion patient died during hospitalization or experienced worsened neurological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Direct carotid artery perfusion may be useful in aortic dissection with brain ischemia because it does not aggravate neurological symptoms and is not associated with intraoperative cerebral infarction. However, it may be ineffective when cerebral infarction has already developed.","output":"Impact of direct carotid artery perfusion in acute type A aortic dissection involving the common carotid artery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biofumigation has been proposed as an alternative to soil fumigation to manage soil-borne diseases including potato early dying disease complex (PED). This study examined the potential of using brown mustard (Mustard juncea) biofumigation to manage PED under rain-fed potato production in New Brunswick, Canada in two trials between 2017 and 2020 in comparison with chloropicrin fumigation and a conventional barley rotation. Biofumigation increased yield in one trial, but not in a second trial where the potato crop experienced severe drought, whereas chloropicrin fumigation increased yield in both trials. Biofumigation was effective in suppressing root-lesion nematode (RLN, Pratylenchus spp.) counts in both trials, but was ineffective in suppressing V. dahliae population density. Chloropicrin fumigation was effective in suppressing RLN counts and V. dahliae population density only in the hill where injected, but the effect was short-lived as the population density of V. dahliae in the hill increased to the level of the control in one potato growing season. Biofumigation may be an alternative to chloropicrin fumigation in managing PED, particularly in fields with high RLN population but relatively low Verticillium population density. However, neither biofumigation nor fumigation used alone may be sustainable in the short-term potato rotations commonly used in New Brunswick, and additional beneficial practices are required to sustain productivity in the long-term.","output":"Effect of Biofumigation on Population Densities of Pratylenchus spp. and Verticillium spp. and Potato Yield in Eastern Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with more than 53,973 people affected in West Bengal state of India. Objectives: The aim of present study was to assess the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) of dental practitioners in Kolkata city, West Bengal, India regarding COVID-2019 pandemic. Materials and method: Online questionnaire was distributed among dentists across West Bengal city, using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. The questionnaire had 17 questions: (1) Section A was 'General section' which comprised of socio-demographic and professional details of the subjects; and (2) Section B comprised of 14 questions depicting knowledge, awareness attitude and practice regarding COVID-19. The data collected was subjected to statistical analysis with level of significance at p=0.05. The descriptive statistical analysis was done to compute frequency and percentages. Intergroup comparison was determined by Chi-square statistical analysis to determine the level of significance for responses of each question. Results: Around 70.4% undergraduates participated in the study. Only 4.3% showed accurate knowledge with respect to the incubation period of coronavirus. Coughing and sneezing was considered to be the most common mode of transmission. 98.9% of dentists considered fever to be the characteristic symptom of the disease. Hand washing and alcohol rubs was advocated by 99.5% of the dentist. Emergency procedures were considered necessary by 90.8% dentists. 75.1% of dentists agree that their practice has been affected by the pandemic.

However, the success rate of LCOs varies from 7% to 87%, and the culture medium compositions are markedly different. Airway organoid media can be used for LCO cultures, but this promotes the overgrowth of normal cell organoids especially in LCOs from intrapulmonary lesions. Several modified media are specifically utilized for promoting the cancer cells growth. For culturing high-purity LCOs, cancer cells from metastatic lesions and malignant effusions are used. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing has identified previously unknown cell populations in the lungs and lung cancer. This sequencing technology can be used to validate whether the LCO recapitulates the heterogeneity and functional hierarchy of the primary tumor. Several groups have attempted to culture LCOs with mesenchymal cells and immune cells to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Disease modeling using LCO provides novel insight into the pathophysiology of lung cancer and enables high-throughput screening for drug discovery and prognosis prediction. An LCO model would help to identify new concepts as a basis for lung cancer targeting by discovering innovative therapeutic targets.","output":"Scientific Validation and Clinical Application of Lung Cancer Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the protective effect of house-screening (HS) on indoor Ae. aegypti infestation, abundance and arboviral infection in Merida, Mexico. METHODS In 2019, we performed a cluster randomized controlled trial (6 control and 6 intervention areas: 100 households/area). Intervention clusters received permanently fixed fiberglass HS on all windows and doors. The study included two cross-sectional entomologic surveys, one baseline (dry season in May 2019) and one post-intervention (PI, rainy season between September-October 2019). The presence and number of indoor Aedes females and blood-fed females (indoor mosquito infestation) as well as arboviral infections with dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses were evaluated in a subsample of 30 houses within each cluster. RESULTS HS houses had significatively lower risk for having Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes (odds ratio [OR]=0.56, 95% C. I. 0.33-0.97, P=0.04) and blood-fed females (OR=0.53, 95% C.

We aim to describe experiences of DRTB-HIV care among patients in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. METHODS: In this qualitative study using Burys framework for chronic illness, we conducted 13 focus groups at a tertiary hospital with 55 patients co-infected with DRTB and HIV (28 women, 27 men) who were receiving new bedaquiline-based treatment for DRTB, concurrent with antiretroviral therapy. Eligible patients were consenting adults (aged >18 years) with confirmed DRTB and HIV who were enrolled into the PRAXIS study within 2 weeks of initiating bedaquiline-based treatment for DRTB. Participants were recruited from the PRAXIS cohort to participate in a focus group based on their time in DRTB treatment: early (2C6 weeks after treatment initiation), middle (2C6 months after discharge or treatment initiation if never hospitalised), and late (>6 months after treatment initiation). Focus groups were carried out in isiZulu language, audio recorded, and translated to English within 4 weeks. Participants were asked about their experiences of DRTB and HIV care and treatment, and qualitative data were coded and thematically analysed. FINDINGS: From March, 2017, to June, 2018, distinctive patient challenges were identified at four critical stages of DRTB care: diagnosis, marked by centralised hospitalisation, renunciation from routine life, systemic stigmatisation and, for patients with longstanding HIV, renewed destabilisation; treatment initiation, marked by side-effects, isolation, and social disconnectedness; discharge, marked by brief respite and resurgent therapeutic and social disruption; and continuity, marked by deepening socioeconomic challenges despite clinical recovery. The periods of diagnosis and discharge into the community were particularly difficult. Treatment information and agency in decision making was a persistent gap. Sources of stigmatisation shifted with movement between the hospital and community. Resilience was built by connecting to peers, self-isolating, financial and material security, and a focus on recovery. INTERPRETATION: People with DRTB and HIV undergo disruptive, life-altering experiences. The lack of information, agency, and social protections in DRTB care and treatment causes wider-reaching challenges for patients compared with HIV. Decentralised, community, peer-support, and differentiated care models for DRTB might be ameliorative and help to maximise the promise of new regimens.

In mammals, it elicits cardioprotection via Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor D (MrgD), and the NOS/NO system. In teleost fish, RAS is known to modulate heart performance. However, no information is available on the presence of a cardioactive ACE2/Alamandine axis. To fill this gap, we used the cyprinid teleost Carassius auratus (goldfish) for in silico and in vitro analyses. Via the NCBI Blast P suite we found that in cyprinids ace2 is phylogenetically detectable in a subcluster of proteins including ace2-like isoforms, and is correlated with a hypoxia-dependent pathway. By real-time PCR, Western Blotting, and HPLC, ACE2 and Alamandine were identified in goldfish heart and plasma, respectively. Both increased after chronic exposure to low O(2) (2.6 mg O(2) L(?1)). By using an ex-vivo working goldfish-heart preparation, we observed that in vitro administration of exogenous Alamandine dose-dependently stimulates myocardial contractility starting from 10(?11) M. The effect that involved Mas-related receptors and PKA occurred via the NOS/NO system. This was shown by exposing the perfused heart to the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA (10(?5) M) that abolished the cardiac effect of Alamandine and was supported by the increased expression of the phosphorylated NOS enzyme in the extract from goldfish heart exposed to 10(?10) M Alamandine.

Therefore, in this work nine metals and metalloids (Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Ni, Fe, Mn, Zn and As) and three nutrients (P, N and C) that seem to accumulate in marine sediments, were determined under the fish cages (zero distance) and about 50 and 100 m away from them, in three aquacultures in Greece. The analysis of these data is crucial due to the negative impact of the intensive aquaculture activities on fish population, human health and marine environment. This study investigated the environmental impact associated with aquaculture cages on marine sediments, using Supervised Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in parallel with Classification Trees (CTs). Optimised models were constructed in order to detect the significance of each variable, predict the origin of the sediment samples and successfully visualise their results. Three popular ANN architectures, as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis function (RBF) and counter propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs) were used to assess the impact of the intensive aquaculture activities on marine sediments. In addition, more traditional multivariate chemometric techniques like CTs were applied to the same data set for comparison purposes. The modelling study showed that P, N, Cu, Cd were the most critical (and polluting) factors of those metals studied. Moreover, single-element models achieved elevated predictive percentages.

We used a combination of data science methods (including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. RESULTS: The most common category in the coded tweets was personal opinions (66.2%), followed by informative (24.7%), jokes/ridicule (4.8%), and personal experiences (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than one in ten (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within jokes/ridicule targeted older adults, half of which were death jokes. Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bivariate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic.

Maternity care disruptions have been surveyed, but not those related to vulnerable small newborns. We aimed to survey reported disruptions to small and sick newborn care worldwide and undertake thematic analysis of healthcare providers' experiences and proposed mitigation strategies. METHODS: Using a widely disseminated online survey in three languages, we reached out to neonatal healthcare providers. We collected data on COVID-19 preparedness, effects on health personnel and on newborn care services, including kangaroo mother care (KMC), as well as disruptors and solutions. RESULTS: We analysed 1120 responses from 62 countries, mainly low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Preparedness for COVID-19 was suboptimal in terms of guidelines and availability of personal protective equipment. One-third reported routine testing of all pregnant women, but 13% had no testing capacity at all. More than 85% of health personnel feared for their own health and 89% had increased stress. Newborn care practices were disrupted both due to reduced care-seeking and a compromised workforce. More than half reported that evidence-based interventions such as KMC were discontinued or discouraged. Separation of the mother-baby dyad was reported for both COVID-positive mothers (50%) and those with unknown status (16%). Follow-up care was disrupted primarily due to families' fear of visiting hospitals (~73%).

Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides.","output":"Viral Polymerase-Helicase Complexes Regulate Replication Fidelity To Overcome Intracellular Nucleotide Depletion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasmodium vivax has been largely neglected over the past century, despite a widespread recognition of its burden across region where it is endemic.

We measure life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and opioid-related deaths over five and ten years.Findings: Under the status quo, our model predicts that approximately 522,000 opioid-related deaths will occur from 2020 to 2024 (range 424,000 - 575,000), rising to 1,172,000 (range 956,000 - 1,308,000) by 2029. Expansion of naloxone availability had the largest effect: with 30% expansion, approximately 25% of opioid deaths would be averted. Pharmacotherapy, needle exchange, and psychosocial treatment are uniformly beneficial, reducing opioid-related deaths while leading to gains in life years and QALYs. Reduced prescribing for acute and transitioning pain (at the end of the first month of acute pain) would reduce lives lost over five and ten years. Reducing chronic pain prescribing, rescheduling drugs, and increasing excess opioid disposal programs would increase total deaths over five years as some opioid users escalate to heroin, but decrease deaths over ten years. Combined interventions would lead to greater increases in life years, QALYs, and deaths averted, although in many cases the results are subadditive.Interpretation: A combination of expanded health services for addicted individuals and reduced opioid prescribing would moderately lessen the severity of the opioid crisis over the next decade.

This study aimed to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on MIS in urology practice at national level. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 urologists in Turkey participated in an online survey between August 22 and September 23, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to determine the participants' demographic characteristics and responses to multiple-choice questions. RESULTS: While 54% of urologists stated that they were concerned about the possibility that the patients planned to undergo MIS were carrying COVID-19 or false-negative for the virus, 51% considered that open surgery was safer than MIS in this regard. The pandemic led to a difference in the preferences of 40% of the urologists in relation to open or MIS methods, and during the pandemic, 39% of the urologists always directed their patients to open surgery. It was determined that during the pandemic, there was a statistical decrease in the intensity and weekly application of MIS methods among all surgical procedures compared to the pre-pandemic (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). MIS was preferred for oncological operations by 97.3% of the urologists during the pandemic, with the most performed operation being radical nephrectomy (90.7%). Among oncological operations, radical prostatectomy was most frequently postponed. To prevent virus transmission during MIS, 44% of the urologists reported that they always used an additional evacuation system and 52% took additional precautions. There were a total of 27 healthcare workers who took part in MIS and tested positive for COVID-19 after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of operations has decreased during the ongoing pandemic, MIS is a method that can be preferred due to its limited contamination and mortality in urology practice provided that safety measures are taken and guideline recommendations are followed.","output":"A nationwide survey on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on minimal invasive surgery in urology practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic discussions employ language metaphors and metonymies to make sense of the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis.

Despite intensive research, most of the existing diagnostic methods remain non-specific, labour-intensive, time-consuming or are not sensitive enough for rapid and timely diagnosis of the onset and progression of sepsis. The present work was undertaken to explore the potential of Raman spectroscopy to identify the biomarkers of sepsis in a label-free and minimally invasive manner using different mouse models of inflammation. The sera of BALB/c mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium reveal extensive hemolysis, as indicated by the Raman bands that are characteristic of the porphyrin ring of hemoglobin (668, 743, 1050, 1253 and 1397 cm-1) which increase in a kinetic manner. These markers are also observed in a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock model, but not in a thioglycollate-induced sterile peritonitis model. These data demonstrate that hemolysis is a signature of systemic, but not localised, inflammation. To further validate our observations, sepsis was induced in the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2-/-) deficient strain which is more sensitive to infection. Interestingly, Nos2-/- mice exhibit a higher degree of hemolysis than C57BL/6 mice. Sepsis-induced hemolysis was also confirmed using resonance Raman spectroscopy with 442 nm excitation which demonstrated a pronounced increase in the resonant Raman bands at 670 and 1350 cm-1 in sera of the infected mice.

Measures Receiver operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC) to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying positive cases of staff within facilities based on community COVID-19 activity level including county positivity rate and county cases per 10,000. Results The detection of any infected staff within a facility using county cases per 10,000 population or county positivity rate resulted in an AUC of 0.648 (95% CI 0.601-0.696) and 0.649 (95% CI 0.601-0.696), respectively. Of staff tested, 28.0% were certified nursing assistants (CNAs), yet accounted for 36.9% of all staff testing positive.

The incidence risks of SARA and SCK were 23.3% and 46.2%, respectively. Simultaneous occurrence of SCK and SARA (SCASCK) was present in 5.2% of the cows. In the final multivariable model, the occurrence of SARA (Odds Ratio: OR = 39.4), SCK (OR = 47.4) and SCASCK (OR = 68.5) was associated with increased odds of PA. Feeding a transition period diet was associated with reduced odds of PA (OR = 0.15). Second parity cows had significantly lower odds of PA than first parity cows (OR = 0.21). In conclusion, inadequate pre-partum and postpartum nutritional management of the herds increased the occurrence of SARA and SCK, which had adverse effects on reproductive performance.","output":"Incidence and effects of subacute ruminal acidosis and subclinical ketosis with respect to postpartum anestrus in grazing dairy cows."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced primary/grade schools and university closings as well as forced the suspension of a number of medical and laboratory testing procedures.

The ideal procedure would be one that offers fast and efficient results safely as an outpatient procedure. Historically, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy is considered the gold standard but transrectal biopsy can under-sample the anterior and apical regions of the prostate and is associated with a risk of prostate biopsy-related sepsis, which may require intensive care admission. Transperineal (TP) biopsy addresses the inefficient sampling of TRUS biopsy but historically has been done under general anaesthetic, which makes it difficult to incorporate into timed diagnostic pathways such as the National Health Service (NHS) 2-week cancer pathway. TRUS biopsy has remained the mainstay of clinical diagnosis because of its simplicity; however, the recent development of simpler local anaesthetic transperineal techniques has transformed outpatient biopsy practice. These techniques practically eliminate prostate biopsy-related sepsis, have a shallow learning curve and offer effective sampling of all areas of the prostate in an outpatient setting. The effectiveness of TP biopsy has been enhanced by the introduction of multiparametric MRI prior to biopsy, the use of PSA density for risk stratification in equivocal cases and combined with more efficient targeted and systematic biopsies techniques, such as the Ginsburg Protocol, has improved the tolerability and diagnostic yield of local anaesthetic TP biopsies, reducing the risk of complications from the oversampling associated with transperineal template mapping biopsies. Areas where the literature remains unclear is the optimum number of cores needed to detect clinically significant disease (CSD) in patients with a definable lesion on MRI, in particular, whether there is a need for systematic biopsy in the face of equivocal MRI findings to ensure no CSD is missed. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on prostate cancer referrals and prostate biopsy techniques within the UK; prior to the pandemic 65% of all prostate biopsies were TRUS, since the pandemic the proportions have reversed such that now over 65% of all prostate biopsies in the NHS are transperineal.","output":"Recent Advances in Systematic and Targeted Prostate Biopsies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aims of this systematic review were to: (1) describe physical activity (PA) levels following diagnosis of primary brain cancer, (2) determine the relationship between PA levels and health outcomes, and (3) assess the effect of participating in an exercise intervention on health outcomes following a diagnosis of brain cancer. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL were searched for relevant articles published prior to May 1, 2020. Studies reporting levels of PA, the relationship between PA and health outcomes, and exercise interventions conducted in adults with brain cancer were eligible. The search strategy included terms relating to primary brain cancer, physical activity, and exercise. Two independent reviewers assessed articles for eligibility and methodological quality (according to Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools). Descriptive statistics were used to present relevant data and outcomes. RESULTS: 15 studies were eligible for inclusion. Most adults with brain cancer were insufficiently active from diagnosis through to post-treatment. Higher levels of PA were associated with lower severity of brain cancer specific concerns and higher quality of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that exercise is safe, feasible and potentially beneficial to brain cancer symptom severity and interference, aerobic capacity, body composition and PA levels. However, the level of evidence to support these findings is graded as weak. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that it is likely appropriate to promote those with brain cancer to be as physically active as possible. The need or ability of those with brain cancer to meet current PA guidelines promoted to all people with cancer remains unclear.

METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 323 Saudi adults with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The participants were selected randomly between August 31, 2020, and July 1, 2020, from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network system, which contains the primary data on COVID-19 infections in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio). The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65.4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15.6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39.5 years, SD = 14.8) (p<0.001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0.06). Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 9.4), hypertension (OR = 8.6), cardiovascular disease (OR = 7.4), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.3), and obesity (OR = 2.0) were significantly associated with death due to COVID-19. Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.

LysOX shows strict substrate specificity for l-lysine, whereas most l-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) exhibit broad substrate specificity for l-amino acids. Previous studies of LysOX showed that overall structural similarity to the well-studied snake venom LAAOs. However, the molecular mechanism of strict specificity for l-lysine was still unclear. We here determined the structure of LysOX in complex with l-lysine at 1.7 ? resolution. The structure revealed that the hydrogen bonding network formed by D212, D315, and A440 with two water molecules is responsible for the recognition of the side chain amino group. In addition, a narrow hole formed by five hydrophobic residues in the active site contributes to strict substrate specificity. Mutation studies demonstrated that D212 and D315 are essential for l-lysine recognition, and the D212A/D315A double mutant LysOX showed different substrate specificity from LysOX. Moreover, the structural basis of the substrate specificity change has also been revealed by the structural analysis of the mutant variant and its substrate complexes.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire delivered to 329 cancer patients in 3 oncology cancer centers in Tunisia between February-May 2021. Logistic regression was used to evaluate odds ratio predicting patients intentions toward the vaccine. RESULTS: Acceptance rate was 50.5%, 28.3% (n = 93) reported to definitely refuse the vaccine and 21.2% (n = 70) did not make their decision yet. High educational level, history of comorbidities, history of influenza vaccination in the current season, and patients opinion about the severity of COVID-19 did not predict vaccine resistance. However, patients who think that the vaccine may interfere with treatment efficacy (OR = 7.28, 95%CI [2.5C12.32]), or may impact cancer outcome (OR = 6.14, 95%CI [2.27C16.7]), were significantly more likely to refuse the vaccine. Patients who disagree that the vaccine is a major weapon against the pandemic (OR = 6.07, 95%CI [2.34C9.52]) or that it could reduce the virus transmission (OR = 7.34, 95%CI [4.22C11.81]) were also significantly more likely to reject the vaccination. Safety concerns were also significant predictive factors (OR = 7.9, 95%CI [4.10C11.27].

This technology guided students through a comprehensive process of learning anatomy, radiographic positioning and pathology. Students then X-rayed a virtual patient in the VR suite using HTC Vive Pro&#8482; headsets and hand controllers. Instant feedback was provided. An online survey was later disseminated to students to gather user feedback. Thematic and descriptive statistical analyses were applied. RESULTS: A response rate of 79% (n = 83) was achieved. Most respondents (58%) reported enjoying VR simulation, whilst some felt indifferent towards it (27%). Ninety-four percent would recommend this tool to other students. The mean length of time it took for students to feel comfortable using the technology was 60 min (10-240 min). Most respondents (58%) desired more VR access. Students attributed enhanced confidence in the areas of beam collimation (75%), anatomical marker placement (63%), centring of the X-ray tube (64%) and exposure parameter selection (56%) to their VR practice.

Recently, several methods and techniques have been proposed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus using different images and data. However, this is the first study that will explore the possibility of using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect COVID-19 from electrocardiogram (ECG) trace images. In this work, COVID-19 and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were detected using deep-learning techniques. A public dataset of ECG images consisting of 1937 images from five distinct categories, such as normal, COVID-19, myocardial infarction (MI), abnormal heartbeat (AHB), and recovered myocardial infarction (RMI) were used in this study. Six different deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2) were used to investigate three different classification schemes: (i) two-class classification (normal vs COVID-19); (ii) three-class classification (normal, COVID-19, and other CVDs), and finally, (iii) five-class classification (normal, COVID-19, MI, AHB, and RMI). For two-class and three-class classification, Densenet201 outperforms other networks with an accuracy of 99.1%, and 97.36%, respectively; while for the five-class classification, InceptionV3 outperforms others with an accuracy of 97.83%. ScoreCAM visualization confirms that the networks are learning from the relevant area of the trace images.

Using social exchange as our theoretical foundation and three-wave lagged survey data collected from N = 300 employees within the United States, the current study found support for the contention that individuals with greater job insecurity pursue fewer idiosyncratic deals (I-Deals) with their employers. Fewer I-Deals in turn were associated with lower affective commitment, and higher turnover intentions, perceived psychological contract breach, and psychological contract violation. However, these indirect effects were conditional upon employee levels of grit (specifically, perseverance of effort), such that higher grit attenuated the negative relationship between job insecurity and the pursuit of I-Deals. Given that employees often have little control over the source of their experienced job insecurity (e.g., impending layoffs, a poor economy, announced merger or acquisition), these findings hold promise in potentially alleviating the well-documented negative outcomes of job insecurity through interventions designed to increase employee levels of grit and facilitate the creation of I-Deals.

METHODS Between March and June 2020, we enrolled >=60 years in-hospital COVID-19 patients (N=806) in GeroCovid, a multicenter observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine. RESULTS The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. In-hospital mortality was higher in the AF group (36.9 vs. 27.5%, p=0.015). At admission, 51.7%, 10.2% and 38.1% of AF cases were taking, respectively, oral anticoagulants (OACs), antiplatelet agents and no antithrombotic therapy. During hospitalization, 51% patients switched to low-molecular weight heparins. AF patients who survived were younger (818 vs. 847 years; p=0.002) and had a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.91.6 vs. 4.41.3; p=0.02) than those who died. OACs use before (63.1% vs. 32.3%; p<0.001) and during hospitalization (34.0% vs. 12.7%; p=0.002) was higher among survivors.

We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.","output":"Cross-scale interactions, nonlinearities, and forecasting catastrophic events."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The use prosthetic materials for the surgical repair of abdominal wall defects has become almost standard practice. This study was designed to assess the expression of different growth factors (VEGF/TGF-1) and macrophages during the early host tissue incorporation of several polypropylene lightweight (PP-LW)-including one partially absorbable-and heavyweight (PP-HW) prosthetic meshes. METHODS Ventral defects were created in the anterior abdominal wall of New Zealand rabbits and repaired by fixing PP-LW meshes of different pore size and a low porosity PP-HW mesh to the edges of the defect. Following killing 14 days after implant, specimens were taken to examine TGF-1/VEGF gene and protein expression by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The macrophage response was also assessed. RESULTS All the materials showed good host tissue incorporation, with a more severe inflammatory reaction and greater numbers of macrophages recorded in the partially absorbable LW implants. Relative amounts of VEGF mRNA were significantly lower for the LW partially absorbable implants compared with the remaining LW meshes. Protein expression of VEGF showed undetectable or minimum staining in the different groups. TGF-1 mRNA levels were also lower in the partially absorbable group compared with one of PP-LW type of mesh. Gene expression patterns were consistent with the TGF-1 protein levels detected. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that VEGF and TGF-1 expression were independent of mesh pore size. The expression of both growth factors and the macrophage response were correlated with the presence of biodegradable material in the mesh. The presence of absorbable material in the LW mesh gave rise to a more intense inflammatory reaction and the reduced synthesis of growth factors known to contribute to neotissue maturation.","output":"Inflammatory reaction and neotissue maturation in the early host tissue incorporation of polypropylene prostheses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual care (i.e. telephone or videoconference) has played a critical role. However, concerns were raised regarding equitable access for older adults, in particular, given potential advantages of videoconference- as opposed to telephone-based assessment. Our objective was to describe patient-specific factors associated with different modes of virtual healthcare. Methods We reviewed medical records of all patients assessed virtually in a geriatric medicine clinic in Toronto, Canada, between March 17 and July 13, 2020. We derived adjusted odds ratios (OR), risk differences (RD), and marginal and predicted probabilities, with 95% confidence intervals, from a multivariable logistic regression model, which tested the association between having a videoconference assessment (vs. a telephone assessment) and patient age, sex, ability to use a computer, education, frailty (measured on the Clinical Frailty Scale), history of cognitive impairment, and immigration history; language of assessment, and caregiver involvement in assessment. Results Our study included 330 patients (227 telephone and 103 videoconference assessments). Frailty (adjusted OR 0.62, 0.45 to 0.85; adjusted RD -0.08, -0.09 to -0.06) and absence of a caregiver (adjusted OR 0.12, 0.06 to 0.24; adjusted RD -0.35, -0.43 to -0.26) were associated with lower odds of videoconference assessment. For example, an 80-year-old woman with mild frailty who immigrated to Canada, speaks English, attained a post-secondary education, does not have cognitive impairment, and uses a computer had a 60% (39% to 80%) predicted probability of videoconference assessment if a caregiver was present compared to 15% (3% to 26%) without a caregiver. Only 32 of 98 (32.7%) patients who could independently use a computer participated in videoconference assessments. Conclusion Given the recent expansion of virtual care, we must urgently implement and evaluate strategies that optimise equitable access to videoconference-based virtual care for older adults.","output":"Factors associated with access to virtual care in older adults: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Timothy Williamson has defended the claim that the semantics of the indicative if is given by the material conditional.

Determining the risk factors for death and the differences in clinical features between severely ill and critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia has become increasingly important. AIM: This study was intended to provide insight into the difference between severely ill and critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we enrolled 62 seriously ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who had been diagnosed by March 12, 2020. Clinical data, laboratory indexes, chest images, and treatment strategies collected from routine medical records were compared between severely ill and critically ill patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were also conducted to identify the risk factors associated with the progression of patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients with severe or critical illness, including 7 who died, 30 (48%) patients had underlying diseases, of which the most common was cardiovascular disease (hypertension, 34%, and coronary heart disease, 5%). Compared to patients with severe disease, those with critical disease had distinctly higher white blood cell counts, procalcitonin levels, and D-dimer levels, and lower hemoglobin levels and lymphocyte counts. Multivariate regression showed that a lymphocyte count less than 10(9)/L (odds ratio 20.92, 95% CI 1.76C248.18; p=0.02) at admission increased the risk of developing a critical illness. CONCLUSION: Based on multivariate regression analysis, a lower lymphocyte count (<10(9)/L) on admission is the most critical independent factor that is closely associated with an increased risk of progression to critical illness. Age, underlying diseases, especially hypertension and coronary heart disease, elevated D-dimer, decreased hemoglobin, and SOFA score, and APACH score also need to be taken into account for predicting disease progression.

METHODS: We performed a single-arm interventional trial measuring NAb and total antibody titers before and after CP transfusion over a 14-day period in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04434131 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04434131) RESULTS: NAb titers in the donor CP units were low (<1:40 to 1:160) and had no effect on recipient neutralizing activity one day after transfusion. NAb titers were detected in 6/12 patients upon enrollment and in 11/12 patients during at least two timepoints. Average titers peaked on day 7 and declined towards day 14 (P=0.004). NAb and IgG titers were correlated in donor plasma units (=0.938, P<0.0001) and in the cumulative patient measures (=0.781, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CP infusion did not alter recipient NAb titers.

We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately. METHODS: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. RESULTS: We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85-1.24).

The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global crisis, with a multitude of factors that affect mental health worldwide. Here, we explore potential predictors for the emergence and maintenance of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the general population in Israel. Methods. Across the span of 16 months, 2,478 people completed a repeated self-report survey which inquired psychiatric symptoms and pandemic related stress factors (PRSF). PRSF were divided into four clusters of environmental stressors: financial, health-related, fatigue and sense of protection by authorities. We applied mixed-effects linear models to assess how each stressor contributes to depression, anxiety and PTSS at each time point, alongside a longitudinal exploration among participants who completed at least two consecutive surveys (n=400). Results. Fatigue was the strongest predictor for depression, anxiety and PTSS at all time points (standardized {beta} between 0.28-0.60, p<.0001), and predicted deterioration overtime ({beta} between 0.22-0.36, p<.0001). Financial concerns associated with depression and anxiety at all time points ({beta} between 0.13-0.26, p<.01), and with their deterioration overtime ({beta} between 0.16-0.18, p<.0001), while health related concerns were uniquely associated with anxiety and PTSS at all time points ({beta} between 0.14-0.29, p<.01) and their deterioration ({beta} between 0.11-0.16, p<.001), but not with depression. Improvement in sense of protection overtime associated with decrease in depression and anxiety ({beta} between -0.09 to -0.16, p<.01). Conclusions.

These disparities are multifactorial, difficult to quantify, and are influenced by historical, socioeconomic, and health care structural factors. The objective of this article was to assess these factors and offer a call to action to overcome them. The authors reviewed published data on pancreatic cancer in Native American populations with a focus on disparities in incidence, outcomes, and research efforts. The historical context of the interactions between Native Americans and the United States health care system was also analyzed to form actionable items to build trust and collaboration. The incidence of pancreatic cancer in Native Americans is higher than that in the general US population and has the worst survival of any major racial or ethnic group. These outcomes are influenced by a patient population with often poor access to high-quality cancer care, historical trauma potentially leading to reduced care utilization, and a lack of research focused on etiologies and comorbid conditions that contribute to these disparities.

However, clinical laboratory metrics suggest key differences in these pathologies. We sought to determine whether plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic potential in patients with COVID-19 differ compared with healthy donors and critically ill patients with sepsis. Approach and Results: We performed comparative studies on plasmas from a single-center, cross-sectional observational study of 99 hospitalized patients (46 with COVID-19 and 53 with sepsis) and 18 healthy donors. We measured biomarkers of endogenous coagulation and fibrinolytic activity by immunoassays, thrombin, and plasmin generation potential by fluorescence and fibrin formation and lysis by turbidity. Compared with healthy donors, patients with COVID-19 or sepsis both had elevated fibrinogen, d-dimer, soluble TM (thrombomodulin), and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes. Patients with COVID-19 had increased thrombin generation potential despite prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas patients with sepsis did not. Plasma from patients with COVID-19 also had increased endogenous plasmin potential, whereas patients with sepsis showed delayed plasmin generation. The collective perturbations in plasma thrombin and plasmin generation permitted enhanced fibrin formation in both COVID-19 and sepsis. Unexpectedly, the lag times to thrombin, plasmin, and fibrin formation were prolonged with increased disease severity in COVID-19, suggesting a loss of coagulation-initiating mechanisms accompanies severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Both COVID-19 and sepsis are associated with endogenous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, but these diseases differently impact plasma procoagulant and fibrinolytic potential. Dysregulation of procoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways may uniquely contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and sepsis.","output":"COVID-19 and Sepsis Are Associated With Different Abnormalities in Plasma Procoagulant and Fibrinolytic Activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding and limiting infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) and subsequent transmission to their families is always important and has been underscored during the COVID-19 pandemic. Except in specific and local settings, little is known about the extent of such transmissions at the national level. OBJECTIVE: To describe SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs and to estimate the risk of HCWs transmitting COVID-19 to their household members, including calculating the secondary attack rate to household members and estimating the risk for hospital workers to contract COVID-19 at home. METHODS: Using individual-level data on all HCWs employed in Norwegian hospitals and their household members, we identified (1) the number of HCWs who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between August 2020 and September 2021 and the proportion of those who were index cases in their own household and (2) the number of HCWs who were secondary cases in their own households. RESULTS: During this period, a3,005 (2,6%) hospital workers acquired COVID-19. Almost half of all hospital workers with confirmed COVID-19 were likely index cases in their own households. When the index case in a family was an HCW, the secondary attack rate was 24.8%. At least 17.8% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases among hospital workers were acquired in the household. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest not only that many HCWs are infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their households but also that infected HCWs constitute a serious infection risk to members of the HCW's household.","output":"Transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between hospital workers and members of their household: Nationwide, registry-based, cohort study from Norway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The visual exploration and analysis of biomolecular networks is of paramount importance for identifying hidden and complex interaction patterns among proteins. Although many tools have been proposed for this task, they are mainly focused on the query and visualization of a single protein with its neighborhood. The global exploration of the entire network and the interpretation of its underlying structure still remains difficult, mainly due to the excessively large size of the biomolecular networks. In this paper we propose a novel multi-resolution representation and exploration approach that exploits hierarchical community detection algorithms for the identification of communities occurring in biomolecular networks. The proposed graphical rendering combines two types of nodes (protein and communities) and three types of edges (protein-protein, community-community, protein-community), and displays communities at different resolutions, allowing the user to interactively zoom in and out from different levels of the hierarchy. Links among communities are shown in terms of relationships and functional correlations among the biomolecules they contain. This form of navigation can be also combined by the user with a vertex centric visualization for identifying the communities holding a target biomolecule. Since communities gather limited-size groups of correlated proteins, the visualization and exploration of complex and large networks becomes feasible on off-the-shelf computer machines. The proposed graphical exploration strategies have been implemented and integrated in UNIPred-Web, a web application that we recently introduced for combining the UNIPred algorithm, able to address both integration and protein function prediction in an imbalance-aware fashion, with an easy to use vertex-centric exploration of the integrated network. The tool has been deeply amended from different standpoints, including the prediction core algorithm. Several tests on networks of different size and connectivity have been conducted to show off the vast potential of our methodology; moreover, enrichment analyses have been performed to assess the biological meaningfulness of detected communities. Finally, a CoV-human network has been embedded in the system, and a corresponding case study presented, including the visualization and the prediction of human host proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV2 proteins.","output":"Multi-resolution visualization and analysis of biomolecular networks through hierarchical community detection and web-based graphical tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of malaria in Honduras is based mainly on microscopic observation of the parasite in thick smears or the detection of parasite antigens through rapid diagnostic tests when microscopy is not available. The specific treatment of the disease depends exclusively on the positive result of one of these tests. Given the low sensitivity of conventional methods, new diagnostic approaches are needed. This study evaluates the in-field performance of a device (Gazelle?) based on the detection of hemozoin. This was a double-blind study evaluating symptomatic individuals with suspected malaria in the department of Gracias a Dios, Honduras, using blood samples collected from 2021 to 2022. The diagnostic performance of Gazelle? was compared with microscopy and nested 18ssr PCR as references. The sensitivity and specificity of Gazelle? were 59.7% and 98.6%, respectively, while microscopy had a sensitivity of 64.9% and a specificity of 100%. The kappa index between microscopy and Gazelle? was 0.9216 using microscopy as a reference. Both methods show similar effectiveness and predictive values. No statistical differences were observed between the results of the Gazelle? compared to light microscopy (p = 0.6831). The turnaround time was shorter for Gazelle? than for microscopy, but the cost per sample was slightly higher for Gazelle?. Gazelle? showed more false-negative cases when infections were caused by Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax. Conclusions: The sensitivity and specificity of Gazelle? are comparable to microscopy. The simplicity and ease of use of the Gazelle?, the ability to run on batteries, and the immediacy of its results make it a valuable tool for malaria detection in the field.

Ketogenic diet (KD) is one of the therapeutic methods used in DRE. There are some data that adipokines may modulate inflammatory processes and their concentrations are influenced by KD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of KD on serum leptin, chemerin and resistin in children with DRE. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study performed on 72 subjects aged 3-9 years, divided into 3 groups: 24 children with DRE treated with KD, 26 treated with valproic acid (VPA), and a control group of 22 children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anthropometric measurements (weight, heigth, BMI, waist to hip circumerences ratio) were performed in all participants. Biochemical tests included serum fasting glucose, insulin, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, lipid profile, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and blood gasometry. Serum levels of leptin, chemerin and resistin were assayed using commercially available ELISA tests. RESULTS: Serum levels of leptin and chemerin in the KD group were significantly lower and resistin - higher in comparison to patients receiving VPA and the control group. In children treated with the KD, leptin concentrations correlate with insulin levels and HOMA-IR scores. Chemerin levels in this group, in contrast, show negative correlation with body mass and height expressed as standard deviation scores from the mean for age and sex.

Methods: Using data from the ICD-10 based hospital sentinel, we estimated SARI incidence and validated our estimations retrospectively using full population data. We estimated age-specific incidences for COVID-19 hospitalization and ICU for the first three COVID-19 waves in Germany, based on information of SARI cases (COVID-SARI). We compared these estimations to hospitalization and ICU burden of COVID-19 from notification data and described potential underreporting of hospitalizations in notification data. Findings: The estimation of SARI incidence from sentinel data corresponded very well to full population data. The estimated COVID-SARI incidence matched the notified COVID-19 hospitalization incidence in the first wave, but was much higher during the second and the third wave. The proportion of unknown hospitalization status among notified COVID-19 cases was much higher in the later waves compared to the first wave. For all waves, the ICU incidence estimated from COVID-SARI was considerably higher than the results from notification data.

Eligibilitycriteria and analysisRandomized control trials (RCTs) published in any language comparing zinc to a control to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2. Other viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) were included, but the certainty of evidence downgraded twice for indirectness. Screening, data extraction, risk of bias appraisal (RoB-2 tool) and verification was performed by calibrated, single reviewers. RCTs with adult populations were prioritised for analysis. Results123 RCTs were identified. None were specific to SARS-CoV-2 nor other coronaviruses. 28 RCTs evaluated oral (15-45mg daily), sublingual (45-300mg daily), or topical nasal (0.09-2.6 mg daily) zinc to prevent or treat nonspecific viral RTIs in 3,597 adults without zinc deficiency. Compared to placebo, zinc prevented 5 mild to moderate RTIs per 100 person-months, including in older adults (95% confidence interval 1 to 9) (number needed to treat (NTT)=20). There was no significant difference in the rates of non-serious adverse events (AE). For RTI treatment, a clinically important reduction in peak symptom severity scores was found for zinc compared to placebo (mean difference 1.2 points, 0.7 to 1.7), but not average daily symptom severity (standardised mean difference 0.2, 0.1 to 0.4). 19 fewer per 100 adults were at risk of remaining symptomatic over the first 7 days (2 to 38, NNT=5) and the mean duration of symptoms was 2 days shorter (0.2 to 3.5), however, there was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 82% and 97%). 14 more per 100 experienced a non-serious AE (4 to 16, NNT=7) such as nausea, or mouth or nasal irritation. No differences in illness duration nor AE were found when zinc was compared to active controls. No serious AE, including copper deficiency, were reported by any RCT.

A large number of emergency medical services (EMS) and emergency department visits are classified as potentially avoidable. OBJECTIVES: To identify circumstances that increase the number of emergency situations in nursing homes and approaches to reduce hospital admissions in order to illustrate the complexity and opportunities for action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scoping review with analysis of current original and peer-reviewed papers (2015C2020) in PubMed, CINAHL, and hand-search databases. RESULTS: From 2486 identified studies, 302 studies were included. Injuries, fractures, cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases are the most frequent diagnostic groups that have been retrospectively recorded. Different aspects could be identified as circumstances inducing emergency department visits: resident-related (e.g., multimorbidity, lack of volition, and advance directives), facility-related (e.g., staff turnover, uncertainties), physician-related (lack of accessibility, challenging access to specialists), and system-related circumstances (e.g., limited possibilities for diagnostics and treatment in facilities). Multiple approaches to reduce emergency department visits are being explored. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of circumstances influence the course of action in emergency situations in nursing facilities. Therefore, interventions to reduce emergency department visits address, among other things, strengthening the competence of nursing staff, interprofessional communication, and systemic approaches. A comprehensive understanding of the complex processes of care is essential for developing and implementing effective interventions.","output":"Notfallsituationen und Krankenhauszuweisungen in Pflegeeinrichtungen C ein Scoping-Review zu Begleitumst?nden und versorgungsrelevanten Ma?nahmen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been 30 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and technological development has drastically changed the future for those with disabilities As healthcare evolves toward promoting telehealth and patient-centered care, leaders must embrace persons with disabilities and caregivers as valued partners in design and implementation, not as passive \\"end-users\\" We call for a new era of inclusive innovation, a term proposed in this publication to describe accessible technological design for all The next 30 years of the ADA leading to year 2050, should reflect a new era of access, whereby digital health surmounts geographic, social, and economic barriers toward an inclusive virtual society","output":"Inclusive innovation in telehealth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies assessing the mental health of patients with COVID-19 infection remain limited.

In order to bridge this gap, we assessed the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. We carried out a cross-sectional study in a secondary hospital in the Littoral Region of Cameroon. We recruited hospitalised COVID-19 patients during a 4-month period. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics. The HADS score was used to assess levels of anxiety and depression. All analysis were done using Stata 14. A P value of <0.05 was used as the cut-off for statistical significance. A total number of 285 patients took part in this study with a mean age of 48.47 years.

We evaluated the distribution of COVID-19Crelated fatalities and ICU admissions by age groups in Europe. Materials and methods: On April 6, 2020, we systematically reviewed official COVID-19Crelated data from 32 European countries. We included countries that provided data regarding more than 10 COVID-19Crelated deaths stratified by age according to pre-specified age groups (i.e., <40, 40C69, 70 years). We used random-effects meta-analysis to summarize the data. Results: Thirteen European countries were included in the review, for a total of 31,864 COVID-19Crelated deaths (range: 27C14,381 per country). In the main meta-analysis (including data from Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland; 21,522 COVID-19Crelated fatalities), the summary proportions of individuals <40, 40C69, and 70 years old among all COVID-19Crelated deaths were 0.1% (0.0C0.2; I(2) 28.6%), 13.0% (10.8C15.4; I(2) 91.5%), and 86.6% (84.2C88.9; I(2) 91.5%), respectively.

Based on this the study objectives are framed to determine the various dimensions of employee loyalty, the impact of wage recession on loyalty and problems faced by employees those who work from home. The study population is college teachers and ITians. In these two sectors adopted a change in their working mode (i.e work from home) and faced wage recession. ITians don't face many issues since it is not new for them but for the teaching community, work from home is an entirely new concept. Teachers try to learn to work in a new platform like google meet, zoom app, cisco Webex meet and give assignments online and conduct exams in virtual mode, leading them to prepare themselves for a changing environment. The work from home created more stress for teachers but for ITians the family intervention and network issues created more stress. Apart from these issues, the employer also reduces the payment from 10% to 50%. Both are the major contributors of employee loyalty. A questionnaire was designed based on the suggestions of HR managers. The data was collected through the virtual mode from 96 professors and 74 ITians in and around Chennai. We measured the key factors which affect employee loyalty like salary, treatment by organization, career focus, job involvement, job satisfaction, wellbeing and work recognition. The study findings revealed that pay reduction does not affect loyalty much. Lack of communication creates more work stress among the employees. This virtual mode of working increased more working hours and responsibility but poor recognition by employers. Our study results reveal that most of the respondents have moderate loyalty and if the work of employees continues to be unrecognized which may decrease the loyalty in future.","output":"Impactof COVID19 pandemic on thelivelihoodof employees in different sectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has inflicted disastrous damages on various aspects of human lives, especially the healthcare sector.

We explored and collected five published and one unpublished single-cell respiratory system tissue transcriptome datasets, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), aging lungs (mouse origin data), lung cancers, and smoked branchial epithelium, for specifically reanalyzing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression profiles. Compared to normal people, we found that smoking and lung cancer increase the risk for COVID-19 infection due to a higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung cells. Aged lung does not show increased risk for infection. IPF patients may have a lower risk for original COVID-19 infection due to lower expression in AT2 cells but may have a higher risk for severity due to a broader expression spectrum of TMPRSS2. Further investigation and validation on these cell types are required.

The objective of our multi-rater study was to compare intra- and inter-rater variability of PV from manual planimetry and ellipsoid formulas. METHODS: Forty treatment-naive patients who underwent prostate MRI were selected from a local database. PV and corresponding PSA density (PSAd) were estimated on 3D T2-weighted MRI (3 T) by 7 independent radiologists using the traditional ellipsoid formula (TEF), the newer biproximate ellipsoid formula (BPEF), and the manual planimetry method (MPM) used as ground truth. Intra- and inter-rater variability was calculated using the mixed model-based intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Mean volumes were 67.00 ( 36.61), 66.07 ( 35.03), and 64.77 ( 38.27) cm3 with the TEF, BPEF, and MPM methods, respectively. Both TEF and BPEF overestimated PV relative to MPM, with the former presenting significant differences (+ 1.91 cm3, IQ = [- 0.33 cm3, 5.07 cm3], p val = 0.03). Both intra- (ICC > 0.90) and inter-rater (ICC > 0.90) reproducibility were excellent. MPM had the highest inter-rater reproducibility (ICC = 0.999). Inter-rater PV variation led to discrepancies in classification according to the clinical criterion of PSAd > 0.15 ng/mL for 2 patients (5%), 7 patients (17.5%), and 9 patients (22.5%) when using MPM, TEF, and BPEF, respectively. CONCLUSION: PV measurements using ellipsoid formulas and MPM are highly reproducible. MPM is a robust method for PV assessment and PSAd calculation, with the lowest variability. TEF showed a high degree of concordance with MPM but a slight overestimation of PV. Precise anatomic landmarks as defined with the BPEF led to a more accurate PV estimation, but also to a higher variability. KEY POINTS: a? Manual planimetry used for prostate volume estimation is robust and reproducible, with the lowest variability between readers. a? Ellipsoid formulas are accurate and reproducible but with higher variability between readers. a?

The obstruction may be thrombotic or non-thrombotic anywhere along the venous course from the hepatic venules to the inferior vena cava (IVC) junction to the right atrium. In clinical practice, cases can be misdiagnosed, particularly in regions where resources are limited, unless the clinician pays special attention to such diagnosis. CASE REPORT AND CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Here, we would like to present a misdiagnosed case of Budd Chiari syndrome. This reported case is a case of 30 years old female patient complaining of dull abdominal pain and swelling. Initially, the patient consulted a local health facility where the patient was diagnosed with tuberculous peritonitis and subsequently treated with an anti-TB regimen empirically. Within a few days of taking medicine, she developed mild jaundice and lower limb edema. At this stage, the patient came to us, which after taking history, her physical examination unveiled mild jaundice, ascites, abdominal tenderness, and mild lower limb petting edema. The patient was recommended an abdominal CT scan with contrast, which revealed early enhancement and enlargement of the caudate lobe and non-opacification of hepatic veins with narrowing of the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava consistent with Budd-Chiari syndrome. The patient was started on warfarin and referred for a hepatic decongestive procedure. After four months of performing a transjugular portosystemic shunt, the patient came to us for follow-up. She had an excellent clinical improvement and was started on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily orally.

Findings were analysed using t tests, regressions and comparisons to large clinical and non-clinical samples assessed before and during the pandemic. Results show that healthcare professionals were most affected by protective measures at their workplace and changes in work procedures. Psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression, were significantly more severe than in a non-clinical pre-pandemic sample and in the general population during the pandemic.

The radiolabeled pPSP.FP2 probe detected both TGEV and PRCV in virus-inoculated cell cultures, whereas pPSP.FP1 probe detected TGEV but not PRCV. The probe was then used to detect TGEV or PRCV in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV or naturally infected with TGEV. Again, the probes detected TGEV in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and PRCV in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs. TGEV RNA was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and, less often, within some crypt epithelial cells. PRCV was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively.

While the organic nature of the data offer new opportunities, the limited understanding of how and by whom the data are generated poses a challenge for advancing health-related research. Individual-level data linkage could shed light into the data generation mechanism. OBJECTIVES This paper investigates whether consent to link survey data with Twitter public data is associated with sociodemographic and Twitter use pattern factors and whether consenters and non-consenters differ on health-related outcomes. METHODS Data from three health related surveys that use probability samples of the target population were used: 1) A college population web survey in KU Leuven University, 2) An adult population web survey of the US population, and 3) A population face-to-face survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In all surveys, respondents reported whether they have a Twitter account, and Twitter users were asked to provide consent for linking their survey responses to their public Twitter data. RESULTS Consent rate estimates from the two web surveys in Belgium and the US were 24% and 27% respectively. The face-to-face survey in KSA yielded a higher consent rate of 45%. In general, respondents' sociodemographic characteristics were not significantly associated with consent to link. However, more use of social media and reporting sensitive information in the survey were found to be significantly correlated with higher consent. Consenters and non-consenters were not found to be statistically different on any of the health related measures. CONCLUSIONS Very few differences were found between those who consented to link their survey data with their Twitter public data and those who did not.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western Africa was defined in accordance with the United Nations' delineation and inclusive of 16 countries. A literature search for publications detailing the number of cobalt-60 machines (COs) and linear accelerators (LINACs) in radiotherapy centres was carried out. Population data from the World Bank Group and crude cancer rates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer were used to calculate ratios of million persons per MVM and MVMs per 1000 cancer cases. RESULTS: The numbers of MVMs in Western Africa in 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2009 were zero, two, three, six and nine, respectively. In 2019 there were 22 MVMs distributed across Ghana (five), C?te d'Ivoire (two), Mali (one), Mauritania (two), Nigeria (nine) and Senegal (three). Nine countries (56.3%) had no history of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The largest increase in absolute EBRT capacity occurred from 2017 to 2019, during which 13 MVMs were commissioned. The largest decrease in EBRT capacity occurred from 2015 to 2017, during which four LINACs and three COs were rendered non-operational. The ratio of million persons per MVM improved from 67.0 in 1979 to 17.8 in 2019. As of 2019, there was 0.09 MVM per 1000 cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: Western African nations have experienced an increase in the absolute number of MVMs and per capita radiotherapy capacity during the last 50 years, especially in the last decade.

Currently, there is very little research on mental health outcomes for young children. OBJECTIVES: To describe the formation of a global collaboration entitled, COVID-19 Unmasked. The collaborating researchers aim to (1) describe and compare the COVID-19 related experiences within and across countries; (2) examine mental health outcomes for young children (1 to 5 years) and caregivers over a 12-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) explore the trajectories/time course of psychological outcomes of the children and parents over this period and (4) identify the risk and protective factors for different mental health trajectories. Data will be combined from all participating countries into one large open access cross-cultural dataset to facilitate further international collaborations and joint publications. METHODS: COVID-19 Unmasked is an online prospective longitudinal cohort study. An international steering committee was formed with the aim of starting a global collaboration. Currently, partnerships have been formed with 9 countries (Australia, Cyprus, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the United States of America). Research partners have started to start data collection with caregivers of young children aged 1C5 years old at baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months. Caregivers are invited to complete an online survey about COVID-19 related exposure and experiences, childs wellbeing, their own mental health, and parenting. DATA ANALYSIS: Primary study outcomes will be child mental health as assessed by scales from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System C Early Childhood (PROMIS-EC) and caregiver mental health as assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). The trajectories/time course of mental health difficulties and the impact of risk and protective factors will be analysed using hierarchical linear models, accounting for nested effects (e.g. country) and repeated measures.","output":"COVID-19 Unmasked Global Collaboration Protocol: longitudinal cohort study examining mental health of young children and caregivers during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with stroke are likely to experience impaired health-related quality of life (QOL), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With the aid of the protein database, structural modelling yielded a testable scientific hypothesis on viral entry to host cells. Simultaneously, annotations for locations and collection dates suggested that the variant virus emerged somewhere in the world in approximately February 2020, entered the USA and propagated nationwide with periodic sampling fluctuation likely due to an approximately 5-day incubation delay. Thus, public database annotations are useful for automated elucidation of the early spreading patterns in relation to human behaviours, which should provide objective reference for local governments for social decision making to contain emerging substrains.

Network analysis can provide a useful method for evaluating and comparing these symptom structures. The present study includes 7034 participants from 86 countries who reported on mental health symptoms associated with either a COVID-19-related PTE (n= 1838) or other PTE (n= 5196).

Findings provide evidence for a shared centrality of depression across networks and theoretically consistent connections between symptoms. Network differences included stronger connections between avoidance-derealization and hypervigilance-depression in the COVID-19 network. Present findings support the conceptualization of psychological responses to pandemic-related PTEs as a network of highly interconnected symptoms and support the use of a transdiagnostic approach to the assessment and treatment of mental health challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) were used to measure the expression level of miR-16-3p, miR-16-5p, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 4 (PTPN4), and autophagy-related proteins (beclin-1, LC3 II/I, and P26) in AC16 cells. The apoptosis level of AC16 cells in each group was measured by flow cytometry and TUNEL. The dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment was also used to verify the targeting relationship between miR-16-5p and PTPN4. Results After H/R treatment, the levels of myocardial injury markers including LDH and CK-MB in AC16 cells were increased significantly (P < 0.05), and the levels of cell apoptosis and autophagy also increased significantly (P < 0.05). The level of miR-16-3p in AC16 cells did not change significantly after H/R treatment, whereas the level of miR-16-5p was increased significantly (P < 0.05). After miR-16-5p was knocked down, the levels of LDH and CK-MB in AC16 cells treated with H/R were significantly reduced (P < 0.05), and the rates of cell apoptosis and autophagy were also significantly reduced (P < 0.05). miR-16-5p negatively regulated the expression level of PTPN4 protein in AC16 cells (P < 0.05), and the dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment confirmed that PTPN4 was the downstream target of miR-16-5p. Silencing of PTPN4 significantly increased the damage of AC16 cells induced by H/R treatment (P < 0.05), but simultaneously inhibiting the expression of PTPN4 and miR-16-5p reversed the protective effect of miR-16-5p knockdown on AC16 cells (P < 0.05).

As an organism ages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined performance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease and death. In this study we develop a mathematical framework of coupled innate and adaptive immune responses, namely the integrated immune branch (IIB) model. This model describes dynamics of immune components in both branches, uses a shape-space representation to encode pathogen-specific immune memory, and exhibits three steady states health, septic death, and chronic inflammation qualitatively similar to clinically-observed immune outcomes. In this model, the immune system (initialized in the health state) is subjected to a sequence of pathogen encounters, and we use the number of prior pathogen encounters as a proxy for the age of the immune system. We find that repeated pathogen encounters may trigger a fragility in which any encounter with a novel pathogen will cause the system to irreversibly switch from health to chronic inflammation. This transition is consistent with the onset of inflammaging, a condition observed in aged individuals who experience chronic low-grade inflammation even in the absence of pathogens. The IIB model predicts that the onset of chronic inflammation strongly depends on the history of encountered pathogens; the timing of onset differs drastically when the same set of infections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the innate and adaptive immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen clearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence. Overall, by considering the complex feedback between immune compartments, our work suggests potential mechanisms for immunosenescence and provides a theoretical framework at the system level and on the scale of an organisms lifetime to account for clinical observations.","output":"Aging-induced fragility of the immune system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To prospectively investigate the incidence of post-lung radiofrequency (RF) ablation fever as well as its associated factors, according to the grade of fever.

Post-ablation fever ( 37.0C) was graded according to the common toxicity criteria of adverse events v. 4.0. Fever  37.0C and <38.0C was defined as grade 0 fever. The 67 RF sessions were divided into two groups according to the presence of post-ablation fever, and the factors associated with fever were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Subsequently, the RF sessions accompanied by post-ablation fever were further divided into two groups according to the grade of fever (grade 0 vs. grade  1), and the factors associated with the grade of fever were determined. RESULTS Grade 0, 1, and 2 fever accompanied 36 (54%), 11 (16%), and 2 (3%) sessions, respectively. Post-ablation fever was significantly associated with larger ablated parenchymal volume (P=0.001) and development of pulmonary infiltration (P=0.004).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of delivering a web-based intervention for dementia caregivers by examining: 1) engagement with the online platform, 2) skill implementation, and 3) changes on outcome metrics over the 30-day study period. METHODS: Enrolled participants were onboarded by a trained research coordinator and provided 24/7 access to the platform over 30 days. At study onset and completion, caregivers completed assessments of care recipient dementia severity and neuropsychiatric symptoms along with instruments which measured dementia knowledge, caregiver burden, and carer experience. RESULTS: Of 84 referrals, 60 caregivers met study inclusion criteria and 55 completed pre and post study measures. Caregivers completed an average of 8 hours of learning over the 30-day web-based intervention, with 84.4%of participants reporting using at least one skill they learned from the online platform. Eighty-nine percent of participants reported high satisfaction with the web-based educational intervention. There were small effect sizes for decreases in NPIQ neuropsychiatric symptom severity and caregiver distress scores from pre- to post-intervention. Small effect sizes were observed for changes in caregiver burden from pre- to post-intervention among caregivers who perceived their care recipient as having high global deterioration. CONCLUSION: Findings show online educational programs are feasible for informal family caregivers of dementia and have perceived value. Future studies should address caregiver response to online education in less severe versus more severe care recipients, and explore the value of caregiver online platforms in diverse caregiver samples.","output":"Caregiver Response to an Online Dementia and Caregiver Wellness Education Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research is uncovering the repercussions of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the mental and emotional state of various populations around the world.

We genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagSNPs from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and measles virus-specific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in Caucasians and African-Americans. Genetic variants within the DDX58/RIG-I gene, including a coding polymorphism (rs3205166/Val800Val), were associated as single-SNPs (p0.017; although these SNPs did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/FDR) and in haplotype-level analysis, with measles-specific antibody variations in Caucasians (haplotype allele p-value=0.021; haplotype global p-value=0.076). Four DDX58 polymorphisms, in high LD, demonstrated also associations (after correction for FDR) with variations in both measles-specific IFN- and IL-2 secretion in Caucasians (p0.001, q=0.193). Two intronic OAS1 polymorphisms, including the functional OAS1 SNP rs10774671 (p=0.003), demonstrated evidence of association with a significant allele-dose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in African-Americans. Genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of ADAR genetic variants, including a non-synonymous SNP (rs2229857/Arg384Lys; p=0.01), in regulating measles virus-specific IFN- Elispot responses in Caucasians (haplotype global p-value=0.017). After correction FDR, 15 single-SNP associations (11 SNPs in Caucasians and 4 SNPs in African-Americans) still remained significant at the q-value<0.20. In conclusion, our findings strongly point to genetic variants/genes, involved in antiviral sensing and antiviral control, as critical determinants, differentially modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated measles vaccine in Caucasians and African-Americans.","output":"Genetic Polymorphisms in Host Antiviral Genes: Associations with Humoral and Cellular Immunity to Measles Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTo determine if rurality, area deprivation, access to outside space (Study 1) and frequency of visiting and duration in green space (Study 2) are associated with mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic.DesignSerial, weekly, nationally representative, cross-sectional, observational study of randomly selected adults in Scotland during June and July 2020.MethodsIf available, validated instruments were used to measure psychological distress, individual demographics and illness beliefs and the following environments: rurality, area deprivation, access to residential outside space, frequency of visiting, and duration in green space.

We sought to describe the serological status of haemodialysis patients having received up to three doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, and to identify factors associated with a poor humoral response. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational study of patients attending a dialysis centre in Antibes, France. One or two of each patients monthly venous blood samples were assayed for antiCspike (S1) immunoglobulin G (IgG). RESULTS: We included 142 patients, of whom 124 remained COVID-19-negative throughout the study. Among these COVID-19-negative patients, the humoral immune response rate (defined as an anti-S1 IgG titre 1.2 U/ml) was 82.9% after two injections and 95.8% after three injections, and the median [interquartile range] titre increased significantly from 7.09 [2.21; 19.94] U/ml with two injections to 93.26 [34.25; 176.06] U/ml with three. Among patients with two injections, the mean body mass index and serum albumin levels were significantly higher in responders than in non-responders (26.5 kg/m(2) vs. 23.2 kg/m(2), p = 0.0392; and 41.9 g/l vs. 39.0 g/l, p = 0.0042, respectively).

Therefore, concerns have been raised over risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and poor prognosis of COVID-19 in persons with prior exposure to these drugs. This study aimed to systematically review available evidence for associations between exposure to RAAS inhibitors with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes in infected persons. It hopes to address the question on the effects of RAAS inhibitors on the risk of COVID-19 and its prognosis. MAIN BODY: Search was conducted in the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase and MedRxiv.org from December 2019 to May 31, 2020, using relevant keywords. Additional articles were identified through hand-searching of reference lists. Studies that reported associations between positive tests to COVID-19 and use of RAAS inhibitors, and treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients who had exposure to RAAS inhibitors were considered eligible. The NewcastleCOttawa scale was used to assess risk of bias in individual studies. The review was conducted in line with Preferred Regulatory Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines 2009. From the 952 studies screened and 2 studies from reference hand-searching, 18 were reviewed. Four studies evaluated the risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection among RAAS inhibitors users, and 16 (including 2 of the 4 studies) evaluated the clinical outcomes associated with previous exposure to RAAS inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Evidence does not suggest higher risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection or poor disease prognosis in the use of RAAS inhibitors. This suggests the continued use of RAAS inhibitors by patients with existing needs, which supports the position statements of American Heart Association and European societies for Cardiology.

The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into 0-7, 8-15 and >= 16 groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection.

Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of this ease-of-use IgG/IgM combined test kit were adequate, plus short turnaround time, no specific requirements for additional equipment or skilled technicians, all of these collectively contributed to its competence for mass testing. At the current stage, it cannot take the place of SARA-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR, but can be served as a complementary option for RT-PCR.

However, owing to the lack of photothermal nanoagents with high photothermal conversion efficiency, NIR-II-driven PTT still suffers from poor efficiency and subsequent cancer recurrence. In this work, we show a new and highly efficient preparation approach for NIR-II photothermal nanoagents and tailor ultrathin layered double hydroxide (LDH)-supported Ag@Ag2O core-shell nanoparticles (Ag@Ag2O/LDHs-U), vastly improving NIR-II photothermal performance. A combination study (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) verifies that ultrafine Ag@Ag2O core-shell nanoparticles (a3.8 nm) are highly dispersed and firmly immobilized within ultrathin LDH nanosheets, and their Ag2O shell possesses abundant vacancy-type defects. These unique Ag@Ag2O/LDHs-U display an impressive photothermal conversion efficiency as high as 76.9% at 1064 nm. Such an excellent photothermal performance is likely attributed to the enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupling effect between Ag and Ag2O and the reduced band gap caused by vacancy-type defects in the Ag2O shell. Meanwhile, Ag@Ag2O/LDHs-U also show prominent photothermal stability, due to the unique supported core-shell nanostructure. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that Ag@Ag2O/LDHs-U possess good biocompatible properties and outstanding PTT therapeutic efficacy in the NIR-II region. This research shows a new strategy in the rational design and preparation of an efficient photothermal agent, which is helpful to achieve more accurate and effective cancer theranostics.","output":"Ultrathin Nanosheet-Supported Ag@Ag2O Core-Shell Nanoparticles with Vastly Enhanced Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for NIR-II-Triggered Photothermal Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For every suicide on the British railway network, at least six potential attempts are interrupted by front-line staff or rail commuters. However, the factors that maximise or hinder the likelihood and effectiveness of such interventions are poorly understood. AIMS: The aim of the current study was to shed light on the experience of intervening to prevent a suicide at a railway location, including how and why people intervene, and their feelings and reflections in the aftermath. METHOD: In-depth interviews were carried out with rail commuters (n = 11) and front-line railway staff (n = 10) who had intervened to stop a suicide by train. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Participants had intervened to prevent suicide in several ways, both from afar (e.g. by calling a member of staff) and more directly (verbally or non-verbally), in some cases with no prior training or experience in suicide prevention, and often as a quick, gut reaction given the limited time to intervene. In more reasoned interventions, poor confidence and concerns around safety were the greatest barriers to action. Although often privy to their final outcome, most participants reflected positively on their intervention/s, stressing the importance of training and teamwork, as well as small talk and non-judgemental listening. CONCLUSIONS: Suicides in railway environments can present bystanders with little time to intervene.

This ongoing pandemic has resulted in the death of millions of people globally. About one and a half thousand people have died due to this illness in Ethiopia. The clinical presentations of the disease vary with geography and populations. We therefore aimed at investigating the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in North-East Ethiopia. Methods: real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted for 18,112 individuals suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection during June 27 to October 20, 2020, at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center. Recorded data of 372 Ethiopians who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center were retrospectively extracted and analyzed using SPSS v25.0. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: nearly 2.1% of the screened participants were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, three fourth of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were male, with an overall median age of 30 years. About 85% of the patients were asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were cough (14.2%), followed by fever (11.0%) and headache (8.6%), whereas hypertension (1.6%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1.6%) diabetes mellitus (1.1%), and chronic respiratory diseases (1.1%) were relatively the most common comorbidities noted. The case-fatality ratio was found at 1.6%. Age and underlying comorbidities had a statistically significant association with severity and poor outcome of patients (P < 0.001). Conclusion: the finding from this study indicated that older age and people with underlying comorbidities are at high risk of having the severe disease and poor outcomes. Hence, appropriate care and priority should be given to these people to decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by this illness. The presence of higher asymptomatic infection is the possible indicator of potential asymptomatic transmissions within the community.

As part of a COVID-19 Recovery Engagement program, we aimed to 1) elucidate the type and trajectory of protracted symptoms after COVID-19 diagnosis and 2) compare symptom prevalence and severity at 1, 3 and 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: This is a prospective observational study of adults diagnosed with COVID-19 at Montefiore Medical Center from March 2020 to December 2020. We identified patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 result who were recently treated in outpatient, Emergency Department, or hospital settings within the medical center. Patients were contacted for consent via telephone at 1, 3, and 6 months after diagnosis and asked to complete 1) a modified revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment (mrESAS), which assessed 13 symptoms on a scale of 0-10 and 2) three additional questions that asked patients to compare their physical, emotional and cognitive health status to their pre-COVID health state. We used chart review to gather additional data for each of the patients, including demographics, past medical history, and course of COVID-19 illness.Results: We enrolled 141 patients (mean (standard deviation (SD) age 49.5(16.9)], with 29 in the 1-month cohort, 22 in 3-month cohort, and 90 in 6-month cohort;46/141 (32.6%) were hospitalized. In patients in the 1-month cohort, there was a high ( 25% of patients) prevalence of 7/13 symptoms: pain (31%), fatigue (31%), sleepiness (30.3%), nausea (30.3%), change in taste (31%), breathlessness (27.6%) and anxiety (37.9%). In general, prevalence of symptoms was lower in patients at 3- month and 6-months after discharge. We found a higher prevalence of nausea and change of taste symptoms in the 1-month group compared with the 3- and 6-month group (10% at 1-month reported nausea vs 1.8% in 3- and 6-month cohorts, p= 0.026;31% at 1-month reported change in taste vs. 10.7 in the 3- and 6-month groups, p=0.006 for change of taste). Furthermore, in the 6-month cohort, 24.4%, 25.6% and 30% reported being worse than pre-COVID in their physical, emotional and cognitive health status, respectively. Conclusion: Patients at 1-month post-COVID experience more nausea and taste change than patients called at later time points after diagnosis.

However, there exists inter-observer variability due to subtle differences in the imaging features of tumor subtypes, which makes decisions on treatment challenging. While deep learning has been recently applied to the automated diagnosis of renal tumor, classification of a wide range of subtype classes has not been sufficiently studied yet. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model for the differential diagnosis of five major histologic subtypes of renal tumors including both benign and malignant tumors on multi-phase CT. Our model is a unified framework to simultaneously identify lesions and classify subtypes for the diagnosis without manual intervention. We trained and tested the model using CT data from 308 patients who underwent nephrectomy for renal tumors. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.889, and outperformed radiologists for most subtypes. We further validated the model on an independent dataset of 184 patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The AUC for this dataset was 0.855, and the model performed comparably to the radiologists.

At child age 2 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained, at age 3 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained and at age 5 years, 299 (69%) participants were retained. Fieldwork for follow-up at age 7 years is underway, with funding available for follow-up at age 9 years. FINDINGS TO DATE: At baseline, 53% of mothers were aged 14C24 years and 72% had high school or less educational attainment. At age 3 years, dental disease experience was higher among children exposed to the intervention later rather than earlier in infancy. The effect was sustained at age 5 years, but rates were still higher than general child population estimates. Experiences of racism were high among mothers, with impacts on both tooth brushing and toothache. Compared with population estimates, levels of self-efficacy and self-rated oral health of mothers at baseline were low. FUTURE PLANS: Our data have contributed to a better understanding of the environmental, behavioural, dietary, biological and psychosocial factors contributing to Aboriginal child oral and general health, and social and emotional well-being. This is beneficial in charting the trajectory of cohort participants health and well-being overtime, particularly in identifying antecedents of chronic diseases which are highly prevalent among Aboriginal Australians.

Acute care hospitals around the world have needed to develop ways to conserve dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) while front-line clinicians struggle to reduce risk of exposure. By placing intravenous smart pumps (IVSP) outside patient rooms, nurses can more quickly attend to alarms, rate adjustments and bag changes with reduced personal risk and without the delay of donning necessary PPE to enter the room. The lengthy tubing required to place IVSP outside of patient rooms comes with important clinical implications which increase the risk to patient safety for the already error-prone intravenous medication administration process. This article focuses on the implications of increasing medication dead volume as intravenous tubing lengths increase. The use of extended intravenous tubing will lead to higher medication volumes held in the tubing which comes with significant safety implications related to unintended alterations in drug delivery. Safe intravenous medication administration is a collaborative responsibility across the team of nurses, pharmacists and ordering providers.

However, partly due to damages associated with the pandemic and the ensuing euphoria over vaccines arrival, some of the challenges are mostly being ignored or not recognized. This paper identifies some pitfalls and drawbacks in vaccine delivery. We argue that the somewhat unique tension between the speed of vaccine delivery and its scale can create opportunities for corrupt behavior that are often at odds with effective means to check abuse. While data on instances of abuse will emerge over time, it is useful to point out different avenues of abuse so that some preventive government actions can be undertaken. Specifically, we argue that the potential for out of turn delivery of vaccines and the stockpiling by unauthorized agents creates incentives for corruption, with the public or bureaucrats initiating corrupt transactions. An understanding of the potential avenues for corruption should guide the formulation of appropriate corruption-control policies and similar challenges that will be faced by policy makers in addressing future pandemics.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine rollout C scale and speed carry different implications for corruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I use an unbalanced panel of over 11,000 academic records spanning from Spring 2017 to Spring 2020 to identify the difference in effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across lower- and higher-income students academic performance.

While no such GPA advantage is observed among top-performing lower-income students, in the absence of the flexible grading policy these students would have seen their GPA decrease by 5% relative to their counterfactual pre-pandemic mean.

For influenza A virus infections, both oral amantadine and rimantadine are effectvive when used for seasonal prophylaxis and for prophylaxis in institutional populations.

It remains to be determined whether any of these modalities or possibly their combined use [44] will be useful in treating severe influenza in hospitalized patients or whether they can prevent the development of complications in high risk patients. Unfortunately, there is no parenteral formulation of amantadine or rimantadine for use in critically in patients. Aerosolized ribavirin has also been shown to have modest therapeutic effects in influenza B virus infection. However, a major need exists for an antiviral which is active against influenza B virus and which can be used on an outpatient basis. Controlled clinical trials have shown that aerosolized ribavirin therapy improves arterial oxygenation and modifies the severity fo respiratory syncytil virus bronchiolitis and pneumonia [3,5]. Its role in treatinglife-threatening disease or in dodifying the long-term sequelae of RSV infections are unknown at the present time. Again, a specific antiviral agent is needed for out-patient use in preventing or treating RSV infections.

We designed and administered a global survey to examine the impact of COVID-19 on vascular surgeons and explore the COVID-19 related stressors faced, coping strategies employed, and support structures available METHODS: The Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons is an anonymous cross-sectional survey sponsored by the Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Committee. The survey analysis evaluates the impact of COVID-19 related stressors on vascular surgeons as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale. The 28-item Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) inventory was used to assess the active and avoidant coping strategies. Survey data were collected using REDCap between 4/14/2020 and 4/24/2020 inclusive. Additional qualitative data were collected using open-ended questions. Univariable and multivariable analysis of factors associated with anxiety levels and qualitative analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1,609 survey responses (70.5% male, 82.5% Vascular Surgeons in Practice) from 58 countries (43.4% United States, 43.4% Brazil) were eligible for analysis. Some degree of anxiety was reported by 54.5% of the respondents and 23.3% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Most respondents (60%) used active coping strategies and the avoidant coping strategy self-distraction and 20% used other avoidant coping strategies. Multivariable analysis identified the following factors as significantly associated with increased self-reported anxiety levels: staying in a separate room at home or staying at the hospital/hotel after work (OR 1.39 (95%CI 1.08-1.79), donning/doffing personal protective equipment (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.41-2.33), worry about potential adverse patient outcomes due to care delay (OR 1.47, 95%CI 1.16-1.87), and financial Concerns (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.49-2.42). Factors significantly associated with decreased self-reported anxiety levels were hospital support (OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.76-0.91) and use of positive reframing as an active coping strategy (OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.81-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgeons globally are experiencing multiple COVID-19 related stressors during this devastating crisis. These findings highlight the continued need for hospital systems to support their vascular surgeons and the importance of national societies to continue to invest in peer support programs as paramount to promoting the well-being of vascular surgeons during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Global vascular surgeons experience, stressors, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously, we modelled the X-ray spectra of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 13224$-$3809 using a disc reflection model with a fixed electron density of $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$.

Virions were mixed with liposomes along with the ectodomain of one of three gD receptors (HVEMt, nectin-1t, or nectin-2t) and incubated under different pH and temperature conditions. Virions failed to associate with liposomes in the presence of nectin-1 or nectin-2 at any temperature or pH tested. In contrast, HVEMt triggered association of HSV with liposomes at pH 5.3 or 5.0 when incubated at 37 degrees C, suggesting that HVEM binding and mildly acidic pH at a physiological temperature provide coactivation signals, allowing virus association with membranes. Virions incubated with HVEMt at 37 degrees C without liposomes rapidly lost infectivity upon exposure to pH 5.0, suggesting that these conditions lead to irreversible virus inactivation in the absence of target membranes. Consistent with the idea that soluble receptor molecules provide a trigger for HSV entry, HVEMt promoted virus entry into receptor-deficient CHO K1 cells. However, in B78H1 cells, HVEMt promoted virus entry with markedly lower efficiency. Interestingly, HSV entry into receptor-bearing CHO K1 cells has been shown to proceed via a pH-dependent manner, whereas HSV entry into receptor-bearing B78H1 cells is pH independent. Based on these observations, we propose that the changes triggered by HVEM and mildly acidic pH that allow liposome association are similar or identical to changes that occur during pH-dependent HSV entry.","output":"Stable association of herpes simplex virus with target membranes is triggered by low pH in the presence of the gD receptor, HVEM."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: There is a paucity of guidance regarding implementation of telemedicine curricula at the clerkship level, particularly with students actively engaged in video and telephone encounters. The COVID-19 pandemic caused rapid shifts in the delivery of medical education to clerkship-level students.

APPROACH: All 18 preceptors and 5 students at Stanford University School of Medicine, California, enrolled in the required 4-week family medicine clerkship in April 2020 were connected as virtual partners via a commercial video platform. The combined use of both this video program and Epic electronic health record (EHR) software as modes for teaching and patient care led to technical challenges and logistical hurdles. As part of an iterative process, clerkship leadership identified problems via preceptor and student interviews and integrated that feedback in order to create a model for delivering high-quality, clerkship-level clinical instruction during the COVID-19 shelter in place order.

This situation arises considering that the disaster can directly and indirectly affect the healthcare system s capacity to serve the COVID-19 cases. With severely damaged healthcare facilities due to the disaster, there will be severely ill COVID-19 cases unmanaged. The coupling and interplay between these two phenomena can indeed be catastrophic. One of the regions where this issue becomes concerned is in Southeast Asia, where most of the Asian countries lie in the fragile ring of fire ecosystem, contributing to the high tsunami and earthquake disasters in the world. At the same time, Asia is one of the regions that have been severely impacted due to the current COVID-19 Delta Variant. Recently, a more contagious Omicron Variant has emerged and put a more massive burden on the healthcare facilities that are impacted by disasters. Then, in this situation, this paper aims to assess healthcare resilience in managing the Omicron pandemic amid disaster impacts. SIR simulation was used to determine whether severely ill Omicron cases were below or above healthcare and ICU capacity under different vaccination coverage. Our result confirms that vaccination coverage was the imminent factor in reducing the severely ill cases in every healthcare facility, whether the facilities were damaged or not. Increasing vaccination coverage from 30% to 60% will significantly reduce the number of severely ill cases that fall below the capacity of healthcare. Based on the current SIR model on the Omicron epidemic variables and Ro, it is estimated that the Omicron will reach its peak after 180 days in February 2022 and will totally disappear in May 2022 in this modeled area. When healthcare system facilities were fully operational and no disaster happened, combined with 60% vaccination rates, all Omicron case numbers were below and under the available hospital beds and even available ICU beds. While the situation is changed when a disaster occurs and causes 30% damage or reduction to healthcare facilities. In this situation, there are portions of Omicron cases that cannot be managed by the healthcare system since the cases have exceeded the available beds. The situations become more apparent where the healthcare facilities are severely damaged and lose 60% of their functionality.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy) is a possible cause of transient ST segment elevation (1C3% of total cases) and is characterized by a reversible left ventricular dysfunction with coronary arteries free from critical stenosis. The predominant echocardiographic pattern of this cardiomyopathy is an akinesia of the mid-apical myocardial segments (apical ballooning), with preserved kinetics of the basal segments. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy showed a marked increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that three factors mainly contribute to the onset of cardiomyopathy in patients with COVID-19: cytokine storm, adrenergic hyperactivation and microvascular dysfunction.

The combined impact of such developments has been an erasure of basic rights to life and livelihood for the poor, rooted not only in state incapacity but also in state acquiring impunity for its acts of coercion and violence against its own citizens. Many of these processes have come into stark focus during the Covid-19 pandemic, but have longer histories and are likely to have impact far beyond the pandemic.

EAD and IAD represent leading causes of stroke in the young, but are uncommon in the general population, thus making it challenging to conduct clinical trials and large observational studies. The guidelines were prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for European Stroke Organisation guidelines and according to GRADE methodology. Our four recommendations result from a thorough analysis of the literature comprising two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anticoagulants to antiplatelets in the acute phase of ischemic stroke and twenty-six comparative observational studies. In EAD patients with acute ischemic stroke, we recommend using intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset if standard inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, and mechanical thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation. We further recommend early endovascular or surgical intervention for IAD patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Based on evidence from two phase 2 RCTs that have shown no difference between the benefits and risks of anticoagulants versus antiplatelets in the acute phase of symptomatic EAD, we strongly recommend that clinicians can prescribe either option. In post-acute EAD patients with residual stenosis or dissecting aneurysms and in symptomatic IAD patients with an intracranial dissecting aneurysm and isolated headache, there is insufficient data to provide a recommendation on the benefits and risks of endovascular/surgical treatment. Finally, nine expert consensus statements, adopted by 8 to 11 of the 11 experts involved, propose guidance for clinicians when the quality of evidence was too low to provide recommendations. Some of these pertain to the management of IAD (use of IVT, endovascular treatment, and antiplatelets versus anticoagulation in IAD with ischemic stroke and use of endovascular or surgical interventions for IAD with headache only). Other expert consensus statements address the use of direct anticoagulants and dual antiplatelet therapy in EAD-related cerebral ischemia, endovascular treatment of the EAD/IAD lesion, and multidisciplinary assessment of the best therapeutic approaches in specific situations.","output":"ESO guideline for the management of extracranial and intracranial artery dissection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse both the impact of the pandemic and clinical and teaching organisation in Spanish Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Departments during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: A survey was conducted of the tutors of rehabilitation departments The questionnaire contained 31 questions divided into 6 parts about the following: general information on the department, adaptation of rehabilitation departments to the COVID pandemic, clinical work of rehabilitation physicians, the approach to rehabilitation in COVID patients, and the effects of the pandemic on the health and teaching activity of rehabilitation physicians during this period RESULTS: A total of 54 responses were obtained Almost half of the departments cancelled face-to-face medical consultations (40%) and 48% of the treatment rooms were turned into COVID beds In 30 hospitals (55 6%), the physicians worked in COVID units Most of the rehabilitation departments developed both graphic and audiovisual material with exercises, referral protocols and guidelines for the rehabilitation management and treatment of COVID 19 patients Half of the departments reported some anxiety symptoms in medical staff Tutorial work has been cancelled (40 7%) or reduced (35 2%) CONCLUSIONS: The organisation of Spanish rehabilitation departments in response to the COVID pandemic has been very similar throughout the country The response of these departments to the healthcare crisis has revealed the versatility of rehabilitation physicians","output":"Fighting against COVID-19: clinical activities of spanish rehabilitation physicians: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantum computing holds significant potential for applications in biology and medicine, spanning from the simulation of biomolecules to machine learning approaches for subtyping cancers on the basis of clinical features.

This study involved developing and validating a multiplex suspension immunoassay on the Luminex platform to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid and spike (S) proteins, and the spike proteins S1 and S2 subunits and receptor binding domain. Multiple versions of these recombinant proteins acquired from commercial and noncommercial sources were evaluated. Assay development and validation utilized saliva and serum samples from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases procured from commercial sources and negative controls from a prepandemic survey. Saliva was also collected in a demonstration survey by mail involving adult individuals in the United States who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection 15 to 80 days prior to sample collection. The survey had an 83% valid sample return rate (192 samples from 38 states). Most COVID-19 cases (93%) reported mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. The final salivary assay based on the best-performing spike and nucleocapsid proteins had a sensitivity of 87.1% (95% bootstrap confidence interval, 82.1 to 91.7%) and specificity of 98.5% (95.0 to 100%) using 227 and 285 saliva samples, respectively. The same assay had 95.9% (92.8 to 98.9%) sensitivity and 100% (98.4 to 100%) specificity in serum (174 and 285 serum samples, respectively). Salivary and serum antibody responses to spike and nucleocapsid proteins were strongly correlated in 22 paired samples (r = 0.88 and r = 0.80, respectively). Antibody responses peaked at approximately 50 days postonset; greater illness severity was associated with stronger responses. This study demonstrated that a salivary antibody assay can be used in large-scale population surveys by mail to better characterize public health impacts of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Given the enormous impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, developing tools for population surveillance of infection is of paramount importance. This article describes the development of a multiplex immunoassay on a Luminex platform to measure salivary immunoglobulin G responses to the spike protein, its two subunits and receptor binding domain, and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. The assay validation utilized serum and saliva samples from prepandemic controls and recent COVID-19 cases. A survey by mail targeting recent COVID-19 cases across the United States also demonstrated the utility of safe, at-home self-collection of saliva. By incorporating multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, this assay may differentiate responses to natural SARS-CoV-2 infections from responses to most vaccines. Application of this noninvasive immunoassay in COVID-19 surveillance can help provide estimates of cumulative incidence rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in various communities and subpopulations, temporal patterns of antibody responses, and risk factors for infection.","output":"A Multiplex Noninvasive Salivary Antibody Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Its Application in a Population-Based Survey by Mail"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Empirical research investigating self-compassion is a rapidly developing field, and it is potentially crucial in early adolescence. The primary aim of the present study was to psychometrically evaluate the Persian translation of the Self-Compassion Scale Youth version (SCS-Y) and evaluate its factor structure among young adolescents. The second aim was to explore the buffering effect of self-compassion against the negative effect of difficulties in emotion regulation on COVID-19-related anxiety. METHODS: A sample of young students (n = 532; mean age 13.57 years) completed an online survey, which included the SCS-Y, Patient Health Questionnaire, Difficulties In Emotion Regulation Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Youth Life Orientation Test, Brief Resilience Scale, and Brief 10-Item Big Five Inventory. First-order (six-factor) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and bi-factor exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) analysis were used to evaluate the factor structure of the SCS-Y. RESULTS: Results showed that the SCS-Y had very good internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha coefficient: 0.88; McDonalds omega coefficient: 0.90), composite reliability (0.87), and adequate testCretest reliability after 4 weeks (0.60). The first-order (six-factor) CFA and bi-factor ESEM analysis demonstrated the SCS-Y had excellent dimensionality. Further analysis found negative associations between self-compassion with both depression and neuroticism, and positive associations between self-compassion with both resilience and optimism. Moreover, self-compassion moderated the association between emotion dysregulation and anxiety generated by the COVID-19. Overall, the findings indicated that the SCS-Y had acceptable criterion-related validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence that the SCS-Y is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the six factors of self-compassion among younger adolescents. Based on the studys findings, self-compassion appears to be a protective factor against mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic for younger adolescents.","output":"Psychometric Validation of the Persian Self-Compassion Scale Youth Version"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, several vaccines have been developed to mitigate its spread and prevent adverse consequences of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The mRNA technology is an unprecedented vaccine, usually given in two doses to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Despite effectiveness and safety, inter-individual immune response heterogeneity has been observed in recipients of mRNA-based vaccines. As a novel disease, the specific immune response mechanism responsible for warding off COVID-19 remains unclear at this point. However, significant evidence suggests that humoral response plays a crucial role in affording immunoprotection and preventing debilitating sequelae from COVID-19. As such this paper focused on the possible effects of age, sex, serostatus, and comorbidities on humoral response (i.e., total antibodies, IgG and/or IgA) of different populations post-mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. A systematic search of literature was performed through PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they reported humoral response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. A total of 32 studies was identified and reviewed, and the percent difference of means of reported antibody levels were calculated for comparison. Findings revealed that older individuals, the male sex, seronegativity, and those with more comorbidities mounted less humoral immune response. Given these findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the current vaccination practices. These include giving additional doses of vaccination for immunocompromised and elderly populations. Another recommendation is conducting clinical trials in giving a combined scheme of mRNA vaccines, protein vaccines, and vector-based vaccines.","output":"Effects of Age, Sex, Serostatus and Underlying Comorbidities on Humoral Response Post-SARS-CoV-2 Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccination: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes a cAMP-regulated anion channel.

The aim of this prospective study was to assess how breast cancer survivors (bCSs) perceived E-TFU. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 15-item survey was e-mailed to bCSs who had been managed with E-TFU. The responses were measured using Likert-like scales and were correlated with the main characteristics of the bCS using Pearson's test. RESULTS One hundred thirty-seven of 343 bCSs (40%) completed the survey between March 9 and June 2, 2020. Their median age was 59 years. Although 80.3% of bCSs were satisfied with E-TFU, only 43.8% would like to have E-TFU in the future. A low educational level was correlated with higher COVID-19-related anxiety (P = .025). An older age (P = .002) and a low educational level (P < .0001) were correlated with the need to be accompanied to reach the hospital. A personal history of second cancer was inversely correlated with understanding medical advice (P = .015) and the expectation of feeling relief after a follow-up visit (P = .0027).

DESIGN/SETTING Prospective cohort study using 2011-2018 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), an annual, nationally-representative longitudinal study of aging in the United States. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and sixty seven newly homebound older adults in 2012. MEASUREMENTS Homebound status was defined via self-report as living in the community but rarely/never leaving home in the prior month. Semi-homebound was defined as leaving the house only with difficulty or help. RESULTS One year after becoming newly homebound, 33.1% remained homebound, 22.8% were completely independent, 23.8% were semi-homebound, 2.2% were in a nursing home, and 18.0% died. Homebound status is highly dynamic; 6 years after becoming homebound, 13.5% remained homebound and 65.0% had died. Recovering from being homebound at 1 year was associated with younger age and lower baseline rates of receiving help with activities of daily living, in particular, with bathing.

Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are a sensitive, well-established method of measuring antigens in solutions. They use one ligand to capture and the other ligand to detect the target analyte. Detection is commonly achieved using colorimetric readout obtained upon the reaction of a substrate with HRP-conjugated secondary ligand. Nanobodies, the V(H)H domain of camelid antibodies, have expanded the repertoire of molecules used in antigen detection. Nanobodies' high affinity for target antigens, their compact structure, their high stability and ease of production has driven research into their use as diagnostic reagents.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1475 registered nurses from a Chinese hospital who provided responses to emotional intelligence, empathy, communication satisfaction, and job well-being scales. Path analysis using a multiple mediation model was performed using AMOS 23.0. RESULTS: Among all clinical nurses who participated in the survey, 1475 (98.33 %) completed the questionnaire. The nurses job well-being score was 83.61  12.63. There was a significant positive correlation between job well-being and communication satisfaction, emotional intelligence, and empathy ability (r = 0.346C0.570, P < 0.001). Empathy and communication satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between emotional intelligence and job well-being, with effect sizes of 0.047 and 0.227, respectively. The chain mediating effect of empathy and communication satisfaction had a value of 0.045. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that hospital managers take actions to improve nurses emotional intelligence level, and conduct professional psychological training to improve nurses empathy and communication satisfaction, and ultimately improve their job well-being.","output":"Relationship between emotional intelligence and job well-being in Chinese clinical nurses: multiple mediating effects of empathy and communication satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently has few effective treatments. Given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness and uptake of a vaccine, it is important that the search for treatments continue. An exaggerated inflammatory state is likely responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, have been shown to be associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TNF blockade reduces not only biologically active TNF but other pro-inflammatory cytokines important in COVID-19 hyperinflammation. Observational data from patients already on anti-TNF therapy show a reduced rate of COVID-19 poor outcomes and death compared with other immune-suppressing therapies. Anti-TNF has a long history of safe use, including in special at-risk populations, and is widely available.

Sialic acids are carbohydrates, present on cell surfaces or soluble proteins. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) recognize and bind to sialic acids. These are widely expressed on various types of immune cells. Siglecs modulate immune activation and can promote or inhibit ROS generation under different contexts.

In this policy brief, we argue that the response to the coronavirus outbreak also offers an opportunity to advance the climate agenda. Indeed, given that we have scarce resources at our disposal, it is essential that we synergize such efforts. We propose that this can be accomplished in two primary ways: (1) harnessing the disruptive forces of the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the decline of carbon-intensive industries, technologies, and practices, and (2) leveraging responses to drive low-carbon innovation. From these two strategies, we outline five principles of sustainability transition policy to serve as a guide during these challenging times.","output":"A tale of two crises: COVID-19 and climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How does language differ across one's Facebook status updates vs. one's text messages (SMS)? In this study, we show how Facebook and SMS use differs in psycho-linguistic characteristics and how these differences drive downstream analyses with an illustration of depression diagnosis. We use a sample of consenting participants who shared Facebook status updates, SMS data, and answered a standard psychological depression screener. We quantify domain differences using psychologically driven lexical methods and find that language on Facebook involves more personal concerns, experiences, and content features while the language in SMS contains more informal and style features. Next, we estimate depression from both text domains, using a depression model trained on Facebook data, and find a drop in accuracy when predicting self-reported depression assessments from the SMS-based depression estimates. Finally, we evaluate a simple domain adaption correction based on words driving the cross-platform differences and applied it to the SMS-derived depression estimates, resulting in significant improvement in prediction.

According to WHO guidelines, continuous use of face mask is mandatory for personal protection for restricting the spread of bacteria and virus. Here, we report a 3-ply cotton-PLA-cotton layered biodegradable face-mask containing encapsulated phytochemicals in the inner-filtration layer. The nano-fibrous PLA filtration layer was fabricated using needleless electrospinning of PLA & phytochemical-based herbal-extracts. This 3-layred face mask exhibits enhanced air permeability with a differential pressure of 35.78a?Pa/cm2 and superior bacterial filtration efficiency of 97.9% compared to conventional face masks. Close-packed mesh structure of the nano-fibrous mat results in effective adsorption of particulate matter, aerosol particles, and bacterial targets deep inside the filtration layer. The outer hydrophobic layer of mask exhibited effective blood splash resistance up to a distance of 30a?cm, ensuring its utilization for medical practices. Computational analysis of constituent phytochemicals using the LibDock algorithm predicted inhibitory activity of chemicals against the protein structured bacterial sites. The computational analysis projected superior performance of phytochemicals considering the presence of stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and Arachidic acid exhibiting structural complementarity to inhibit targeted bacterial interface. Natural cotton fibers and PLA bio-polymer demonstrated promising biodegradable characteristics in the presence of in-house cow-dung based biodegradation slurry. Addition of jaggery to the slurry elevated the biodegradation performance, resulting in increment of change of weight from 07% to 12%.

Researchers conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and participant solicited diaries. Caregivers of adults ages 55 and older were recruited to understand barriers to medication management during hospital to skilled home health care transitions. We used a human factors engineering approach to guide our understanding of systems level barriers. At least two researchers independently coded each transcript using content analysis and the ATLAS.ti software. We interviewed 23 caregivers and identified five barrier types stemming from systems breakdowns related to: (1) knowledge and information, (2) access to and use of resources and tools, (3) caregiver burden, (4) pandemic concerns, and (5) health limitations. Caregivers grappled with receiving overwhelming, insufficient, incorrect, or conflicting information, and had difficulty managing information from different sources. Latinx caregivers encountered language barriers that impeded role and task clarity. Caregivers expressed mistrust in health systems elements and inability to access resources. Caregivers were in need of additional caregiving assistance, financial aid, and tools to manage medications. Balancing multiple medications and responsibilities left caregivers burdened. The health limitations of the older adult and COVID-19 concerns related to reduced access to resources and ability to deliver and receive in person care complicated task management. Altogether these barriers reflect systems level breakdowns impeding task understanding, execution, and overall management.

The murine dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4) protein is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV; thus, mice are resistant to MERS-CoV infection. We generated human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice by replacing exons 10-12 at the mouse Dpp4 locus with exons 10-12 from the human DPP4 gene. The resultant human DPP4 KI mice are permissive to MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012 strain) infection but develop no disease.

Interestingly, no review of attitudes toward telemedicine among older adults has been performed. This is likely to be the group most affected by both cancer and the increasing use of technology in health care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to map research on the acceptance of telemedicine among older adults who are cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 2020. Articles were included if the study population had a mean or median age 65 years, with cancer diagnoses and if the study assessed patients acceptance of a telemedicine intervention. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies were included. RESULTS: Out of a total of 887 articles that were identified, 19 were included in the review. Interventions were delivered via telephone, videoconference, web portal, mobile app, wearable technology, and text messaging and included teleconsultation, monitoring and follow-up, psychosocial support and nursing care, and prompts. The most often cited facilitating factor was convenience. Other facilitators included an increase in telemedicine care accessibility, previous positive experiences of telemedicine, appropriate technical knowledge and support, decreased cost, physician recommendations, and privacy conferred by the telemedicine intervention. Barriers include a preference for conventional care along with negative perceptions of telemedicine, concerns about technical difficulties, and confidentiality concerns in the adoption of telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: None of the studies explored the ability of tailored interventions to address facilitators and barriers of the acceptance of telemedicine in order to increase its adoption by older adults. Facilitators and barriers will likely differ across different cultural contexts and by type of telemedicine; however, this is a gap in current knowledge.

Additionally, the laboratories were asked to indicate the operational challenges they faced. Results: A total of 1210 valid submissions were included in this analysis. Most of the survey participants worked in hospital laboratories. Around 15% of laboratories restricted certain tests on patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 over biosafety concerns. Just over 10% of the laboratories had to restrict their test menu or services due to resource constraints. Approximately a third of laboratories performed temperature monitoring, while two thirds of laboratories increased the frequency of disinfection. Just less than 50% of the laboratories split their teams. The greatest reported challenge faced by laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic is securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), analytical equipment, including those used at the point of care, as well as reagents, consumables and other laboratory materials. This was followed by having inadequate staff, managing their morale, anxiety and deployment.

Today, during a pandemic, the risk of contamination of transplanted cells with SARS-CoV-2 virus is extremely high. Data about cryo-resistance (virulence and/or infectivity) of SARS-CoV-2 are limited. Analysis and systematization of literature data allow us to draw the following conclusions: 1) The cytoplasmic membrane of somatic cell, like envelope of corona viruses, consists of lipid bilayer and this membrane, like envelope of corona virus, contains membrane proteins. Thus, we can consider the cytoplasmic membrane of an ordinary somatic cell as a model of the envelope membrane of SARS-CoV-2. It is expected that the response of the virus to cryopreservation is similar to that of a somatic cell. SARS-CoV-2 is more poor-water and more protein-rich than somatic cell, and this virus is much more cryo-resistant. 2) The exposure of somatic cells at low positive temperatures increases a viability of these cells. The safety of the virus is also in direct proportion to the decrease in temperature: the positive effect of low temperatures on SARS-CoV-2 virus has been experimentally proven. 3) Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to cryoprotectant-free cryopreservation is extremely high. The high viability rate of SARS-CoV-2 after freezing-drying confirms its high cryo-resistance. 4) The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissues that have been contaminated with this virus, increases significantly.

Whether an integrated measure of place-based risk can classify counties at high risk for COVID-19 outcomes is not known. METHODS: We conducted an ecological nationwide analysis of 2,701 US counties from 1/21/20 to 2/17/21. County-level characteristics across multiple domains, including demographic, socioeconomic, healthcare access, physical environment, and health factor prevalence were harmonized and linked from a variety of sources. We performed latent class analysis to identify distinct groups of counties based on multiple sociodemographic, health, and environmental domains and examined the association with COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 population. RESULTS: Analysis of 25.9 million COVID-19 cases and 481,238 COVID-19 deaths revealed large between-county differences with widespread geographic dispersion, with the gap in cumulative cases and death rates between counties in the 90(th) and 10(th) percentile of 6,581 and 291 per 100,000, respectively.

Aim of the present study was testing those two issues in a population of 258 consecutive patients admitted from 29 February to 30 April 2020 to General Medicine ward of the Hospital of Montichiari (Brixia). Design and method: A group of 258 patients (173 males and 85 females, aged 71  14) was enrolled. Their medical record and ongoing treatment were assessed. Patients were treated according to emerging information with oxygen, anti-malarian agents, anti-viral drugs, different antibiotics (azithromycin and others), tocilizumab and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at different doses. As of June 10th, 65 deaths had been observed. Survival curves were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between groups was performed with Breslow and Mantel-Cox test Results: Ongoing therapy with ACE-inhibitors at the time of admission was associated with a worse prognosis (p=0.004), while no difference in survival was observed in patients under treatment with ARBs (p=0.68). Ongoing treatment with statins (p&lt;0.001), low-dose aspirin (p&lt;0.001) and steroids (p&lt;0.001) was associated with a poorer outcome as well Administration during hospitalization of LMWH (p&lt;0.001), steroids (p&lt;0.001), anti-viral drugs (p=0.002), anti-malarian drugs (p&lt;0.001) and tocilizumab (p&lt;0.001), improved prognosis, while antibiotics (azithromycin and other) didn't have any impact. Conclusions: our experience confirms most findings in ongoing trials. Surprisingly, treatment with ACE-inhibitors seems to impact negatively on survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

PDT is considered a high-risk procedure for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers (HCWs). The present study analyzed the optimal timing of PDT, the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing PDT, and the safety of HCWs performing PDT. Methods: Of the 133 COVID-19 patients who underwent PDT in our ICU from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, 13 patients were excluded, and 120 patients were enrolled. A trained medical team was dedicated to the PDT procedure. Demographic, clinical history, and outcome data were collected. Patients who underwent PDT were stratified into two groups: an early group (PDT  12 days after orotracheal intubation (OTI) and a late group (>12 days after OTI). An HCW surveillance program was also performed. Results: The early group included 61 patients and the late group included 59 patients. The early group patients had a shorter ICU length of stay and fewer days of mechanical ventilation than the late group (p < 0.001). On day 7 after tracheostomy, early group patients required fewer intravenous anesthetic drugs and experienced an improvement of the ventilation parameters PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, PEEP, and FiO(2) (p < 0.001). No difference in the case fatality ratio between the two groups was observed. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in the HCWs performing the PDTs. Conclusions: PDT was safe and effective for COVID-19 patients since it improved respiratory support parameters, reduced ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, and optimized the weaning process. The procedure was safe for all HCWs involved in the dedicated medical team.

We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to investigate synaptic actions of N/OFQ. N/OFQ was primarily inhibitory, causing outward currents in both immunocytochemically identified dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) and non-dopaminergic (TH(-)) VTA neurons (effect at 1 M: 20  4 pA). Surprisingly, this effect was mediated by augmentation of postsynaptic GABAAR currents, unlike the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), where the N/OFQ induced outward currents were K+ channel dependent. A smaller population, 19% of all VTA neurons, responded to low concentrations N/OFQ with inward currents (10 nM: -11  2 pA). Following 100 nM N/OFQ, the response to a second N/OFQ application was markedly diminished in VTA neurons (14  10% of first response), but not in SNc neurons (90  20% of first response). N/OFQ generated outward currents in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-projecting VTA neurons, but inward currents in a subset of posterior anterior cingulate cortex-projecting VTA neurons. While N/OFQ inhibited NAc-projecting VTA cell bodies, it had little effect on electrically or optogenetically evoked terminal dopamine release in the NAc measured ex vivo with fast scan cyclic voltammetry. These results extend our understanding of the N/OFQ system in brainstem circuits implicated in many neurobehavioral disorders.Significance statement The neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and its receptor (NOP) are engaged under conditions of stress and are associated with reward processing disorders. Both peptide and receptor are highly enriched in ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways underlying motivation and reward. Using whole cell electrophysiology in rat midbrain slices we found: 1) NOPs are functional on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic VTA neurons; 2) N/OFQ differentially regulates VTA neurons based on neuroanatomical projection target; and 3) repeated application of N/OFQ produces evidence of receptor desensitization in VTA but not SNc neurons. These results reveal candidate mechanisms by which the NOP system regulates motivation and emotion.","output":"Differential modulation of ventral tegmental area circuits by the nociceptin/orphanin FQ system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant was first detected in England in March, 2021. It has since rapidly become the predominant lineage, owing to high transmissibility. It is suspected that the delta variant is associated with more severe disease than the previously dominant alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. We aimed to characterise the severity of the delta variant compared with the alpha variant by determining the relative risk of hospital attendance outcomes. METHODS: This cohort study was done among all patients with COVID-19 in England between March 29 and May 23, 2021, who were identified as being infected with either the alpha or delta SARS-CoV-2 variant through whole-genome sequencing. Individual-level data on these patients were linked to routine health-care datasets on vaccination, emergency care attendance, hospital admission, and mortality (data from Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System and COVID-19-associated deaths dataset; the National Immunisation Management System; and NHS Digital Secondary Uses Services and Emergency Care Data Set). The risk for hospital admission and emergency care attendance were compared between patients with sequencing-confirmed delta and alpha variants for the whole cohort and by vaccination status subgroups. Stratified Cox regression was used to adjust for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, recent international travel, area of residence, calendar week, and vaccination status. FINDINGS: Individual-level data on 43 338 COVID-19-positive patients (8682 with the delta variant, 34 656 with the alpha variant; median age 31 years [IQR 17C43]) were included in our analysis. 196 (23%) patients with the delta variant versus 764 (22%) patients with the alpha variant were admitted to hospital within 14 days after the specimen was taken (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 226 [95% CI 132C389]). 498 (57%) patients with the delta variant versus 1448 (42%) patients with the alpha variant were admitted to hospital or attended emergency care within 14 days (adjusted HR 145 [108C195]). Most patients were unvaccinated (32 078 [740%] across both groups). The HRs for vaccinated patients with the delta variant versus the alpha variant (adjusted HR for hospital admission 194 [95% CI 047C805] and for hospital admission or emergency care attendance 158 [069C361]) were similar to the HRs for unvaccinated patients (232 [129C416] and 143 [104C197]; p=082 for both) but the precision for the vaccinated subgroup was low. INTERPRETATION: This large national study found a higher hospital admission or emergency care attendance risk for patients with COVID-19 infected with the delta variant compared with the alpha variant. Results suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care services than the alpha variant.

The preoperative burden on patients mental wellbeing of impaired joint function or symptoms is well established. The purpose of this study was to determine patients awareness of their hip joint whilst awaiting hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement, to explore any association between joint awareness and mental health status, and to determine whether this relates to time spent waiting for arthroscopy preoperatively. METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing hip arthroscopy between January 2018 and November 2020 was analysed. All patients with a diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) undergoing arthroscopic treatment were included. Questionnaires included the FJS-12, twelve item international hip outcome tool (iHOT-12), EuroQol 5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L) and the Tegner activity score. Pearsons correlation coefficient was used to assess relationships between continuous variables. RESULTS: Preoperative functional outcomes were completed by 81 patients (97.5%) prior to undergoing hip arthroscopy. Median preoperative FJS-12 score was 16.67 (IQR 8.33 C 29.68). Forty-four patients reported any level of anxiety/depression preoperatively (54.3%). Preoperative FJS-12 showed a significant negative correlation with worsening mental health status (r = ? 0.359, p < 0.001), and a significant positive correlation with EQ-5D-5L (r = 0.445, p < 0.001). The duration of symptoms or time on the waiting list did not correlate with increased joint awareness or worsened mental health. CONCLUSION: Joint awareness is high when awaiting hip arthroscopy for FAI. Increasing levels of joint awareness correlate with poorer mental health status and poorer quality of life measures, however these parameters do not seem to be associated with increased duration of symptoms prior to surgery or time on the waiting list for surgery.","output":"Preoperative morbidity and joint awareness while awaiting hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to support the development of a stakeholder-informed, culturally relevant, evidence-based lifestyle intervention for Mexican-origin Hispanic survivors of cancer living in a border community to improve their dietary quality and physical activity. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 12 Mexican-origin Hispanic survivors of breast cancer and 7 caregivers were conducted through internet-based teleconferencing. The interviews explored the impact of cancer on lifestyle and treatment-related symptoms, perception of lifestyle as an influence on health after cancer, and intervention content and delivery preferences. Interviews were analyzed using a deductive thematic approach grounded in the Quality of Cancer Survivorship Care Framework. RESULTS: Key survivor themes included perception of Mexican diet as unhealthy, need for reliable diet-related information, perceived benefits of physical activity after cancer treatment, family support for healthy lifestyles (physical and emotional), presence of cancer-related symptoms interfering with lifestyle, and financial barriers to living a healthy lifestyle. Among caregivers, key themes included effects of the cancer caregiving experience on caregivers lifestyle and cancer-preventive behaviors and gratification in providing support to the survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The interviews revealed key considerations to the adaptation, development, and implementation of a theory-informed, evidence-based, culturally relevant lifestyle program to support lifestyle behavior change among Mexican-origin Hispanic survivors of cancer living in border communities.

It has often been a challenge to analyze these types of glycans, including those that are differentiated by the incorporation of N-acetyl (NANA) and N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NGNA) residues. In this study, a strategy for rapid N-glycan profiling by mixed mode chromatography is proposed as a complement to established HILIC methodologies. Hybrid silica chromatographic surfaces are used to improve recoveries during a column's initial use and to eliminate the need for column conditioning. In addition, the loss of labeled acidic glycans, especially phosphorylated glycan species, during SPE purification is addressed through the use of a citrate containing eluent. Yields for both singly and doubly phosphorylated glycan species are markedly improved. Combined with a mixed mode anion exchange reversed phase separation, these advances afford a class separation of glycans derivatized with labels designed to enhance positive ion mode MS detection. These labeled glycan species are separated according to their charge and with an added level of resolution imparted by the reversed phase retention mechanism. The separation technique itself can be accomplished with a low ionic strength gradient running from 0 to 22 mM ammonium formate such that high sensitivity detection can be achieved by both fluorescence and mass spectrometry. Using analytical scale chromatography, features in an N-glycan profile were easily interrogated to well below a 0.1% relative abundance. As such, it became possible to characterize N-glycans from recombinant beta glucuronidase and to quickly identify a number of unique phosphorylated glycan species.","output":"High sensitivity acidic N-glycan profiling with MS-enhancing derivatization and mixed mode chromatography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hamad General Hospital Anticoagulation Clinic is one of the largest collaborative-practice clinics of its type in Qatar.

This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of HSCT recipients after developing COVID-19. METHODS: In response to the pandemic, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) implemented a special form for COVID-19-related data capture on March 27, 2020. All patients-irrespective of age, diagnosis, donor type, graft source, or conditioning regimens-were included in the analysis with data cutoff of Aug 12, 2020. The main outcome was overall survival 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Factors associated with mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. FINDINGS: 318 HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported to the CIBMTR. The median time from HSCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 17 months (IQR 8-46) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 23 months (8-51) for autologous HSCT recipients. The median follow-up of survivors was 21 days (IQR 8-41) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 25 days (12-35) for autologous HSCT recipients. 34 (18%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients were receiving immunosuppression within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was mild in 155 (49%) of 318 patients, while severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 45 (14%) of 318 patients-ie, 28 (15%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 17 (13%) of 134 autologous HSCT recipients. At 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% (95% CI 58-77) for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% (55-78) for recipients of autologous HSCT. Age 50 years or older (hazard ratio 253, 95% CI 116-552; p=0020); male sex (353; 144-867; p=0006), and development of COVID-19 within 12 months of transplantation (267, 133-536; p=0005) were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic HSCT recipients, and a disease indication of lymphoma was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with plasma cell disorder or myeloma (241, [108-538]; p=0033) in autologous HSCT recipients.

We proposed prioritizing wards under higher risk zones for intelligent decision making regarding COVID-19 risk reduction through appropriate management of resources-related policy consequences.

However, little is known about whether the program was associated with better quality or outcomes or lower costs. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether participation in BPCI among physician group practices was associated with advantageous or deleterious changes in costs or patient outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used 2013 to 2017 Medicare files and difference-in-differences (DID) models to compare the change over time in Medicare payments, patient selection, and clinical outcomes between 91 orthopedic groups in BPCI Model 2 and 169 propensity-matched controls for patients undergoing joint replacement. Analyses were performed between December 2019 and February 2021. EXPOSURES: Voluntary participation in BPCI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 90-day Medicare payments; secondary outcomes were patient selection (volume, comorbidities) and clinical outcomes (30-day and 90-day emergency department visits, readmissions, mortality, and healthy days at home). RESULTS: There were 74 343 patient episodes in the baseline period and 102 790 during the intervention in BPCI practices, and 88 147 patient episodes in the baseline period and 120 253 during the intervention in control practices; 291 214 of 461 598 (63.1%) patients were women, and 419 619 (90.9%) were White. At baseline, mean episode payments among BPCI-participating practices were $18 257, which decreased to $15 320 during the intervention, while control practices decreased from $17 927 to $16 170 (DID, ?$1180; 95% CI, ?$1565 to ?$795; P < .001). Savings were driven by a decrease in postacute care spending. There were no differential changes in volume or comorbidities. The BPCI practices increased the proportion of patients discharged home compared with controls (23.6% to 43.4% vs 22.2% to 31.8%; DID, 10.2% [95% CI, 6.2% to 14.1%]). There were no differential changes in 30-day or 90-day mortality rates or emergency department visits, but 30-day and 90-day readmission rates decreased more among BPCI practices than controls (90 days: 8.7% to 7.5% vs 8.9% to 8.7%; DID, ?1.0% [95% CI, ?1.4% to ?0.5%]), and 90-day healthy days at home increased (BPCI, 82.9 to 84.8, vs controls, 83.1 to 84.4; DID, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4 to 0.8]).

METHODS: Environmental swabs were used to culture HCPs personal mobile phone surfaces. Four cultures were obtained per phone: before and after the UV-C device's 30-second disinfecting cycle, at the beginning and end of a 12-hour shift. Surveys were administered to participants pre- and post-study. RESULTS: Total bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) were reduced by 90.5% (p=0.006) after one UV-C disinfection cycle, and by 99.9% (p=0.004) after two cycles. Total pathogenic bacterial CFUs were decreased by 98.2% (p=0.038) after one and >99.99% (p=0.037) after two disinfection cycles. All survey respondents were willing to use the UV-C device daily to weekly, finding it convenient and beneficial. DISCUSSION: This novel UV-C disinfecting device is effective in reducing pathogenic bacteria on mobile phones. HCPs would frequently use a phone disinfecting device to reduce infection risk.

Guidance on how to handle and safely continue such trials is lacking. Chronically ill elderly individuals requirein addition to protection from infectionregular physical exercise and social contact to remain healthy. Solutions on how to handle these conflicting necessities are needed. The ENTAIER-randomised controlled trial was investigating the influence of mindful movements on fall risk, fear of falling, mobility, balance, life quality, and other outcomes. The study population was planned to comprise of 550 chronically ill elderly individuals with a high risk of falling. The movements were regularly performed in coached groups over 6 months. After the trial began, COVID-19 lockdowns stopped all in-person meetings, and it was expected that the limitations of this pandemic would continue for a long term. Therefore, the exercise programme, which involved complex movements and was typically conducted face-to-face in groups, had to be substituted by a telemedicine programme within a short timeframe. The objectives, therefore, were to identify challenges and tasks that could to be resolved and steps that could to be taken to achieve high-quality, efficacy, safety, and enable human encounter and motivation. METHODS: We proceeded with four steps: 1) A literature review on the quality and feasibility issues of telemedicine in general, and specifically, in exercise training in elderly individuals. 2) Participation in two international telemedicine task forces on integrative medicine, particularly, mindCbody medicine. 3) Interviews with study therapists, (for practical purposes, eurythmy therapists and Tai Chi teachers are summarized here as therapists) personnel, and international experts on providing mindful movement exercises and other physiotherapies via live telecommunication technology, and with scientists and patient representatives. 4) Final evaluation by the core trial team and subsequent planning and implementation of changes in the trial organisation. RESULTS: Various tasks and challenges were identified: for the technical equipment for therapists and patients; for the ability of therapists and trial participants to adequately manage the technology and telemedicine intervention; the reservations and concerns about the technology among therapists and participants; safety and data protection in using the technology; and study design. The two major options found on how to continue the trial in the COVID-19 situation were a complete switch to telemedicine and a partial switch in the form of risk management implemented into the former design. CONCLUSIONS: The management of an ongoing clinical trial in a national or international crisis with a minimum of available time and extra financial resources, alongside with two checklists on steps and procedures for trial continuation and telemedicine implementation, may be informative for other researchers or healthcare providers faced with similar challenges and making similar decisions in the current situation or similar future scenarios.

At the same time, vitamin D deficiency seems to be prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Hence, the association between the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection and mortality among European countries was examined. Design: A case series and recent literature review study Settings: Information on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in each country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed database. As of December, 23rd 2020, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per million population were extracted from the Worldometer website, whereas the latitude of each country was taken from the CSGNetwork website. The association between both vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots. Participants: European Countries-Populations Results: The range of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries was 6.9-75.1%, with most countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their population. Significant positive correlations were observed between COVID-19 infections (r=0.82; p<0.001) and mortalities (r=0.53; p=0.05) per million population with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Most of the high latitude countries showed lower rates of COVID-19 infections and mortalities compared to middle latitude countries.

Repeat and chronic CED infusions have rarely been described for oncological purposes. Currently available CED devices are not approved for extended indwelling use, and the only potential at this time is for sequential treatments through multiple procedures. The authors report on the safety and experience in a group of pediatric patients who received sequential CED into the brainstem for the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. METHODS Patients in this study were enrolled in a phase I single-center clinical trial using 124I-8H9 monoclonal antibody (124I-omburtamab) administered by CED (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01502917). A retrospective chart and imaging review were used to assess demographic data, CED infusion data, and postoperative neurological and surgical outcomes. MRI scans were analyzed using iPlan Flow software for volumetric measurements. Target and catheter coordinates as well as radial, depth, and absolute error in MRI space were calculated with the ClearPoint imaging software. RESULTS Seven patients underwent 2 or more sequential CED infusions. No patients experienced Clinical Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or greater deficits. One patient had a persistent grade 2 cranial nerve deficit after a second infusion. No patient experienced hemorrhage or stroke postoperatively. There was a statistically significant decrease in radial error (p = 0.005) and absolute tip error (p = 0.008) for the second infusion compared with the initial infusion. Sequential infusions did not result in significantly different distribution capacities between the first and second infusions (volume of distribution determined by the PET signal/volume of infusion ratio [mean  SD]: 2.66  0.35 vs 2.42  0.75; p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates the ability to safely perform sequential CED infusions into the pediatric brainstem. Past treatments did not negatively influence the procedural workflow, technical application of the targeting interface, or distribution capacity. This limited experience provides a foundation for using repeat CED for oncological purposes.","output":"Repeat convection-enhanced delivery for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, an infection capable of causing severe disease and death but which may also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic in many individuals. While several risk factors, including age, have been described, the mechanisms of this variation are poorly understood. Several studies have described associations between blood group and COVID-19 severity, while others do not. Expression of ABO glycans on secreted proteins and non-erythroid cells is controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2). Inactivating mutations result in a non-secretor phenotype which is known to protect against some viral infections. We investigated whether ABO or secretor status was associated with COVID-19 severity. Data combined from healthcare records and laboratory tests (n=275) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients hospitalised with COVID-19, confirmed higher than expected numbers of blood group A individuals compared to O (RR=1.24, CI 95% [1.05,1.47], P=0.0111). There was also a significant association between group A and COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications (RR=2.56, CI 95% [1.43,4.55], P=0.0011) which is independent of gender.

Development and evaluation of samplers is often labor-intensive and time-consuming due to the need to use monodisperse aerosols spanning a range of sizes. This study develops a rapid experimental methodology using polydisperse solid aerosols to evaluate size-resolved aerosol-to-aerosol (AtoA) and aerosol-to-hydrosol (AtoH) sampling efficiencies. Arizona Test Dust (diameter 0.5C20 m) was generated and dispersed into an aerosol test chamber and two candidate samplers were tested. For the AtoA test, aerosols upstream and downstream of a sampler were measured using an online aerodynamic particle sizer. For the AtoH test, aerosols collected in sampling medium were mixed with a reference sample and then measured by the laser diffraction method. The experimental methodology were validated as an impressive time-saving procedure, with reasonable spatial uniformity and time stability of aerosols in the test chamber and an acceptable accuracy of absolute mass quantification of collected particles.

Within 2 weeks, Manchester Central Convention Centre was converted into a potential 648 bed facility, capable of providing step-down care to patients from the north west.Junior doctors had the opportunity to witness the creation of a field hospital, shape systems and processes, and work with a diverse team coming together for a common cause. To capture their experiences, interviews were conducted using a semi-structured format and the responses summarised into transcripts. Consensus coding was performed using domains/themes.When exploring successes, there was consistent mention of a strong team;in particular the feeling of being individually valued within a flattened hierarchy. Staff wellbeing and education were also regularly mentioned and helped contribute to this overall feeling. When asked what they would take forward, doctors focussed on the importance of a strong team that values multi-disciplinary working.But the hospital was not without challenges, with processes changing from one shift to the next and leading to potential errors. In addition, system issues (such as with medication and documentation) lead to a sometimes-chaotic work environment. Staff identification was a significant challenge, and potentially contributed to communication breakdowns.To rectify this, doctors undertook QI projects which formed the basis for re-activation plans. Perhaps more important than material improvements were feelings of empowerment they identified to achieve actionable change within the hospital.Junior doctors were overwhelmingly positive about their NNW experience. Their power to act as agents of change was showcased at NNW, where senior management encouraged them to take ownership of challenges identified and seek ways to improve the system in which they worked.","output":"Capturing the experience and lessons from junior doctors working at the Nightingale North West: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Energy potential and demand in Indonesia continues to grow, especially for coal power generation needs. Likewise, energy needs derived from gas and oil for industrial, household, and transportation needs, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, energy companies must have good performance to meet these needs. This study aims to determine the performance of energy companies, especially in gas and oil companies and coal companies, and the factors that influence them. The study was conducted in the last 3 years, namely 2018 to 2020 where there was a transition between before and during the pandemic. The study results found that there was a significant decrease between performance before the pandemic and during the pandemic. The decline was felt mainly by gas and oil companies. In addition, company size and liquidity are the most important factors to maintain the performance of energy companies. This is because the need for working capital to run an energy company is very large so that if it experiences a lack of funds, the company has the potential not to achieve the expected performance. In addition, of the two types of companies studied, coal companies significantly influence the performance of energy companies. This is in line with the huge energy demand from coal in Indonesia and the abundant coal reserves so that the opportunity to earn profits is greater than that of gas and oil companies. ? 2022, Econjournals.

Vast resources have been allocated to control the pandemic and treat patients. However, little attention has been paid to the adverse impact on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. (2) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Chinese college students' mental health, understand the underlying mechanisms, and explore feasible mitigation strategies. (3) Methods: During the peak time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we conducted longitudinal surveys of sixty-six college students. Structured questionnaires collected information on demographics, physical activity, negative emotions, sleep quality, and aggressiveness level. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate associations between variables, and the mediating effect of sleep quality was further explored. A generalized additive model was used to determine the dose-response relationships between the COVID-19 death count, physical activity, and negative emotions. (4) Results: The COVID-19 death count showed a direct negative impact on general sleep quality (? = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.55, 2.19) and reduced aggressiveness (? = -6.57, 95% CI: -12.78, -0.36). In contrast, the COVID-19 death count imposed not a direct but an indirect impact on general negative emotions (indirect effect (IE) = 0.81, p = 0.012), stress (IE = 0.40, p < 0.001), and anxiety (IE = 0.27, p = 0.004) with sleep quality as a mediator. Moreover, physical activity directly alleviated general negative emotions (? = -0.12, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.01), and the maximal mitigation effect occurred when weekly physical activity was about 2500 METs. (5) Conclusions: (a) The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak has an indirect effect on negative emotions by affecting sleep quality.

To this end, we propose a simple model of infection that enables to study the coincidence time of two random walkers on an arbitrary graph. By studying the coincidence time of a susceptible and an infected individual both moving in the graph we obtain estimates of the infection probability. The main result of this paper is to pinpoint the impact of the network topology on the infection probability. More precisely, we prove that for homogeneous graphs including regular graphs and the classical Erd?sCRnyi model, the coincidence time is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the graph. We then study the model on power-law graphs, that exhibit heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and show the existence of a phase transition for the coincidence time depending on the parameter of the power-law of the degree distribution. We finally undertake a preliminary analysis for the case with k random walkers and provide upper bounds on the convergence time for both the complete graph and regular graphs.","output":"A random walk model for infection on graphs: spread of epidemics & rumours with mobile agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region is known to be a global hotspot to viral outbreaks because of many factors.

METHODS: Based on the infectivity and hospital requirements of COVID-19, a new simple respirator was designed by the medical staff of the Department of Anesthesiology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, which was applied on the 22 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 who needed oxygen therapy admitted to the Cancer Center of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from February 15th to March 15th in 2020. The new simple respirator contained two National Utility Model Patents (a respirator: ZL 2015 2 0410623.6, a fluid switch and oxygen suction device: ZL 2017 2 0873509.6), which was mainly composed of anesthesia mask and filter, L-shaped connecting tube, soft breathing bladder, connecting tube and elastic fixing belt. When in use, the anesthesia mask was fixed to the patient's mouth and nose with elastic straps, the connecting tube was inserted into the oxygen meter interface, the oxygen flow was adjusted to 6-10 L/min, and the L-shaped connecting tube was opened immediately after the soft breathing bag was full. The carbon dioxide and excess oxygen in the body was discharged from exhaust port. The oxygen flow was lowered to 2-3 L/min, the patient's respiratory rate (RR) was observed through the soft breathing bag fluctuations, and the oxygen flow was adjusted at any time. The changes of pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), RR and heart rate (HR) before and after application of new simple respirator were observed, and the blood gas test results of part of the patients were collected. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with severe and critical COVID-19 had significantly higher SpO2 at 10 minutes after application of the new simple ventilator than before application (0.9940.007 vs. 0.9520.017, P < 0.01), and RR was significantly lower than that before application (times/min: 27.593.63 vs. 29.643.81, P < 0.01); after 1 day of application, each index was further improved. All 13 patients who received blood gas analysis indicated no carbon dioxide accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The new simple respirator can significantly improve the oxygen therapy effect of patients with severe and critical COVID-19. At the same time, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can be filtered through the filter to reduce the formation of aerosol and protect the medical staff and patients.","output":"[Effect of new simple breathing apparatus on oxygen therapy in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although typical and atypical CT image findings of COVID-19 are reported in current studies, the CT image features of COVID-19 overlap with those of viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/- consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). RESULTS: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854. These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score > 2.

The sudden onset of stay-at-home orders and social distancing enacted in much of the United States created sudden barriers for researchers to recruit participants in-person. Recognizing the critical need to understand the impact of COVID-19 on children and families in real time, studies required an alternative approach. The present study sought to develop methods and establish the feasibility of utilizing Facebook's targeted advertising to enroll schoolaged children and their parents for a study examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families. This study used an 8 week pay-per-click advertisement approach via Facebook for research recruitment. Parents of children age 8 to 17 were invited and asked to include their child. Standardized measures were included for parents and children. Zip code targeting was used to increase diversity in participants. The ad campaign reached 213,120, yielding 3563 clicks, 684 parent participants, 494 child participants and a 26% conversion rate over eight weeks. The cost-per-click was $0.64, and cost-per-participant was $3.30 and $4.60 for parents and children, respectively. This nationwide study successfully used social media to recruit a robust nationwide sample of parent-child dyads during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A \\"renal pharmacist consultant service\\" (RPCS) at hospital admission can support patient safety by detecting rDRP. However, the efficient information sharing from pharmacists to physicians is still discussed. The aim of the study was to test the implementation of a RPCS and its effectiveness on prescription changes and to evaluate two ways of written information sharing with physicians. METHODS Urological patients with eGFRnon-indexed of 15-59 ml/min and 1 drug were reviewed for manifest and potential rDRP at admission by a pharmacist. Written recommendations for dose or drug adaptation were forwarded to physicians comparing two routes: July-September 2017 paper form in handwritten chart; November 2017-January 2018 digital PDF document in the electronic patient information system and e-mail alert. Prescription changes regarding manifest rDRP were evaluated and compared with a previous retrospective study without RPCS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The RPCS detected rDRP in 63 of 234 (26.9%) patients and prepared written recommendations (median 1 rDRP (1-5) per patient) concerning 110 of 538 (20.5%) drugs at admission. For manifest rDRP, acceptance rates of recommendations were 62.5% (paper) vs 42.9% (digital) (P = 0.16). Compared with the retrospective study without RPCS (prescription changes in 21/76 rDRP; 27.6%), correct prescribing concerning manifest rDRP significantly increased by 27.1%.

IgG antibodies (Abs) that form complexes with Fc receptors (FcRs) on innate immune cells can activate Fc-mediated immune functions. Genetic variation in both IgGs and FcRs have the capacity to alter IgG-FcR complex formation via changes in binding affinity and concentration. A growing challenge lies in unraveling the importance of multiple variations, especially in the context of vaccine trials that are conducted in homogenous genetic populations. Here we use an ordinary differential equation model to quantitatively assess how IgG1 allotypes and FcR polymorphisms influence IgG-FcRIIIa complex formation in vaccine-relevant settings. Using data from the RV144 HIV vaccine trial, we map the landscape of IgG-FcRIIIa complex formation predicted post-vaccination for three different IgG1 allotypes and two different FcRIIIa polymorphisms. Overall, the model illustrates how specific vaccine interventions could be applied to maximize IgG-FcRIIIa complex formation in different genetic backgrounds. Individuals with the G1m1,17 and G1m1,3 allotypes were predicted to be more responsive to vaccine adjuvant strategies that increase antibody FcRIIIa affinity (e.g. glycosylation modifications), compared to the G1m-1,3 allotype which was predicted to be more responsive to vaccine boosting regimens that increase IgG1 antibody titers (concentration). Finally, simulations in mixed-allotype populations suggest that the benefit of boosting IgG1 concentration versus IgG1 affinity may be dependent upon the presence of the G1m-1,3 allotype. Overall this work provides a quantitative tool for rationally improving Fc-mediated functions after vaccination that may be important for assessing vaccine trial results in the context of under-represented genetic populations.","output":"A Quantitative Approach to Unravel the Role of Host Genetics in IgG-FcR Complex Formation After Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, no effective vaccines or therapies are available against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pandemic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

COVID-19 can be transmitted among humans. To control the spread of the epidemic and meet the learning needs of students, Chinese universities have used a variety of multimedia forms to conduct online teaching. However, the influence of different teaching methods on the learning effects of nursing students has not been conclusive, and few studies have directly compared the differences in the effects of different teaching methods. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of different teaching methods on students learning effects. METHODS: A total of 119 participants from the graduating class of 2022 performed 4 validated classes (fundamental nursing, medical nursing, surgical nursing, and paediatric nursing) through network teaching. A total of 126 participants from the graduating class of 2021 used the traditional teaching method and were enrolled as a control group. All participants completed a questionnaire, which was designed by the school for teaching evaluation, and took a test after the courses. RESULTS: A total of 245 nursing undergraduates were ultimately enrolled. The analysis of the academic performance and the student evaluations from the four courses showed no significant difference between the network teaching group and the traditional teaching group for nursing undergraduates (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Through the convenience of network teaching, teachers and students can choose the time and place of both their teaching and learning independently. Moreover, such use effectively prevents the spread of the epidemic. After the epidemic concludes, the continued use of the network teaching method can help improve teaching efficiency by being combined with the traditional teaching method.

METHODS: Qualitative study consisting of six focus groups carried out between 1st\\\\12th May, 2020 (39\\\\50 days into the UK lockdown). RESULTS: Participants were divided as to whether or not they felt they would use the app. Analysis revealed five themes: (1) lack of information and misconceptions surrounding COVID\\\\19 contact tracing apps; (2) concerns over privacy; (3) concerns over stigma; (4)concerns over uptake; and (5) contact tracing as the greater good. Concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those stated they will not be using the app, and the view that the app is for the greater good was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID\\\\19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity.

As reported by the World Health Organization, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread across the world, killed many, collapsed economies and changed the way people live since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in the end of 2019. As at the end of December 2020, it had led to over 2.8 million confirmed cases in Africa with over 67 thousand deaths. The trend poses a huge threat to global public health. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We employed a SEIHCRD mathematical transmission model with reported Kenyan data on cases of COVID-19 to estimate how transmission varies over time. The model is concise in structure, and successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) from the model to assess the factors driving the infection. The model illustrates the effect of mass testing on COVID-19 as well as individual self initiated behavioral change. The results have significant impact on the management of COVID-19 and implementation of prevention policies. The results from the model analysis shows that aggressive and effective mass testing as well as individual self initiated behaviour change play a big role in getting rid of the COVID-19 epidemic otherwise the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery.","output":"SARS-COV-2 outbreak and control in Kenya - Mathematical model analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Executive Summary: The global spread of 'COVID-19' [coronavirus disease 2019] has created many new opportunities for threat actors since the novel 'coronavirus' began gathering widespread attention at the end of 2019 Now, all organizations need to carefully review their multi-layered cybersecurity strategies and arm employees with knowledge of how to protect themselves against these specific attacks [ ] To provide a clear picture of how malicious actors are exploiting those opportunities, the Mimecast Threat Intelligence team analyzed key trends in activity over the first 100 days COVID-19 (Disease);Cybersecurity;Threats","output":"100 Days of Coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to perform the content and face validation of a checklist and a banner on pressure injury prevention in patients in prone position METHOD: this is a methodological study of content and face validation with 26 nurses with specialization Professionals assessed the checklist and the banner in relation to clarity, theoretical relevance, practical relevance, relation of the figures to the text and font size The Content Validity Index was calculated for each item, considering one with a value equal to or greater than 0 8 as valid RESULTS: all the actions described in the checklist and in the banner had a Content Validity Index greater than 0 80, with standardization of verbal time and esthetic adjustments in the banner's layout, as suggested CONCLUSIONS: the checklist and the banner were validated and can be used in clinical practice to facilitate pressure injury preventions in patients in prone position","output":"COVID-19 patients in prone position: validation of instructional materials for pressure injury prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Paracetamol is one of the most widely analgesic and antipyretic drugs recently integrated into the supportive therapy of COVID-19. The pharmaceuticals containing methionine with paracetamol may contribute to avoid hepatotoxicity and eventual paracetamol overdose-dependent death. OBJECTIVE: The current work purposes to develop and validate two chromatographic methods for the simultaneous determination of methionine and paracetamol in presence of two paracetamol impurities (4-nitrophenol and 4-aminophenol). METHODS: Two chromatographic methods were established and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The first one was a RP-HPLC/UV method based on applying a \\"dual-mode\\" gradient elution. The separation was realized via varying both the composition of the ternary mobile phase (acetonitrile-methanol-water) and its flow rate. This strategy enabled a relatively rapid analysis with a satisfactory resolution, although the investigated compounds exhibit a significant difference in lipophilicity. The second one relied on TLC- densitometry, where the optimum separation was realized using a quaternary mobile phase system composed of butanol-dioxane-toluene-methanol (8: 2.5: 3.5: 0.3, by volume). Both methods were monitored at 220 nm. RESULTS: The developed methods were proven to be robust, accurate, specific, and appropriate for the routine analysis of paracetamol in its pure form or in pharmaceutical formulations with methionine in quality control laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: The corresponding methods are suitable to determine methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities. HIGHLIGHTS: The study achieves the analysis of methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities via the application of HPLC and TLC- densitometry methods.","output":"Dual-mode gradient HPLC and TLC densitometry methods for the simultaneous determination of paracetamol and methionine in the presence of paracetamol impurities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dialysis patients frequently receive unwanted high intensity end-of-life care. The Pathways Project tested implementation of evidence-based supportive care best practices to identify seriously ill (SI) patients, engage them in goals of care conversations (GOCC), and track outcomes respectful of patient preferences. Teams at 10 dialysis centers participated in a learning collaborative to adopt supportive care best practices. They were trained to screen patients with the surprise question- Would I be surprised if this patient died the next six months?- to identify those who are SI;hold GOCC;and document patient preferences. Centers submitted monthly reports to benchmark improvement, including the number of patients screened, percent SI, GOCC, and death. Project processes were interrupted at 9 months by COVID-19, then resumed with adjustments 90 days later. A mortality risk ratio was calculated for the risk of death over the first 9 months for SI versus not SI, and a Cochran-Armitage one-sided test for increasing trend was used to assess potential increases in GOCC. Team members completed a 17-item Kidney Supportive Care Implementation Quotient at baseline and at project completion to assess perceived implementation of each best practice. The average monthly census was 1,529 patients;98.8% were screened, and 18.4% were identified as SI. SI constituted 66% of 114 deaths though only 18.4% of patients. The 9-month mortality risk was 27% for SI versus 3% for not SI (risk ratio: 8.52;95% CI: 5.71 -12.88;p <. 0001). Dialysis center teams implemented site-specific approaches to make GOCC part of usual workflow;centers conducting GOCC within 30 days of hospital discharge increased from 30% to a peak of 80% prior to COVID-19 (p =. 01).

Through these signals we generate pseudo-queries and their respective pseudo-positive (relevant documents) and pseudo-negative (non-relevant documents) examples. The article retrieval process combines a ranking model based on term-maching techniques and a neural one based on pretrained BERT models. BERT models are fine-tuned to the task using the pseudo-qrels generated. We compare different BERT models, both open domain and biomedical domain, and also the generated pseudo-qrels with the open domain MS-Marco dataset for fine-tuning the models.

METHODS: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the pandemic peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (1 March 2020 to 24 April). All patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain with a medical diagnosis of AIRD and with symptomatic COVID-19 were included. The main outcome was hospital admission related to COVID-19. The covariates were sociodemographic, clinical and treatments. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess risk factors for the hospital admission. RESULTS: The study population included 123 patients with AIRD and COVID-19. Of these, 54 patients required hospital admission related to COVID-19. The mean age on admission was 69.7 (15.7) years, and the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 5 (3C10) days. The median length of stay was 9 (6C14) days. A total of 12 patients died (22%) during admission. Compared with outpatients, the factors independently associated with hospital admission were older age (OR: 1.08; p=0.00) and autoimmune systemic condition (vs chronic inflammatory arthritis) (OR: 3.55; p=0.01). No statistically significant findings for exposure to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were found in the final model.

OBJECTIVE: Through a national cross-sectional survey in the United States, we aimed to describe and compare the characteristics of populations with and without mental health issues (depression or anxiety disorders), including physical health, sleep, and alcohol use. We also examined the patterns of social networking service use, PGHD, and attitudes toward health information sharing and activities among the participants, which provided nationally representative estimates. METHODS: We drew data from the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey of the National Cancer Institute. The participants were divided into 2 groups according to mental health status. Then, we described and compared the characteristics of the social determinants of health, health status, sleeping and drinking behaviors, and patterns of social networking service use and health information data sharing between the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the predictors of mental health. All the analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates. RESULTS: Participants with mental health issues were significantly more likely to be younger, White, female, and lower-income; have a history of chronic diseases; and be less capable of taking care of their own health. Regarding behavioral health, they slept <6 hours on average, had worse sleep quality, and consumed more alcohol. In addition, they were more likely to visit and share health information on social networking sites, write online diary blogs, participate in online forums or support groups, and watch health-related videos. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that individuals with mental health issues have inequitable social determinants of health, poor physical health, and poor behavioral health. However, they are more likely to use social networking platforms and services, share their health information, and actively engage with PGHD.

METHODS: Three cross-breed dogs were found to be affected with colobomas. Two of the cases were NEHJ1 homozygous and Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) affected and had the typical optic nerve head colobomas seen with the disease. The third case had an unexpected atypical coloboma. In vivo retinal photography and non-invasive retinal imaging by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were done, and the eye affected with the atypical coloboma was collected and processed for histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: The majority of the defining features within the CEA defects were similar, with the extent of change to the choroid being of note. Similar to the first two cases, the atypical coloboma demonstrated absent normal retina, RPE, and choroid within the coloboma. Prominent intercalary membranes and vitreal strands attached to the depth of the coloboma were also apparent in all affected eyes. However, unlike the CEA-associated colobomas, the atypical coloboma possessed normal choroid surrounding the lesion and the depth of the lesion was apparent throughout. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced retinal imaging enables the appreciation of microanatomical changes that occur in the living eye.

Records were abstracted for co-morbidities, signs and symptoms, and illness outcomes during the two weeks before and after the date of positive specimen collection. Relative Risks (RR) of hospitalization and death were calculated. Results Of the 118 residents tested among approximately 130 residents from Facility A during February 28 C March 16, 2020, 101 (86%) were found to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. At initial presentation, about two thirds of SARS-Cov-2-positive residents had an abnormal vital sign or change in oxygen status. Most (90.2%) symptomatic residents had elevated temperature, change in mental status, lethargy, change in oxygen status, or cough; nine (11.0%) did not have fever, cough, or shortness of breath during their clinical course. Those with change in oxygen status had an increased relative risk of 30-day mortality (51.1% vs. 29.7%, RR: 1.7 [1.0-3.0]).

Therefore, this paper proposes a method for the analysis of COVID-19 epidemic situation using knowledge graph combined with interactive visual analysis. Firstly, based on the key factors of novel Coronavirus disease, the entity model of the patient, the relationship type of the patient and the expression of knowledge modeling were proposed, and the knowledge graph of the action track of the COVID-19 patient was deeply explored and comparative summarized. Secondly, in the process of constructing knowledge graph, conditional random field (CRF) algorithm is used to extract entity and knowledge. Meanwhile, to better analyze the disease relationship between patients, the semantic relationship of knowledge graph was combined with the visualization of knowledge graph, and the semantic model was verified by deep learning calculation and node attribute similarity. To discover the community detection of patients in the patient knowledge graph, this paper uses PageRank combined with Label propagation algorithms to discover community propagation in the network.

Here we confirm, using a more stringent method, that viewing static images of another person gazing in a particular direction, at an object, produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction. The aftereffect was manifested as a change in perceptual decision threshold for detecting left versus right motion. The effect disappeared when the person was looking away from the object. These findings suggest that the attentive gaze of others is encoded as an implied agent-to-object motion that is sufficiently robust to cause genuine motion aftereffects, though subtle enough to remain subthreshold.","output":"A motion aftereffect from viewing other peoples gaze"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mathematical model for the quantitative analysis of the interaction between cancer cells and cell-mediated immune system with two discrete-time delays, considering the role of antibodies, is studied in this paper.

In this international, multi-center study conducted by the World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography (WASE), we aim to determine the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype of acute cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients, to explore phenotypic differences in different geographic regions across the world, and to identify parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Methods We studied 870 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from 13 medical centers in four world regions (Asia, Europe, United States, Latin America) who had undergone transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs). Clinical and laboratory data were collected, including patient outcomes. Anonymized echocardiograms were analyzed with automated, machine learning-derived algorithms to calculate left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and LV longitudinal strain (LS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters that were measured included right ventricular (RV) LS, RV free wall strain (FWS), and RV basal diameter (RVBD). Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Results Significant regional differences were noted in terms of patient co-morbidities, severity of illness, clinical biomarkers, and LV and RV echocardiographic metrics. Overall in-hospital mortality was 21.6%. Parameters associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis were age (OR 1.12 [1.05, 1.22], p = 0.003), previous lung disease (OR 7.32 [1.56, 42.2], p = 0.015), LVLS (OR 1.18 [1.05, 1.36], p = 0.012), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 6.17 [1.74, 28.7], p = 0.009), and RVFWS (OR 1.14 [1.04, 1.26], p = 0.007). Conclusions LV dysfunction is noted in approximately 20% and RV dysfunction in approximately 30% of patients with acute COVID-19 illness and portend a poor prognosis. Age at presentation, previous lung disease, LDH, LVLS, and RVFWS were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

The innate immune system offers alternative mechanisms that do not require antigen-specific recognition or a priori knowledge of the causative agent. However, it is unclear whether effective stable innate immune system activation can be achieved without triggering harmful autoimmunity or other chronic inflammatory sequelae. Here, we show that transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in the absence of other viral proteins, can profoundly reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity by exposing the normally membrane-sequestered RdRP activity to sustained innate immune detection. RdRP-transgenic mice have life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and show profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. Multiple crosses with defined knockout mice (Rag1, Mda5, Mavs, Ifnar1, Ifngr1, and Tlr3) established that the mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS and is fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated the key features with striking fidelity, with the RdRP inducing an analogous ISG network and a strict block to HIV-1 infection. This RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA but operates at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis. Importantly, despite lifelong massive ISG elevations, RdRP mice are entirely healthy, with normal longevity. Our data reveal that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. These results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection.","output":"Antiviral Protection via RdRP-Mediated Stable Activation of Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of desensitizing agents (DA) on dentin hypersensitivity (DH) after non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT) through a systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA The PICO strategy was used to include randomized clinical trials in human subjects with DH (P) after NSPT treated with DA (I) compared to those treated with placebo or control (C) to identify DH relief (O). The Cochrane guidelines and GRADE was used to classify the risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, respectively. SOURCES PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, Cochrane Library databases, and OpenGrey were searched on the 20th of May 2020. STUDY SELECTION Nine studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Five meta-analyses were performed. Three meta-analyzes assessed the effectiveness of DA compared to a placebo or control in relation to pain assessment stimuli and two meta-analyzes assessed the mechanism of action of DA. For the mechanical stimulus in overall analysis, the control group presented a higher mean of pain reduction (SMD 1.03 [0.73, 1.32], p < 0.001) with very low certainty of evidence. For water (SMD -0.78 [-1.22, -0.35], p = 0.0009) and evaporative in overall analysis (SMD -1.21 [-1.79, -0.64], p < 0.001) stimuli, the DA decreased DH pain with very low and low certainty of evidence, respectively. CONCLUSION Due to the limited quality of evidence, there is no definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of DA on DH after NSPT. Thus, further clinical studies with a low risk of bias and high-quality evidence are encouraged to reinforce the certainty of evidence on that issue.

To bridge the gap between live group discussion (GD) and virtual GD in the conventional format (VGD), we implemented an innovative yet feasible multistep approach of conducting structured virtual group discussion (sVGD). It involved priming of students during the preparatory phase and incorporation of the Tuckman model of group dynamics, which consists of sequential substages of forming, storming, norming, and performing into the virtual format. Unsupervised synchronous and asynchronous, as well as supervised synchronous interactions within and in between the minigroups in a structured way, led to active engagement of students with one another and the moderator, despite the constraints imposed by the virtual format. After establishing the feasibility of the approach during the first GD (sVGD-1), sVGD-2 was conducted, further refining the approach, and feedback was obtained from the postgraduate students. Pre-GD feedback revealed that the live session was preferred over virtual for the conduct of GD, whereas both live GD and sVGD were perceived to be more effective than VGD in the post-GD feedback.

Acting at this site, PEA can downstream several genes involved in the inflammatory response, including cytokines (TNF-, Il-1) and other signal mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and COX2. To shed light on this, we tested the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity of ultramicronized(um)-PEA, both alone and in the presence of specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-) antagonist MK886, in primary cultures of murine alveolar macrophages exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SP).

Yet, workforce analysis elicited serious concerns with the distribution, practice environments and regulation of Lebanese pharmacists. Recent workforce data shows that the profession has been majorly destabilized with hundreds of pharmacists closing their pharmacies or losing their employment. Proper planning for the future of the pharmacy profession in Lebanon necessitates a deeper understanding of the current challenges and the necessary policy and practice recommendations. The aim of this study is to examine stakeholders' perspectives on the current pharmacist workforce challenges and the necessary measures to support the profession. METHODS: The research team carried out a series of semi-structured interviews with twenty-one key stakeholders within the pharmacy profession in Lebanon. We categorized stakeholders according to their experience as policy makers, practitioners, academicians, and media experts. The interview guide included questions about workforce trends, labor market challenges and recommendations for improvement. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged from this study: the oversupply of pharmacists in Lebanon, the demand supply imbalance, poor regulation of the pharmacy practice, and the difficult practice environment. There was a consensus among interviewees that the oversupply of pharmacists is due to the poor workforce planning and weak regulatory framework, combined with the easy integration of foreign-trained pharmacists into the labor market. The lack of coordination between the educational and practice sectors is further widening the demand-supply gap. Interviewees further revealed that the regulatory policies on pharmacy practice were outdated and/or weakly enforced which increases the risk of unethical practices and erodes the image of pharmacists in the society. With respect to the practice environment, there is an ongoing struggle by Lebanese pharmacists to maintain profitability and exercise their full scope of practice.

Hook-end steel fibres and SF were also used in the mixtures at the optimised replacement levels of 1% and 8%, respectively. The results showed that the addition of both types of RCA adversely affected the compressive strength of concrete. However, the incorporation of SF led to compressive strength development in both types of concretes. The most significant improvement in terms of comparable concrete strength and peak strain with ordinary concrete at 28 days was observed in the case of using a combination of steel fibres and SF in both recycled aggregate concretes, especially with RCA sourced from high strength concrete. Although using SF slightly increased the elastic modulus of both recycled aggregate concretes, a substantial improvement in strength was observed due to the reinforcement with steel fibre and the coexistence of steel fibre and SF. Moreover, existing models to predict the elastic modulus of both non-fibrous and fibrous concretes are found to underestimate the elastic modulus values. The incorporation of SF changed the compressive stress-strain curves for both types of RCA. The addition of steel fibre and SF remarkably improved the post-peak ductility of recycled aggregates concretes of both types, with the most significant improvement observed in the case of RCA sourced from a low-strength parent concrete.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The effects of the COVIDC19 global pandemic on fertility services became evident in early 2020. Because of possible impacts of the virus on gametes, embryos and patients and concerns over virus transmission and the ability of medical services to cope, fertility treatments were temporarily suspended, as advised by ESHRE, ASRM and others. Across Europe, services were paused for approximately 7 weeks. Patients have reported that they found this extremely stressful and in some cases, unfair. After the initial closures, many clinics re-opened but with new risk mitigation strategies regarding PPE, hygiene and reducing staff and patient footfall. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Men and women with a scheduled appointment at a fertility clinic over a 7-week period during the first wave of the COVIDC19 pandemic were asked to complete a questionnaire outlining their experience and how it affected them. Participants were recruited via email using a secure online patient portal. A standardised anonymous 25-item questionnaire was sent to 828 patients and a reminder was circulated seven days later. The questionnaire remained open for 28 days. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were invited to complete a questionnaire and assured that all data would remain anonymous. Three areas were assessed. Firstly, how the pandemic itself affected their attempts to conceive. Secondly, participant perceptions regarding the overall disruption to fertility services. Thirdly, how participants feel fertility services should be treated in the event of a future large scale global pandemic. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: 135 responses were received, giving a response rate of 16.3%. 80% of respondents were female and 20% male with no significant difference in responses between the sexes. Most participants (96%) had completed third level education and 90% were fully employed. Interestingly, 69% of participants continued trying to conceive during this time. This was despite 28% having concerns about contracting COVIDC19 should they attend a clinic, 21% having concerns regarding the effect of the virus on pregnancy and 21% having concerns regarding an impact on the fetus. The majority surveyed (93%) stated that fertility treatment should be considered essential. 90% had their treatment disrupted or altered and, of these, 44% felt that this was justified, 23% disagreed and 33% were unsure. Regarding changes implemented within the clinic, 68% were satisfied with online video consultations and a further 16% would be content in certain circumstances. 92% felt privacy was maintained and 95% were happy to sign consent forms via video link. Many disagreed with the no partner policy at early pregnancy scans(57%) and embryo transfer(44%); however, they agreed with it for phlebotomy and treatment scans. In the event of a future pandemic, 79% felt fertility services should or probably should be continued. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study focuses on the first wave of COVIDC19. The long term, ongoing nature of the pandemic may influence participants perspectives on the areas investigated over time. Wider implications of the findings: It is estimated that the world will face a global pandemic approximately once every generation. Fertility stakeholders must learn from these events and studies such as ours are important to ascertain the views of service users. Some policies, such as video consultations, may be of benefit even in non-pandemic times.

This in turn has strongly impacted the energy demand of the transport sector and associated CO(2) emissions. We analyse near real-time passenger mobility and related emission trends in Europe between 21 January and 21 September 2020. We compiled a dataset of country-, sector- and lockdown- specific values, representing daily activity changes in private, public, and active passenger transport. In the aggregate, surface passenger transport emissions fell by 11.2% corresponding to 40.3 MtCO(2) in Europe. This decline was predominantly due to the reduction of private passenger transport in five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK). During the first lockdown in April 2020, CO(2) emissions from surface passenger transport declined by 50% in Europe, resulting in a 7.1% reduction in total CO(2) emissions. After April 2020, private passenger travel recovered rapidly, while public passenger flows remained low. Solely prompted by the private sector, a rebound in total emissions and surface passenger transport emissions of 1.5% and 10.7%, respectively, was estimated at the end of the study period. The resulting situation of increased private and decreased public passenger transport is in contradiction to major climate goals, and without reversing these trends, emission reductions, as stated in the European Green Deal are unlikely to be achieved. Our study provides an analysis based on a detailed and timely set of data of surface passenger transport and points to options to grasp the momentum for innovative changes in passenger mobility.","output":"Implications of COVID-19 lockdowns on surface passenger mobility and related CO(2) emission changes in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although hospital systems have largely halted elective surgical practices in preparing their response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, transplantation remains an essential and lifesaving surgical practice. To continue transplantation while protecting immunocompromised patients and health care workers, significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits is required. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, descriptive study of the abdominal transplant program at 1 academic center (University of California, San Francisco) and the programmatic changes undertaken to safely continue transplantations. Patient transfers, fellow use, and patient discharge education were identified as key areas requiring significant reorganization. RESULTS: The University of California, San Francisco abdominal transplant program took an early and aggressive approach to restructuring inpatient workflows and health care worker staffing. The authors formalized a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transfer system to address patients in need of services at their institution while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in their transplant ward and used technological approaches to provide virtual telehealth where possible. They also modified their transplant fellow staffing and responsibilities to develop an adequate backup system in case of potential exposures. CONCLUSION: Every transplant program is unique, and an individualized plan to adapt and modify standard clinical practices will be required to continue providing essential transplantation services. The authors' experience highlights areas of attention specific to transplant programs and may provide generalizable solutions to support continued transplantation in the COVID-19 era.","output":"Rapid Modification of Workflows and Fellow Staffing at a Single Transplant Center to Address the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread throughout Europe. However, there is a lack of data on the full clinical course of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Europe, especially in the population that developed acute respiratory failure (ARF). OBJECTIVES To identify risk factors associated with developing ARF during SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was an observational study of 60 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected from March 26, 2020 to May 26, 2020 in a tertiary academic hospital in Poland. All patients reached final outcome (discharge from the hospital or death). We divided patients into 2 groups based on whether they developed ARF, compared their clinical data, and performed multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Twenty-two patients (36%) from the observed cohort developed ARF. Logistic regression identified that a high sequential organ failure assessment score at admission (odds ratio (OR) = 6.97 (1.57-30.90, p = 0.011)), and a long time from admission until pneumonia (OR = 1.41 (1.06-1.87, p = 0.016)), correlated with ARF development. D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) differed both statistically and clinically between ARF and non-ARF groups. The mortality rate in the observed cohort of patients was 13.3%, and it was 32% in the group that developed ARF. CONCLUSIONS Routine vigilant examination of the above markers may identify patients at the highest risk of ARF early on during COVID-19 infection.","output":"Risk factors and outcomes for acute respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019: An observational cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture for short term load forecasting of building energy loads.

DATA SOURCES: The Web of Science, Pubmed, and Embase databases were searched from inception to July 2021. The corresponding authors of excluded articles were contacted to obtain additional data for possible inclusion. REVIEW METHODS: The main outcomes included ischaemic complications (stroke, transient ischaemic attack [TIA], and transcranial Doppler [TCD] measured micro-emboli), haemorrhagic complications (haemorrhagic stroke, neck haematoma, and re-operation for bleeding), and composite outcomes. Pooled estimates using odds ratios (ORs) were combined using a random or fixed effects model based on the results of the chi square test and calculation of I2. RESULTS: In total, 47 411 patients were included in 11 studies, with 14 345 (30.2%) receiving DAPT and 33 066 (69.7%) receiving aspirin only. There was no significant difference in the rates of peri-operative stroke (OR 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 - 1.05) and TIA (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 - 1.17) despite a significant reduction in TCD measured micro-emboli (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 - 0.35) in the DAPT compared with the aspirin monotherapy group. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant difference in ischaemic stroke risk between patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. DAPT was associated with an increased risk of neck haematoma (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.87 - 4.18) and re-operation for bleeding (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.77 - 2.23) vs. aspirin. Haemorrhagic stroke was an under reported outcome in the literature. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found that CEA while on DAPT increased the risk of haemorrhagic complications, with similar rates of ischaemic complications, vs. aspirin monotherapy. This suggests that the risks of performing CEA on DAPT outweigh the benefits, even in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. The overall quality of studies was low, and improved reporting of CEA outcomes in the literature is necessary.","output":"Peri-Operative Outcomes of Carotid Endarterectomy are Not Improved on Dual Antiplatelet Therapy vs. Aspirin Monotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Japanese technical experts who have been supporting health in low-and middle- income countries (LMICs) are facing unprecedented travel restrictions As of 11 April 2020, of 195 countries Japan has diplomatic relationship with, 181 countries have entry restrictions and 69 countries have post-entry movement restrictions (self-quarantine) for Japanese nationals or travellers from Japan In order for technical experts to assist LMICs technically from Japan to meet the increased demand and needs in the health sector due to COVID-19, it is important to prioritize and reorganize the project activities in accordance with the local situation in particular to address three challenges i) to communicate from Japan;ii) to prioritize activities to match to the increased COVID-19 related tasks;and iii) to advocate health workers' rights and working environment","output":"Sustainable implementation of international health cooperation projects while Japanese technical experts cannot go to low- and middle-income countries because of the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospitals and ambulatory facilities significantly reduced cardiac care delivery in response to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because particulate filtering facepiece respirators (respirators; e.g. N95 masks) are more effective than surgical masks against bio-aerosols, many international organisations now recommend that health workers (HWs) wear a respirator when caring for individuals who may have COVID-19. In South Africa (SA), however, surgical masks are still recommended for the routine care of individuals with possible or confirmed COVID-19, with respirators reserved for so-called aerosol-generating procedures. In contrast, SA guidelines do recommend respirators for routine care of individuals with possible or confirmed tuberculosis (TB), which is also transmitted via aerosol. In health facilities in SA, distinguishing between TB and COVID-19 is challenging without examination and investigation, both of which may expose HWs to potentially infectious individuals. Symptom-based triage has limited utility in defining risk. Indeed, significant proportions of individuals with COVID-19 and/or pulmonary TB may not have symptoms and/or test negative. The prevalence of undiagnosed respiratory disease is therefore likely significant in many general clinical areas (e.g. waiting areas). Moreover, a proportion of HWs are HIV-positive and are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death. RECOMMENDATIONS: Sustained improvements in infection prevention and control (IPC) require reorganisation of systems to prioritise HW and patient safety. While this will take time, it is unacceptable to leave HWs exposed until such changes are made. We propose that the SA health system adopts a target of zero harm, aiming to eliminate transmission of respiratory pathogens to all individuals in every healthcare setting. Accordingly, we recommend: 1. the use of respirators by all staff (clinical and non-clinical) during activities that involve contact or sharing air in indoor spaces with individuals who: (i) have not yet been clinically evaluated; or (ii) are thought or known to have TB and/or COVID-19 or other potentially harmful respiratory infections; 2. the use of respirators that meet national and international manufacturing standards; 3. evaluation of all respirators, at the least, by qualitative fit testing; and 4. the use of respirators as part of a package of care in line with international IPC recommendations. We recognise that this will be challenging, not least due to global and national shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). SA national policy around respiratory protective equipment enables a robust framework for manufacture and quality control and has been supported by local manufacturers and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition. Respirator manufacturers should explore adaptations to improve comfort and reduce barriers to communication. Structural changes are needed urgently to improve the safety of health facilities: persistent advocacy and research around potential systems change remain essential.","output":"A position statement and practical guide to the use of particulate filtering facepiece respirators (N95, FFP2, or equivalent) for South African health workers exposed to respiratory pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to describe the experience of a private outpatient network for hematology and oncology treatment in the adoption of management tools to face the risk of contamination by SARS-CoV-2 METHOD: an experience report on the use of a root cause analysis method to identify potential risks of contamination by COVID-19 among patients and employees Through the risks identified through the Ishikawa Diagram, we built an action plan, linked to the 5W2H tool, for planning and decision-making implemented RESULTS: the number of attendances in person and people circulating in the units was reduced, protective distance measures and new protection barriers were fundamental to control the risks of spreading COVID-19 in patients and employees FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: the management tools served as a valuable tool in the construction of measures, making the measures in question more clearly and applicable","output":"Management of coping with the risks of COVID-19 in an onco-hematological outpatient clinic: an experience report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Studies find that psychosocial safety climate is positively associated with workplace safety behaviors However, the mechanism through which psychosocial safety climate exerts its effect needs further investigation Therefore, this study investigated the indirect effect of work self-efficacy in the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and workplace safety behaviors Methodology: Participants, who were 155 bank workers (F=66 5%;mean age= 33 9, SD=6 4), responded to an online survey of workplace safety behavior scale (WSBS), psychosocial safety climate scale (PSC-12), and work self-efficacy scale (WSES) Results: Results from correlational analyses revealed that psychosocial safety climate positively related to workplace safety behaviors Moreover, work self-efficacy positively correlated to workplace safety behaviors The mediation analysis using Hayes Process Macros indicated an indirect effect of work self-efficacy in the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and workplace safety behaviors Creating a psychosocially safe climate may enhance bank workers' safety behaviors in the period after the Covid-19 pandemic ? 2021 Abimbola A Akanni et al , published by Sciendo 2021","output":"Mediating Effect of Work Self-Efficacy on the Relationship between Psychosocial Safety Climate and Workplace Safety Behaviors among Bank Employees after Covid-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Functional disability continues to be a significant public health problem that increases older adults vulnerability to experience a diminished quality of life, loss of independence, higher healthcare costs and health services utilization, and increased risks of mortality. Thus, we aimed to study the prevalence of functional disabilities by sex according to the types of daily living activities, controlling for specific sociodemographic variables among older Hispanics from low-income communities. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional epidemiological research design, considering a complex sampling design of households to interview adults 65 years living in low-income communities in Puerto Rico. Functional disability was measured by the PROMIS? Physical Function Short Form-20 T-score. The selected community was reported to have 5980 adult residents 65 years, according to the USA Census. The prevalence of functional disability was estimated using the logistic regression model, weighting by the effect of the sampling. Our estimated prevalence was compared between sexes using the prevalence ratio (PR), which was estimated with logistic regression models, controlling for age, income, number of chronic conditions, high and low impact of chronic conditions in functional disabilities, marital status, and sampling design. RESULTS: We recruited 211 older Hispanics from a randomly selected sample. Their mean age was 74.4  7.1 years, with female predominance (57.3%). The overall estimated prevalence of physical function disability using T-score among females was 2.70 (95% CI: 1.4, 5.1) times the estimated prevalence of physical function disability among males. Women were more likely to report functional disabilities in instrumental activities of daily living, self-care activities, and functional mobility compared to males. However, sex differences were largely explained by the presence of musculoskeletal conditions of high impact in functional disability.

We review our experience with Onyx and report its limitations in the treatment of spinal AVFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the Interventional Neuroradiology Procedure database at Washington University for cases of sDAVF embolization. Radiology reports were reviewed for fistula classification, treatment technique, and initial and follow-up results. Angiographic images were reviewed to confirm diagnosis, treatment, and penetration of embolisate into the draining vein. RESULTS With the use of Onyx, sDAVFs were obliterated in six of seven patients at the time of treatment. Follow-up angiography confirmed sDAVF obliteration in two patients, and recurrence in two cases. Two patients had no follow-up. One patient not cured at the time of treatment was treated surgically. Of the nine total treatments, Onyx successfully crossed the nidus into the draining vein in only four cases. Successful venous embolization was facilitated with positioning of the microcatheter to less than 5 mm from the nidus in three of the four cases. The use of n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) resulted in venous penetration in eight of 10 cases, and short term follow-up cure in seven of 10 patients.

How does program design affect the efficiency and distributional implications of these policies? And what design features determine their political popularity? We study these questions in the context of a program to distribute relief through the electric utility in Accra, Ghana, using data from 1,200 households surveyed during the COVID-19 crisis. We find that distributing relief through electricity transfers has significant advantages. It enables an immediate government response to the crisis because it leverages the existing financial infrastructure between the government utility and households. Moreover, theoretical efficiency concerns about in-kind transfers are mitigated because the transfers are inframarginal for most households and electricity credit can be stored, with many even preferring electricity transfers over cash. These advantages do not preclude delays in transfer receipt and the exclusion of some eligible households, and the program is regressive in both design and implementation. The households least likely to receive relief are those who use less electricity, pay a landlord or other intermediary for electricity, or share an electricity meter with other users C all common among low-income electricity consumers in urban settings. Finally, transfer receipt increases support for the governing party, but support for the program drops significantly if even a fraction of its costs are to be recovered through future electricity tariff increases. Concerns around disbursing relief through utility transfers in this context thus arise not from efficiency loss, but from regressivity, distributional challenges, and politicization.","output":"Disbursing Emergency Relief through Utilities: Evidence from Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on the health of Black Americans, Latinx or Hispanic Americans, and American Indians.

The COVID-19 health disparities are arguably unjust because health equity is a \\"free-standing\\" demand of justice, an obligation of reparative justice, a remedy to structural injustice, and part of dismantling pernicious racial concepts. Identifying multiple accounts of injustice may lower the evidentiary bar for our normative claims and help us to identify alternative policy pathways for ending health inequity.","output":"Causation and Injustice: Locating the injustice of racial and ethnic health disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infrared thermographs (IRTs) implemented according to standardized best practices have shown strong potential for detecting elevated body temperatures (EBT), which may be useful in clinical settings and during infectious disease epidemics. However, optimal IRT calibration methods have not been established and the clinical performance of these devices relative to the more common non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) remains unclear. In addition to confirming the findings of our preliminary analysis of clinical study results, the primary intent of this study was to compare methods for IRT calibration and identify best practices for assessing the performance of IRTs intended to detect EBT. A key secondary aim was to compare IRT clinical accuracy to that of NCITs. We performed a clinical thermographic imaging study of more than 1000 subjects, acquiring temperature data from several facial locations that, along with reference oral temperatures, were used to calibrate two IRT systems based on seven different regression methods. Oral temperatures imputed from facial data were used to evaluate IRT clinical accuracy based on metrics such as clinical bias ([Formula: see text]), repeatability, root-mean-square difference, and sensitivity/specificity. We proposed several calibration approaches designed to account for the non-uniform data density across the temperature range and a constant offset approach tended to show better ability to detect EBT. As in our prior study, inner canthi or full-face maximum temperatures provided the highest clinical accuracy. With an optimal calibration approach, these methods achieved a [Formula: see text] between 0.03 C with standard deviation ([Formula: see text]) less than 0.3 C, and sensitivity/specificity between 84% and 94%. Results of forehead-center measurements with NCITs or IRTs indicated reduced performance. An analysis of the complete clinical data set confirms the essential findings of our preliminary evaluation, with minor differences. Our findings provide novel insights into methods and metrics for the clinical accuracy assessment of IRTs. Furthermore, our results indicate that calibration approaches providing the highest clinical accuracy in the 37C38.5 C range may be most effective for measuring EBT. While device performance depends on many factors, IRTs can provide superior performance to NCITs.","output":"Infrared Thermography for Measuring Elevated Body Temperature: Clinical Accuracy, Calibration, and Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia may progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

This retrospective multicenter caseCcontrol study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who received standard of care with or without tocilizumab. Primary outcome was the progression to intubation or death. PSMATCH (SAS) procedure was used to achieve exact propensity score (PS) matching. Data from 1289 patients were collected, and study population was reduced to 1073 based on inclusionCexclusion criteria. The composite outcome was observed more frequently in tocilizumab-users, but there was a significant imbalance between arms in all critical parameters. Primary analyses were carried out in 348 patients (174 in each arm) after exact PS matching according to gender, ferritin, and procalcitonin. Logistic regression models revealed that tocilizumab significantly reduced the intubation or death (OR 0.40, p = 0.0017). When intubation is considered alone, tocilizumab-users had > 60% reduction in odds of intubation. Multiple imputation approach, which increased the size of the matched patients up to 506, provided no significant difference between arms despite a similar trend for intubation alone group.

OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: This study reviewed the vertical transmission (VT) potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women. Key-related symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes for mothers and infants before and after childbirth were summarized. Some practical therapies and preventive health solutions were also proposed. RESULTS: There was a high susceptibility in pregnant women to COVID-19 infection, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy. The most common symptoms in 22C40-year-old patients infected with COVID-19 were fever (87.6%), cough (52.3%), dyspnea (27.6%), fatigue (22.4%), sore throat (13.5%), malaise (9.4%), and diarrhea (3.4%), respectively. The viral infection led to an increase in preterm labor and cesarean delivery without any intrauterine infection and severe neonatal asphyxia. No infection in the newborn infants was reported despite a high risk of the VT phenomenon. The most important therapies were the reception of antiviral and antibiotic drugs, oxygenation therapy, psychological interventions, and food supplements with health-promoting effects. The best proposed medical strategies to control the COVID-19 infection were bi-monthly screening and following-up the mothers and fetuses health, not using the potent broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, providing the delivery room with negative pressure for emergency cesarean section, and the immediate isolation of newborns after childbirth without direct breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: Babies with respiratory problems may be born to some mothers with COVID-19, who have weak immune systems. Thus, the virus transmission cycle should be disrupted to prevent adverse maternal and fetal outcomes by integrating individual health guidelines, efficient medical care therapies, and hospital preventive practices.","output":"Pregnant women and infants against the infection risk of COVID-19: a review of prenatal and postnatal symptoms, clinical diagnosis, adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and available treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persistent infection with high-risk types Human Papillomavirus could cause diseases including cervical cancers and oropharyngeal cancers.

The boom in LSBN platforms such as Foursquare, Twitter, and Yelp has motivated a considerable amount of research focused on POI recommendations within the last decade. Inspired by the success of deep neural networks in many fields, researchers are increasingly interested in using neural networks such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to make POI recommendation. Compared to traditional methods like Factorizing Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) and Tensor Factorization (TF), neural network methods show great improvement in general sequences prediction. However, the users personal preference, which is crucial for personalized POI recommendation, is not addressed well in existing works. Moreover, the users personal preference is dynamic rather than static, which can guide predictions in different temporal and spatial contexts. To this end, we propose a new deep neural network model called Personal Dynamic Preference Neural Network(PDPNN). The core of the PDPNN model includes two parts: one part learns the users personal long-term preferences from the historical trajectories, and the other part learns the users short-term preferences from the current trajectory. By introducing a similarity function that evaluates the similarity between spatiotemporal contexts of users current trajectory and historical trajectories, PDPNN learns the users personal dynamic preference from users long-term and short-term preferences.

Although older women are commonly screened for breast cancer, little is known about screening outcomes using DBT among older women. OBJECTIVE: To assess proximal screening outcomes with DBT compared to traditional two-dimensional(2-D) mammography among women 67C74 and women 75 and older. DESIGN: Cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 67 years and older with no history of prior cancer who received a screening mammogram in 2015. MAIN MEASURES: Use of subsequent imaging (ultrasound and diagnostic mammography) as an indication of recall, breast cancer detection, and characteristics of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis. Analyses used weighted logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. KEY RESULTS: Our study included 26,406 women aged 67C74 and 17,001 women 75 and older who were screened for breast cancer. Among women 75 and older, the rate of subsequent imaging among women screened with DBT did not differ significantly from 2-D mammography (91.8 versus 97.0 per 1,000 screening mammograms, p=0.37). In this age group, DBT was associated with 2.1 additional cancers detected per 1,000 screening mammograms compared to 2D (11.5 versus 9.4, p=0.003), though these additional cancers were almost exclusively in situ and stage I invasive cancers.

Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, political trust has been found to reduce anxiety. Taking these findings into account, this study explores the association of generalised and political trust with mental well-being on current postpartum women who were particularly at risk due to a decline in social support leaving them an increased burden of caring newborns during the pandemic. We conducted a crosssectional survey in October 2020 in Japan (n=558). Depressive symptoms (above the cutoff of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)) and Fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale (FCVC19S) scores were used as mental well-being indicators. Generalised and political trust were captured by binary variables. Results of regression analyses, in which covariates were fully adjusted, showed that higher generalised trust had a statistically significant association with lower possibility of depressive symptoms and a lower FCV-19S score, while political trust was not significantly associated with either indicator. For further understanding, we divided respondents into two groups; women living in cities where higher COVID-19 cases were reported and women living in areas with lower COVID-19 cases, to test whether the role of trust differs depending on the infection spread status.

In a general sense, acute and chronic inflammation are different types of adaptive response that are called into action when other homeostatic mechanisms are insufficient. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the cellular and molecular events that are involved in the acute inflammatory response to infection and tissue injury, the causes and mechanisms of systemic chronic inflammation are much less known. The pathogenic capacity of this type of inflammation is puzzling and represents a common link of the multifactorial diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In recent years, interest has been raised by the discovery of novel mediators of inflammation, such as microRNAs and adipokines, with different effects on target tissues. In the present review, we discuss the data emerged from research of leptin in obesity as an inflammatory mediator sustaining multifactorial diseases and how this knowledge could be instrumental in the design of leptin-based manipulation strategies to help restoration of abnormal immune responses. On the other direction, chronic inflammation, either from autoimmune or infectious diseases, or impaired microbiota (dysbiosis) may impair the leptin response inducing resistance to the weight control, and therefore it may be a cause of obesity.

Thirty hospitalized patients with real-time PCR-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infections were included in the study and five serum samples (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th) were collected from each participant. The serum levels of N and S specific anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were evaluated by the immunoassay technique at the same time. To determine the correlation between levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM with severity of disease, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR %), and the serum levels of C-reactive protein were evaluated using an automated analyzer and turbidimetry assays, respectively. The mean serum level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody was at the highest level up to 90 days and then decreased significantly 1 year POS (P < 0.0001).

Tapentadol is approved for cancer pain in Japan; however, real-world evidence on tapentadol's effectiveness and safety for cancer-related pain in Japan is limited. METHODS This retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of tapentadol (by patient type-opioid-na?ve and opioid-tolerant) in 84 patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain at Ichikawa General Hospital between September 2014 and August 2016. RESULTS Almost 93% of patients achieved clinically relevant pain relief within 4 days (median). Over 90% of patients with neuropathic pain or mixed pain and all patients with nociceptive pain were responders. Pain intensity significantly decreased from baseline through to the end of maintenance period in opioid-na?ve and opioid-tolerant patients. No patients discontinued tapentadol due to serious adverse events. No opioid-na?ve patients experienced nausea or vomiting during tapentadol treatment. Only three opioid-tolerant patients experienced nausea which was considered to be related to tapentadol. CONCLUSION Tapentadol is effective and well tolerated in opioid-na?ve and opioid-tolerant patients with cancer pain of varying pathophysiology, including those with nociceptive and/or neuropathic components.

However, the current information about dynamic change of LDH in COVID-19 pneumonia has not been well investigated. METHODS: Study was performed in 87 cases confirmed by COVID-19 infection. The serum LDH levels were determined at diagnosis and follow-up visits. The evaluation of clinical response to therapy was based on chest CT scan. We selected the value of LDH around the data of chest CT scan (- 1 ~ + 1 day). RESULTS: At diagnosis, significant differences in LDH levels were found between non-severe and severe group (P < 0.05). It was demonstrated that increase or decrease of LDH was indicative of radiographic progress or improvement (P < 0.05). The time to LDH normalization (5.67  0.55, days) was positively correlated with the time to radiographic absorption (5.57  0.65 days, r = 0.53, P < 0.05). Applying the cut-off value of the increase in LDH has good specificity to predict disease progression.

Multiple COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in agricultural settings, including a large outbreak among employees of a fruit grower during May-August. Because of this outbreak, Okanogan County Public Health and the Washington State Department of Health initiated one-time, on-site screening testing (2) of all orchard and warehouse employees in August 2020 and assessed risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 3,708 known orchard employees, a valid SARS-CoV-2 test result or information on COVID-19-like symptoms in the absence of a test was available for 3,013 (81%). Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during approximately 3 months among tested orchard employees was 6%. Cumulative incidence was 12% in employees residing in the community, compared with 4% in employees residing in farmworker housing (p<0.001); point prevalence during the single screening testing event was 1% in both groups. Among 1,247 known warehouse employees, a valid result was available for 726 (58%). Cumulative incidence over approximately 3 months among tested warehouse employees was 23%, with substantial variation across job roles. Positive test results were received by 28% of employees who worked packing and sorting fruit, 24% of those in other roles in the packing and sorting area, 10% of forklift operators, 7% of employees in other warehouse roles, and 6% of office employees. Point prevalence among all warehouse workers was 1% at the screening testing event. Collaboration among employers, community groups, and public health authorities can reveal risk factors and help decrease farmworkers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community and the workplace. Creation of a COVID-19 assessment and control plan by agricultural employers, with particular focus on indoor workers whose jobs limit physical distancing, could reduce workplace transmission.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak Among Farmworkers - Okanogan County, Washington, May-August 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile devices have increasingly become an essential part of the healthcare system worldwide [...].","output":"Mobile Diagnostic Devices for Digital Transformation in Personalized Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The ongoing worldwide pandemic due to COVID\\\\19 has forced drastic changes on the daily lives of the global population.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on mental health in general and on schizoptypal traits specifically in general population samples of the UK (N 1st timepoint=239 , N 2nd timepoint= 126) and Germany (N 1st timepoint= 543, N 2nd timepoint=401) over two timepoints, April/May and September/October 2020. We were able to show that whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cutoff for further psychological investigation declined from the first to the second timepoint in both countries, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were increased at the second timepoint. We investigated potential predictors, using regression models. For schizotypy, we detected a doubling or more of the estimated impact from the first to the second timepoint, including stronger perceived loneliness, increased use of drugs, stronger financial burden, and decreased regular exercise and sleep. These effects predicted GSI, however with a lower increase of impact from the first to the second timepoint. We furthermore found that living in the UK was a predictor for higher schizotypal scores or GSI. However, the results are highly comparable between the two countries. In conclusion, this study shows that while the general psychological impact decreases, potentially showing a normative response to an exceptional situation; schizotypy scores increase, revealing a stronger impact of loneliness, drug use, and financial burden. This development might create an increased risk for developing psychosis in some individuals. The development of the general psychological and schizotypy scores over time requires further attention and investigation.","output":"Are we back to normal yet?

Herein, we performed a virtual screening using 22 antiviral drugs retrieved from the DrugBank repository, azithromycin (antibiotic), ivermectin (antinematode), and seven non-structural proteins (Nsps) of SARS-CoV-2, which are considered important targets for drugs, via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.

Moreover, the results suggest that simeprevir is a strong inhibitor of Mpro (-37.2 kcal mol-1), which is an interesting finding because Mpro plays an important role in viral replication.

Both experimental and computational methods were utilized to understand the mechanism of binding. The UV absorption profile of HSA changes in the presence of both cuminaldehyde and cuminol, due to the interaction between HSA with both monoterpenes. The intrinsic fluorescence intensity of HSA was also quenched on the sequential addition of both ligands, due to change in the microenvironment of the fluorophore present in the former. Quenching of HSA by cuminaldehyde was much higher in comparison to that in the presence of cuminol. Fluorescence quenching data were analyzed using modified Stern-Volmer and Lineweaver-Burk methods, which suggested that the binding mechanism was of a static type for both ligands. In both cases, the binding was favored by the domination of hydrophobic as well as hydrogen bonding/Van der Waals forces. Both ligands partially unfolded the secondary structure of HSA, although the effect of cuminaldehyde was more pronounced, as compared to cuminol. The preferred binding site of cuminaldehyde and cuminol inside HSA was also the same; namely, drug binding site 1, located in subdomain IIA. The study showed that cuminaldehyde binds strongly with albumin as compared to its alcohol counterpart, which is due to the more hydrophobic nature of the former.","output":"Spectroscopic and Molecular Docking Investigation on the Interaction of Cumin Components with Plasma Protein: Assessment of the Comparative Interactions of Aldehyde and Alcohol with Human Serum Albumin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), attenuation of inflammatory responses that increase susceptibility to postoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality is important.

For this reason, it has very devastating effects in many areas worldwide. It is vital to detect COVID-19 diseases as quickly as possible to restrain the spread of the disease. The similarity of COVID-19 disease with other lung infections makes the diagnosis difficult. In addition, the high spreading rate of COVID-19 increased the need for a fast system for the diagnosis of cases. For this purpose, interest in various computer-aided (such as CNN, DNN, etc.) deep learning models has been increased. In these models, mostly radiology images are applied to determine the positive cases. Recent studies show that, radiological images contain important information in the detection of coronavirus. In this study, a novel artificial neural network, Convolutional CapsNet for the detection of COVID-19 disease is proposed by using chest X-ray images with capsule networks. The proposed approach is designed to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases with binary classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings), and multi-class classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings, and Pneumonia). The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.24%, and 84.22% for binary class, and multi-class, respectively. It is thought that the proposed method may help physicians to diagnose COVID-19 disease and increase the diagnostic performance.

Motivated by their performance, multiple studies have focused on designing deep convolutional neural network architectures tailored to detect COVID-19 cases from chest computerized tomography (CT) images. However, a fundamental challenge of DNN models is their inability to explain the reasoning for a diagnosis. Explainability is essential for medical diagnosis, where understanding the reason for a decision is as important as the decision itself. A variety of algorithms have been proposed that generate explanations and strive to enhance users' trust in DNN models. Yet, the influence of the generated machine learning explanations on clinicians' trust for complex decision tasks in healthcare has not been understood. This study evaluates the quality of explanations generated for a deep learning model that detects COVID-19 based on CT images and examines the influence of the quality of these explanations on clinicians trust. First, we collect radiologist-annotated explanations of the CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 to create the ground truth. We then compare ground truth explanations with machine learning explanations. Our evaluation shows that the explanations produced. by different algorithms were often correct (high precision) when compared to the radiologist annotated ground truth but a significant number of explanations were missed (significantly lower recall). We further conduct a controlled experiment to study the influence of machine learning explanations on clinicians' trust for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Our findings show that while the clinicians trust in automated diagnosis increases with the explanations, their reliance on the diagnosis reduces as clinicians are less likely to rely on algorithms that are not close to human judgement. Clinicians want higher recall of the explanations for a better understanding of an automated diagnosis system.","output":"The effect of machine learning explanations on user trust for automated diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and physiologic profile of individuals with varying degrees of severity of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children diagnosed with MIS-C admitted to a single quaternary childrens hospital from May 2020 to April 2021. We created an MIS-C severity score using the following parameters: hospital admission status (e.g., floor vs intensive care unit), need for inotropic or vasoactive medications, and need for mechanical ventilation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to associate risk factors corresponding to the MIS-C severity score. RESULTS: The study included 152 children who were followed for 14 days post hospital admission. A stepwise forward selection process identified seven physiologic variables associated with severe MIS-C according to a logistic regression. Specifically, a combination of elevated creatinine (p = 0.013), international normalized ratio (p = 0.002), brain natriuretic peptide (p = 0.001), white blood cell count (p = 0.009), ferritin (p = 0.041), respiratory rate (p = 0.047), and decreased albumin (p = 0.047) led to an excellent discrimination between mild versus severe MIS-C (AUC = 0.915).

The elevated risk of thromboembolic complications associated with the device necessitates the need for administration of antiplatelet agents. We sought to assess current dual-antiplatelet therapy practices patterns and their associated costs after PED placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS An online questionnaire that assessed dual-antiplatelet regimens after flow diversion for treatment of intracranial aneurysms was developed and disseminated to 80 neurosurgeons at major academic cerebrovascular centers. Pricing information from 2 of the largest prescription payers in Massachusetts was used to calculate the monthly cost of these agents. RESULTS Twenty-six responses (32.5%) were received. All respondents (100%) affirmed using clopidogrel and aspirin dual-antiplatelet therapy as a first-line regimen. Twenty-three (88.5%) routinely use platelet function testing. Eleven respondents (42.3%) each identified that they administer aspirin/ticagrelor and aspirin/prasugrel to clopidogrel hypo- or nonresponders. For uninsured patients, prasugrel was found to have the highest cumulative monthly cost ($471), followed by ticagrelor ($396), clopidogrel ($149), and ticlopidine ($110). CONCLUSIONS Significant heterogeneity in dual-antiplatelet regimens after PED placement and associated costs exists at major academic neurovascular centers. The most commonly used first-line dual-antiplatelet regimen consists of aspirin and clopidogrel. Two major alternate protocols involving ticagrelor and prasugrel are administered to clopidogrel hyporesponders.

The aim of the present study was to determine the function and phenotype of T cell populations associated with survival or death of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care as a result of phenotypic and functional profiling by mass cytometry. Increased frequencies of circulating, polyfunctional CD4(+)CXCR5(+)HLA-DR(+) stem cell memory T cells (Tscms) and decreased proportions of granzyme BCexpressing and perforin-expressing effector memory T cells were detected in recovered and deceased patients, respectively. The higher abundance of polyfunctional PD-L1(+)CXCR3(+)CD8(+) effector T cells (Teffs), CXCR5(+)HLA-DR(+) Tscms, and anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NC) cytokine-producing T cells permitted us to differentiate between recovered and deceased patients. The results from a principal component analysis show an imbalance in the T cell compartment that allowed for the separation of recovered and deceased patients. The paucity of circulating PD-L1(+)CXCR3(+)CD8(+) Teffs and NC-specific CD8(+) T cells accurately forecasts fatal disease outcome.

RSV is classified into two subtypes, A and B, whose predominance alternates during different epidemic seasons. The clinical impact of viral factors is controversial and many evidences suggest a critical role for the immune host response. Premature children are at the highest risk for severe RSV infection. The main aim of this study is to identify the different RSV subtypes circulating in the last three epidemic seasons and to evaluate whether any of them was associated with poor prognosis in term and preterm infants. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records for all patients aged less than one year which were hospitalized during the winter season between November 2015 and April 2018 with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and nasopharyngeal aspirates positive for RSV. RESULTS: We enrolled 422 children, of which 50 were born preterm. During the analysis period, we observed a significant increase in the rates of oxygen supplementation and admission to intensive care unit. The evidence shows an alternating pattern in the prevalence of RSV subtypes among term born; in each epidemic season, the prevalent serotype is the cause of the majority of the cases requiring intensive care. Conversely, RSV-A is always prevalent in preterm children and caused most of the cases requiring intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: During the 3 seasons analyzed, we observed an alternating prevalence of RSV A and B. While there are no differences in severity between RSV A and B in term population, RSV-A is prevalent and causes most of the severe cases in the premature group. Furthermore, an increase in RSV-related oxygen therapy and PICU admission has been documented not only in the premature population. Considering the absence of appropriate therapeutic strategies, our work emphasizes the importance of implementing prophylaxis measures against RSV and highlights the urgent need to gain knowledge about immune response to the virus, also in premature children.

As of November 18, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 1,342,709 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~2.4% and a recovery rate of ~69.6%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets with the SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses (EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine a unique anti-SARS-CoV-2 gene signature. We identified for the first time that molecular pathways for heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 genes, which are involved in severe inflammatory responses, and the FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with the cellular gene response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly IL-8 and IL-6, demonstrated key associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared among the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis shed light on genes with high interaction activity that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with rheumatoid arthritis, the AGE-RAGE signaling system, malaria, hepatitis B, and influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV were more similar than to SARS, H1N1, and MERS.

Single vessel involvement or multiple vascular occlusions may give rise to a wide variety of presentations. Any combination of vascular occlusive events may occur in the same individual and the time interval between them also varies considerably from weeks to months or even years. Deep vein thrombosis, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary embolism, is the most frequently reported manifestation in this syndrome. Cerebrovascular accidentseither stroke or transient ischemic attacksare the most common arterial thrombotic manifestations. Early and late fetal losses, premature births and pre-eclampsia are the most frequent fetal and obstetric manifestations. Additionally, several other clinical features are relatively common in these patients, i.e., thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis, heart valve lesions, hemolytic anemia, epilepsy, myocardial infarction, leg ulcers, and amaurosis fugax.

AIMS: The main aim of this service improvement project performed during the pandemic was to explore feasibility of telephone (TC) and videoconference (VC) Memory Clinic consultations. METHODS: Consecutive patients on the Memory Clinic waiting list were telephoned and offered an initial appointment by VC or TC. Data extracted included: age, internet-enabled device ownership, reason for and choice of Memory Clinic assessment. We noted Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Blind (TC) and Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination-III (VC via Attend Anywhere) scores, and feasibility of consultation. RESULTS: Out of 100 patients, 12 had a home assessment, moved away, been hospitalised, or died. 45, 21 and 6 preferred F2F, VC and TC assessments respectively. 16 were not contactable and offered a F2F appointment. The main reason for preferring F2F was non-ownership, or inability to use an internet-enabled device (80%). VC and TC preference reasons were unwillingness to come to hospital (59%), and convenience (41%). Attendance rate was 100% for VC and TC, but 77% for F2F.

Screening by means of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can shift detection to an earlier stage and reduce lung cancer mortality in high-risk individuals. However, to date, Poland, Croatia, Italy, and Romania are the only European countries to commit to large-scale implementation of targeted LDCT screening. Using a health systems approach, this article evaluates key factors needed to enable the successful implementation of screening programs across Europe. Recent literature on LDCT screening was reviewed for 10 countries (Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom) and complemented by 17 semistructured interviews with local experts. Research findings were mapped against a health systems framework adapted for lung cancer screening. The European policy landscape is highly variable, but potential barriers to implementation are similar across countries and consistent with those reported for other cancer screening programs. While consistent quality and safety of screening must be ensured across all screening centers, system factors are also important. These include appropriate data infrastructure, targeted recruitment methods that ensure equity in participation, sufficient capacity and workforce training, full integration of screening with multidisciplinary care pathways, and smoking cessation programs. Stigma and underlying perceptions of lung cancer as a self-inflicted condition are also important considerations.

Long term demographic changes, geographic shortages of care providers, and now a global pandemic contribute to this need. Telepresence provides an option for delivering this care.

To bridge this gap, we propose the use of social robot augmented telepresence (SRAT). We have constructed a demonstration SRAT system for upper extremity rehab, in which a humanoid, with a head, body, face, and arms, is attached to a mobile telepresence system, to collaborate with the patient and clinicians as an independent social entity. The humanoid can play games with the patient and demonstrate activities.These activities could be used both to perform assessments in support of self-directed rehab and to perform exercises.

The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19. This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events. Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19. Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020. We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19. We excluded studies without a comparator group. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We reported results narratively. MAIN RESULTS We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available as preprints. Studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain and the USA. All of the studies included people hospitalised with COVID-19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. The mean age of participants (reported in 6 studies) ranged from 59 to 72 years. Only three included studies reported the follow-up period, which varied from 8 to 35 days. The studies did not report on most of our outcomes of interest: need for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID-19, DVT, pulmonary embolism, adverse events, and quality of life. Anticoagulants (all types) versus no treatment (6 retrospective NRS, 5685 participants) One study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.66; 2075 participants). One study reported a reduction in mortality only in a subgroup of 395 people who required mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). Three studies reported no differences in mortality (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.92; 449 participants; unadjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 154 participants and adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.57; 192 participants). One study reported zero events in both intervention groups (42 participants). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was critical and the certainty of the evidence was very low. One NRS reported bleeding events in 3% of the intervention group and 1.9% of the control group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.71; 2773 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulants versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulants (1 retrospective NRS, 244 participants) The study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46) and a lower absolute rate of death in the therapeutic group (34.2% versus 53%). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was serious and the certainty of the evidence was low. The study also reported bleeding events in 31.7% of the intervention group and 20.5% of the control group (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.37; low-certainty evidence). Ongoing studies We found 22 ongoing studies in hospital settings (20 RCTs, 14,730 participants; 2 NRS, 997 participants) in 10 different countries (Australia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), China (3), France (2), Germany (1), Italy (4), Switzerland (1), UK (1) and USA (6)). Twelve ongoing studies plan to report mortality and six plan to report additional respiratory support. Thirteen studies are expected to be completed in December 2020 (6959 participants), eight in July 2021 (8512 participants), and one in December 2021 (256 participants). Four of the studies plan to include 1000 participants or more.

Methods: The levels of biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, lymphocytes, monocytes, and a panel of 29 cytokines, were measured in blood samples from 167 hypertensive patients included in the BRACE-CORONA trial. The primary outcome was the highest score during hospitalization on the modified WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement. The probability of progression to severe disease was estimated using a logistic regression model that included clinical variables and biomarkers associated significantly with the primary outcome. Results: During hospitalization, 13 (7.8%) patients showed progression to more severe forms of COVID-19, including three deaths. Obesity, diabetes, oxygen saturation, lung involvement on computed tomography examination, the C-reactive protein level, levels of 15 cytokines, and lymphopenia on admission were associated with progression to severe COVID-19. Elevated levels of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 (p70) combined with two or three of the abovementioned clinical comorbidities were associated strongly with progression to severe COVID-19. The risk of progression to severe disease reached 97.5% in the presence of the five variables included in our model. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 (p70) levels, in combination with clinical variables, at hospital admission are key biomarkers associated with an increased risk of disease progression in hypertensive patients with COVID-19.","output":"IL-10 and IL-12 (P70) Levels Predict the Risk of Covid-19 Progression in Hypertensive Patients: Insights From the BRACE-CORONA Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic from a prevention science perspective, including research topics, is discussed.

We describe the design, tools and context of the strategies applied. SonarQube, a tool commonly used in production environments, is used for measuring the metrics. The penalisation strategy is based on a SonarQube quality gate. The reward strategy is based on a contest, where an automatic judge tool is devised to provide an online leaderboard with a classification based on the SonarQube metrics. An empirical study is conducted to determine which of the strategies works better to help the students/trainees keep the Technical Debt low.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) play an emerging and important role in the interplay between viruses and host cells. Although the impact of host miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted, experimental data are still missing. This study started by a bioinformatics prediction of cellular miRNAs potentially targeting viral RNAs;then, a number of criteria also based on experimental evidence and virus biology were applied, giving rise to eight promising binding miRNAs. Their interaction with viral sequences was experimentally validated by transfecting luciferase-based reporter plasmids carrying viral target sequences or their inverted sequences into the lung A549 cell line. Transfection of the reporter plasmids resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity for five out of the eight potential binding sites, suggesting responsiveness to endogenously expressed miRNAs. Co-transfection of the reporter plasmids along with miRNA mimics led to a further and strong reduction of luciferase activity, validating the interaction between miR-219a-2-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-378d, miR-29a-3p, miR-15b-5p, and viral sequences. miR-15b was also able to repress plasmid-driven Spike expression. Intriguingly, the viral target sequences are fully conserved in more recent variants such as United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7 and South Africa 501Y.V2. Overall, this study provides a first experimental evidence of the interaction between specific cellular miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 sequences, thus contributing to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying virus infection and pathogenesis to envisage innovative therapeutic interventions and diagnostic tools.","output":"Human MicroRNAs Interacting With SARS-CoV-2 RNA Sequences: Computational Analysis and Experimental Target Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To test an implementation strategy, the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), to increase rates of HIV testing and counseling (HTC) in family planning (FP) clinics in Mombasa, Kenya. DESIGN Cluster randomized trial. METHODS Twenty-four FP clinics were randomized 1:1 to implementing SAIA versus usual procedures. Study staff implemented monthly SAIA cycles with FP clinic staff for 12 months. SAIA has five steps. Step 1 uses a \\"cascade analysis\\" tool to quantify the number of individuals who complete each step of a process. Step 2 involves sequential process flow mapping to identify modifiable bottlenecks in the system. Step 3 develops and implements workflow modifications to address bottlenecks. Step 4 assesses impact of the modification by recalculating the cascade analysis. Step 5 repeats the cycle. The primary outcome was the proportion of new FP clients tested for HIV during the last quarter of the trial. RESULTS During the last three months of the trial, 85% (740/868) of new FP clients were counseled for HIV in intervention clinics compared to 67% (1036/1542) in control clinics (prevalence rate ratio [PRR] 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-1.30). Forty-two percent (364/859) of FP clients were tested for HIV at intervention clinics compared to 32% (485/1521) at control clinics (PRR 1.33, 95%CI 1.16-1.52).

And the initiation of EMT in the airways depends on the epithelial disruption involving dissolution and/or destabilization of the adhesive structures between the cells and ECM. Previously, we have shown that integrin-?4, an epithelial adhesion molecule in bronchial epithelium is an important regulator of cell proliferation and wound repair in human airway epithelial cells. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate whether integrin-?4 also regulates EMT phenotypes during injury and repair in airway epithelial cells of both wild type/integrin-?4-/- mice in vivo and cultured cells treated with integrin-?4/nonsense siRNA in vitro. Methods: We induced injury to the airway epithelial cells by either repeated exposure to ozone and mechanical scratch wound, and subsequently examined the EMT-related phenotypic features in the airway epithelial cells including biomarkers expression, adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization and cell stiffness. Results: The results show that in response to injury (ozone exposure/scratch wound) and subsequent spontaneous repair (ozone withdrawal/wound healing) both in vivo and in vitro, the airway epithelial cells underwent dynamic changes in the epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers expression, adhesion and cytoskeleton structures as well as cell stiffness, all together exhibiting enhanced EMT phenotypic features after injury and reversal of the injury-induced effects during repair. Importantly, these injury/repair-associated EMT phenotypic changes in airway epithelial cells appeared to be dependent on integrin-?4 expression. More specifically, when integrin-?4 was deficient in mice (integrin-?4-/-) the repair of ozone-injured airway epithelium was impaired and the recovery of ozone-enhanced EMT biomarkers expression in the airway epithelium was delayed. Similarly, in the scratch wounded airway epithelial cells with integrin-?4 knockdown, the cells were impaired in all aspects related to EMT during wound and repair including cell proliferation, wound closure rate, adhesion and cytoskeleton protein expression (vinculin and vimentin), mesenchymal-like F-actin reorganization, cell stiffness and RhoA activation. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggested that integrin-?4 may be essential in regulating the effects of injury and repair on EMT in airway epithelial cells via influencing both the cell adhesion to ECM and cells' physical phenotypes through RhoA signaling pathway.","output":"Integrin-?4 regulates the dynamic changes of phenotypic characteristics in association with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and RhoA activity in airway epithelial cells during injury and repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corneal disease affects 12.5 million individuals worldwide, with 2 million new cases each year.

Progressive efforts have succeeded in expanding hCECs; however, the ability to expand hCECs is still limited, and new sources of CECs are being sought. Crucial advances have been achieved by the directed differentiation of embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells, but these cells have disadvantages, such as the use of oncogenes, and are still difficult to establish.

We present several protocols capable of the directed differentiation of human ADSCs to hCECs.

METHODS: We designed a randomized clinical trial enrolling 120 patients with a BMI32.5 kg/m(2) after LSG. They were randomized into two groups to be administered with omeprazole by rapid intravenous injection (group A) or by continuous micropump infusion (group B). The plasma concentration of omeprazole was monitored upon initiating administration. Change in intragastric pH and gastrointestinal symptoms during follow-up served as indicators for therapeutic evaluation. RESULTS: Patients in the two groups showed no difference in the AUC curves (P=0.25), but group A had significantly higher peak concentration (P<0.001), and shorter time to reach peak concentration after administration (P<0.001), compared to group B. Before and after the administration of omeprazole, the average change in intragastric pH was much lower in group A (0.031  0.61) than in group B (0.48  0.74) (P=0.004). The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms was similar between the two groups (P=0.85); however, the average duration of remaining symptoms was longer in group A (3.97 months; 95% CI, 2.90C5.04) than in group B (2.82 months; 95% CI, 2.01C3.63) (P=0.04).

Our objectives are to describe inter-ICU transfer patterns and evaluate the impact of timing of transfer on patient-centered outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective, quasi-experimental study. SETTING: We used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases in five states (Florida, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, and Washington) during 2015C2017. PARTICIPANTS: We selected patients with International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision codes of respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation who underwent an inter-ICU transfer (n = 6,718), grouping as early ( 2 d) and later transfers (3+ d). To control for potential selection bias, we propensity score matched patients (1:1) to model propensity for early transfer using a priori defined patient demographic, clinical, and hospital variables. MAIN OUTCOMES: Inhospital mortality, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and cumulative charges related to inter-ICU transfer. RESULTS: Six-thousand seven-hundred eighteen patients with ARF underwent inter-ICU transfer, 68% of whom (n = 4,552) were transferred early ( 2 d). Propensity score matching yielded 3,774 well-matched patients for this study. Unadjusted outcomes were all superior in the early versus later transfer cohort: inhospital mortality (24.4% vs 36.1%; p < 0.0001), length of stay (8 vs 22 d; p < 0.0001), and cumulative charges ($118,686 vs $308,977; p < 0.0001). Through doubly robust multivariable modeling with random effects at the state level, we found patients who were transferred early had a 55.8% reduction in risk of inhospital mortality than those whose transfer was later (relative risk, 0.442; 95% CI, 0.403C0.497). Additionally, the early transfer cohort had lower HLOS (20.7 fewer days [13.0 vs 33.7; p < 0.0001]), and lower cumulative charges ($66,201 less [$192,182 vs $258,383; p < 0.0001]).

Objectives Our study investigates the role of bone setting in Tanzania through patient utilization and perspectives. Methods We surveyed 212 patients at the outpatient orthopaedic clinic at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) in Moshi, Tanzania. Surveys were either self-administered or physician-administered. Summary statistics were calculated using XLSTAT. Open responses were analyzed using a deductive framework method. Results Of all surveys, 6.3% (n=13) reported utilizing traditional bone setting for their injury prior to presenting to KCMC. Of the self-administered surveys, 13.6% (n=6) reported utilizing bone setting compared to 4.3% (n=7) of the physician-administered surveys (p=0.050). Negative perceptions of bone setting were more common than positive perceptions and the main reason patients did not utilize bone setting was concern for competency (35.8%, n=67). Conclusion Our study found lower bone setting utilization than expected considering the reliance of Tanzanians on traditional care reported in the literature. This suggests patients utilizing traditional care for musculoskeletal injury are not seeking allopathic care; therefore, collaboration with bone setters could expand allopathic access to these patients.

DNA polymerases select against NTPs by using steric gates to exclude the 2 OH, but RNAPs have to employ alternative selection strategies. In single-subunit RNAPs, a conserved Tyr residue discriminates against 2dNTPs, whereas selectivity mechanisms of multi-subunit RNAPs remain hitherto unknown. Here we show that a conserved Arg residue uses a two-pronged strategy to select against 2dNTPs in multi-subunit RNAPs. The conserved Arg interacts with the 2OH group to promote NTP binding, but selectively inhibits incorporation of 2dNTPs by interacting with their 3OH group to favor the catalytically-inert 2-endo conformation of the deoxyribose moiety. This deformative action is an elegant example of an active selection against a substrate that is a substructure of the correct substrate. Our findings provide important insights into the evolutionary origins of biopolymers and the design of selective inhibitors of viral RNAPs.","output":"The mechanism of the nucleo-sugar selection by multi-subunit RNA polymerases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and control measures adopted by countries globally can lead to stress and anxiety. Investigating the coping strategies to this unprecedented crisis is essential to guide mental health intervention and public health policy. This study examined how people are coping with the COVID-19 crisis in Ghana and identify factors influencing it. METHODS: This study was part of a multinational online cross-sectional survey on Personal and Family Coping with COVID-19 in the Global South. The study population included adults, &#8805;18 years and residents in Ghana. Respondents were recruited through different platforms, including social media and phone calls. The questionnaire was composed of different psychometrically validated instruments with coping as the outcome variable measured on the ordinal scale with 3 levels, namely, Not well or worse, Neutral, and Well or better. An ordinal logistic regression model using proportional odds assumption was then applied. RESULTS: A total of 811 responses were included in the analysis with 45.2% describing their coping level as well/better, 42.4% as neither worse nor better and 12.4% as worse/not well. Many respondents (46.9%) were between 25-34 years, 50.1% were males while 79.2% lived in urban Ghana. Having pre-existing conditions increased the chances of not coping well (aOR = 1.86, 95%CI: 1.15-3.01). Not being concerned about supporting the family financially (aOR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.06-2.68) or having the feeling that life is better during the pandemic (aOR = 2.37, 95%CI: 1.26-4.62) increased chances of coping well. Praying (aOR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.43-0.90) or sleeping (aOR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.34-0.89) more during the pandemic than before reduces coping. CONCLUSION: In Ghana, during the COVID-19 pandemic, financial security and optimism about the disease increase one's chances of coping well while having pre-existing medical conditions, praying and sleeping more during the pandemic than before reduces one's chances of coping well. These findings should be considered in planning mental health and public health intervention/policy.","output":"Coping strategies adapted by Ghanaians during the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Matthew Carmona's article focuses on the crucial resources and responsibilities that market and state actors have in shaping high streets.

Recent experience with CoV-2 infection and difficulties in prevention and therapy of COVID-19 point out the lack of specific antiviral drugs, leading to the use of repurposed drugs. A number of drugs, registered for various disorders for decades including antidepressants were considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID. Preclinical studies verified the antiviral effects of some antidepressants, first of all fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These drugs inhibit the entry of viruses into the cell, arrest their intracellular pathway, and block their replication if used in the dose of usual human therapy, according to most of the studies. However, there are only a few in vivo studies available on the antiviral effects of antidepressants. According to observation of French clinicians in the course of the pandemia in COVID-19 therapy, epidemiological studies of the morbidity and mortality of patients on antidepressants, the association of SSRI use and reduced intubation and mortality confirm the results of in vitro trials in clinical practice. However, antidepressants are not yet registered for infectious diseases, their beneficial effects can be exploited in case of comorbidity or post-COVID syndrome.

Due to the high adsorption properties, magnetic biochar proved to be efficient in the sorption of heavy metals and nutrients. Although there are several studies on development of magnetic biochars, there is a lack of research on development of high-performance magnetic biochar from food waste for removal applications. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at preparing new classes of magnetic biochar derived from tea waste (TBC) for removal of heavy metals (Ni(2+), Co(2+)), and nutrients (NH(4)(+) and PO(4)(3?)) from water and effective fertilizer (source of NH(4)(+) and PO(4)(3?)). METHODS: Standard carbonization process and ultrafast microwave have been used for fabrication of TBCs. The removal of nickel, cobalt as the representatives of heavy metals, and over-enriched nutrients (NH(4)(+) and PO(4)(3?)) from water were tested and the removal kinetics, mechanism, and the effect of pH, dissolved organic matter and ionic strength were studied. Simultaneously, possible fertilizing effect of TBC for controlled release of nutrients (NH(4)(+) and PO(4)(3?)) in soil was investigated. RESULTS: Up to 147.84 mg g(?1) of Ni(2+) and 160.00 mg g(?1) of Co(2+) were adsorbed onto tested biochars. The process of co-adsorption was also efficient (at least 131.68 mg g(?1) of Co(2+) and 160.00 mg g(?1) of Ni(2+)). The highest adsorbed amount of NH(4)(+) was 49.43 mg g(?1), and the highest amount of PO(4)(3?) was 112.61 mg g(?1). The increase of the solution ionic strength and the presence of natural organic matter affected both the amount of adsorbed Ni(2+)+Co(2+) and the reaction mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that magnetic nanoparticle impregnated onto tea biochar, can be a very promising alternative for wastewater treatment especially considering removal of heavy metals and nutrients and slow-release fertilizer to improve the composition of soil elements.","output":"Sustainable synthesis of rose flower-like magnetic biochar from tea waste for environmental applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Potential risks of COVID-19 spread during minimally invasive procedures caused several concerns among surgeons, despite the lack of high-level evidence.

It is unclear if chemotherapy per se increases the overall risk in this population. In our study, we analyzed retrospective COVID-19 data linked to oncological information systems to evaluate outcomes in COVID-19 cancer patients under chemotherapy. We identified 681 patients with a past history of chemotherapy. Patients in active chemotherapy did not have an increased mortality compared to non-active chemotherapy COVID-19 cases. We identified the use of topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents as protective factors, while palliative intent of treatment and hematological neoplasms were risk factors. ABSTRACT: Background: Cancer patients present a distinct vulnerability to COVID-19. It is unclear if chemotherapy could accentuate the overall risk in these patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis linking COVID-19 data and oncological information systems to compare lethality in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy before COVID-19. We considered patients who received chemotherapy in the last 30 days as in active treatment, and patients who did not receive drugs in this period as non-active treatment for propensity-score pair matching. We also tested the influence of baseline variables in our results in a multivariate model. Results: 66.1% (162/246) of patients in matched active chemotherapy died vs. 70.2% (172/246) in the matched non-active chemotherapy group. The risk of death was positively associated with palliative intent of treatment and hematologic neoplasms. Being in active chemotherapy was not associated with increased mortality compared to non-active treatment. We also noted in exploratory propensity-score matchings that the use of alkylating agents (odds ratio [OR] 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21C0.70) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14C0.56) were protective factors.

We hypothesised that postponements due to the pandemic were associated with higher levels of psychological distress than prepandemic postponements. METHODS A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted among patients in whom elective cardiac surgery was postponed. Patients who received information regarding a new date of surgery prior to the pandemic were compared with patients postponed during the pandemic without information regarding a new date of surgery. Data were collected from patient records, validated questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS Out of 55 postponed patients, 21 experienced prepandemic postponement. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding the psychological measures before their rescheduled operation. However, patients in both groups reported high levels of anxiety and depression with > 60% indicative of potentially positive diagnoses. No differences were found in mortality across groups and no patients developed severe complications. Interviews showed that patients in the COVID-19 group felt immediate relief at postponement and engaged in a meaning-making process with respect to their ability to tolerate postponement in order to reassure themselves and their relatives. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences were found in psychological distress between the patients of the two groups. However, both groups experienced high levels of psychological distress.

Although previous studies have investigated patients with cardiac events and pneumonia, they have not studied the burden of disease in depth at the population level. The objective of this study is to provide population-level data on patients 60 years old who were hospitalized with pneumonia with comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Spain over a period of 19 years (1997C2015). METHODS: This is a retrospective study based on a minimum basic data set (MBDS). The following variables were collected: age, sex, re-admission (yes/no), hospital stay (days), and other diagnoses. Hospitalization rate (per 100,000 inhabitants), mortality rate (per 100,000 inhabitants), and lethality rate (%) were obtained, and the 95% confidence interval of each rate was calculated. Analyses were stratified by age (categorized into 4-year intervals), sex, and year of admission. Differences were assessed for significance with the chi-squared test for proportions and the Poisson model for rates. Logistic regression was run with in-hospital survival as the dependent variable and sex, age, year of admission, and re-admission (yes/no) as the independent variables. The level of significance was p < 0.005. RESULTS: The total number of patients 60 years old hospitalized for pneumonia with comorbid CVD was 99,346. The rates of hospitalization, mortality, and lethality increased significantly with age over the 19 years. Men had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. The probability of a patient with CAP and CVD dying was correlated with male sex, older age, hospital re-admission, and having been hospitalized earlier in the study period.

However, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report found that health care providers were adhering poorly to guideline recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of men with hypogonadism. Methods A prior authorization drug request (PADR) testosterone order template was implemented at VA Puget Sound Health Care System. A retrospective chart review was conducted in veterans who were prescribed testosterone and had no previous prescription in the prior year. Eligible veterans were evaluated 6 months before (pretemplate) and after (posttemplate) implementation of the template, and 3 months after removal of alternative testosterone ordering pathways (posttemplate/no alternative ordering pathways) that were discovered after PADR template implementation. We assessed the proportion of eligible veterans with documented symptoms of testosterone deficiency; appropriate diagnosis and evaluation of hypogonadism with  2 low serum testosterone and LH and FSH levels; and discussion of risks and benefits of testosterone treatment. Results In the pretemplate period, only 20 of 80 eligible veterans (25%) had a completed PADR for testosterone. In the posttemplate period, 18 of 45 (44%) eligible veterans had a completed PADR but only 7 (17%) had the testosterone order template completed. In the posttemplate/no alternative ordering pathways period, 13 (68%) and 11 (58%) of 19 eligible veterans had a completed PADR and testosterone order template, respectively. In all 3 periods, documentation of clinical symptoms and a discussion of risks and benefits were similar.

While such dwellings and settlements pose a number of established risks to the health of their residents, the present study aimed to explore whether they might also undermine the potential impact of regulations intended to safeguard public health, such as the stringent lockdown restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. Using a representative sample of 1,381 South African households surveyed in May-June 2021, the present study found that respondents in temporary structures/shacks were more likely to report non-compliance (or difficulty in complying) with lockdown restrictions when compared to those living in traditional/formal houses/flats/rooms/hostels (OR:1.61; 95%CI:1.06-2.45). However, this finding was substantially attenuated and lost precision following adjustment for preceding sociodemographic and economic determinants of housing quality (adjusted OR:1.20; 95%CI:0.78-1.87). Instead, respondents were far more likely to report non-compliance (or difficulty in complying) with COVID-19 lockdown restrictions if their dwellings lacked private/indoor toilet facilities (adjusted OR:1.56; 95%CI:1.08,2.22) or they were Black/African, young, poorly educated and under-employed (regardless of: their socioeconomic position, or whether they resided in temporary structures/shacks, respectively).

Prior research suggests starting a new job is an uncertain experience; we theorize that the COVID-19 pandemic creates additional environmental stressors that affect new hire engagement. First, we hypothesize that the occurrence of COVID-19 and unemployment rates relate negatively to engagement. Second, we theorize that the effects of the pandemic become more disruptive on new hire engagement as they gain tenure within the organization. Third, drawing from strategic management theory, we test whether States that introduce stronger COVID-19 policies help enhance the engagement of new hires. Examining a U.S. national sample of 12,577 newly hired (90 days or less) quick service restaurant employees across 9 months (January-September, 2020), we find support for these hypotheses. Subsequent model comparisons suggest there may be health stressors that shape engagement more strongly than purely economic stressors. These findings may be important because they highlight the experiences of workers more likely to be exposed to the pandemic and affected by COVID-related policies. Should the results generalize to other samples and jobs, this study offers potentially new research directions for understanding relationships between macro stressors and new hire perceptions and socialization. It also offers practical implications by helping organizations understand the importance of explicitly managing job insecurity, particularly in terms of COVID-19 policy.

In a previous study, we mapped the use of ORS treatment subnationally and found that ORS coverage increased over time, while the use of home-made alternatives or recommended home fluids (RHF) decreased, in many countries. These patterns were particularly striking within Senegal, Mali, and Sierra Leone. It was unclear, however, whether ORS replaced RHF in these locations or if children were left untreated, and if these patterns were associated with health policy changes. METHODS: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from household surveys to map the percentage of children with diarrhea that received (1) any ORS, (2) only RHF, or (3) no oral rehydration treatment between 2000 and 2018. This approach allowed examination of whether RHF was replaced with ORS before and after interventions, policies, and external events that may have impacted healthcare access. RESULTS: We found that RHF was replaced with ORS in most Sierra Leone districts, except those most impacted by the Ebola outbreak. In addition, RHF was replaced in northern but not in southern Mali, and RHF was not replaced anywhere in Senegal. In Senegal, there was no statistical evidence that a national policy promoting ORS use was associated with increases in coverage. In Sierra Leone, ORS coverage increased following a national policy change that abolished health costs for children. CONCLUSIONS: Children in parts of Mali and Senegal have been left behind during ORS scale-up. Improved messaging on effective diarrhea treatment and/or increased ORS access such as through reducing treatment costs may be needed to prevent child deaths in these areas.

This need has led to the emergence of a variety of neutralization assays. Head-to-head evaluation of different SARS-CoV-2 neutralization platforms could facilitate comparisons across studies and laboratories. Five neutralization assays were compared using 40 plasma samples from convalescent individuals with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): four cell-based systems using either live recombinant SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viral particles created with lentivirus (LV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging and one surrogate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based test that measures inhibition of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding its receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Vero cells, Vero E6 cells, HEK293T cells expressing hACE2, and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 were tested. All cell-based assays showed 50% neutralizing dilution (ND(50)) geometric mean titers (GMTs) that were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81 to 0.89) and ranged within 3.4-fold. The live virus assay and LV pseudovirus assays with HEK293T/hACE2 cells showed very similar mean titers, 141 and 178, respectively. ND(50) titers positively correlated with plasma IgG targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD (r = 0.63 to 0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46 to 0.73). ND(80) GMTs mirrored ND(50) data and showed similar correlation between assays and with IgG concentrations. The VSV pseudovirus assay and LV pseudovirus assay with HEK293T/hACE2 cells in low- and high-throughput versions were calibrated against the WHO SARS-CoV-2 IgG standard.

There is insufficient evidence about if and how smoking affects the risk of COVID-19 infection, and the reports on whether smoking increases or reduces the risk of respiratory infections, are contradictory. Therefore, the current study was designed to determine the effects of nicotine consumption on the infectivity of COVID-19. Methods: We performed in silico computer simulation-based study. The structures of SARS-CoV2spike ectodomain, and its receptor ACE2, were obtained from PDB. The structure of nicotine and its metabolites NNK and NNAL were obtained from the PubChem chemical database. After optimization, they were interacted using AutoDock 4.2, to see the effect of nicotine, NNK, or NNAL presence on the docking of viral spike protein to its receptor ACE2. Results: ACE2 vs spike protein interaction results were used as a control (ZDOCK score 1498.484, with four hydrogen bonds). The NNK+ACE2 vs spike protein docking formed 10 hydrogen bonds with the highest ZDOCK score of 1515.564. NNAL+ ACE2 vs spike protein interaction formed eleven hydrogen bonds with the ZDOCK score of 1499.371. Nicotine+ACE2 vs spike protein docking showed the lowest ZDOCK score of 1496.302 and formed 8 hydrogen bonds. Whereas, NNK+spike vs ACE2 interaction had a ZDOCK score of 1498.490 and formed eight hydrogen bonds. NNAL+spike vs ACE2 docking formed eleven hydrogen bonds with a ZDOCK score of 1498.482. And Nicotine+spike vs ACE2 interaction showed a ZDOCK score of 1498.488 and formed 9 hydrogen bonds. Conclusions: The binding of nicotine to either spike of virus or its receptor ACE2 is not affecting the viral docking with the receptor. But binding of NNK, a metabolite of nicotine, is facilitating the viral docking with its receptor indicating that smoking may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Smoking May Increase the Risk of COVID-19 Infection: Evidence from In Silico Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In India, there is increasing number of children with development delay and vision impairment with or without additional disabilities due to prematurity, brain damage, cerebral palsy, or genetic syndromes.

RESULTS Eighty-three articles fulfilled the search criteria. Scrotal MRI is mainly recommended after inconclusive US findings or inconsistent with the clinical examination and should be asked in the following cases: differentiation between intratesticular and paratesticular lesions (in rare cases of uncertain US findings), characterization of paratesticular and intratesticular lesions (when US findings are indeterminate), discrimination between germ cell and sex cord-stromal testicular tumors, local staging of testicular malignancies (in patients planned for testis-sparing surgery), differentiation between seminomas and nonseminomatous tumors (when immediate chemotherapy is planned and orchiectomy is delayed), assessment of acute scrotum and scrotal trauma (rarely needed, in cases of nondiagnostic US findings).

Despite the ecological importance of this species as a major insect predator, and the particular susceptibility of lasiurine bats to wind turbine strikes, our understanding of hoary bat ecology, physiology, and behavior remains poor. METHODS: To better understand adaptive evolution in this lineage, we used whole-genome sequencing to identify protein-coding sequence and explore signatures of positive selection. Gene models were predicted with Maker and compared to seven well-annotated and phylogenetically representative species. Evolutionary rate analysis was performed with PAML. RESULTS: Of 9,447 single-copy orthologous groups that met evaluation criteria, 150 genes had a significant excess of nonsynonymous substitutions along the L. cinereus branch (P < 0.001 after manual review of alignments). Selected genes as a group had biased expression, most strongly in thymus tissue. We identified 23 selected genes with reported immune functions as well as a divergent paralog of Steep1 within suborder Yangochiroptera. Seventeen genes had roles in lipid and glucose metabolic pathways, partially overlapping with 15 mitochondrion-associated genes; these adaptations may reflect the metabolic challenges of hibernation, long-distance migration, and seasonal variation in prey abundance. The genomic distribution of positively selected genes differed significantly from background expectation by discrete KolmogorovCSmirnov test (P < 0.001).

In fact, the stimulation of social and psychological wellbeing benefits of non-native language learning may consequently also generate multilingual cognitive gains in healthy older generation. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Cognitive, Mental and Social Benefits of Online Non-native Language Programs for Healthy Older People"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in African populations with a high burden of infectious disease comorbidities such as HIV. The kinetics, magnitude and duration of virus-specific antibodies and the underlying B cell responses in people living with HIV (PLWH) in sub-Saharan Africa have not been fully characterized. METHODS: We longitudinally followed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and characterized SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies weekly for a month, and then at 3 months post diagnosis. 7/30 (41.7%) were PLWH, 83% (25/30) of which were on ART and with full HIV suppression. Potency of convalescent plasma neutralization was determined using a live virus neutralization assay and antibody secreting cell population frequencies were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Similar seroconversion rates, time to peak antibody titer, peak magnitude and durability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, IgA, were observed in HIV uninfected and PLWH with complete HIV suppression on ART. In addition, similar neutralization potency against an isolate of SARS-CoV-2, circulating at the time of sampling in the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in South Africa was observed in both groups. Loss of IgA was significantly associated with age (p=0.023) and a previous diagnosis of TB (p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Similar antibody response kinetics and neutralization potency in HIV negative and PLWH on stable ART in an African setting suggests that COVID-19 natural infections may confer comparable antibody immunity in these groups. This provides hope that COVID-19 vaccines will be effective in PLWH on stable ART.","output":"Similar antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in HIV uninfected and infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy during the first South African infection wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being multinational and complex, global supply chains may be extremely vulnerable to sudden crises, such as the recent covid-19 pandemic. In addition to issues related to the health and lives of people, the pandemic has also had negative impacts on supply chains, and many companies dependent on them have been struggling. The ability to recover from disruptions is called resilience. In this study, the resilience of supply chains is evaluated by studying three globally operating Finnish b2b manufacturing companies during the covid-19 pandemic. The empirical research was conducted by interviewing the companies' supply chain and purchasing operations representatives, analysing the results and comparing the results to the literature. As a result, essential methods to survive during crises and increase the resilience of supply chains were discovered. The results can be utilised in preparing for future crises.

This chapter will review SARS-CoV-2 associated cutaneous findings, including incidence and relevance to the pediatric population. RECENT FINDINGS The most commonly reported cutaneous findings described for COVID-19 in adults and children were chilblains-like lesions, followed by maculopapular eruption, urticarial lesions, vesicular lesions, and livedoid lesions. Children can also present with erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions and skin findings associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). SUMMARY There are numerous cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, some of which are unique to children such as EM-like lesions and skin findings for MIS-C. Livedoid lesions do not commonly occur in the pediatric population. In mild cases, supportive care is indicated, whereas severe cases warrant intensive care and hospitalization.","output":"Covid-19 skin manifestations: an update."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teenagers are highly susceptible to mental health issues and this problem has been exacerbated by the quarantine restrictions of COVID-19. This study evaluated the use of Heartfulness Meditation and Audio Brainwave Entrainment to help teenagers cope with mental health issues. It used 30-min Heartfulness meditation and 15-min brainwave entrainment sessions with binaural beats and isochronic tones three times a week for 4 weeks. Using a pretest-posttest methodology, participants were asked to complete a survey battery including the Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index, Perceived Stress Scale, Patient Health Question-9, Profile of Mood States, and Cambridge Brain Health assessment. Participants (n = 40) were divided into four experimental groups: the control group (n = 9), Audio Brainwave Entrainment group (n = 9), Heartfulness Meditation group (n = 10), and a combined group (n = 12), for a 4-week intervention. Data were analyzed with paired t-tests. The singular Audio Brainwave Entrainment group did not see statistically significant improvements, nor did any of the intervention groups for brain health (p > 0.05). This study, however, proved the efficacy of a 4-week Heartfulness Meditation program to regulate overall mood (p = 0.00132), stress levels (p = 0.0089), state depression (POMS; p = 0.0037), and anger (p = 0.002).

Methods: The data of a total of 41 eyes of 40 patients (20 female, 20 male) who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and epiretinal membrane (ERM) peeling with/without internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling between November 2001 and October 2005 at Beyoglu Eye Training and Research Hospital with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were included in this retrospective study. The patients' best corrected visual acuity (BCVA; Snellen) and the biomicroscopic, funduscopic, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings measured preoperatively and at month 1,3,6, and a final visit were recorded. The surgical technique (partial 25-gauge vs 20-gauge), ILM peeling, intraoperative dyes, and the etiology of the ERM were evaluated as separate factors in the surgical outcome. Intraoperative, peroperative, and postoperative complications were assessed and compared. Results: The mean age of the study group participants was 63.5614.96 years. The mean BCVA had increased from 0.280.149 to 0.350.24 Snellen lines (p=0.028) at the 6-month visit. In all, 18 of 41 eyes (43.9%) had gained 2 Snellen lines at the final visit. Cataract progression was detected in 17 cases (54.8%) of phakic eyes. The incidence of ERM recurrence was significantly greater in the ILM Intact group (37% vs 0%) than in the ILM Peeled group (p=0.009). There was no significant difference in anatomical or functional outcome between the partial 25-gauge and 20-gauge PPV techniques. Conclusion: ILM peeling significantly reduced ERM recurrence.

A novel 1.2-kb gene, located between the genes for the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins, was identified. This gene, the 3'-most 0.5 kb of which is also present in the genome of the equine torovirus isolate Berne virus (BEV), codes for a class I membrane protein displaying 30% sequence identity with the hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs) of coronaviruses and influenza C viruses. Heterologous expression of the BoTV HE gene yielded a 65,000-molecular weight N-glycosylated protein displaying acetylesterase activity. Serologic evidence indicates that the HE homolog is expressed during the natural infection and represents a prominent antigen. By using an antiserum raised against residues 13 to 130 of HE, the HE protein was detected in radioiodinated, sucrose gradient-purified BoTV preparations. Formal evidence that HE is a structural protein was provided by immunoelectron microscopy. In addition to the large, 17- to 20-nm spikes, BoTV virions possess shorter surface projections (6 nm on average). We postulate that these surface projections, which are absent from the BEV virion, are composed of the BoTV HE homolog. The HE gene, which has now been demonstrated in three different virus genera, is a showpiece example of modular evolution.","output":"Hemagglutinin-esterase, a novel structural protein of torovirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article mainly explores the psychological state of occupational exposure of medical staff in operation room contaminated with novel coronavirus, and provides targeted suggestions for mental health service of medical staff so as to maintain their physical and mental health.

Older adults are vulnerable to social isolation and loneliness, which pose significant health risks comparable to those of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure. A lack of social connectedness is also correlated with higher mortality rates even when controlling for other factors such as age and comorbid conditions. The purpose of this mini review was to explore the emerging concepts of older adults' use of commercially available artificial intelligent virtual home assistants (VHAs; e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Nest), and its relationship to social isolation and loneliness. A secondary purpose was to identify potential areas for further research. Results suggest that VHAs are perceived by many older adult users as companions and improve social connectedness and reduce loneliness. Available studies are exploratory and descriptive and have limited generalizability due to small sample sizes, however, similar results were reported across several studies conducted in differing countries. Privacy concerns and other ethical issues and costs associated with VHA use were identified as potential risks to older adults' VHA adoption and use. Older adults who were using VHAs expressed the need and desire for more structured training on device use. Future research with stronger methods, including prospective, longitudinal, and randomized study designs are needed.

This study assessed the present status of M. pneumoniae infection in Japan and clinical end-points to distinguish children with MR-M. pneumoniae. METHODS: During an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infections in Fukuoka, Japan in 2010C11, a total of 105 children with clinically suspected M. pneumoniae infection were enrolled. M. pneumoniae was analyzed for macrolide resistance in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Sixty -five patients with PCR positive for M. pneumoniae were analyzed with regard to clinical symptoms, efficacy of several antimicrobial agents and several laboratory data. RESULTS: Causative pathogens were detected in 81.0% (85 of 105) and M. pneumoniae was identified 61.9% (65 of 105). The resistance rate of M. pneumoniae was 89.2% (58 of 65) in this general pediatric outpatient setting. Patients infected with MR-M. pneumoniae showed longer times to resolution of fever and required frequent changes of the initially prescribed macrolide to another antimicrobial agent. We observed three different genotypes of M. pneumoniae including the rarely reported A2063T mutation (A2063G: 31 strains, A2063T: 27 strains, no mutation: 7 strains). Drug susceptibility testing showed different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for each genotype. Serum IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IP-10 levels were higher in patients with MR-genotypes than in those infected with no-mutation strains (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Macrolide resistance is more common than previously thought and a small epidemic of rarely reported A2063T mutation was observed in Fukuoka, Japan.

Basing the prior on the reproduction rate during lockdown instead on the CoMix study results for the reduction in social contacts under lockdown, and assuming the reproduction number scales with the number of social contacts, provides a much more restrictive upper limit on the transmission rate by contaminated objects of fewer than 1 in 30 per day per infectious person (95% CL). Applied to postal deliveries and groceries, the upper limit on the fomite transmission rate corresponds to a probability below 1 in 70 (95% CL) that a contaminated object transmits the infection.

RESULTS Of 5064 participants, 90.6% (4562/5034) were women, mean age was 37.2  11 years. Most questions had a completion rate above 87% (non-completion rate ranging from 0-12.7%). Twenty percent were health-care professionals (993/5046). Surgical and cloth masks were the most common personal protective equipment type, whereas protective eyewear and FFP2/FFP3 masks were mostly used by health-care professionals. About 97% (1814/1870) of migraine and headache participants reported aggravation of pre-existing headaches with personal protective equipment use, and 56% (2476/4420) had de novo headaches. Participants with de novo headaches had a higher frequency of pre-existing migraine (1118/1226, 91.2% vs 1408/1600, 88%, P = .042), and wore personal protective equipment for longer periods of time (7  2 h 42 vs 6  2 h 54 min per day, P < .001).

Our aim was to evaluate the results of embolization only in a cohort of patients who were enrolled in the A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) study at 39 clinical sites in 9 countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the rates and severity of stroke and death in patients who underwent embolization only. Events were identified through in-person neurologic follow-up visits performed at 6-month intervals during the first 2 years and annually, with telephone contact every 6 months thereafter. All event-related data were reviewed by independent adjudicators. RESULTS Among 30 patients who had embolization planned, 26 underwent embolization only. A total of 13 stroke events were reported in the follow-up period among 26 subjects (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or both in 4, 7, and 2 subjects, respectively). The adverse event occurred after the first embolization in 11 of 13 patients. One patient had a major motor deficit, and 2 patients developed major visual field deficits. One event was fatal. The modified Rankin Scale score was 0-2 at last follow-up in 11 of the 12 stroke survivors. Estimated stroke-free survival was 46% at 12 months.

Amyloidoses are classified into two as systemic and localized. Out of the systemic forms, AL (light chain) amyloidosis is the most prevalent type; however, amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is more frequently encountered in the rheumatology practice. AA amyloidosis stands out as a major complication of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Splenic and renal involvement is more likely in FMF-associated systemic amyloidosis. The involvement of thyroid and adrenal glands has also been described, although infrequently. Amyloidoses have a heterogeneous plethora of clinical manifestations, with certain phenotypes associated with specific amyloid forms. Gynecological amyloidosis is a rare condition. Uterine involvement may occur in a localized fashion or may also arise as a part of systemic involvement, albeit at a lesser ratio. Several cases of uterine AL amyloidosis have been documented so far as an organ involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis. On the other hand, uterine amyloidosis associated with AA amyloidosis has been described merely in one case with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The susceptibility of asthmatics to develop an exacerbation when they present with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of asthmatic patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who required hospitalisation during the spring 2020 outbreak in Paris, France. METHODS: A prospective cohort follow-up was carried out from March 15 to April 15, 2020 in Bictre Hospital, University Paris-Saclay, France. All hospitalised patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported a history of asthma were included. RESULTS: Among 768 hospitalised patients, 37 (4.8%) reported a history of asthma, which had been previously confirmed by a pulmonologist in 85% of cases. Patients were mainly female (70%), non-smokers (85%), with a median age of 54 years (interquartile range, IQR 42C67). None of them presented with an asthma exacerbation. Twenty-two (59%) had major comorbidities and 31 (84%) had a body mass index 25 kgm(?2). The most common comorbidities were obesity (36%), hypertension (27%) and diabetes (19%). All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography of the chest. Eosinopenia was a typical biologic feature with a median count of 0/mm3 (IQR 0C0). Eleven patients (30%) were admitted in intensive care unit with three death (8.1%) occurring in the context of comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asthmatics were not overrepresented among patients with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation.

This reveals a need for more attention to political aspects of health outcome inequities. As advocates for health equity, nurses can join in recent scholarship and activism concerning the political determinants of health. In this paper, we examine recent work on the political determinants of health with an aim to add two things. First, we seek to build further on the notion of \\"political\\" determinants of health by distinguishing policy and governance structures from dynamics of politicization through appeal to critical disabilities studies. Second, we seek to apply this further nuanced approach to challenge rhetorical uses of \\"vulnerable populations,\\" where this phrase serves to misrecognize systemic institutionalized forces that actively exploit and marginalize people and groups. By refocusing attention to political systems organized around and perpetuating inequitable health outcomes, nurses and other health care professionals-as well as those whom they serve-can concentrate their effort and power to act on political determinants of health in bringing about more equitable health outcomes.","output":"Nursing is never neutral: Political determinants of health and systemic marginalization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naturally-occurring attenuated strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are being developed as vaccine vectors for use in poultry and humans. However, some NDV strains, such as Beaudette C (BC), may retain too much virulence in poultry for safe use, and more highly attenuated strains may be suboptimally immunogenic. We therefore modified the BC strain by changing the multibasic cleavage site sequence of the F protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strain LaSota. Additionally, the BC, F, and HN proteins were modified in several ways to enhance virus replication. These modified BC-derived vectors and the LaSota strain were engineered to express the hemagglutin (HA) protein of H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV). In general, the modified BC-based vectors expressing HA replicated better than LaSota/HA, and expressed higher levels of HA protein. Pathogenicity tests indicated that all the modified viruses were highly attenuated in chickens. Based on in vitro characterization, two of the modified BC vectors were chosen for evaluation in chickens as vaccine vectors against H5N1 HPAIV A/Vietnam/1203/04. Immunization of chickens with rNDV vector vaccines followed by challenge with HPAIV demonstrated high levels of protection against clinical disease and mortality. However, only those chickens immunized with modified BC/HA in which residues 271C330 from the F protein had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the NDV AKO strain conferred complete protection against challenge virus shedding. Our findings suggest that this modified rNDV can be used safely as a vaccine vector with enhanced replication, expression, and protective efficacy in avian species, and potentially in humans.","output":"Modified Newcastle disease virus vectors expressing the H5 hemagglutinin induce enhanced protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown in Germany had an impact on all areas of social life.

To empirically test this model, data was collected through a survey from the employees of public/private emergency and disaster management organisations during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The results confirm that ESM usage indirectly affects decision-making effectiveness, which ultimately improves organisations operational and social performance. Organisational agility and ESM infrastructure are strong mediators of the link between ESM usage and decision-making effectiveness, while the mediating effect of knowledge sharing through ESM is weaker. In addition to presenting theoretical rationale and empirical evidence, the study enables us to outline policy guidelines for social media managers of disaster management organisations, who must develop ESM strategies in order to boost operational and social performance.

This study examined the prevalence of COVID-19-related workplace bullying and patient aggression and its association with psychological distress among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. This was a cross-sectional study conducted from May 22 to 26, 2020, inviting participants (n = 1,421) from an online survey of full-time employees. We limited the sample to healthcare professionals for further analyses. Using an online self-report questionnaire, workplace bullying and patient aggression related to COVID-19 was measured using nine items with dichotomous response options. Psychological distress was measured using the Japanese version of Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Among 1,032 participants (72.6%) who completed the survey, 111 healthcare professionals were identified.

This review examines the current impact of chemoprevention on the emergence and spread of drug resistant malaria, and the impact of drug resistance on the efficacy of each of the chemoprevention strategies currently recommended by the World Health Organization, namely, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp); intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi); seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC); and mass drug administration (MDA) for the reduction of disease burden in emergency situations. While the use of drugs to prevent malaria often results in increased prevalence of genetic mutations associated with resistance, malaria chemoprevention interventions do not inevitably lead to meaningful increases in resistance, and even high rates of resistance do not necessarily impair chemoprevention efficacy. At the same time, it can reasonably be anticipated that, over time, as drugs are widely used, resistance will generally increase and efficacy will eventually be lost. Decisions about whether, where and when chemoprevention strategies should be deployed or changed will continue to need to be made on the basis of imperfect evidence, but practical considerations such as prevalence patterns of resistance markers can help guide policy recommendations.","output":"Malaria chemoprevention and drug resistance: a review of the literature and policy implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Assessment of commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for their capacity to provide reliable information on sera neutralizing activity is an emerging need. We evaluated the performance of two commercially-available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC) (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Patients and Methods: Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). Results: Overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM and 92.2% for the NtAb assay. Sensitivity increased for all assays in sera collected beyond day 14 after symptoms onset (93.9%, 79.6%,93.9% and 93.9%, respectively). Reactivities equal to or more intense than the positive control line ([]2+) in the Wondfo assay had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 96.4% for high NtAb50 titers ([]1/160). Conclusions: Our findings support the use of LFIC assays evaluated herein, particularly the Wondfo test, for COVID-19 diagnosis.

Methods Using a classical epidemiologic framework, and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020 and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions- shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing- to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced, automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. Results Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in >90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. Conclusion Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.","output":"Universal Shelter-in-Place vs. Advanced Automated Contact Tracing and Targeted Isolation: A Case for 21st-Century Technologies for SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a new coronavirus was discovered in China, sparking a serious pandemic of human acute respiratory syndrome which spread worldwide at a fast rate Public health knowledge and awareness is required on food facts, nutrients and immune system for coronavirus prevention The study designed to investigate COVID-19 impact on dietary intake, knowledge, habits, activities and lifestyle among the people in Taif City Data collection was conducted from the 4th to the 29th of June 2020 A total of 312 respondents, aged from  12 to  65 years were involved in the survey About 81% of the respondents were with high education level (bachelors degree or higher) Results show that the most frequent diseases in descending order of magnitude were obesity, dental problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, low immunity and colon problems Data collected showed an increase in food intake frequency during the epidemic except for (4 44, 41 82,12 86, and 30 51 %), like fish, bread, pasta and fast food, respectively Two hundred and eight (208) of the respondents preferred to use olive oil in their diet due to its several benefits The majority of the respondents preferred star anise (124) followed by sagebrush (44) as herbal drinks in descending order, respectively During the COVID-19 pandemic, the study population reported to eat more herbs such as garlic (169), ginger (152) and curcuma (103) to enhance the immune system Multivitamin (66) and vitamin D intake were reported as the highest, while vitamin BGroup and ascorbic acid recorded similar intakes values Mineral supplement intake in descending order were reported as calcium (57), iron (37) zinc (29) and selenium (5) Around 119 of the respondents had no knowledge on the exact source of COVID-19, while 113 reported as an infection from a bat to humans The respondents recognized the symptoms as fever (270) and shortness of breath (249) Observing social distance and hand washing were chosen by most respondents (301) as a way of preventing the infection Two cases of smokers quit the smoking habit;a minor increase rate of training activity was reported;almost all of the respondents embraced the consumption of functional foods, oils, herbs, roots, colored fruits and vegetables and special supplements during COVID-19 Knowledge on covid-19 had significant positive impact on the respondents healthy eating habits, physical exercise, water intake and reduced smoking Findings recommended intensifying efforts in sensitizing the public to a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening the immune system ? 2021 All Rights Reserved","output":"Saudi Community Care Awareness Food Facts, Nutrients, Immune System and Covid-19 Prevention in Taif City among Different Age Categories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We estimate direct and spillover effects of social distancing measures intended to slow the spread of COVID-19 at the U S county level using mobility indicator","output":"Staggered Adoption of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions to Contain COVID-19 Across U.S. Counties: Direct and Spillover Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guided by the Conceptual Model of Implementation Research, we explored the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of: (1) automated screening approaches utilizing existing health data to identify those who require subsequent diagnostic evaluation for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and (2) family communication methods including chatbots and direct contact to communicate information about inherited risk for FH.

Methods. The UKILD Post-COVID study planned interim analysis was designed to stratify risk groups and estimate the prevalence of Post-COVID Interstitial Lung Damage (ILDam) using the Post-HOSPitalisation COVID-19 (PHOSP-COVID) Study. Demographics, radiological patterns and missing data were assessed descriptively. Bayes binomial regression was used to estimate the risk ratio of persistent lung damage >10% involvement in linked, clinically indicated CT scans. Indexing thresholds of percent predicted DLco, chest X-ray findings and severity of admission were used to generate risk strata. Number of cases within strata were used to estimate the amount of suspected Post-COVID ILDam. Results. A total 3702 people were included in the UKILD interim cohort, 2406 completed an early follow-up research visit within 240 days of discharge and 1296 had follow-up through routine clinical review. We linked the cohort to 87 clinically indicated CTs with visually scored radiological patterns (median 119 days; interquartile range 83 to 155, max 240), of which 74 people had ILDam. ILDam was associated with abnormal chest X-ray (RR 1.21 95%CrI 1.05; 1.40), percent predicted DLco<80% (RR 1.25 95%CrI 1.00; 1.56) and severe admission (RR 1.27 95%CrI 1.07; 1.55). A risk index based on these features suggested 6.9% of the interim cohort had moderate to very-high risk of Post-COVID ILDam. Comparable radiological patterns were observed in repeat scans >90 days in a subset of participants. Conclusion. These interim data highlight that ILDam was not uncommon in clinically indicated thoracic CT up to 8 months following SARS-CoV-2 hospitalisation. Whether the ILDam will progress to ILD is currently unknown, however health services should radiologically and physiologically monitor individuals who have Post-COVID ILDam risk factors.","output":"Interstitial lung damage following COVID-19 hospitalisation: an interim analysis of the UKILD Post-COVID study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Our study describes changes in HIV care service delivery and continuity of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) during the 8 weeks before and after diagnosis of the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Haiti on March 19, 2020. METHODS: Using data from 96 out of 167 health facilities offering ART services, we compared four ART program indicators: (1) count of HIV visits; (2) proportion of ART dispenses in community-based settings (DAC); (3) proportion of multi-month dispensing of ART medications > 6 months (> 6 m MMD); and (4) proportion of timely ART refills. We used uncontrolled interrupted time series (ITS) models to estimate slope and level changes in each indicator with the arrival of COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From week 1 to week 16, the average number of HIV visits fell from 121.5 to 92.5 visits, the proportion of DAC rose from 22.7% to 36.7%, the proportion of > 6 m MMD rose from 29.4% to 48.4%, and the proportion of timely ART refills fell from 51.9% to 43.8%.

Evidences have indicated that the efficiency of emergency response was considered crucial to curb the spread of the emerging infectious disease. However, studies of COVID-19 on this topic are relatively few. METHODS: A qualitative comparative study was conducted to compare the timeline of emergency responses to H1N1 (2009) and COVID-19, by using a set of six key time nodes selected from international literature. Besides, we also explored the spread speed and peak time of COVID-19 and H1N1 swine influenza by comparing the confirmed cases in the same time interval. RESULTS: The government's entire emergency responses to the epidemic, H1N1 swine influenza (2009) completed in 28 days, and COVID-19 (2019) completed in 46 days. Emergency responses speed for H1N1 was 18 days faster. As for the epidemic spread speed, the peak time of H1N1 came about 4 weeks later than that of COVID-19, and the H1N1 curve in America was flatter than COVID-19 in China within the first four months after the disease emerged. CONCLUSIONS: The speed of the emergency responses to H1N1 was faster than COVID-19, which might be an important influential factor for slowing down the arrival of the peak time at the beginning of the epidemic. Although COVID-19 in China is coming to an end, the government should improve the public health emergency system, in order to control the spread of the epidemic and lessen the adverse social effects in possible future outbreaks.","output":"Characteristics of and Public Health Emergency Responses to COVID-19 and H1N1 Outbreaks: A Case-Comparison Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Calpains are calcium-dependent proteases that are required for numerous intracellular processes but also play an important role in the development of pathologies such as ischemic injury and neurodegeneration. Many current small molecule calpain inhibitors also inhibit other cysteine proteases, including cathepsins, and need improved selectivity. The specificity of inhibition of several calpains and papain was profiled using synthetic positional scanning libraries of epoxide-based compounds that target the active-site cysteine. These peptidomimetic libraries probe the P4, P3, and P2 positions, display (S,S)- or (R,R)-epoxide stereochemistries, and incorporate both natural and non-natural amino acids. To facilitate library screening, an SDS-PAGE assay that measures the extent of hydrolysis of an inactive recombinant m-calpain was developed. Individual epoxide inhibitors were synthesized guided by calpain-specific preferences observed from the profiles and tested for inhibition against calpain. The most potent compounds were assayed for specificity against cathepsins B, L, and K. Several compounds demonstrated high inhibition specificity for calpains over cathepsins. The best of these inhibitors, WRH(R,R), irreversibly inactivates m- and mu-calpain rapidly (k(2)/K(i) = 131,000 and 16,500 m(-1) s(-1), respectively) but behaves exclusively as a reversible and less potent inhibitor toward the cathepsins. X-ray crystallography of the proteolytic core of rat mu-calpain inactivated by the epoxide compounds WR gamma-cyano-alpha-aminobutyric acid (S,S) and WR allylglycine (R,R) reveals that the stereochemistry of the epoxide influences positioning and orientation of the P2 residue, facilitating alternate interactions within the S2 pocket. Moreover, the WR gamma-cyano-alpha-aminobutyric acid (S,S)-complexed structure defines a novel hydrogen-bonding site within the S2 pocket of calpains.","output":"Development of calpain-specific inactivators by screening of positional scanning epoxide libraries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific data analyses often combine several computational tools in automated pipelines, or workflows. Thousands of such workflows have been used in the life sciences, though their composition has remained a cumbersome manual process due to a lack of standards for annotation, assembly, and implementation. Recent technological advances have returned the long-standing vision of automated workflow composition into focus. This article summarizes a recent Lorentz Center workshop dedicated to automated composition of workflows in the life sciences. We survey previous initiatives to automate the composition process, and discuss the current state of the art and future perspectives. We start by drawing the big picture of the scientific workflow development life cycle, before surveying and discussing current methods, technologies and practices for semantic domain modelling, automation in workflow development, and workflow assessment. Finally, we derive a roadmap of individual and community-based actions to work toward the vision of automated workflow development in the forthcoming years. A central outcome of the workshop is a general description of the workflow life cycle in six stages: 1) scientific question or hypothesis, 2) conceptual workflow, 3) abstract workflow, 4) concrete workflow, 5) production workflow, and 6) scientific results. The transitions between stages are facilitated by diverse tools and methods, usually incorporating domain knowledge in some form. Formal semantic domain modelling is hard and often a bottleneck for the application of semantic technologies. However, life science communities have made considerable progress here in recent years and are continuously improving, renewing interest in the application of semantic technologies for workflow exploration, composition and instantiation. Combined with systematic benchmarking with reference data and large-scale deployment of production-stage workflows, such technologies enable a more systematic process of workflow development than we know today. We believe that this can lead to more robust, reusable, and sustainable workflows in the future.","output":"Perspectives on automated composition of workflows in the life sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is known to be associated with a distinct form of coagulopathy. OBJECTIVE: To describe the imaging manifestations of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy in hospitalized patients, across anatomic sites and modalities, and to identify clinical variables associated with positive imaging findings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a consecutive series of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital over a 3-week period. Patient demographics, hematologic values, cross-sectional imaging examinations, and clinical outcomes (death and intubation) were collected. Imaging was reviewed for imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess for associations of patient demographics, hematologic markers, and outcomes, with the conduct of imaging and imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. RESULTS: Among 308 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 46% underwent cross-sectional imaging for a total of 332 included cross-sectional imaging examinations. A total of 26% (37/142) of patients demonstrated imaging positive for coagulopathy. The most common such imaging manifestations were pulmonary embolus (n=21) on contrast-enhanced CT or CTA, thrombus in the upper or lower extremity veins (n=13) on Doppler US, end organ infarction in the bowel (n=4) and kidney (n=4) on contrast-enhanced CT, and thrombus or parenchymal infarction in the brain (n=2) on contrast-enhanced CTA or MRI with MRA. Among patients with imaging positive for coagulopathy, 22% (8/37) had multi-site involvement. Thrombi were multifocal in 4 of 5 patients with positive upper and 3 of 8 patients with positive lower extremity examinations and involved both superficial and/or deep veins. In multivariable analysis, intubation (p<0.001) and prolonged prothrombin time (p=0.04) showed a significant association with undergoing imaging; no patient variable was significantly associated with imaging positive for coagulopathy (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Imaging commonly demonstrates manifestations of coagulopathy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with such manifestations, over a fifth demonstrate multi-site involvement. Clinical variables poorly predict which patients have positive imaging, indicating a complementary role of imaging in detecting COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. CLINICAL IMPACT: In patients with COVID-19, CT pulmonary angiogram, extremity Doppler US, contrast-enhanced abdomen CT, and contrast-enhanced brain MRI and MRA may all be appropriate if systemic coagulopathy is suspected, in the absence of imaging contraindications.","output":"Multisystem assessment of the imaging manifestations of coagulopathy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present review attempts to critically examine and evaluate research findings on mushrooms as sources of vitamin D and other nutraceuticals. Recently, there is a growing concern about diseases associated with the deficiency of vitamin D in humans. As people tend to stay indoors, in present times, due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, vitamin D levels are further affected. Research indicates vitamin D as a promising defensive or therapeutic agent against COVID, making this review more crucial. Mushrooms, as a rich source of vitamin D along with various bioactive compounds, perform a significant role in resolving health issues. Robust analyses of various strategies for enhancing vitamin D content in mushrooms holds significance in this study;moreover, this will help stakeholders of the mushroom industry in enriching the overall mushroom quality and human health. Mushroom\\\\based medicinal formulations and functional foods serve to deliver vitamins and nutrients to humans, thus helping to combat malnutrition and other health problems, especially in developing countries. Evidence from pre\\\\clinical and clinical analyses suggests that vitamin D2 bioavailability in mushrooms is comparable with vitamin D from other sources.

Methods: We describe our experience with continuing CF research activity during the pandemic crisis at our large adult unit (~350 pwCF). We use a bespoke CF single-person research suite that includes a lounge area incorporating hotel facilities, separate from the main clinical buildings. Results: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, 104 pwCF in 6 active trials (4 requiring physiologic tests) wished to carry on with their routine trial visits. One study (54 participants) was put on hold at the request of the sponsor. All pwCF were risk assessed before attending to comply with guidelines. From March to December 2020, we carried out 3 sweat tests,15 blood tests and 50 spirometry tests in the suite, and 50 research imaging and 10 full pulmonary function tests within another setting. All procedures were carried out using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), with staff fit-tested to perform spirometry safely. Feedback from pwCF indicated that they felt safe and secure in addition to being supported. Conclusion: With the implementation of measures such as face coverings, health screens, and social distancing, most research activity within CF presents a relatively low risk for individuals despite the challenges faced. Having a bespoke facility allowed us to ensure the safety of research participants, minimise the risk of COVID-19 community spread, including spread to the researchers themselves and the avoidance of interactions with non-research staff.

Background: Coughing is known to produce a significant amount of aerosols and is thus commonly used as a best reference for high-risk aerosol-generation. Accordingly, procedures during which aerosol generation exceeds the amount of aerosol generated in instances of coughing are seen as high risk aerosol generating procedures. However, no reliable quantitative values are available for high risk aerosol-generation. Methods: Coughing was measured from 37 healthy volunteers in the operating room environment. Aerosol particles generated during coughing within the size range of 0.3 - 10 microm were measured with Optical Particle Sizer from 40cm, 70cm, and 100cm distances. The distances reflected potential exposure distances where personnel are during surgeries. Results: A total of 306 coughs were measured. Average aerosol concentration during coughing was 1.580 +/- 13.774 particles/cm3 (range 0.000 - 195.528). Discussion: The aerosol concentration measured in this study can be used as a limit for high-risk aerosol generation in the operating room environment when assessing the aerosol generating procedures and the risk of operating room staff s exposure for aerosol particles.

The longest splicing isoform of ZC3HAV1 contains a C-terminal PARP-like domain, which has evolved under positive selection in primates. We analyzed the evolutionary history of this same domain in humans and in Pan troglodytes. We identified two variants that segregate in both humans and chimpanzees; one of them (rs3735007) does not occur at a hypermutable site and accounts for a nonsynonymous substitution (Thr851Ile). The probability that the two trans-specific polymorphisms have occurred independently in the two lineages was estimated to be low (P = 0.0054), suggesting that at least one of them has arisen before speciation and has been maintained by selection. Population genetic analyses in humans indicated that the region surrounding the shared variants displays strong evidences of long-standing balancing selection. Selection signatures were also observed in a chimpanzee population sample. Inspection of 1000 Genomes data confirmed these findings but indicated that search for selection signatures using low-coverage whole-genome data may need masking of repetitive sequences. A caseCcontrol study of more than 1,000 individuals from mainland Italy indicated that the Thr851Ile SNP is significantly associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.08C1.99, P = 0.011). This finding was confirmed in a larger sample of 4,416 Sardinians cases/controls (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.037C1.344, P = 0.011), but not in a population from Belgium. We provide one of the first instances of human/chimpanzee trans-specific coding variant located outside the major histocompatibility complex region. The selective pressure is likely to be virus driven; in modern populations, this variant associates with susceptibility to MS, possibly via the interaction with environmental factors.","output":"A Trans-Specific Polymorphism in ZC3HAV1 Is Maintained by Long-Standing Balancing Selection and May Confer Susceptibility to Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To assess the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and related knowledge and attitudes during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Croatia. METHODS: The online survey, conducted on social media in May 2020, yielded 1393 responses across the country (66% from the Adriatic area). The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic questions and questions on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PPE use. The (2) test, t test, and multivariate logistic regression were used in data analysis. RESULTS: As many as 84.0% of participants reported the compliance with social distancing measures, while 52.8% reported using PPE (mask and/or gloves) when shopping or visiting friends and family. Participants demonstrated good knowledge (mean of 10.4 [95% CI 10.3-10.4] correct answers out of 13 questions) and neutral to moderately positive attitude about PPE use (mean of 36.6 [36.1-37.1] out of 50 points). Participants with higher education, women, and health care workers had a greater probability for having a high knowledge score. Women, older individuals, public transport users, people with more positive PPE use attitude, and those who complied with social distancing had a higher probability of PPE use, while health care workers and highly educated participants had a reduced probability of PPE use in public. CONCLUSIONS: Croatians had good knowledge and neutral to moderately positive attitudes about PPE use. Nevertheless, health authorities need to promote positive attitudes about PPE use in order to retain trust and compliance with epidemiological measures.","output":"Adherence to epidemiological measures and related knowledge and attitudes during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Croatia: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Adolescent and young women (10-24 years old) are a neglected group in humanitarian setting and their sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs are habitually ignored.

However, gaps persist between evolution and medicine, for historical reasons and because they are often perceived as having disparate goals. Evolutionary biologists have a role in building a bridge between the disciplines by presenting evolutionary biology in the context of human health and medical practice to undergraduates, including premedical and preprofessional students. We suggest that students will find medical examples of evolution engaging. By making the connections between evolution and medicine clear at the undergraduate level, the stage is set for future health providers and biomedical scientists to work productively in this synthetic area. Here, we frame key evolutionary concepts in terms of human health, so that biomedical examples may be more easily incorporated into evolution courses or more specialized courses on evolutionary medicine.

Founded in 2006, GEP has grown to over 100 participating two-year and four-year institutions and introduced thousands of students to eukaryotic gene structure, comparative genomics, and genome evolution. GEP members contribute their expertise and enthusiasm to the community through four committees: science and IT, curriculum development, assessment, and professional development and mentoring. Digital communication tools facilitate collaboration in this geographically distributed community while regional nodes enable the development of local initiatives. Our education research is focused on student experiences, attitudes, and learning gains in the CURE setting. An important dimension of CUREs that distinguishes them from the traditional laboratory classroom is iteration: students have opportunities to make mistakes and re-do (Auchincloss et al, 2014). The scaling of undergraduate research from an apprentice model to the classroom, however, poses a major challenge for faculty, creating the need to provide feedback to a large number of inexperienced student researchers. We find that custom bioinformatics tools provide rapid feedback to GEP students and allow for iterative revisions of student projects. Student surveys and focus groups reveal that bioinformatics CUREs foster ?formative frustration,? whereby students can safely fail in their original analysis, adjust, recover, and succeed;students value this experience. During the COVID pandemic, GEP has provided an authentic research experience that can be delivered remotely. Bioinformatics resources are available online, as are GEP virtual tutors. Thus, GEP is a viable option for undergraduate research projects even for online learning. We are expanding our repertoire of scientific projects. GEP has partnered with Galaxy to develop G-OnRamp, an open-source platform for constructing UCSC Assembly Hubs and JBrowse/Apollo genome browsers to facilitate collaborative annotation of eukaryotic genomes. These tools allow us to include investigations of the evolution of venom in parasitoid wasps and an investigation of the evolution of genes in Drosophila biochemical pathways. We seek to grow our network of faculty and to increase the diversity of our community by making a variety of training opportunities available, including online mentoring via the QUBES platform and regional node workshops.

Our interest in this country pair is driven by the two countries interwoven history as well as by the fact that Belarus remains autocratic and strongly tied to Russia, while Lithuania has reinvented herself as a democratic market economy fully integrated into the EU. Our aim is to understand better the extent to which the growth differential between the two countries can be traced to increased efficiency, i.e., total factor productivity, in the use of capital and other resources via, inter alia, better institutions (intensive growth) as opposed to sheer accumulation of capital (extensive growth), the hallmark of Soviet economic growth. To this end, we compare the development of some key determinants of growth in the two countries since the 1990s. Employing a simple growth accounting model we find that institutional reforms, open and transparent governance, and good education play a more important role for output and efficiency than crude capital accumulation. Hence Lithuania does better than Belarus, which remains marred by problems related to weak governance as well as autocratic rule. As in Estonia and Latvia we find that the EU perspective made a significant contribution to growth in Lithuania. The Russian connection has done less for Belarus.

Proxalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal anti-androgen (NSAA) with strong activities on androgen receptor (AR) antagonism, suppression of AR nuclear expression, and downregulation of the membrane-attached angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). The efficacy of proxalutamide was previously demonstrated for early COVID-19 patients, and has now demonstrated efficacy to reduce deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patient in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT). Whether radiological changes would follow the improvement in clinical outcomes with proxalutamide is not established. The present post-hoc analysis aims to evaluate whether proxalutamide improves lung injury observed through chest computed tomography (CT) scans, in addition to the clinical improvement, thus providing further objective evidence of the drug response in COVID-19. Methods: This is a post-hoc analysis of the radiological findings of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective, two-arm RCT (The Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV Trial) with all enrolled patients from the three participating institutions of the city of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, that had at least two chest CT scans during hospitalization. The quantification of lung parenchyma involvement was performed by independent board-certified radiologists with expertise in analysis of COVID-19 images, that were blind to the assigned intervention in the RCT. A first chest CT scan was performed upon randomization and a second CT scan was performed approximately five days later, whenever patient transportation was feasible. Results: Of the 395 patients initially evaluated, 72 and 179 patients from the proxalutamide and placebo arms, respectively, were included (n=251). Baseline and clinical characteristics, interval between first and second chest CT scans, and percentage of lung parenchyma affected in the baseline chest CT scan were similar between groups. In the second chest CT scan, the percentage of lungs affected (Median - IQR) was 35.0% (25.0-57.5%) in the proxalutamide group versus 67.5% (50.0-80.0%) in the placebo group (p < 0.001).

IBs are considered dynamic entities that harbor high percentages of the recombinant protein, which can be found in different conformational states. The production conditions influence the properties of IBs and recombinant protein recovery and solubilization. The E. coli growth in thermoinduced systems is generally carried out at 30 C and then recombinant protein production at 42 C. Since the heat shock response in E. coli is triggered above 34 C, the synthesis of heat shock proteins can modify the yields of the recombinant protein and the structural quality of IBs. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different pre-induction temperatures (30 and 34 C) on the growth of E. coli W3110 producing the human granulocyteCmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF) and on the IBs structure in a pL/pR-cI857 thermoinducible system. The recombinant E. coli cultures growing at 34 C showed a ~ 69% increase in the specific growth rate compared to cultures grown at 30 C. The amount of rHuGM-CSF in IBs was significantly higher in cultures grown at 34 C. Main folding chaperones (DnaK and GroEL) were associated with IBs and their co-chaperones (DnaJ and GroES) with the soluble protein fraction. Finally, IBs from cultures that grew at 34 C had a lower content of amyloid-like structure and were more sensitive to proteolytic degradation than IBs obtained from cultures at 30 C. Our study presents evidence that increasing the pre-induction temperature in a thermoinduced system allows obtaining higher recombinant protein and reducing amyloid contents of the IBs. KEY POINTS: ?

For each study, we assessed odds ratios, mean difference, and 95% confidence interval to assess and synthesize outcomes. RESULT Twenty-one randomized controlled trials were eligible for this meta-analysis with a total of 3636 patients. Compared with decompression, decompression and fusion significantly increased length of hospital stay, operative time and estimated blood loss. Compared with fusion, decompression significantly decreased operative time, estimated blood loss and overall visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Compared with endoscopic decompression, microscopic decompression significantly increased length of hospital stay, and operative time. Compared with traditional surgery, endoscopic discectomy significantly decreased length of hospital stay, operative time, estimated blood loss, and overall VAS scores and increased Japanese Orthopeadic Association score. Compared with TLIF, MIS-TLIF significantly decreased length of hospital stay, and increased operative time and SF-36 physical component summary score. Compared with multi-level decompression and single level fusion, multi-level decompression and multi-level fusion significantly increased operative time, estimated blood loss and SF-36 mental component summary score and decreased Oswestry disability index score. Compared with decompression, decompression with interlaminar stabilization significantly decreased operative time and the score of Zurich claudication questionnaire symptom severity, and increased VAS score.

Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines used in the field can persist and provide the genetic material needed for recombination and emergence of novel IBV serotypes. Inactivated and subunit vaccines overcome some of the limitations of MLV with no risk of virulence reversion and emergence of new virulent serotypes. However, these vaccines are weakly immunogenic and poorly protective. There is an urgent need to develop more effective vaccines that can elicit a robust, long-lasting immune response. In this study, we evaluate a novel adjuvant system developed from Quil-A and chitosan (QAC) for the intranasal delivery of nucleic acid immunogens to improve protective efficacy. The QAC adjuvant system forms nanocarriers (<100 nm) that efficiently encapsulate nucleic acid cargo, exhibit sustained release of payload and can stably transfect cells. Encapsulation of plasmid DNA vaccine expressing IBV nucleocapsid (N) protein by the QAC adjuvant system (pQAC-N) enhanced immunogenicity as evidenced by robust induction of adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses post vaccination and challenge. Birds immunized with pQAC-N showed reduced clinical severity and viral shedding post challenge on par with protection observed with current commercial vaccines without the associated safety concerns. Presented results indicate that the QAC adjuvant system can offer a safer alternative to the use of live vaccines against avian and other emerging coronaviruses.Importance According to the 2017 US agriculture statistics, the combined value of production and sales from broilers, eggs, turkeys, and chicks was $42.8 billion. Of this number, broiler sales comprised 67 percent of the industry value with the production of > 50 billion pounds of chicken meats. The economic success of the poultry industry in the USA hinges on the extensive use of vaccines to control Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and other poultry pathogens. Majority of vaccines currently licensed for poultry health include both modified live vaccine and inactivated pathogens. Despite their proven efficacy, modified live vaccine constructs take time to produce and could potentially revert to virulence, which limits their safety. The significance of our research stems from the development of a safer and potent alternative mucosal vaccine to replace live vaccines against IBV and other emerging coronaviruses.","output":"A Novel Mucosal Adjuvant System for the Immunization Against Avian Coronavirus Causing Infectious Bronchitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selected trace metals of importance in different incense before and after the smoldering process were assessed based on the recent respiratory ailments.

METHODS: An evidence synthesis of qualitative data from (a) the evaluation of ACE (Active, Connected, Engaged), a feasibility trial of a peer volunteering active ageing intervention, and (b) interviews with volunteers and managers of third sector organisations providing peer volunteering programmes. Data were analysed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Ten managers, 22 volunteers and 20 ACE participants were interviewed. The analysis identified six main themes, 33 higher and 22 sub themes. Main themes were: (i) Motives, (ii) Benefits, (iii) Skills and Characteristics, (iv) Challenges, (v) Training Needs, (vi) Recruitment and Retention. Altruism, changes in life circumstances, opportunities to reconnect with the community and personal fulfilment were the main reasons for volunteering. Volunteering was described as being personally rewarding, an avenue to acquire new skills and knowledge, and an opportunity for increased social connections and physical activity. Good peer volunteers are committed, reliable, have a good sense of humour, good interpersonal skills and are able to relate to participants. When pairing volunteers with participants, shared interests and geographical proximity are important to consider. Clarity of role, level of time commitment, regular feedback, recognition of effort and strong networks for on-going support are important strategies to facilitate volunteer retention.

We synthesize multiple data sources from across the seafood supply chain to show the relative initial responses and variables of recovery during a pre-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) and during the pandemic (2020). Our study shows that seafood sectors and trade were disrupted by abrupt shifts in demand, supply and limitations on the movement of people and goods, with a wide range of impacts and consequences for the seafood sectors.

Incorporation of a cysteine-containing peptide-based chelator at the C terminus provides an opportunity for stable labelling with the radionuclide (99m)Tc. The use of a GGGC chelator at the C terminus has provided the lowest renal radioactivity retention of the previously investigated peptide-based chelators. Previously, it has also been demonstrated that replacement of the His(6)-tag with the negatively charged histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate (HEHEHE)-tag permits purification of affibody molecules by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and provides low hepatic accumulation of radioactivity of conjugates site-specifically labelled at the C terminus using several different nuclides. We hypothesized that the combination of a HEHEHE-tag at the N terminus and a GGGC chelator at the C terminus of an affibody molecule would be a favourable format permitting IMAC purification and providing low uptake in excretory organs. To investigate this hypothesis, a (HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC affibody molecule was generated. It could be efficiently purified by IMAC and stably labelled with (99m)Tc. (99m)Tc-(HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC preserved specific binding to HER2-expressing cells. In NMRI mice, hepatic uptake of (99m)Tc-(HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC was lower than the uptake of the control affibody molecules, (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:2395)-VDC and (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC. At 1 and 4 h after injection, the renal uptake of (99m)Tc-(HE)(3)-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC was 2-3-fold lower than uptake of (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:2395)-VDC, but it was substantially higher than uptake of (99m)Tc-Z(HER2:342)-GGGC. Further investigation indicated that a fraction of (99m)Tc was chelated by the HEHEHE-tag which caused a higher accumulation of radioactivity in the kidneys. Thus, a combination of a HEHEHE-tag and the GGGC chelator in targeting scaffold proteins was found to be undesirable in the case of (99m)Tc labelling due to a partial loss of site-specificity of nuclide chelation.","output":"Evaluation of a HER2-targeting affibody molecule combining an N-terminal HEHEHE-tag with a GGGC chelator for 99mTc-labelling at the C terminus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we propose a mathematical model -- based on a cellular automaton -- for the redistribution of patients within a network of hospitals with limited available resources, in order to reduce the risks of a local/global collapse of the healthcare system.

The research investigation concerned finding an answer to the question: to what extent did consumer eating behavior change during the pandemic, and how did the risk of becoming overweight and obesity increase? Design/Methodology/Approach: To gain deeper insight into consumer eating behavior amid the Covid-19 outbreak, a survey on food choice and cooking attitudes was carried out in the West Pomeranian region of Poland. Four hundred twenty respondents took part in the survey. The data obtained was used to elaborate a multi-agent model created by the author and the execution of simulation experiments. A multi-agent-based modeling and simulation (MABS) method was used to build the model. Findings: The research shows that among the individuals participating in the study, three types of eating attitudes were distinguished, restrained eaters (41.9%), emotional eaters (34.8%), and external eaters (23.3%). These three groups reported different behavior, highlighting, for example, an increase in ready-made and ultra-processed food consumption within the non-emotionally responsive group. Empirical data was used to develop an agent-based simulation model that combined different eating styles represented by consumers with their food and cooking habits to simulate consumer behavior during the Covid-19 epidemic. Practical Implications: The findings could be helpful in support of practical and social solutions for the identification of excessive weight and obesity risk factors and the preparation of strategies aimed at reducing the influence of pandemics on consumer eating behavior and increasing consumer awareness on this issue.

Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study, enrolling the patients with autoimmune- and immune-mediated diseases who voluntarily completed our questionnaire, both online and during hospital evaluations. Based on their decision to receive the vaccine, the patients were divided into two groups (vaccinated and non-vaccinated). Participants who chose not to receive the vaccine served as a control group in terms of flare-ups. Results: A total of 623 patients, 416 vaccinated and 207 non-vaccinated, were included in the study during hospital evaluations (222/623) and after online (401/623) enrolment.

Methods: Patients perception of satisfaction was evaluated through self-administered survey questionnaires, previously validated in the Spanish language. Cohorts were grouped according to two relational models: i) Assisted televisit, 503 neurology patients during the years 2018-2019;and ii) Televisit , 831 patients from different specialties treated during 2020. Perception of satisfaction was compared by gender, age, and type of televisit, and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) and reliability (factorial analysis of main components) were assessed. Results: Assisted televisit and televisit cohorts were composed by 64.2% and 67.6% women, respectively;patients under 65 years of age were 62.2% and 75%, respectively. Assisted televisit patients showed very high 94.4% (n=475) and high 5.2% (n=26) satisfaction levels, while televisit patients showed very high 22.3% (n=185), high 63.9% (n=531), and moderate 13.1% (n=109) satisfaction levels;this difference is statistically significant at p < 0.001. Questionnaires showed excellent internal consistency, and all items showed point biserial correlations greater than 0.30. Conclusion: Lower perception of satisfaction due to the change in televisit relational modality underscores the importance of primary care professionals, who support the specialist in the assisted televisit model. The results of this study suggest that assisted televisit contributes to delivering an integrative solution that helps to alleviate the fragmentation of the system.Funding: None to declare.

The Royal College of Surgeons of England published guidance on consent during COVID-19. Through this study, we aimed to assess our local consent adherence to these guidelines on the resumption of elective activity after the first wave of COVID-19. Methods This prospective review of consecutive elective surgical consent forms was conducted from 20( )July 2020 to 16 August 2020 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, England. The primary outcome was evidence of COVID-19 risk documentation on the consent forms. Results A total of 116 patients consent forms were reviewed. Most patients were American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade 2 (n=70; 60.34%). Only 25 consent forms (21.55%) had COVID -19 and its associated risks documented, with registrars being the most compliant (19/46; 41.3%) followed by consultants (6/51; 11.7%). With regards to the surgical sub-specialities, general surgery, orthopaedics and ENT had the highest compliance with the guidance.

The climate emergency is anticipated to generate dire health consequences worldwide in the coming decades. While the pathways that link climate change and different disease areas are better understood, the connection between climate change and HIV/AIDS is still yet to be recognized both in research and practice. In this review, we update one of the frameworks on the HIV-climate nexus described in earlier literature. Four major pathways have been identified: extreme weather events;sea level rise;changes in precipitation and temperature;and increased air pollution. These pathways impact the spectrum of HIV/AIDS-related outcomes through changes in social systems, healthcare disruption, and other climate-sensitive diseases, influenced by the social determinants of health. We also reflect on the significance of this updated framework for the Philippines, a country that is both highly vulnerable to the climate crisis and facing a rising HIV/AIDS epidemic. The framework can aid countries like the Philippines in filling gaps in research, policy, and program design to mount climate-adaptive HIV/AIDS responses. The HIV/AIDS and climate justice movements must also join forces in calling for accelerated worldwide decline in greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors to stabilize the global climate - this will benefit not just people affected by HIV/AIDS but everyone.","output":"Pathways Linking Climate Change and HIV/AIDS: An Updated Conceptual Framework and Implications for the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Verbal communication is one of the most sophisticated human motor skills reflecting both-the mental and physical health of an individual. Voice parameters and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient profiling.","output":"Voice perturbations under the stress overload in young individuals: phenotyping and suboptimal health as predictors for cascading pathologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the world has witnessed a soaring inflow of capital into sustainable investment. This is particularly so following the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. However, while a growing size of literature has deliberated debt financing in sustainable investment, less ink has been spilt on equity financing in this space, and even less scholarship has explored the role of government and law in facilitating sustainable Venture Capital (VC) funds. This paper proposes a dualist approach towards facilitating the development of sustainable VC funds encompassing a contractarian strategy with government support. The contractarian approach includes effective contracting covering the entire VC cycle in sustainable investment. It aims to provide strong incentives for all participants, ranging from investors, entrepreneurs, fund managers, to credit-rating agencies and evaluation firms. In the same vein, this paper seeks to craft a role for regulators that facilitates the simultaneous availability of several factors in a sustainable VC cycle (i.e., fund-raising, investment and exit). In the fund-raising stage, governments may play an active role by expanding the source of financing for sustainable VC funds and enacting detailed and targeted legislations. For the VC investment stage, sustainable VC funds should make full use of its strong corporate governance rights and monitoring to ensure that start-ups deliver their sustainable promises. In the exit stage, a specialized sustainability board is strongly recommended to offer viable exit options, together with greater standardization and comparability in sustainability information disclosure, and regulatory support for trustworthy sustainable impact rating agencies to sustain investor confidence.","output":"Venture Capital in the Rise of Sustainable Investment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the development and the performance of a new targeted liquid crystalline nanodispersion (LCN) by the attachment of cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) onto their surfaces to improve skin delivery of lipoic acid (LA) were evaluated. For that, the synthesis and characterization of this new platform as well as its spatiotemporal analysis from in vitro and in vivo topical application were explored and extensively discussed in this paper. The TAT or D4 peptides were chosen as CPP due to specific target strategies by the charge grouping on the skin surface or target the overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of cell membrane of keratinocytes, respectively. Thus, the nanoparticle characterization results when taken together suggested that designed LCNs maintained their hexagonal phase structure, nanoscale particle size, and low polydispersity index even after drug, lipopolymers, and peptide additions, which are proved to be favorable for topical skin delivery. There were no statistical differences among the LCNs investigated, except for superficial charge of LCN conjugated with TAT which may have altered the LCN zeta potential due to cationic charge of TAT amino acid sequence compared with D4. The cumulative amounts of LA retained into the skin were determined to be even higher coming from the targeted LCNs. Moreover, the exogenous antioxidant application of the LA from the LCNs can prevent ROS damage, which was demonstrated by this study with the less myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and decrease in cytokine levels (TNF-alpha and IL-1?) generated by the oxidative stress modulation. Together, the data presented highlights the potential of these targeted LCNs, and overall, opens new frontiers for preclinical trials.","output":"Liquid crystalline nanodispersion functionalized with cell-penetrating peptides improves skin penetration and anti-inflammatory effect of lipoic acid after in vivo skin exposure to UVB radiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Revascularization rates with stent retrievers after acute ischemic stroke are 69% to 86%, but favorable clinical outcomes occur in just 43% to 58% of cases. New distal emboli may negatively impact clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence and angiographic pattern of distal emboli associated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Solitaire Flow Restoration device and evaluate their correlation with clinical outcome. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the cerebral angiography of all patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with the use of the Solitaire FR device from 2012 to 2013. Angiographic microcatheter runs prior to Solitaire deployment and after thrombectomy were compared to identify new distal filling defects. Clinical outcome was assessed at discharge and after 90 days. RESULTS Successful revascularization using the Solitaire device occurred in 36 of 39 patients (92%). Three distinct patterns were identified: new distal emboli in the same vascular territory (n = 3), new distal emboli in a new vascular territory (n = 3), and distal emboli that resolved after proximal revascularization (n = 7). Thirteen patients had distal emboli before and after Solitaire runs, and 13 showed no evidence of distal emboli. Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scores 0-2) was seen in 54% of all patients and 83% of patients with new distal emboli; thus, there was no correlation between new emboli and unfavorable clinical outcome (P = .67).

However, design-based learning is mostly based on forward engineering, in which students design thinking can be nurtured by designing unknown solutions. Little is known about whether design thinking can be facilitated in the context of reverse engineering, when students learn from already designed products. This study therefore seeks to explore the perceptions of 38 ninth-grade students on the characteristics of design thinking before and after a four-week reverse engineering project, using Likert scales to measure six aspects of design thinking, namely (a) being comfortable with uncertainty and risks, (b) human-centeredness, (c) mindfulness to the process and impacts on others, (d) collaboratively working with diversity, (e) orientation to learning by making and testing, and (f) being confident and optimistic to use creativity. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including means, standard deviations, paired-samples t-tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The results indicate that two aspects, human-centeredness and being confident and optimistic to use creativity, were significant (p = 0.008 and p = 0.043, respectively), with size effects of 0.43 and 0.34, respectively. Based on this potential, reverse engineering can be a design-based learning approach to facilitate students design thinking.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the prevalence of early bacterial identification in intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia, and to characterize its microbiology and impact on outcomes. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective European cohort performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation >48h were eligible if they had SARS-CoV-2 or influenza pneumonia at ICU admission. Bacterial identification was defined by a positive bacterial culture, within 48h after intubation, in endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood cultures, or a positive pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigen test. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 1,050 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2 and 482 in influenza groups). The prevalence of bacterial identification was significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia (9.7 vs 33.6%, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.30), adjusted OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.33), p<0.0001). Gram-positive cocci were responsible for 58% and 72% of co-infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza pneumonia, respectively. Bacterial identification was associated with increased adjusted hazard ratio for 28-day mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.44), p=0.043). However, no significant difference was found in heterogeneity of outcomes related to bacterial identification between the two study groups, suggesting that the impact of co-infection on mortality was not different between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza patients.

The chapter ends up with the discussion on DAMPs and SAMPs as future essential diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and therapeutics. For example, in patients with organ-specific injuries, the continuous determination of a DAMPs/SAMPs ratio may provide individual information about the severity of the injury, their possible remote effects, and early signs of either controlled healing or uncontrolled disease-causing processes. Finally, the therapeutic imperative is discussed, interpreted as a blockade/elimination of DAMPs and/or administration of SAMPs to prevent an injury-induced hyperinflammatory state (e.g., acute organ failure) or chronic nonresolving inflammatory state (e.g., chronic organ failure).","output":"Solid Organ Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sri Lanka sustained its malaria-free status by implementing, among other interventions, three core case detection strategies namely Passive Case Detection (PCD), Reactive Case Detection (RACD) and Proactive Case Detection (PACD). The outcomes of these strategies were analysed in terms of their effectiveness in detecting malaria infections for the period from 2017 to 2019. METHODS: Comparisons were made between the surveillance methods and between years, based on data obtained from the national malaria database and individual case reports of malaria patients. The number of blood smears examined microscopically was used as the measure of the volume of tests conducted. The yield from each case detection method was calculated as the proportion of blood smears which were positive for malaria. Within RACD and PACD, the yield of sub categories of travel cohorts and spatial cohorts was ascertained for 2019. RESULTS: A total of 158 malaria cases were reported in 2017C2019. During this period between 666,325 and 725,149 blood smears were examined annually. PCD detected 95.6 %, with a yield of 16.1 cases per 100,000 blood smears examined. RACD and PACD produced a yield of 11.2 and 0.3, respectively. The yield of screening the sub category of travel cohorts was very high for RACD and PACD being 806.5 and 44.9 malaria cases per 100,000 smears, respectively. Despite over half of the blood smears examined being obtained by screening spatial cohorts within RACD and PACD, the yield of both was zero over all three years. CONCLUSIONS: The PCD arm of case surveillance is the most effective and, therefore, has to continue and be further strengthened as the mainstay of malaria surveillance. Focus on travel cohorts within RACD and PACD should be even greater. Screening of spatial cohorts, on a routine basis and solely because people are resident in previously malarious areas, may be wasteful, except in situations where the risk of local transmission is very high, or is imminent.

This study aimed to evaluate the extent of social media utilization in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic by plastic surgery residency programs. METHODS: Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts of plastic surgery programs, program directors, and chiefs were identified. Number of followers, total posts, and posts since March 1, 2020, were extracted. Account content was categorized as informational, social, operative, research, self-promotional, guest lecture, education, or other. Spearmans coefficient was used to determine correlations among account data. Differences among regions and program pathways were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Since March 1, 2020, 17 Instagram, five Twitter, and three Facebook accounts have been created. Instagram was most widely used and followed (1720 posts, 1235.7  735.9 followers) compared with Twitter (722 tweets, 325.6  451.0 followers) and Facebook (430 posts, 338.3  363.3 followers). Although the majority of content was informational (45.1 percent), Instagram contained more social content (21 percent), Twitter contained more research (21 percent), and Facebook contained more self-promotional content (25 percent).

The components of kuromoji essential oil have antitumor and aromatherapy effects. However, the composition of the hydrosol, obtained as a by-product of the essential oil process, is unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether kuromoji essential oil has a deodorizing effect. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare the chemical composition of kuromoji essential oil and hydrosol, as well as evaluate the deodorizing effect of the former. The chemical composition of samples was evaluated using gas chromatographyCmass spectrometry (GC-MS). Additionally, the deodorizing effect of Kuromoji essential oil was investigated with the detector tube method using ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and isovaleric acid. Linalool was the most abundant component in both the essential oil and hydrosol; however, its proportion was higher in the hydrosol (57.5%) than in the essential oil (42.8%). The hydrosol contained fewer chemical components, but higher proportions of trans-geraniol and ethanol. Moreover, the essential oil eliminated 50% of ammonia and 97.6% or more of isovaleric acid. Interestingly, linalool was soluble in the hydrosol and did not irritate the skin.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Online survey. PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians who self-identified as infant care providers, that is, neonatal clinicians (N = 158). METHODS: We sent an online survey invitation to neonatal clinicians through neonatal websites, conferences, and social media sites in the United States and used snowball recruitment. We used a risk management framework to analyze qualitative data. We used descriptive statistics and the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to determine if opinions differed based on clinician and organizational characteristics. RESULTS: Respondents' support of parent sleep during skin-to-skin care (yes/no) did not differ on the basis of whether the clinician had taken a formal course on skin-to-skin care, facilitated skin-to-skin care more than 100 times, or frequently promoted skin-to-skin care in current practice. Respondents who supported parent sleep (n = 93, 59% of respondents) reported greater implementation of risk control strategies than nonsupporters (n = 53 [57%] vs. n = 3 [5%]; p < .001), such as frequent monitoring of vital signs (n = 33 [35%] vs. n = 2 [3%]; p < .001), use of devices to support skin-to-skin care (n = 49 [53%] vs. n = 19 [29%]; p = .003), and proper positioning (n = 20 [22%] vs. n = 0 [0%]; p < .001). Nonsupporters more frequently reported that parent sleep during skin-to-skin care violates safe sleep recommendations, is habit forming for home, poses a fall risk, and jeopardizes the infant's airway. CONCLUSION: Most respondents supported parent sleep during skin-to-skin care, but concerns regarding safety for the infant remained a barrier.

The sharing economy is a business model of the digital economy, born by the fourth industrial revolution during the Great Recession of 2008 and developing in the context of the unprecedented economic crisis of 2020, when the impact of the coronavirus pandemic simultaneously collapsed production, financial markets and consumer demand for goods and services, and the task of \\"conscious consumption\\" - to spend money correctly and reduce costs - became vital. The concept does not focus on ownership but rather on the sharing of assets and resources. A predictive construct is given: the sharing economy is not so much the introduction of new technologies to implement the world-old idea of renting on digital platforms, but a new paradigm of production and consumption and as such leads to a circular economy, causes systemic changes that form qualitatively new principles of business organization, the economy and society as a whole. The study concluded that the sharing model has proven its viability not only in a period of stable economic development, but also in a contemporary crisis, which is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it was during this period of force majeure that the sharing economy model showed its importance both in everyday life and in business. This allows us to conclude about the further growth of the sharing economy, the creation of new services - both in spite of and thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Sharing Economy: the Business Model of the Digital Economy in the Covid-19 Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth is an increasingly critical component of the health care ecosystem, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid adoption of telehealth has exposed limitations in the existing infrastructure. In this paper, we study and highlight photo quality as a major challenge in the telehealth workflow. We focus on teledermatology, where photo quality is particularly important; the framework proposed here can be generalized to other health domains. For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject ~50% of the sub-par quality images, while retaining ~80% of good quality images patients send in, despite heterogeneity and limitations in the training data. These promising results suggest that our solution is feasible and can improve the quality of teledermatology care.","output":"TrueImage: A Machine Learning Algorithm to Improve the Quality of Telehealth Photos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produo do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publicaes cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referentes ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classificao metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avaliao da qualidade metodolgica Essa avaliao tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomendao oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 13 artigos e 10 protocolos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 12 de agosto de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that health care workers (HCWs), as front liners of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, are at high risk for psychological symptoms, but few studies have compared these symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs. This study compares psychological symptoms among these two groups. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 938 HCWs from various medical fields working in the leading general hospitals of Alborz province, Iran, were selected using a multistage sampling method. The participants had contact with COVID-19 patients. Post-traumatic stress disorder-8 (PTSD-8) is a validated questionnaire that we used to evaluate PTSD symptoms along with its subscales, including intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance. Also, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire was used to assess the severity of the aforementioned conditions in HCWs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare psychological symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs. RESULTS: Among 938 included HCWs, 55 had a history of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, intrusion, hypervigilance, and avoidance among infected HCWs were significantly higher in comparison to non-infected HCWs. In the multivariate logistic model, history of COVID-19 infection among HCWs was associated with a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, stress, intrusion, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the HCWs with COVID-19 infection were at a high risk of displaying psychological symptoms.

Our objective was to compare epidemiological characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. Methods This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. Results We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62{+/-}17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor.

MethodsBetween October 2020 and July 2021, we sequenced 4,439 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes, 23% of all known infections in Alachua County, Florida, including 109 vaccine breakthrough cases. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between viral load (VL) level and patient characteristics. Contact tracing and phylogenetic analysis were used to investigate direct transmissions involving vaccinated individuals. ResultsThe majority of breakthrough sequences with lineage assignment were classified as Delta variants (74.6%) and occurred, on average, about three months (104 {+/-} 57.5 days) after full vaccination, at the same time (June-July 2021) of Delta variant exponential spread within the county. Six Delta variant transmission pairs between fully vaccinated individuals were identified through contact tracing, three of which were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Delta breakthroughs exhibited broad VL values during acute infection (IQR 1.2 - 8.64 Log copies/ml), on average 38% lower than matched unvaccinated patients (3.29 - 10.81 Log copies/ml, p<0.00001). Nevertheless, 49-50% of all breakthroughs, and 56-60% of Delta-infected breakthroughs exhibited VL above the transmissibility threshold (4 Log copies/ml) irrespective of time post vaccination. ConclusionsDelta infection transmissibility and general VL patterns in vaccinated individuals suggest limited levels of sterilizing immunity that need to be considered by public health policies.

METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1010), aged 18C94, running from April 10C20, 2020. We assessed depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scale), loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), and frequency of in-person and remote social connections (4 items, e.g., hugging family member, video chats) and sexual connections (4 items, e.g., partnered sexual activity, dating app use). RESULTS: One-third of participants (32%) reported depressive symptoms, and loneliness was high [mean (SD): 4.4 (1.7)]. Those with depressive symptoms were more likely to be women, aged 20C29, unmarried, and low-income. Very frequent in-person connections were generally associated with lower depression and loneliness; frequent remote connections were not.

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the only IgG transport receptor, its expression on mucosal surfaces is triggered upon viral stimulation, which significantly enhances mucosal immunity. We utilized TGEV as a model pathogen to explore the role of FcRn in resisting viral invasion in overall intestinal mucosal immunity. TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating NF-B signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. First, using small interfering RNAs, we found that TGEV up-regulated FcRn expression via TLR3, TLR9 and RIG-I. Moreover, TGEV induced IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-, and TNF- production. TGF--stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-B signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128C252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis. Thus, TGEV N protein and TGF- up-regulated FcRn expression, further clarifying the molecular mechanism of up-regulation of FcRn expression by TGEV.","output":"Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Infection Up-Regulates FcRn Expression via Nucleocapsid Protein and Secretion of TGF- in Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Negative externalities of transport are a crucial issue in environmental discussion and policy The mobility of our society is responsible for many negative environmental impacts, both on our planet and on human health This paper aims to assess one aspect of a negative externality of transport related to air pollution from particulate matter up to 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) and its impact on human health, using the example of the key Czech Republic highway D1 The assessment method precisely follows the geographical routing of this motorway through varying elevations in which different buffer zones are identified to assess PM10 concentration changes according to distance from the road in the 2007C2016 period The resulting relation between PM10 and highway proximity is then discussed in an econometric analysis of the entire road transport network of the Czech Republic In the final step, we assess the size and demographic structure of the population affected by the highway PM10 pollution problem, and we compare several methods to assess economically related morbidity The results show falling levels of PM10 pollution, not only with increasing distance but also in intertemporal comparison, with concentrations lower by 2g m3 in the 2012C2016 period than in 2007C2011 despite increasing road traffic on the highway This means a very significant reduction in the number of cases and economic value for all analysed endpoints between EUR 485,056 and 842,891","output":"Assessment of the burden on population due to transport-related air pollution: The Czech core motorway network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper argues the case for viewing a countrys transition regime as a totality in which different career steps and routes assign significance and value to one another.

However, the reconstructed regime also locks-in features that may well become long-term problems, namely an expensive higher education system which leaves graduates with debts that many do not expect to repay in full, and substantial low wage, low skill, low productivity sectors in the economy and workforce.","output":"Regime Change: Education to Work Transitions in England, 1980sC2020s"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus outbreak, which emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and spread to the world, has changed each of our lives. Objective To investigate the effects of quarantine on depression, anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and SF-36 of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients during the COVID-19 outbreak and differences between healthy controls (HC). Methods Eighty-six MS patients and 65 HC patients were included in the study. Participants filled out the various scales through face-to-face interviews for mental health assessment from January 15 to February 15, 2021. Results When both groups were compared in terms of BECK-D inventory (p < 0.001), BECK-A inventory (p = 0.010), and FS (p < 0.001), the patient group had significantly higher results. Physical functioning (p < 0.001), physical role limitation (p = 0.001), energy vitality rates (p = 0.010), and general health perception (p < 0.001) were higher in the HC group. When MS patients were divided according to EDSS scores, BECK-A (p < 0.001), BECK-D (p = 0.001), and PSQI (p = 0.006) scores of the patients with EDSS > 3 were higher, while emotional role restriction rates (p = 0.006), energy and vitality (p = 0.018), and pain (p = 0.005) were significantly lower than those with EDSS  3. When MS patients were divided into two groups as who had COVID-19 and who did not and compared SF-36 subscale scores, pain, (p = 0.049) and mental status (p = 0.030) were obtained significant differences in the two groups. Conclusions Our study revealed that MS patients, who are more susceptible to the new 'normal' that emerged during the pandemic period, are among the priority groups that should be supported in terms of mental health as well as physical health.","output":"Effects of quarantine applied during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) features associated with a severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to propose a quick and easy to use model to identify patients at risk of a severe form. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 158 patients with biologically confirmed COVID-19 who underwent a chest CT after the onset of the symptoms were included. There were 84 men and 74 women with a mean age of 6814 (SD) years (range: 24-96years). There were 100 non-severe and 58 severe cases. Their clinical data were recorded and the first chest CT examination was reviewed using a computerized standardized report. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in order to identify the risk factors associated with disease severity. Two models were built: one was based only on qualitative CT features and the other one included a semi-quantitative total CT score to replace the variable representing the extent of the disease. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the two models were compared with DeLong's method. RESULTS: Central involvement of lung parenchyma (P<0.001), area of consolidation (P<0.008), air bronchogram sign (P<0.001), bronchiectasis (P<0.001), traction bronchiectasis (P<0.011), pleural effusion (P<0.026), large involvement of either one of the upper lobes or of the middle lobe (P<0.001) and total CT score&#8805;15 (P<0.001) were more often observed in the severe group than in the non-severe group. No significant differences were found between the qualitative model (large involvement of either upper lobes or middle lobe [odd ratio (OR)=2.473], central involvement [OR=2.760], pleural effusion [OR=2.699]) and the semi-quantitative model (total CT score&#8805;15 [OR=3.342], central involvement [OR=2.344], pleural effusion [OR=2.754]) with AUC of 0.722 (95% CI: 0.638-0.806) vs. 0.739 (95% CI: 0.656-0.823), respectively (P=0.209).

The current gold standard for molecular diagnostics is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the extraordinary and unmet demand for testing in a variety of environments means that both complementary and supplementary testing solutions are still needed. This review highlights the role that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has had in filling this global testing need, providing a faster and easier means of testing, and what it can do for future applications, pathogens, and the preparation for future outbreaks. This review describes the current state of the art for research of LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as its implications for other pathogens and testing.

Most people infected by the virus present mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and recover with supportive treatments. However, certain susceptible hosts develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), associated with an inflammatory \\"cytokine storm\\", leading to lung damage. Despite the current availability of different COVID-19 vaccines, the new emerging SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants represent a major concern worldwide, due to their increased transmissibility and rapid spread. Indeed, it seems that some mutations or combinations of mutations might confer selective advantages to the virus, such as the ability to evade the host immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. Several therapeutic approaches have been investigated but, to date, a unique and fully effective therapeutic protocol has not yet been achieved. In addition, steroid-based therapies, aimed to reduce inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, increasing the hospitalization time and mortality rate of these patients. Hence, there is an unmet need to develop more effective therapeutic options. Here, we discuss the potential use of natural immunomodulators such as Thymosin &#945;1 (T&#945;1), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and lactoferrin (LF), as adjunctive or preventive treatment of severe COVID-19 disease. These agents are considered to be multifunctional molecules because of their ability to enhance antiviral host immunity and restore the immune balance, depending on the host immune status. Furthermore, they are able to exert a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by means of direct interactions with cellular or molecular targets of pathogens or indirectly by increasing the host immune response. Thus, due to the aforementioned properties, these agents might have a great potential in a clinical setting, not only to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also to prevent opportunistic infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Immunomodulatory agents as potential therapeutic or preventive strategies for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

While the different waves of the Covid-19 pandemic have demonstrated the need for continued compliance, little is known about the impact of warning messages and risk perception on individual behavior in public health emergencies. To address this gap, this paper uses data from the second wave of Covid-19 in China to analyse how warning information influences preventive behavior through four categories risk perception and information interaction. Drawing on the protective action decision model (PADM) and the social amplification of risk framework (SARF), risk warning information (content, channel, and type), risk perception (threat perception, hazard- and resource-related preparedness behavior perception and stakeholder perception), information interaction, and preparedness behavior intention are integrated into a comprehensive model. To test our model, we run a survey with 724 residents in Northern China. The results show that hazard-related preparedness behavior perception and stakeholder perception act as mediators between warning and preventive action. Stakeholder perception had much stronger mediating effects than the hazard-related attributes. In addition, information interaction is effective in increasing all categories risk perception, stimulating public response, while functioning as a mediator for warning. The risk warning information content, channel, and type are identified as key drivers of risk perception. The research found that information channel was more related to different risk perception than other characteristics. Overall, these associations in our model explain core mechanisms behind compliance and allow policy-makers to gain new insights into preventive risk communication in public health emergencies.","output":"From warning messages to preparedness behavior: The role of risk perception and information interaction in the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dissecting the functional diversity of T cells is critical in elucidating mechanisms and in developing therapies for various diseases.

We extend this literature to examine practices of social distancing, specifically the act of maintaining a 'space between' bodies in communal areas - a practice currently brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the CF clinic as a case study, we examine how distancing can be understood as an emplaced practice of care, shaped by - and shaping - architectures and materialities in particular contexts.

Clinical staff practices of maintaining distancing were often regarded by patients as 'care-ful', part of personalised 'care in place', embroiling a wider care assemblage including ancillary staff, materialities and architectures. Patients also actively participate in distancing as an 'ethic of care', using strategies of 'holding back' and 'looking out' in confined spaces.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen children with DCD (aged 8-16 years) participated in the five-day intervention during which they worked on three intervention goals. After the intervention, during an eight-week training and coaching trajectory for parents and children, children worked on a transfer goal. Assessment took place at four moments in time: two pretest measures, a posttest measure, and a 3-month follow-up measure. Primary outcome measures focused on changes in performance and satisfaction of self-chosen intervention and transfer goals. The secondary outcome measure explored changes in children's attitude, motivation, and confidence in relation to motor skill activities, social skills, and level of participation. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found with regard to the performance and satisfaction of intervention goals. For the transfer goal, only parents reported significant improvements. Finally, parents indicated potential improvements with regard to the attitude, motivation, and confidence of their children, but not for their social skills or level of participation.

Wedged against the magnetic pile-up boundary, the low-frequency signatures last on average $\\\\sim$10 s with corresponding sizes of the order of 15-30 upstream solar wind proton thermal gyroradii, or 10-20 proton gyroradii in the immediate wake of the quasi-perpendicular bow shock.

Situated in a marginally stable plasma with $\\\\beta_{||}\\\\sim$1, we hypothesise that these so-called magnetic bottles, containing a relatively higher energy and denser ion population with respect to the background plasma, are formed upstream of the spacecraft behind the quasi-perpendicular shock.

Several epidemiological studies have indicated that dietary modifications, such as increased consumption of fruits and vegetables play an important role in reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors. Food sources rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, and hypoglycemic properties are thought to ameliorate the progression of cardiovascular disease and serve as a potential treatment mode. Many in vivo and in vitro studies using turmeric, cinnamon, mango, blueberries, red wine, chocolate, and extra virgin olive oil have demonstrated significant improvements in cholesterol profiles, toxic reactive oxygen species, inflammation, obesity, and hypertension.

Previous research shows that for-profit LTC homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than nonprofit homes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 29 to May 20, 2020, using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between profit status of LTC homes (for-profit, nonprofit or municipal) and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC homes, the extent of COVID-19 outbreaks (number of residents infected), and deaths of residents from COVID-19. RESULTS: The analysis included all 623 Ontario LTC homes, comprising 75 676 residents; 360 LTC homes (57.7%) were for profit, 162 (26.0%) were nonprofit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTC homes, involving 5218 residents and resulting in 1452 deaths, with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the public health unit region surrounding an LTC home (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.05), the number of residents (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61), and older design standards of the home (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the extent of an outbreak in an LTC home (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (adjusted RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared with nonprofit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older design standards in for-profit LTC homes and chain ownership. INTERPRETATION: For-profit status is associated with the extent of an outbreak of COVID-19 in LTC homes and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for-profit and nonprofit homes are largely explained by older design standards and chain ownership, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","output":"For-profit long-term care homes and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and resident deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with dementia are vulnerable during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, yet few studies describe their hospital course and outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the hospital course for COVID-19 patients with dementia to an aging cohort without dementia in a large New York City academic medical center. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study describing all consecutive patients age 65 or older with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center between March 6 and April 7, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were evaluated, including 116 (21.8%) with previously diagnosed dementia, and 415 without dementia. Patients with dementia had higher mortality (50.0%versus 35.4%, p = 0.006); despite similar comorbidities and complications, multivariate analysis indicated the association was dependent on age, sex, comorbidities, and code status. Patients with dementia more often presented with delirium (36.2%versus 11.6%, p < 0.001) but less often presented with multiple other COVID-19 symptoms, and these findings remained after adjusting for age and sex. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with dementia had higher mortality, but dementia was not an independent risk factor for death. These patients were approximately 3 times more likely to present with delirium but less often manifested or communicated other common COVID-19 symptoms. For this high-risk population in a worsening pandemic, understanding the unique manifestations and course in dementia and aging populations may help guide earlier diagnosis and optimize medical management.","output":"Clinical Features and Outcomes of Patients with Dementia Compared to an Aging Cohort Hospitalized During the Initial New York City COVID-19 Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evolution and popularity are two keys of the Barabasi-Albert model, which generates a power law distribution of network degrees. Evolving network generation models are important as they offer an explanation of both how and why complex networks (and scale-free networks, in particular) are ubiquitous. We adopt the evolution principle and then propose a very simple and intuitive new model for network growth, which naturally evolves modular networks with multiple communities. The number and size of the communities evolve over time and are primarily subjected to a single free parameter. Surprisingly, under some circumstances, our framework can construct a tree-like network with clear community structures-branches and leaves of a tree. Results also show that new communities will absorb a link resource to weaken the degree growth of hub nodes. Our models have a common explanation for the community of regular and tree-like networks and also breaks the tyranny of the early adopter; unlike the standard popularity principle, newer nodes and communities will come to dominance over time. Importantly, our model can fit well with the construction of the SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary network.","output":"Growing networks with communities: A distributive link model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To control the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), China imposed rigorous restrictions, which resulted in great reductions in pollutant emissions.

Compared to those before CNY, PM2.5, BC, SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), other ions, elements, and NO2 and CO mass concentrations decreased by 9.9%-64.0% during CNY. The lockdown policy had strong (weak) effects on the diurnal variations in aerosol chemical compositions (gas pollutants). Compared to those before CNY, source concentrations and contributions of vehicle exhaust during CNY decreased by 72.9% and 21.7%, respectively. In contrast, increased contributions from coal combustion and industry were observed during CNY, which were recorded to be 2.9 and 1.7 times higher than those before CNY, respectively. This study highlights that the lockdown policy that was imposed in Suzhou during CNY not only reduced the mass concentrations of air pollutants but also modified their diurnal variations and the source contributions of PM2.5, which revealed the complex responses of PM2.5 sources to the rare, low emissions of anthropogenic pollutants that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown.","output":"Air pollutant variations in Suzhou during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown of 2020: High time-resolution measurements of aerosol chemical compositions and source apportionment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has resulted in a global pandemic and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Zoonotic diseases are infections that are transmitted from animals to humans COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated in bats and transmitted to humans through a possible intermediate host Based on published research so far, pangolins are considered the most likely intermediate hosts Further studies are needed on different wild animal species, including pangolins that are sold at the same wet market or similar wet markets before concluding pangolins as definitive intermediate hosts SARS-CoV-2 is capable of reverse zoonosis as well Additional research is needed to understand the pathogenicity of the virus, especially in companion animals, modes of transmission, incubation period, contagious period, and zoonotic potential Interdisciplinary one health approach handles these mosaic issues of emerging threats by integrating professionals from multiple disciplines like human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, and social sciences Given that the future outbreak of zoonotic diseases is inevitable, importance must be given for swift identification of the pathogen, source, and transmission methods Countries should invest in identifying the hot spots for the origin of zoonotic diseases, enhance diagnostic capabilities, and rapid containment measures at local, regional, and national levels The threat posed by emerging infectious diseases in modern-days also needs combined efforts internationally where a single discipline or nation cannot handle the burden alone","output":"Potential Zoonotic Origins of SARS-CoV-2 and Insights for Preventing Future Pandemics Through One Health Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Obesity is a complex disease with negative impacts on physical and mental health. The treatment of obesity is an area where shared decision making and patient preferences play an important role. Recommendations surrounding weight loss medications are evolving and only recently, with the publication of the 2020 Canadian Obesity Management Clinical Guidelines, pharmacotherapy has become a recommended alternative for obesity management. Guidelines recommend three medications: orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone/bupropion. This study sought to identify medication attributes relevant to patients starting pharmacotherapy for weight management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Semi-structured focus groups and interviews were conducted with Canadian residents who were 18 years of age and were living with obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30kg/m(2) or 27kg/m(2) with adiposity-related complications). Sessions were conducted virtually, audio recorded, and transcribed. Two team members used a combination of inductive and deductive coding to independently code the data. A final coding template was agreed upon through discussion. RESULTS: A total of 21 individuals participated (85.7% female, 76.2% 40 years of age) with the average BMI being 44.3 kg/m(2). Participants touched upon many attributes which were categorized into five categories: 1) cost, 2) regimen, 3) side effects, 4) benefits, and 5) non-medication attributes. Cost of medications, lack of coverage by insurance companies, and stigma were identified as major barriers to accessing medications. There was consensus in the desire for a simple regimen, however there was heterogeneity among opinions on tolerability of side effects, desired benefits, and route of administration. CONCLUSION: This study identified attributes that influenced patients decisions when considering a new anti-obesity medication. Understanding these attributes can assist clinicians in shared decision-making. This study highlighted the stigma that is prevalent among providers and the need for education. Further research should be conducted to understand the tradeoffs patients in our study make between the identified attributes.","output":"Patient Preferences for Attributes of Health Canada Approved Weight Loss Medications Among Adults Living with Obesity in Canada: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The swift transition to remote learning in response to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic presented substantial challenges for both students and instructors in post\\\\secondary natural sciences education.

Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: Responses were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic between April 27th and July 13th. Participants: 398 LGBTQ+ respondents forming an analytical sample of 310 in the main models. Methods: We used a combined measure of gender identity or expression and sexual orientation as the main explanatory variable. We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We measured experiences of discrimination with a battery of questions that asked respondents whether they had experienced a set of discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. Experiences of discrimination was considered a mediating factor and examined both as an outcome as well as an explanatory variable. Models were adjusted for a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results: The prevalence of depression and stress were both high, with the majority of the sample exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (69%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). In regression models, the average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.517-2.354) for those who had experienced an instance of homophobic or transphobic harassment, compared to respondents who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (CES-D-10 scores of 10 or more) increased three-fold among those who had experienced harassment based on their gender or sexuality compared to those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95% CI: 1.168-9.052). These marked associations remained after adjustment for a number of socioeconomic and demographic covariates. Cis-female respondents who identify as gay or lesbian had the lowest scores for perceived social or depressive symptoms; conversely transgender and gender diverse individuals had the highest scores. Conclusions: We found high levels of stress and depressive symptoms, particularly among younger and transgender and gender diverse respondents. These associations were partially explained by experiences of discrimination which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on stress and mental health.","output":"The mental health and experiences of discrimination of LGBTQ+ people during the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial findings from the Queerantine Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had increased population-level anxiety and had elicited panic buying behaviour across the world. The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention. In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic buying of toilet paper during the crisis. Methods: A total of 255,171 tweets were collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic. Conclusions: Social media data can provide rapid infodemiology of public mental health.

We aimed to evaluate the experiences and working environment at an NCI-designated Cancer Center for current and future parents in the post-COVID era. We hypothesized there would be differences in the experiences of parents between men and women, and between trainees, faculty, and staff. Methods: A 61-question online survey for current and future parents was developed by the Women's Task Force of the Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Questions focused on perceived attitudes towards parents, the supportive nature of the working environment for parents, experiences with breastfeeding as a working parent, and childcare responsibilities preand post-COVID. The survey was sent to 562 scientific faculty, physicians, trainees, and research staff at HCC. Comparisons between groups of interest were performed using a chi-square test. Results:There were 214 respondents (38% response rate) with even representation: 38% were faculty, 27% were trainees, and 35% were research staff;59% were female. 6% of respondents reported being 'discouraged or excluded from participating in specific activities due to having or planning children', and 24% felt 'moderately supported' as a parent at work. Regarding breastfeeding, 58% reported that the decision to breastfeed was moderately impacted by returning to work, and of the women who were currently or recently breastfeeding, 42% reported that there were not enough lactation rooms in their building. Other questions in the survey aimed to evaluate what further support would be helpful for parents. 40% reported that on-site childcare would help better support them as a parent, especially because 47% documented that finding childcare was difficult and 53% documented that they looked at 4 daycares or nannies. Further, 49% reported that they did not know where to look for resources in finding childcare. Pre-COVID, 32% reported spending 2-3 hours a day on childcare and/or home responsibilities;post-COVID, 55% reported spending 4 hours a day. These effects were more pronounced in women compared to men (p &lt; 0.05). Pre-COVID, 40% reported that they were unable to participate in work events due to childcare responsibilities, which increased to 54% post-COVID, and was most pronounced in faculty and trainees compared to staff (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our survey describes some of the universal challenges of working parents in Oncology, which have been exacerbated by COVID. The impact of COVID was more pronounced in women.

Moreover, we give a brief overview on how this knowledge developed so far into novel therapeutic approaches to target metastatic prostate cancer. ABSTRACT: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancer types in males and the consequences of its distant metastatic deposits are the leading cause of PCa mortality. Therefore, identifying the causes and molecular mechanisms of hematogenous metastasis formation is of considerable clinical importance for the future development of improved therapeutic approaches. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting messenger RNAs. Numerous studies have identified miRNAs as promotors or inhibitors of metastasis and revealed, in part, their targeting pathways in PCa. Because miRNAs are remarkably stable and can be detected in both tissue and body fluid, its potential as specific biomarkers for metastasis and therapeutic response is also currently under preclinical evaluation. In the present review, we focus on miRNAs that are supposed to initiate or suppress metastasis by targeting several key mRNAs in PCa. Metastasis-suppressing miRNAs include miR-33a-5p, miR-34, miR-132 and miR-212, miR-145, the miR-200 family (incl. miR-141-3p), miR-204-5p, miR-532-3p, miR-335, miR-543, miR-505-3p, miR 19a 3p, miR-802, miR-940, and miR-3622a. Metastasis-promoting RNAs, such as miR-9, miR-181a, miR-210-3, miR-454, miR-671-5p, have been shown to increase the metastatic potential of PCa cells. Other metastasis-related miRNAs with conflicting reports in the literature are also discussed (miR-21 and miR-186). Finally, we summarize the recent developments of miRNA-based therapeutic approaches, as well as current limitations in PCa. Taken together, the metastasis-controlling miRNAs provide the potential to be integrated in the strategy of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of metastatic PCa. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of consistency between certain miRNA signatures and reproducibility, which impedes clinical implementation.","output":"Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"U radu autori analiziraju hrvatski profesionalni sport i utjecaj COVID-19 krize na njega.

The results indicated that more health problems were associated with higher stress and burnout symptoms. While seeking emotional support and using drugs or alcohol to cope were associated with higher stress, a positive social outlook was associated with lower stress. Lower quality of work-life was associated with higher burnout symptoms and turnover intention. Negative effects of the pandemic on wellbeing and higher number of COVID-19-related concerns were associated with higher stress and burnout symptoms. Contrary to the original hypotheses, self-care was not associated with any of the three outcomes, and effects of the political climate and issues of racism on wellbeing were not associated with stress, burnout or turnover intention. However, identifying as a Person of Colour was associated with higher stress, as well as lower burnout. The findings on worker health, social outlook, quality of work-life and race/ethnicity, in particular, suggest a critical need for healthcare systems to address the wellbeing of workers through equitable organisational policy and practice.","output":"A cross-sectional analysis of factors associated with stress, burnout and turnover intention among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spurred in part by literature published in the immediate aftermath of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, powered air\\\\purifying respirators have seen increased use worldwide during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

(3) Results: Of the total of 12,066 patients included in the study, most were males (7052, 58.5%) and Caucasian (10,635, 89.5%), with a mean age at diagnosis of 67 years (standard deviation (SD) 16). The main pre-admission comorbidities were arterial hypertension (6030, 50%), hyperlipidemia (4741, 39.4%) and diabetes mellitus (2309, 19.2%). The average number of days from COVID-19 symptom onset to hospital admission was 6.7 (SD 7). The triad of fever, cough, and dyspnea was present almost uniformly in all 4 clinical phenotypes identified by clustering. Cluster C1 (8737 patients, 72.4%) was the largest, and comprised patients with the triad alone. Cluster C2 (1196 patients, 9.9%) also presented with ageusia and anosmia; cluster C3 (880 patients, 7.3%) also had arthromyalgia, headache, and sore throat; and cluster C4 (1253 patients, 10.4%) also manifested with diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Compared to each other, cluster C1 presented the highest in-hospital mortality (24.1% vs. 4.3% vs. 14.7% vs. 18.6%; p < 0.001).

In this work, the MoSO monolayer with tunable electronic and magnetic properties is comprehensively investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The pristine MoSO single layer is an indirect gap semiconductor with energy gap of 1.02(1.64) eV as predicted by the PBE(HSE06) functional. This gap feature can be efficiently modified by applying external strain presenting a decrease in its value upon switching the strain from compressive to tensile. In addition, the effects of vacancies and doping at Mo, S, and O sites on the electronic structure and magnetic properties are examined. Results reveal that Mo vacancies, and Al and Ga doping yield magnetic semiconductor 2D materials, where both spin states are semiconductors with significant spin-polarization at the vicinity of the Fermi level. In contrast, single S and O vacancies induce a considerable gap reduction of 52.89% and 58.78%, respectively. Doping the MoSO single layer with F and Cl at both S and O sites will form half-metallic 2D materials, whose band structures are generated by a metallic spin-up state and direct gap semiconductor spin-down state. Consequently, MoV, MoAl, MoGa, SF, SCl, OF, and OCl are magnetic systems, and the magnetism is produced mainly by the Mo transition metal that exhibits either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling. Our work may suggest the MoSO Janus monolayer as a prospective candidate for optoelectronic applications, as well as proposing an efficient approach to functionalize it to be employed in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.","output":"Tuning MoSO monolayer properties for optoelectronic and spintronic applications: effect of external strain, vacancies and doping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 attacks hemoglobin through its structural protein ORF3a, dissociating the iron from the heme, as iron is necessary by cell machinery for virus replication. In this process protoporphyrin (PpIX) is released. METHODS: The decrease in the hemoglobin levels observed in patients with Covid-19 is frequently accompanied by an increase in PpIX levels. This evidence was confirmed by the quantification of PpIX by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PpIX emission is observed in its two characteristic bands at approximately 635 nm and 705 nm. RESULTS: This paper searches to understand the role of heme and PpIX inside the cells. Perspectives on the use of PpIX fluorescence as a sensor to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue, blood, urine, or feces to map the evolution and severity of the disease or to monitor the response of the Covid-19 treatment modalities were described. CONCLUSION: Fluorescence spectroscopy could be adopted as an excellent diagnostic technique for Covid-19, of low cost and high sensitivity. This method can potentially be used as a marker to monitor the response to the treatments.

Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.","output":"Early warning signals of malaria resurgence in Kericho, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital Object Identifier: 10 1188/21 0NF E4 PODIUM ABSTRACTS ADVANCED PRACTICE ONCOLOGY NURSE PRACTITIONER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED MONITORING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Jennifer Lloyd, MSN, FNP-C, OCN?, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT;Heidi Nielson, DNP, AG-ACNP, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT;Eli lacob, PhD, University of Utah College of Nursing, Salt Lake City, UT;Gary Donaldson, PhD, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT;Kathi Mooney, PhD, RN, FAAN, University of Utah College of Nursing, Salt Lake City, UT Patients receiving treatment for cancer are challenged to adjust to the diagnosis of a life-threatening disease, cope with treatment demands, and deal with disease and treatment-related side effects THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST (CNS) ROLE IN SUPPORTING REDEPLOYED STAFF DURING COVID-19: RAPID INTEGRATION OF SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO PROVIDE OPTIMAL PATIENT CARE Natasha Ramrup, MSN, RN, OCN?, AOCNS?, CNS, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;Nora Love, MS, RN, CURN, OCN?, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY CNS are in an ideal position to support staff during times of rapid change to ensure safe patient care POINT OF CARE GENETIC TESTING IN A BREAST CANCER SURVIVORSHIP CLINIC Lori Ranallo, RN, MSN, CBCN?, APRN-BC, University of Kansas, Westwood, KS;Lauren Nye, MD, University of Kansas Health System, Westwood, KS;Mary Williams, RN, BSN, OCN?, CBCN?, University of Kansas Health System, Westwood, KS;Carol Fabian, MD, University of Kansas Health System, Westwood, KS;Anne O'Dea, MD, University of Kansas Health System, Westwood, KS;Jennifer Klemp, PhD, University of Kansas Health System, Westwood, KS Breast cancer survivorship care (BCSC) includes the ongoing assessment of personal and family cancer history and offering genetic education, counseling and testing to survivors who meet NCCN, ASBrS and Medicare guidelines for germline genetic testing Incorporating a point of care genetic testing model requires additional support (genetic extender), professional development, education, and a commitment to provide patient centric care","output":"Late-Breaking Abstracts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ABO blood type has been reported to be associated with several diseases such as hepatitis and malaria.

Fear of the future, feelings of uncertainty and loneliness led to a rise in mental health problems. Public family support services also faced significant challenges: while families felt more need for support, established means of reaching families and providing services were severely curtailed. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed at capturing pandemic-related changes in family needs and at documenting experiences in the use of newly developed analog and digital services provided by public family support institutions in the city of Hamburg, Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted focus groups with staff members of different types of public family support services and parents who were using these services. Central topics of discussion were pandemic-related experiences and ideas for the future of public family support services. RESULTS: Results confirm an increase in family pressures. Parents and staff members missed low-threshold accessibility of services and personal contact and dialogue. Creative approaches to complement services digitally were developed. Several of these approaches were considered beneficial, especially for reaching new target groups and strengthening interprofessional cooperation in the field. CONCLUSIONS: In-person support services need to be upheld. However, digital services can effectively complement analog formats.

To understand the route of disease origin and viral transmission in companion animals, a comparative pan-genomic analysis of coronavirus sequences originating from major felines and canines were conducted. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) is a rapid procedure for assessing the very close antigenic relationship between feline CoV (FCoVs) and canine CoV (CCoVs) and ANI-based phylogenetic tree that clustered CoVs according to their respective host species. While pan-genomic analysis demarcated strains clearly. The distribution of the clinical isolates all across the categories in the hierarchical phylogenetic model enabled the visualization of their original ecological niche rather than their isolation source, as infections are extremely rare events and evolutionary dead-ends. In polymorphism analysis, we found seven accessory gene clusters common to the FCoV/CCoV category clade, including pantropic strains, that perform functions supporting their pathogenicity. In addition, the gene presence/absence among FCoVs and CCoVs would provide very valuable information on species-specific control measures against CoV disease, such as the selection of good markers for differentiating new species from common and/or pantropic isolates. Also, the virulent FCoV strains were grouped with human CoV strains NL63 and 229E confirming hypotheses stating that cats are highly susceptible to HCoVs, while dogs have low susceptibility to the virus.

Overall, our study underscores the high diversity of the Delta variant between countries and identifies a list of amino acid mutations in the Delta variants proteome for probing the mechanistic basis of pathogenic features such as high viral loads, high transmissibility, and reduced susceptibility against neutralization by vaccines.","output":"High diversity in Delta variant across countries revealed by genome\\\\wide analysis of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 beyond the Spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first case of COVID-19 in Japan was reported on 16 January 2020. The total number of the infected has reached 313,844 and the number of deaths has reached 4,379 as of 16 January 2021. This article reviews the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021 in order to provide a reference for the next step in epidemic prevention and control. The Japanese Government declared a state of emergency on 7 April 2020, which suppressed the increase in the number of the infected by curtailing economic activity. The first wave peaked at 701 new cases a day and it decreased to 21 new cases on May 25 when the state of emergency was lifted. However, the number of the infected increased again due to the resumption of economic activity, with a peak of 1,762 new cases a day during the second wave. Although the situation was worse than that during the first wave, the government succeeded in limiting the increase without declaring a state of emergency again, and that may be attributed to a decrease in crowd activities and an increase in the number of inspections. During the third wave, the number of the infected continued to exceed the peak during previous waves for two months. Major factors for this rise include the government's implementation of further policies to encourage certain activities, relaxed immigration restrictions, and people not reducing their level of activity. An even more serious problem is the bed usage for patients with COVID-19; bed usage exceeds 50% not only in major cities but also in various areas. On 7 January 2021, 5,953 new cases were reported a day; this greatly exceeded the previous peak, and the state of emergency was declared again. Although Japan has been preparing its medical system since the first wave, maintaining that system has imposed a large economic burden on medical facilities, hence stronger measures and additional support are urgently needed to combat COVID-19 in the coming few months.","output":"Overview of the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is taking a significant toll on front-line healthcare professionals - especially nurses who provide care for patients 24/7. Given the trend for higher acuity levels among the COVID-19 patients and increased infection prevention and control (IPAC) precautions, such as donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE), the demands on front-line healthcare professionals have changed. To understand the changes, discrete event simulation (DES) was used to quantify the effects of varying COVID-19 policies on nurse workload and quality of care. We are testing a standard nurse-patient ratio of 1:5 where we vary the number of COVID-19 positive patients in that mix from 1 to 5. Preliminary modeling results show as nurses were assigned to more COVID-19 positive patients, the workload of nurses increased, and quality of care deteriorated. In comparison to the baseline (pre-pandemic) case, distance walked by simulant-nurse, mental workload, direct care time, missed care, missed care delivery time and care task waiting time, increased by up to 40%, 279%, ?27%, 132%, 311% and 44%, respectively.

Indeed, high crowding indexes (i.e. high numbers of people relative to the vehicle size), inadequate clean air supply, and frequent extended exposure durations make transport environments potential hotspots for transmission of respiratory infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, generic mitigation measures (e.g. physical distancing) have been applied without also considering the airborne transmission route. This is due to the lack of quantified data about airborne contagion risk in transport environments. In this study, we apply a novel combination of close proximity and room-scale risk assessment approaches for people sharing public transport environments to predict their contagion risk due to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection. In particular, the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (expressed through the reproduction number) are evaluated for two types of buses, differing in terms of exposure time and crowding index: urban and long-distance buses. Infection risk and reproduction number are calculated for different scenarios as a function of the ventilation rates (both measured and estimated according to standards), crowding indexes, and travel times. The results show that for urban buses, the close proximity contribution significantly affects the maximum occupancy to maintain a reproductive number of <1. In particular, full occupancy of the bus would be permitted only for an infected subject breathing, whereas for an infected subject speaking, masking would be required. For long-distance buses, full occupancy of the bus can be maintained only if specific mitigation solutions are simultaneously applied. For example, for an infected person speaking for 1h, appropriate filtration of the recirculated air and simultaneous use of FFP2 masks would permit full occupancy of the bus for a period of almost 8h. Otherwise, a high percentage of immunized persons (>80%) would be needed.","output":"Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 airborne infection transmission risk in public buse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the deadly epidemic COVID-19 was exponentially spread across the world as a pandemic outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, termed as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) In this view, the imminent danger of a pandemic situation surge the researchers and physicians to understand the molecular mechanism and pathology of this novel virus, in order to discover promising therapeutic drugs and vaccines to cure the diseases At present, World Health Organization (WHO) updates on 27th June, 2020 for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak situation with confirmed cases of 9,653,048 and 491,128 deaths in 211 countries, areas or territories To control the global outbreak, robust measures have been implemented across the world to minimize COVID-19 disease spread, in specific restricting international and domestic flights, enforcing lockdowns in susceptible areas, social distancing, etc Although, a very few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs was tested in clinical trials against COVID-19 virus, which resulted in patient recovery Based on existing published data, this review extensively highlights the COVID-19 epidemiology, clinical manifestations, prognosis, treatment and prevention In order to offer a detailed overview to public health officials and future readers all over the world, we explain the latest interpretation of COVID-19 and presented the current state of implementation of the medical intervention in this review This review is hoped to help the public understand and combat with SARS-CoV-2, as well as provide a guideline for future research","output":"Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19): A Review on Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Molecular Mechanism, Therapeutic Evidence and Preventive Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli strains are common agents of diarrhoea particularly in developing countries.

As DT projects are disruptive to an organisation and are significantly different from traditional information technology projects, it is important to understand the value that specific DT projects will bring to an organisation before they are implemented, so that DT project portfolios can be optimally managed. Aim: This study aims to determine the key goals and benefits of DT projects, as well as the selection criteria for DT projects in South African businesses. The study also explores the most influential technologies for driving the implementation of DT projects. Setting: South Africa is an emerging economy. The study was performed in the initial phases of nationwide lockdown owing to COVID-19. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 leaders from South African businesses of varying sizes, but all in significant local markets. Content analysis using CAQDAS was used to analyse the primary data, using both inductive and deductive coding methods. Results: South African businesses use a combination of financial and non-financial project selection criteria across four main goals and benefit categories: customer experience, operational efficiency, business culture, and traditional project evaluation. The fifth proposed goal (new business models) was not used to evaluate DT projects. The most influential technologies that drive the selection of DT projects were data-related, such as data storage, data processing, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. Conclusion: Companies in South Africa can use traditional project evaluation criteria together with several new criteria to determine the value of DT projects more holistically.

STUDY: This cross-sectional study took place in Sarawak, Malaysia among 11 pig farms, 2 abattoirs, and 3 animal markets in June and July of 2017. Pig feces, pig oral secretions, bioaerosols, and worker nasal wash samples were collected and analyzed via rPCR and rRT-PCR for respiratory and diarrheal viruses. RESULTS: In all, 55 pig fecal, 49 pig oral or water, 45 bioaerosol, and 78 worker nasal wash samples were collected across 16 sites.

I wanted to take advantage of excellent IT support, and NHS England funding of software licence, to drive introduction of Attend Anywhere patient videoconsultation (telepsychiatry) software within my local ADAPT (Anxiety, Depression and Personality Disorder,Trauma) Community Mental Health Team from April 2020 onwards. Method I assembled a small group of clinicans to take part in a local pilot of Attend Anywhere software. One Care Coordinator, a Consultant Psychologist, two Consultant Psychiatrists and myself completed satisfaction and confidience scores throughout an 8 week period. Number of videoconsultation outpatient appointments offered to and accepted by patients were also recorded. Weekly group meetings were deemed impossible to schedule given pandemic workloads, so we used 1:1 quick remote catchups, identifying and troubleshooting obstacles, working with IT implement a work-around when the team hit a technical brick wall. Result Clinician confidence and satisfaction increased significantly during this period, as did number of offered & completed video consultations. Attend Anywhere consultations were used for up to 25% of clinician weekly workload. Clinicians who manage their own diaries started quickly It was difficult to successfully engage Administration team to organise Attend Anywhere test calls, leading to slow uptake for Consultant Psychiatrists who do not manage their own diaries. Conclusion Patient obstacles to use of Attend Anywhere appeared to be idiosyncratic and multifactorial, including poverty, digital exclusion, lack of privacy at home, and clinical history of online grooming. However, some patients already used Attend Anyhwere software with their physical health teams, while others prefer videocall to phone. Age was not an obstacle. Once this small group of clinicians began to use software successfully, it had a snowball effect within the team and other clinicians asked to sign up for the service. Full support from Administration teams will be crucial to increasing videocalls within the service.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand and measure current robotic-assisted surgery processes in a systematic, quantitative, and replicable manner to identify latent systemic threats and opportunities for improvement based on our observations and to implement and evaluate interventions. This 5-year study will follow a human factors engineering approach to improve the safety and efficiency of robotic-assisted surgery across 4 US hospitals. METHODS: The study uses a stepped wedge crossover design with 3 interventions, introduced in different sequences at each of the hospitals over four 8-month phases. Robotic-assisted surgery procedures will be observed in the following specialties: urogynecology, gynecology, urology, bariatrics, general, and colorectal. We will use the data collected from observations, surveys, and interviews to inform interventions focused on teamwork, task design, and workplace design. We intend to evaluate attitudes toward each intervention, safety culture, subjective workload for each case, effectiveness of each intervention (including through direct observation of a sample of surgeries in each observational phase), operating room duration, length of stay, and patient safety incident reports. Analytic methods will include statistical data analysis, point process analysis, and thematic content analysis.

Recent studies showed that CMR has a broad spectrum of anticancer activities and induces paraptosis in breast cancer and prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of CMR against human non-small cell lung cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. We found that CMR dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human lung cancer H460, A549 and PC-9 cells. Furthermore, exposure to low and median doses of CMR induced paraptosis but not apoptosis, which was presented as the formation of extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation with increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, Bip and Chop, as well as activation of MAPK pathway in the lung cancer cells. Knockdown of Bip with siRNA not only reduced the cell-killing effect of CMR, but also decreased the percentage of cytoplasmic vacuoles in H460 cells. Moreover, CMR also increased the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to radiotherapy through enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress. In lung cancer H460 cell xenograft nude mice, combined treatment of CMR and radiation caused greatly enhanced tumor growth inhibition with upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins and activation of pErk in xenograft tumor tissue. These data demonstrate that the anticancer activity and radiosensitization effect of CMR result from inducing paraptosis, suggesting that CMR could be considered as a potential anticancer agent and radiation sensitizer in the future cancer therapeutics.","output":"Chalcomoracin inhibits cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to radiotherapy in human non-small cell lung cancer cells via inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated paraptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has killed over 5 million people worldwide.

However, initiating and sustaining these changes remains a challenge. Ingestion of whey protein has shown to be effective for improving glycaemic control by increasing insulin and incretin secretion, and influencing appetite regulation; however, little is known about what influences uptake and adherence. We conducted a qualitative interview study to explore behavioural determinants of uptake and adherence to a commercially made whey protein supplementation. In total, 16/18 adults with type 2 diabetes who participated in an RCT took part in a semi-structured interview. Seven themes were generated from the data following thematic analyses. The most frequently reported determinant of uptake was the expectation that the supplement would improve health status (e.g., type 2 diabetes management), as a consequence of appetite suppression and weight loss. Determinants of adherence included palatability; the belief that the supplement was an appetite suppressant; and receiving positive reinforcement on the effects of the supplement.

In low-income countries diagnosis is under 10%. Self-testing for HCV antibodies (HCVST) could expand the coverage of HCV testing services. Currently, there are no stringent regulatory authority (SRA) approved HCVSTs, therefore lay-user usability of three prototype kits was assessed. This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted with 171 (CareStart n = 60, Bioline n = 52, First Response n = 59) participants. Participants were given one of the three HCVST kits with only instructions for use (IFU) and asked to perform the test in front of a professional trained in rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Usability indices were calculated based on the correctness of performing each step of the product-specific process followed by contrived results interpretation and a post-test interview. The usability index was 93.9% for CareStart, 90.7% for Bioline and 94.9% for First Response. Most errors were on incorrect handwashing, sample collection and transfer to the test device. An average of 93.1% of contrived results were correctly interpreted, with most errors related to interpreting invalid results. Most participants (n = 167) stated they would visit a clinic after a positive result. With negative results, nearly half (28/60 (46.7%)) stated they should condomize, while just over two-thirds of participants that used Bioline (35/52 (67.3%)) and First Response (38/59 (64.4%)) said they should re-test. Most participants (n = 162) found the devices easy to use. Participants liked that self-testing was fast, private and convenient, however there were some confusion with IFU steps and pictures, finger-pricking with the lancet, collecting blood after the finger-prick, and transferring the sample/buffer.

One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to, from a statistical perspective, identify several key issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. METHODS: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, and the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) to analyze the reconstructed data. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups, and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We use the restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) as a global and robust measure for efficacy. RESULTS: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was C1.67 days (95% CI C3.62 to 0.28; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al, the difference of RMTIs at day 28 was C0.89 days (95% CI C2.84 to 1.06; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the hazard ratio estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al, the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups at day 30 was C2.7 days (95% CI C4.0 to C1.2; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in the recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI C3 to 0; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences became more statistically significant at larger percentiles.

Factors associated with a worse Covid-19 prognosis include old age (> 65 years), ethnicity, male sex, obesity and people with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases. Further, vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure due to Covid-19. Vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor, which - according to a recent clinical case series C has the prospect of reducing hospital stay, intensive care and fatal outcomes. Vitamin D has potent immunomodulatory property sand its supplementation might improve important outcomes in critically ill and vitamin D deficient Covid-19 patients. Despite the evidence that supports an association between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 severity, there is uncertainty about the direct link. The aim of the trial is therefore to assess if high dose vitamin D supplementation has a therapeutic effect in vitamin D deficient patients with Covid-19.MethodsRandomized, placebo-controlled double blind, multi-centre study trial to compare a high single dose of vitamin D (140000 IU) followed by treatment as usual (TAU) (VitD + TAU) with treatment as usual only (placebo + TAU) in patients with Covid-19 and vitamin D deficiency.DiscussionVitamin D substitution in patients with Covid-19 and vitamin D deficiency should be investigated for efficacy and safety.

The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. SPINT2 is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between SPINT2/TMPRSS2 and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that SPINT2 negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after SPINT2 knockdown, while overexpression lead to a drastic reduction of the viral load. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases.","output":"The endogenous cellular protease inhibitor SPINT2 controls SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and is associated to disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic in March 2020.

This study aimed to examine the demographics and incidence of COVID-19 in homeless vs non-homeless emergency department (ED) patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients seen in the University of Louisville Hospital Emergency Department (ULH ED) from March 2019 to December 2020, excluding January and February 2020. Data was collected from the Kentucky Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) and ULH electronic health records. RESULTS: A total of 51,532 unique patients had 87,869 visits during the study period. There was a 18.1% decrease in homeless patient visits over the time period, which was similar to the decrease in non-homeless patient visits (19.2%). In the total population, 9471 individuals had known COVID-19 testing results, with a total of 610 positive (6.4% positivity rate). Of the 712 homeless ED patients, 39 tested positive (5.5% positivity rate). After adjusting for age, gender identity, race, and insurance, there was no statistically significant difference in test positivity between homeless and non-homeless patients, OR 1.23 (0.88, 1.73). Homeless patients were less likely to be admitted to either the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: OR 0.51, 0.60) as they were more likely to be discharged (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.52, 1.79).

METHODS: We enrolled 36 COPD patients and 47 healthy volunteers, classified according to pulmonary function into: normal, COPD mild, and COPD severe. Contrast gradient was obtained from sequential dynamic x-ray (DXR) and converted to motion vector using OFM. VF-DXR images were created by projection of the vertical component of lung motion vectors onto DXR images. The maximum magnitude of lung motion vectors in tidal inspiration/expiration, forced inspiration/expiration were selected and defined as lung motion velocity (LMV). Correlations between LMV with demographics and pulmonary function and differences in LMV between COPD patients and healthy volunteers were investigated. RESULTS: Negative correlations were confirmed between LMV and % forced expiratory volume in one second (%FEV(1)) in the tidal inspiration in the right lung (Spearmans rank correlation coefficient, r(s) = -0.47, p < 0.001) and the left lung (r(s) = -0.32, p = 0.033).

However, there is limited data about the management of chronic anticoagulation therapy in these patients. We assessed the anticoagulation and incidence of major cardiovascular events in hospitalized patients with AF and COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively investigated all consecutive patients with AF admitted with COVID-19 between March and May 2020 in 9 Spanish hospitals. We selected a control group of non-AF patients consecutively admitted with COVID-19. We compared baseline characteristics, incidence of major bleeding, thrombotic events and mortality. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to minimize potential confounding variables, as well as a multivariate analysis to predict major bleeding and death. Results: 305 patients admitted with AF and COVID-19 were included. After PSM, 151 AF patients were matched with 151 control group patients. During admission, low-molecular-weight heparin was the principal anticoagulant and the incidence of major bleeding and mortality were higher in the AF group [16(10.6%) vs 3(2%), p=0.003; 52(34.4%) vs 35(23.2%), p=0.03, respectively]. The multivariate analysis showed the presence of AF as independent predictor of in-hospital major bleeding and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In AF group, a secondary multivariate analysis identified high levels of D-dimer as independent predictor of in-hospital major bleeding. Conclusions: AF patients admitted with COVID-19 represent a population at high risk for bleeding and mortality during admission.

Despite intensive research, most of the existing diagnostic methods remain non-specific, labour-intensive, time-consuming or are not sensitive enough for rapid and timely diagnosis of the onset and progression of sepsis. The present work was undertaken to explore the potential of Raman spectroscopy to identify the biomarkers of sepsis in a label-free and minimally invasive manner using different mouse models of inflammation. The sera of BALB/c mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium reveal extensive hemolysis, as indicated by the Raman bands that are characteristic of the porphyrin ring of hemoglobin (668, 743, 1050, 1253 and 1397 cm-1) which increase in a kinetic manner. These markers are also observed in a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock model, but not in a thioglycollate-induced sterile peritonitis model. These data demonstrate that hemolysis is a signature of systemic, but not localised, inflammation. To further validate our observations, sepsis was induced in the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2-/-) deficient strain which is more sensitive to infection. Interestingly, Nos2-/- mice exhibit a higher degree of hemolysis than C57BL/6 mice. Sepsis-induced hemolysis was also confirmed using resonance Raman spectroscopy with 442 nm excitation which demonstrated a pronounced increase in the resonant Raman bands at 670 and 1350 cm-1 in sera of the infected mice.

As the protective immunity following the infection wanes within few months, studies of re-infection after prolonged duration is needed. Hence we assessed the potential of re-infection by Delta, Delta AY.1 and B.1 in COVID-19 recovered hamsters after 3 months of infection. Re-infection with Delta and B.1 variants in hamsters showed reduced viral shedding, lung pathology and lung viral load, whereas the upper respiratory tract viral load remained similar to that of first infection. The reduction in viral load and lung pathology after re-infection with Delta AY.1 variant was not marked. Further we assessed the disease characteristics of Delta AY.1 to understand whether it has any replication advantage over Delta variant and B.1 variant, an early isolate in Syrian hamsters. Body weight changes, viral load in respiratory organs, lung pathology, cytokine response and neutralizing antibody response were assessed. Delta AY.1 variant produced milder disease in comparison to Delta variant and the neutralizing response was similar against Delta, B.1 and B.1.351 variant in contrast to Delta or B.1 infected hamsters which showed a significant reduction in neutralization titres against B.1.351. Elevation of IL-6 levels was observed post infection in hamsters after primary infection. The prior infection could not produce sterilizing immunity but the protective effect was evident following reinfection. This indicates the importance of the transmission prevention efforts even after achieving herd immunity. Research in context Evidence before this study Secondary infections with Delta variant are being widely reported and there are reports of increased disease severity. Delta sub lineages with K417N substitution has caused concern worldwide due to the presence of the same substitution in Beta variant, a Variant of Concern known for its immune evasion. The information on the biological characteristics of this sub lineage is also scanty. Added value of this study The present study showed that the secondary infection with Delta variant does not show any evidence of increased disease severity in hamster model. Delta AY. 1 variant produces mild disease in Syrian hamsters in contrast to severe disease caused by Delta variant. Delta, B.1 and AY.1 variant infected hamster sera showed comparable cross neutralizing response against each other. In contrast to the lower neutralizing response shown by B.1 and Delta variant infected animals against B.1.351 variant, Delta AY.1 showed comparable response as that with other variants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 18.03.2009 and 09.12.2009, 100 patients were included in the study and they underwent elective gallbladder removal by applying the laparoscopic technique. All patients were divided into two equal groups: qualified for SILS cholecystectomy (group I) and qualified for classic four-trocar laparoscopic cholecystectomy (group II), whose ASA physical status was I and II. BMI was limited to 35 kg/m(2). Outcome measures included operative time, intensity of postoperative pain and consumption of painkillers, hospital stay, need for conversion, complications, and cosmetic effects. RESULTS Mean operating time in group I was 66 min and in group II 47.2 min. Intensity of pain evaluated by using the visual analogue scale (VAS) 6 h after the operation in group I was 3.49 and in group II 4.53, whereas 24 h after the operation in group I it was 1.18 and in group II 1.55.

Recent COVID-19 research indicates that the disease progress propagates from the bottom of the lungs to the top. However, chest radiography (CXR) cannot directly provide a quantitative metric of radiographic opacities, and existing AI-assisted CXR analysis methods do not quantify the regional severity. In this paper, to assist the regional analysis, we developed a fully automated framework using deep learning-based four-region segmentation and detection models to assist the quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia. Specifically, a segmentation model is first applied to separate left and right lungs, and then a detection network of the carina and left hilum is used to separate upper and lower lungs. To improve the segmentation performance, an ensemble strategy with five models is exploited. We evaluated the clinical relevance of the proposed method compared with the radiographic assessment of the quality of lung edema (RALE) annotated by physicians. Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate a positive correlation to the regional extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities based on the RALE. Therefore, the proposed method can accurately assist the quantification of regional pulmonary opacities of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","output":"Deep Learning-Based Four-Region Lung Segmentation in Chest Radiography for COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Flexible endoscopic treatment is one of the alternative approaches for the management of Zenker's diverticum. The present paper shows our short-term and long-term results with flexible endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy/septotomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of our experience in patients with Zenker's diverticulum treated using a flexible endoscope, assisted by a flexible diverticuloscope, between 2002 and 2015. Myotomy/septotomy was performed with a needle-knife papillotome under deep sedation or general anesthesia. RESULTS Among the 64 patients treated, two died within 10 days of surgery from causes not directly related to the procedure, and one presented with pharyngo-esophageal perforation, which recovered with conservative management at 47 days after admission. Four additional patients were lost to short-term follow-up. Among the 57 remaining patients, 52 had complete relief of dysphagia after 6 weeks. Eleven of these had recurrent symptoms on the mid and the long term. Eight were retreated with the same flexible endoscopic technique, one with a hybrid endoscopic approach, one with classical open surgery and one refused retreatment. After a mean follow-up of 2 years and a half, 33 of 37 patients reported absent or minimal dysphagia, controllable with punctual dietary restrictions. CONCLUSIONS Flexible endoscopic treatment for Zenker's diverticulum is effective and safe. It represents an option on an equal footing to rigid endoscopy and classical open surgery and may also be used when the latter two are technically impracticable or contraindicated.","output":"Flexible endoscopic treatment of Zenker's diverticulum: thirteen years' experience in Spain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals who have been vaccinated for COVID19 should have IgG antibody in response to the specific antigen that is the target in the vaccine development.

We investigate the association between food insecurity severity and mental illnesses in a nationally representative youth sample. METHODS We sampled 55 700 youth 12-24 years from recent cycles of Canadian Community Health Survey. Household food insecurity was measured using a standard 18-item questionnaire. We fitted Poisson regressions on self-rated mental health and diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, controlling for sociodemographic confounders. Clinical assessments of emotional distress, major depression and suicidal ideation were examined in subsamples with available data. We stratified the sample by gender, age and survey cycle to test potential demographic heterogeneity. RESULTS One in seven youth lived in marginal (5.30%), moderate (8.08%) or severe (1.44%) food insecurity. Results showed that food insecurity was associated with higher likelihood of every mental health problem examined. The association was graded, with more severe food insecurity linked to progressively worse mental health. Notably, marginal, moderate and severe food insecurity were associated with 1.77, 2.44 and 6.49 times higher risk of suicidal thoughts, respectively. The corresponding relative risk for mood disorders were 1.57, 2.00 and 2.89; those for anxiety disorders were 1.41, 1.65 and 2.58. Moderate food insecurity was more closely associated with mental health problems in 18-24 year olds than in 12-17 year olds. CONCLUSIONS Food insecurity severity was associated with poorer mental health among Canadian youth independent of household income and other socioeconomic differences.

However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of whole-body vibration on muscular performance. Tonic vibration reflex is the most commonly cited mechanism to explain the effects of whole-body vibration on muscular performance, although there is no conclusive evidence that tonic vibration reflex occurs. The bone myoregulation reflex is another neurological mechanism used to explain the effects of vibration on muscular performance. Bone myoregulation reflex is defined as a reflex mechanism in which osteocytes exposed to cyclic mechanical loading induce muscle activity. AIMS The aim of this study was to assess whether bone tissue affected vibration-induced reflex muscle activity and vibration-induced muscle strength gain. STUDY DESIGN A prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. METHODS Thirty-four participants were randomised into two groups. High-magnitude whole-body vibration was applied in the exercise group, whereas low-magnitude whole-body vibration exercises were applied in the control group throughout 20 sessions. Hip bone mineral density, isokinetic muscle strength, and plasma sclerostin levels were measured. The surface electromyography data were processed to obtain the Root Mean Squares, which were normalised by maximal voluntarily contraction. RESULTS In the exercise group, muscle strength increased in the right and left knee flexors (23.9%, p=0.004 and 27.5%, p<0.0001, respectively). However, no significant change was observed in the knee extensor muscle strength. There was no significant change in the knee muscle strength in the control group. The vibration-induced corrected Root Mean Squares of the semitendinosus muscle was decreased by 2.8 times (p=0.005) in the exercise group, whereas there was no change in the control group. Sclerostin index was decreased by 15.2% (p=0.031) in the exercise group and increased by 20.8% (p=0.028) in the control group. A change in the sclerostin index was an important predictor of a change in the vibration-induced normalised Root Mean Square of the semitendinosus muscle (R2=0.7, p=0.0001). Femoral neck bone mineral density was an important predictor of muscle strength gain (R2=0.26, p=0.035).

The second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is the group of students that had their face-to-face activities interrupted because of the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect of the COVID-19 confinement on students' performance. This effect is also significant in activities that did not change their format when performed after the confinement. We find that this effect is significant both in subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that did not change the student workload. Additionally, an analysis of students' learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study on a continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement changed students' learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving their efficiency.

Participants were 141 patients with hypertensive heart disease (mean age = 39  10.2 years) referred to the cardiac clinic of Madani Hospital in Khorramabad, Iran, and 141 healthy people selected from those referred to the hospital. The Persian version of the revised Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II (HPLP-II) was used to evaluate the health-promoting behaviors of participants. After collecting data, they were analyzed in SPSS v. 22 software using descriptive statistics and statistical tests including independent t-test and one-way ANOVA. RESULTS The overall HPLP-II score was 142.34  30.48 in patients and 150.52  37.07 in controls. The highest and lowest HPLP-II dimension scores in both groups were related to health responsibility and stress management dimensions.

IAQ can be affected, or may become under high risk by some of nearby gases, microbial contaminates or energy stressor that affect the HSE condition. This paper presents the main factors that been considered to provide practical solutions to achieve high IAQ and tackling viruses (such as COVID-19). Methods, Procedures, Process: IAQ refers to the air quality within and around the plants/buildings. IAQ can usually be affected, or may become under high risk by nearby gases, particulates, microbial contaminates or any mass that affect 100% HSE. Inadequate air quality in building will increase the risk and impact on transferring viruses to people (such as COVID and Flue) and equipment performance (such as equipment failure, components corrosion and short circuits on control board). Survey and data was recorded to evaluate air quality performance in atmosphere instead of assuming it. Accordingly, the impact of inadequate IAQ was studied and evaluated. Results, Observations & Conclusions: The international standard set a good IAQ in respect of gas concentration and human who works inside buildings in a way that less than 50% people should not detect any odor, 25% should not experience discomfort, 10% should not suffer from mucosal irritation and 5% should not experience annoyance. Study concluded that inadequate IAQ inside the building will affect people performance/health and installed equipment performance. In addition, improper HVAC system operation will be become breeding site for odor causing mold and bacteria, specifically on cooling coil. Hence, several technics were studied to improve IAQ, by installing Ultraviolet (UV) light to stop growing bacterial inside the HVAC system, installing chemical filter in air intakes to remove atmospheric dust, gases and bacteria by 100%, upgrading filtration efficiency to MERV-13 or highest achievable to capture at least 75 - 95% of airborne particles between 0.3 and 1.0 micron, increase outdoor air ventilation and temperature/humidity control. The performance of HVAC system and quality of air inside building were monitored by simulating IAQ based on ISO 16890, filters life cycle, energy consumption, and the results were found 100% satisfactory and provided solutions that are now successfully implemented in all new and some of the existing buildings. Novel/Additive Information: There are several buildings with similar issues and these approach/technics now being adopted in new constructed/existing buildings to protect human and asset integrity, which will support ADNOC Way by sustaining safe environment operation, lower health risk, reduce of equipment failure, reduce maintenance cost and 100% HSE. There are numbers of occupied buildings across the world were surrounded by aggressive gases/pollution with poor IAQ and above approaches it can be followed to realize larger benefits. ?

Nearly 30 years ago it was predicted that such triaxial dark matter halos should exhibit steady figure rotation or tumbling motions for durations of several gigayears. The angular frequency of figure rotation predicted by cosmological simulations is described by a log-normal distribution of pattern speed with a median value 0.15hkm/s/kpc (~ 0.15h rad/Gyr ~ 9h deg/Gyr) and a width of 0.83km/s/kpc. These pattern speeds are so small that they have generally been considered both unimportant and undetectable. In this work we show that even this extremely slow figure rotation can significantly alter the structure of extended stellar streams produced by the tidal disruption of satellites in the Milky Way halo. We simulate the behavior of a Sagittarius-like polar tidal stream in triaxial dark matter halos with different shapes, when the halos are rotated about the three principal axes. For pattern speeds typical of cosmological halos we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Sagittarius-like tidal stream would be altered to a degree that is detectable even with current observations. This discovery will potentially allow for a future measurement of figure rotation of the Milky Way's dark halo, and perhaps enabling the first evidence of this relatively unexplored prediction of LambdaCDM.","output":"Detecting the Figure Rotation of Dark Matter Halos with Tidal Streams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The quantitative information on the risk of infection in the COVID-19 pandemic is calculated currently exclusively on the base of new infections per day, which only contribute 6.60%1.34% to the 100% contagious acute infections and are, therefore, not proportional to the risk of infection. All methods and results presented here are shown for data in Germany, but can be transferred to any other region worldwide. Methods: More precise parameters as are used at present, are based on acute infections: stress index with information about the distance to the stress limit of the health system, the density of the sources of infection and the change in acute infections during the last 5 days are suggested here. Results: The comparison of the results of the current and the new assessment parameters shows that large daily fluctuations in new infections of up to 22% lead to unnecessary uncertainties. The new assessment parameters are correspondingly more precise. The 7-days incidence warning thresholds introduced by German law in November 2020 and April 2021 are defined on the base of new infections. As a result, the real infection risks can be incorrectly assessed due to the large fluctuations of the 7-days incidence values up to 23%, so that legal conflicts can arise if legally prescribed protective measures are objectively unjustified or introduced too late. Conclusion: By moving from new infections to acute infections as a base for calculation, infection risks can be described more precisely and even unjustified, expensive protective measures can be avoided. ? 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.","output":"How to reduce misinterpretation of quantitative infection risk by assessment parameters associated with the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading.

In this study, we develop a novel drug repositioning method (VDA-KLMF) to prioritize possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs integrating virus sequences, drug chemical structures, known Virus-Drug Associations, and Logistic Matrix Factorization with Kernel diffusion. First, Gaussian kernels of viruses and drugs are built based on known VDAs and nearest neighbors. Second, sequence similarity kernel of viruses and chemical structure similarity kernel of drugs are constructed based on biological features and an identity matrix. Third, Gaussian kernel and similarity kernel are diffused. Forth, a logistic matrix factorization model with kernel diffusion is proposed to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Finally, molecular dockings between the inferred antiviral drugs and the junction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 interface are implemented to investigate the binding abilities between them. VDA-KLMF is compared with two state-of-the-art VDA prediction models (VDA-KATZ and VDA-RWR) and three classical association prediction methods (NGRHMDA, LRLSHMDA, and NRLMF) based on 5-fold cross validations on viruses, drugs, and VDAs on three datasets.

METHODS: As part of a larger, chronic disease-focused, and ongoing longitudinal study designed to explore Ontario adults' health and wellness-related behaviors during the pandemic, participants completed an online survey that included demographic information and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI consists of 19 items, one of which is open-ended, designed to assess an individual's quantity, quality, and patterns of sleep on seven domains (ie, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month). Summative content analysis was used to analyze responses to the open-ended question regarding participants' sleep disturbances. RESULTS: This study included 2192 individuals, 85% of whom slept 6+ hours/night. The mean global PSQI score was 7.57, out of a possible 21 (SD = 4.09). The self-reported sleep disturbances of largest concern were: (1) general fear/anxiety/worry (n = 203); (2) children (n = 167); (3) mind wandering/overthinking (n = 118); (4) pain/injury (n = 78); (5) partner (n = 78); and (6) fear/anxiety/stress related to COVID-19 (n = 74).

However, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not clear. The study was aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed, and coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe infection and those with non-severe infection. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the D-dimer and severity of COVID-19 association were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis. RESULTS: In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function, and a significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 g/ml [interquartile range 0.9C4.6] vs 0.5 [0.3C1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases than the mild ones, on admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies (including the current study), patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.51C1.31, p < 0.001) g/ml compared to those with non-severe disease, and odds of severe infection was associated with D-dimer greater than 0.5 g/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16C15.44, p < 0.001) on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher level of D-dimer than those with non-severe disease, and D-dimer greater than 0.5 g/ml is associated with severe infection in patients with COVID-19.","output":"D-dimer level is associated with the severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent lifestyles changes have favored increased time in contact with screens and a parallel reduction in contact with natural environments. There is growing awareness that nature exposure and screen time are related to depression. So far, the roles of how these environmental lifestyles affect depressive symptoms and disorders have not been reviewed simultaneously. The aim of this review was to gather the literature regarding the role of nature exposure and screen time in depression. An emphasis was made on clinical samples of patients with well-defined depression and the different methodological approaches used in the field. A second goal was to suggest an agenda for clinical practice and research. Studies were included if they assessed depressive symptoms in patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression. An overview of the published literature was conducted using three scientific databases up to December 2021. Several interventions involving nature exposure have shown positive effects on depressive symptoms and mood-related measures. The most consistent finding suggests that walks in natural environments may decrease depressive symptoms in patients with clinical depression. Less researched interventions, such as psychotherapy delivered in a forest or access to natural environments via virtual reality, may also be effective. In contrast, fewer observational studies and no experimental research on screen time have been conducted in patients with clinical depression. Thus, recommendations for practice and research are also discussed. Scarce research, diverse interventions, and several methodological shortcomings prevent us from drawing conclusions in this area. More high-quality experimental research is needed to establish interventions with proven efficacy in clinical depression. At this stage, it is too early to formulate practice guidelines and advise the prescription of these lifestyles to individuals with depression. The present findings may serve as a basis to develop strategies based on nature exposure and screen time targeting clinical depression.","output":"Lifestyle Prescription for Depression with a Focus on Nature Exposure and Screen Time: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy is significantly important to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure. The Ministry of Education decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size. We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: The potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19). Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered. The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from February 16 to March 22. The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening. RESULTS: Assuming the transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and approximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23. After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6 for 14 days. CONCLUSION: The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education.

The characteristics of these patients are mostly unknown and there is reason to believe that there are large inter-hospital differences in thresholds for intensive care admissions from the ED. The purpose of this study was to give a nationwide overview of ED admissions directly to intensive care units. METHODS: We used the Swedish Intensive care Registry to identify all patients admitted to intensive care from the ED (January 1, 2013 until June 7, 2018). The primary outcome was discharge diagnosis after intensive care (primary ICU diagnosis code). ICU mortality and ICU admission due to only observation were analyzed as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 110,072 ICU admissions were included, representing 94,546 unique patients. Intoxication, trauma and neurological conditions were the most common causes for intensive care, but large variations according to age, sex and hospital type were seen. Intoxication was the most prevalent diagnosis in young adults (46.8% of admissions in 18C29 years old), whereas infectious diseases predominated in the elderly (17.0% in 65C79 years old). Overall, ICU mortality was 7.2%, but varied substantially with age, sex, type of hospital and medical condition. Cardiac conditions had the highest mortality rates, reaching 32.9%. The mortality was higher in academic centers compared to rural hospitals (9.3% vs 5.0%). It was more common to be admitted to ICU for only observation in rural hospitals than in academic centers (20.1% vs 7.8%). Being admitted to ICU only for observation was most common in patients with intoxication (30.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, intoxication was the most common cause for ICU admission from the ED. However, causes of ED ICU admissions differ substantially according to age, sex and hospital type. Being admitted to the ICU only for observation was most common in intoxicated patients.

Post-traumatic growth (PTG) has been defined as the subjective experience of positive psychological changes as a result of a traumatic event. PTG can involve changes in five psychological main dimensions: relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life. In the context of national emergencies, those PTG dimensions encompassing changes at the social level (e.g., relating to others) can play a role in coping strategies that involve a renewed sense of self and ones social identities, including national identities, and in turn, foster a stronger sense of trust and connection to others. AIM: To investigate how each of the five PTG dimensions mediates the association between the salience of national identity and interpersonal trust in a sample of Italian young adults. Trust in national and European institutions were expected to positively predict the strength of the Italian national identity which in turn was expected to be positively associated with interpersonal trust, and the PTG relating to others dimension to mediate this association. METHOD: This study involves the secondary analysis of data from a representative sample of 2,000 Italian young adults (age range 18C34 years). Participants completed a web survey during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in Italy with measures of trust in EU and national institutions, national identity, interpersonal trust, and the PTG Inventory. Structural equation modeling procedures were employed for key hypotheses tests. RESULTS: Trust in national institutions positively predicted national identity, which in turn was positively associated with interpersonal trust. Evidence of a full mediation effect of the PTG relating to others dimension on the association between national identity and interpersonal trust was found. DISCUSSION: Findings contribute to clarify the psychological responses to collective traumas. In the context of Italys COVID-19 crisis, trust in national institutions reinforced Italian national identity, which was in turn associated with greater interpersonal trust, but only when psychological responses to the trauma involved changes in how individuals perceived and related to others, and not merely a focus on the self.

The data were analyzed by means of panel mixed logit models. RESULTS: The prevention of deaths and financial problems of households had a very strong influence on the uptake of the app. Predicted app uptake rates ranged from 24% to 78% for the worst and best possible app for these societal effects. We found a strong positive relationship between peoples trust in government and peoples propensity to install the DCT app. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake levels we find are much more volatile than the uptake levels predicted in comparable studies that did not include societal effects in their discrete choice experiments. Our finding that the societal effects are a major factor in the uptake of the DCT app results in a chicken-or-the-egg causality dilemma. That is, the societal effects of the app are severely influenced by the uptake of the app, but the uptake of the app is severely influenced by its societal effects.","output":"Societal Effects Are a Major Factor for the Uptake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Digital Contact Tracing App in The Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess our determination to continue transplant activity in Colombia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, this study seeks to describe the risk of infection and mortality of transplanted patients vs those on the waiting list.

We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS. METHODS In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion. RESULTS A total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group.

Through qualitative coding of 100 randomly sampled group channels from the 4,300 channels dataset, we identified and reported 9 categories such as Project channels, IT-Support channels, and Event channels. We further defined a feature metric with 21 meta features (and their derived features) without looking at the message content to depict the group communication style for these group chat channels, with which we successfully trained a machine learning model that can automatically classify a given group channel into one of the 9 categories. In addition to the descriptive data analysis, we illustrated how these communication metrics can be used to analyze team performance. We cross-referenced 117 project teams and their team-based Slack channels and identified 57 teams that appeared in both datasets, then we built a regression model to reveal the relationship between these group communication styles and the project team performance. This work contributes an updated empirical understanding of human-human communication practices within the enterprise setting, and suggests design opportunities for the future of human-AI communication experience.","output":"Group Chat Ecology in Enterprise Instant Messaging: How Employees Collaborate Through Multi-User Chat Channels on Slack"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009 had a slower spread in Europe than expected. The human rhinovirus (HRV) has been suggested to have delayed the pandemic through viral interference. The importance of co-infections over time during the pandemic and in terms of severity of the disease needs to be assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory viruses and specifically the presence of co-infections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1) in hospitalized children during the H1N1 pandemic. A secondary aim was to investigate if co-infections were associated with severity of disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 502 children with influenza-like illness admitted to inpatient care at a pediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden during the 6 months spanning the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Respiratory samples were analyzed for a panel of 16 viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: One or more viruses were detected in 61.6% of the samples. Of these, 85.4% were single infections and 14.6% co-infections (2C4 viruses). The number of co-infections increased throughout the study period. H1N1 was found in 83 (16.5%) children and of these 12 (14.5%) were co-infections. HRV and H1N1 circulated to a large extent at the same time and 6.0% of the H1N1-positive children were also positive for HRV. There was no correlation between co-infections and severity of disease in children with H1N1. CONCLUSIONS: Viral co-infections were relatively common in H1N1 infected hospitalized children and need to be considered when estimating morbidity attributed to H1N1. Population-based longitudinal studies with repeated sampling are needed to improve the understanding of the importance of co-infections and viral interference.","output":"Respiratory Viruses in Hospitalized Children with Influenza-Like Illness during the H1n1 2009 Pandemic in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Vitamin D is a hormone regulating not only calcium and phosphate homeostasis but also, at the same time, exerting many other extraskeletal functions via genomic effects (gene transcription) and probably by non-genomic effects as well. Availability is ensured by dietary intake of its precursors and by de novo production via sunlight. Yet, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are very common across the globe and are connected to many pathophysiological states, for example, diabetes mellitus, allergies, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy complications, and recently have also been associated with worse COVID-19 clinical outcomes. SUMMARY In this review, we summarize current knowledge about vitamin D metabolism in general, its role in diabetes mellitus (mainly type 2) and diabetic complications (mainly diabetic kidney disease), and potential therapeutic perspectives including vitamin D signalling as a druggable target.

Methods: We conducted a systematic search of literature comparing the diagnostic accuracy of truly hand-held ultrasound devices compared to conventional high-end ultrasound devices, chest X-rays, thoracic CT (computer tomography), or physical examinations to diagnose peripheral lung lesions. ScienceDirect, PubMed, and PubMed Central bibliographic databases were searched within a time limit of 15 years. Results: The applied search strategy retrieved 439 studies after removing duplicates; 34 were selected for full-text review, and 15 articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. When comparing hand-held ultrasound devices to chest X-rays, negative predictive values were above 90%, while positive predictive values tended to be lower (from 35% to 75.8%). Hand-held ultrasound reached a correlation of 0.99 as associated with conventional ultrasound with a BlandCAltman bias close to zero. Conclusions: Being accessible, radiation-free, and comparatively easy to decontaminate, hand-held ultrasound devices could represent a reliable tool for evaluating peripheral lung diseases.

Patients' opinions on teledermatology have already been analyzed, but a current analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. The purpose of this survey was to investigate the satisfaction of patients who had received dermatological advice via telephone during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze their general opinion about eHealth as well as possible limitations for a broad implementation. Ninety-one patients managed in the dermatology department using telephone consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic were interviewed. An anonymous questionnaire, including the established quality of life questionnaire (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]), was used. It was found that men were more satisfied with telephone consultations than women (p = 0.029), educational level and age did not correlate with satisfaction (p = 0.186 and 388, respectively), and the longer the waiting time for a telephone consultation, the lower the satisfaction (p = 0.001). Grouped analysis of all participants showed that the majority (54.0% n = 38/71) were \\"very happy\\" with the telephone consultation. Higher disease burden (DLQI) was associated with lower satisfaction (p = 0.042). The main stated reasons for using telemedicine were shorter waiting times (51.6% n = 47/91) and no travel requirement (57.1% n = 47/91). Almost one-quarter (23.1% n = 21/89) of patients would use teledermatology in the future, 17.6% (n = 16/89) would not, and 57.1% (n = 51/89) would only use it in addition to a traditional consultation with personal contact. In conclusion, most patients in the study group still preferred traditional face-to-face medical consultations to telephone consultations, but also desired an add-on telemedical tool. Dermatological care using more modern telemedicine technologies than telephone conferencing is needed to better address patients' desires, especially in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Teledermatology in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hospitalised COVID-19 patients are frequently elderly subjects with co-morbidities receiving polypharmacy, all of which are known risk factors for d","output":"Drug-Drug Interactions and Prescription Appropriateness in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Analysis from a Reference Hospital in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gene therapy has held promises for treating specific genetic diseases. However, the key to clinical application depends on effective gene delivery. METHODS: Using a large animal model, we developed two pharmaceutical formulations for gene delivery in the pigs' vagina, which were made up of poly (?-amino ester) (PBAE)-plasmid polyplex nanoparticles (NPs) based two gel materials, modified montmorillonite (mMMT) and hectorite (HTT). FINDINGS: By conducting flow cytometry of the cervical cells, we found that PBAE-GFP-NPs-mMMT gel was more efficient than PBAE-GFP-NPs-HTT gel in delivering exogenous DNA intravaginally. Next, we designed specific CRISPR/SpCas9 sgRNAs targeting porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and evaluated the genome editing efficacy in vivo. We discovered that PERV copy number in vaginal epithelium could be significantly reduced by the local delivery of the PBAE-SpCas9/sgRNA NPs-mMMT gel. Comparable genome editing results were also obtained by high-fidelity version of SpCas9, SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9, in the mMMT gel. Further, we confirmed that the expression of topically delivered SpCas9 was limited to the vagina/cervix and did not diffuse to nearby organs, which was relatively safe with low toxicity. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggested that the PBAE-NPs mMMT vaginal gel is an effective preparation for local gene therapy, yielding insights into novel therapeutic approaches to sexually transmitted disease in the genital tract.

More than 14 thousand organic compounds from the commercially available Maybridge database were docked into the active site of main protease using the SOL docking program, and more than 100 ligands with the most negative SOL scores were selected for further processing. For all these top scored ligands, the enthalpy of protein-ligand binding was calculated using the PM7 semiempirical quantum-chemical method with the COSMO implicit solvent model. When calculating the enthalpy of protein-ligand binding, a best docked ligand pose was used as the initial conformation for local energy optimization by the PM7 method with varying the positions of all ligand atoms. In the optimized ligand pose, the energy of the protein-ligand complex was recalculated with the COSMO solvent for fixed positions of all atoms of the system. For further experimental testing, 18 ligands were selected with the following criteria: good SOL scores, the most negative binding enthalpies, favorable protein-ligand interactions inferred from visual inspection of the docking poses and chemical diversity of the ligands. The selected ligands are planned to be measured in vitro for their inhibition of the main protease SARS-CoV-2. In the case of experimental confirmation of their inhibitory activity, these compounds can be used to further optimize their chemical structure in order to obtain a lead compound C the basis for new direct-acting antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Application of Docking and Quantum Chemistry to the Search for Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to assess an innovative risk score for common dental procedures, based on the most recent contaminant SARS-CoV-2. After scoring the level of infection risk, safety procedures, advice and personal protective equipment (PPE) are recommended for the dental team in each dental practice. METHODS: The authors of this research analysed 42 common dental procedures on the basis of known transmission risks. In increasing order, many consider the parameters leading to different risk scores for the dental team and patients for each procedure to be: direct contact with saliva (score 1), direct contact with blood (score 2), production of low levels of spray/aerosol via air-water syringes (score 3), the production of high levels of spray/aerosol from rotating, ultrasound and piezoelectric tools (score 4); and the duration of the procedure, which may increase the risk of procedures producing droplets and aerosols. RESULTS: Using this innovative risk-scoring system, the authors classified the different dental procedures according to low, medium or high risk: low (1-3), medium (4-5), high (&#8805; 6). A safety protocol for each procedure was thereafter matched with the calculated risk level. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative risk-scoring system presented in this research permits the reclassification of dental procedures according to the infection risk level.

To increase the yield of recombinant GRFT, the RNA silencing defense mechanism of N. benthamiana was abolished by using three gene silencing suppressors. A transient expression system was used by transferring the GRFT gene, which encodes 122 amino acids, under the control of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter. The presence of correctly assembled GRFT in transgenic leaves was confirmed using immunoglobulin-specific sandwich ELISA. The data demonstrated that the use of three gene silencing suppressors allowed the highest accumulation of GRFT, with a yield of 400 g g(?1) fresh weight, and this amount was reduced to 287 g g(?1) after purification, representing a recovery of 71.75%. The analysis also showed that the ability of GRFT expressed in N. benthamiana to bind to glycoprotein 120 is close to that of the GRFT protein purified from E. coli. Whole-cell assays using purified GRFT showed that our purified GRFT was potently active against HIV.

Our primary goal was to determine whether fibrin glue adds to the tensile strength of conduit-assisted primary digital nerve repairs. Our secondary goal was to evaluate the impact of varying suture number and location on the tensile strength. METHODS Ninety cadaveric digital nerves were harvested and divided equally into the following repair groups: A (4/4), B (2/2), C (0/2), D (0/1), and E (0/0) with the first number referring to the number of sutures at the coaptation and the second number referring to the number of sutures at each proximal and distal end of the nerve-conduit junction. When fibrin glue was added, the group was labeled prime. The nerve specimens were transected and then repaired with 8-0 nylon suture and conduit. The tensile strength of the repairs was tested, and maximum failure load was determined. The results were analyzed with a 2-way analysis of variance. The Tukey post hoc test compared repair groups if the 2-way analysis of variance showed significance. RESULTS Both suture group and glue presence significantly affected the maximum failure load. Increasing the number of sutures increased the maximum failure load, and the presence of fibrin glue also increased the failure load. CONCLUSIONS Fibrin glue was found to increase the strength of conduit-assisted primary digital nerve repairs. Furthermore, the number of sutures correlated to the strength of the repair.

A subunit of the sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential M4 (Sur1-TRPM4) channel has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemia-evoked cerebral edema. In this study, we examined whether glibenclamide (GBC), a Sur1-TRPM4 channel inhibitor, attenuates cerebral edema following CA/CPR and further examined the efficacy of GBC combined with therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS Isoflurane-anesthetized adult male wild-type C57Bl/6 mice subjected to 7-min CA/CPR were randomized into five groups: sham operation, control with normothermia, GBC with normothermia, control with hypothermia, and GBC with hypothermia. The primary outcome was to evaluate regional brain water content; the secondary outcome was to measure blood glucose level, Sur1-TRPM4 expression, and pro-inflammatory factor expression. RESULTS Compared with normothermia, GBC treatment or hypothermia significantly attenuated brain water content in mice subjected to CA/CPR. GBC combined with hypothermia had no additional effects on attenuating cerebral edema. Pro-inflammatory factor messenger RNA expression (TNF- and IL-6), NFʦ activation, and SUR1-TRPM4 levels were upregulated after CA/CPR. Compared with normothermia, hypothermia, but not GBC, partly suppressed these factors' expression. CONCLUSIONS GBC attenuated cerebral edema following CA/CPR by blocking Sur1-TRPM4 channels upregulated by CA insult. The effect of GBC was comparable with that of therapeutic hypothermia alone.

Because voluntarily unvaccinated people are not fulfilling their societal obligations during a pandemic, the ethical principle of justice demands that they reap the egalitarian consequences. These consequences could include lower priority for care, an increasing number of employer and government mandates, and restrictions to entering many entertainment venues. Discussion: Voluntarily unvaccinated individuals increase the chance that the COVID-19 virus will mutate and spread, endangering the entire population, but especially those who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons, children for whom vaccines have yet to be approved, and older adult and immunocompromised people for whom the vaccine is less effective. When voluntarily unvaccinated individuals seek medical treatment for COVID-19 (94% of patients with COVID-19 in U.S. intensive care units), they use resources needed for those with nonCCOVID-related illnesses. Conclusions: A method to balance resource allocation between those patients who refuse vaccination and patients who need the same health care resources is necessary. An ethical solution is to give those who are voluntarily unvaccinated a lower priority for admission and for the use of other health care resources. Current in-hospital triage models can easily be modified to accomplish this.

In multimedia analysis, domain adaptation studies the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer from a label rich source domain to a label scarce target domain, thus potentially alleviates the annotation requirement for deep learning models. However, we find that contemporary domain adaptation methods for cross-domain image understanding perform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation (WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario where source data can be noisy. Prior methods on WSDA remove noisy source data and align the marginal distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained semantic structure in the embedding space, which have the problem of class misalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near features of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we adopt the cluster assumption and learn cluster discriminatively with class prototypes in the embedding space. We propose to leverage the location information of the data points in the embedding space and model the location information with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We then design a network which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a sub-module for unsupervised noise removal and propose a novel cluster-level adversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target data with the less noisy class prototypes for mapping the semantic structure across domains. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on both general images and medical images from COVID-19 and e-commerce datasets.

METHODS: We summarized the epidemic prevention and control policies in Japan, Italy, China, and Singapore, and analyzed the policy effects of these four countries by using the data published by Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. RESULTS: As of May 27, 2020, the growing trend of new cases in Japan, Italy, China and Singapore has stabilized. However, the cumulative number of confirmed cases (231139) and case-fatality rate (14.3%) in Italy far exceeded those in the other three countries, and the effect of epidemic control was inferior. Singapore began to experience a domestic resurgence after April 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases reaching 32,876, but the case-fatality rate remained extremely low (0.1%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in China (84547) was almost stagnant, and the case-fatality rate was low (5.5%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in Japan (16661) increased slowly, and the case-fatality rate (4.8%) was slightly lower than that in China. CONCLUSION: This study divided the epidemic prevention and control policies of the four countries into two categories: the blocking measures adopted by China and Singapore, and the mitigation measures adopted by Japan and Italy. According to the Epidemic control results of these four countries, we can conclude that the blocking measures were generally effective. As the core strategy of blocking measures, admitting mild patients into hospital and cases tracing helped curb the spread of the outbreak in Singapore and China. Countries should choose appropriate response strategies on the premise of considering their own situation, increase investment in health resources to ensure global health equity, and eventually control the spread of infectious diseases in the world effectively.","output":"Policy disparities in fighting COVID-19 among Japan, Italy, Singapore and China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brian Schrauger, in The Jerusalem Post, discussed Jews being \\"slaughtered,\\" \\"murdered,\\" \\"bludgeoned to death, herded into houses to be burned alive en masse, stripped naked and marched to a collective massacre,\\" before asking \\"Could COVID-19 ignite an outbreak of antisemitism?\\"6 Dan Freedman, in Moment Magazine, sought to explain \\"why Jews were blamed for the Black Death\\";doing so, he too repeated the language of persecution by highlighting \\"episodes of violence,\\" \\"slaughter,\\" \\"burning,\\" \\"torture,\\" and more 7 Although Freedman did not answer the question asked, the answer seems implicit in the vocabulary he employed [ ]it may do the opposite;it may encourage hatred and violence as evidenced by the fact that some of the perpetrators of anti-Jewish attacks today have been known to have Googled questions like, for example, \\"Why Did Hitler Hate Jews?\\"10 The current popular writing about American Jews in the era of the pandemic (and Trump) feels eerily like Leidensgeschichte (the history of suffering), but without the Gelehrtengeschichte (the history of learning) that was equally a hallmark of much nineteenth-century Jewish historiography In his piece, Roth challenged the idea that all violence from which Jews suffered was automatically antisemitic 17 Episodes of \\"Jewish martyrdom,\\" Roth argued, were very often episodes of \\"general history,\\" with Jews caught in bigger events 18 A few years later, Roth published his popular A Short History of the Jewish People, in which he declared his desire \\"to break with\\" earlier Jewish historiography that tended to overstress \\"the traditional tale of woe [ ]both authors explicitly or implicitly used their scholarship to combat antisemitism, in part by expanding the existing understanding of what Jewish life and experience had been like in the past 21 Both Baron and Roth, in different ways, strove","output":"The Pandemic, Antisemitism, and the Lachrymose Conception of Jewish History"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic, the deterioration of the epidemic situation in Russia, the lockdown and the growing fear in society caused by panic rumors and misinformation spread on social networks and the media pose urgent organizational and medical tasks for our psychiatric service.

Recently, we have provided evidence of viscerally-mediated sweating alterations in humans during exercise brought about by warm and cool fluid ingestion. In the present study, we characterize the modification of shivering and whole-body thermal sensation during cold stress following the administration of a graded thermal stimuli delivered to the stomach via fluid ingestion at 52, 37, 22 and 7C. Despite no differences in core and skin temperature, fluid ingestion at 52C rapidly decreased shivering and sensations of cold compared to 37C, whereas fluid ingestion at 22 and 7C led to equivalent increases in these responses. Warm and cold fluid ingestion independently modifies cold defence thermoeffector responses, supporting the presence of visceral thermoreceptors in humans. However, the cold-defence thermoeffector response patterns differed from previously identified hot-defence thermoeffectors. ABSTRACT Sudomotor activity is modified by both warm and cold fluid ingestion during heat stress, independently of differences in core and skin temperatures, suggesting independent viscerally-mediated modification of thermoeffectors. The present study aimed to determine whether visceral thermoreceptors modify shivering responses to cold stress. Ten males (mean  SD: age 27  5 years; height 1.73  0.06 m, weight 78.4  10.7 kg) underwent whole-body cooling via a water perfusion suit at 5C, on four occasions, to induce a steady-state shivering response, at which point two aliquots of 1.5 ml kg-1 (SML) and 3.0 ml kg-1 (LRG), separated by 20 min, of water at 7, 22, 37 or 52C were ingested. Rectal, mean skin and mean body temperature (Tb ), electromyographic activity (EMG), metabolic rate (M) and whole-body thermal sensation on a visual analogue scale (WBTS) ranging from 0 mm (very cold) to 200 mm (very hot) were all measured throughout. Tb was not different between all fluid temperatures following SML fluid ingestion (7C: 35.7  0.5C; 22C: 35.6  0.5C; 37C: 35.5  0.4C; 52C: 35.5  0.4C; P = 0.27) or LRG fluid ingestion (7C: 35.3  0.6C; 22C: 35.3  0.5C; 37C: 35.2  0.5C; 52C: 35.3  0.5C; P = 0.99). With SML fluid ingestion, greater metabolic rates and cooler thermal sensations were observed with ingestion at 7C (M: 179  55 W, WBTS: 29  21 mm) compared to 52C (M: 164  34 W, WBTS: 51  28 mm; all P < 0.05). With LRG ingestion, compared to shivering and thermal sensations with ingestion at 37C (M: 215  47 W, EMG: 3.9  2.5% MVC, WBTS: 33  2 mm), values were different (all P < 0.05) following ingestion at 7C (M: 269  77 W, EMG: 5.5  0.9% MVC, WBTS: 14  12 mm), 22C (M: 270  86 W, EMG: 5.6  1.0% MVC, WBTS: 18  19 mm) and 52C (M: 179  34 W, EMG: 3.3  2.1% MVC, WBTS: 53  28 mm). In conclusion, fluid ingestion at 52C decreased shivering and the sensation of coolness, whereas fluid ingestion at 22 and 7C increased shivering and sensations of coolness to similar levels, independently of core and skin temperature.","output":"Evidence of viscerally-mediated cold-defence thermoeffector responses in man."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced drastic changes to daily life, from the implementation of stay-at-home orders to mandating facial coverings and limiting in-person gatherings. While the relaxation of these control measures has varied geographically, it is widely agreed that contact tracing efforts will play a major role in the successful reopening of businesses and schools. As the volume of positive cases has increased in the United States, it has become clear that there is room for digital health interventions to assist in contact tracing. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile-friendly app designed to supplement manual COVID-19 contact tracing efforts on a university campus. Here, we present the results of a development and validation study centered around the use of the MyCOVIDKey app on the Vanderbilt University campus during the summer of 2020. METHODS: We performed a 6-week pilot study in the Stevenson Center Science and Engineering Complex on Vanderbilt University's campus in Nashville, TN. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and staff >18 years who worked in Stevenson Center and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to register for a MyCOVIDKey account. All users were encouraged to complete regular self-assessments of COVID-19 risk and to key in to sites by scanning a location-specific barcode. RESULTS: Between June 17, 2020, and July 29, 2020, 45 unique participants created MyCOVIDKey accounts. These users performed 227 self-assessments and 1410 key-ins. Self-assessments were performed by 89% (n=40) of users, 71% (n=32) of users keyed in, and 48 unique locations (of 71 possible locations) were visited. Overall, 89% (202/227) of assessments were determined to be low risk (ie, asymptomatic with no known exposures), and these assessments yielded a CLEAR status. The remaining self-assessments received a status of NOT CLEAR, indicating either risk of exposure or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (7.5% [n=17] and 3.5% [n=8] of self-assessments indicated moderate and high risk, respectively). These 25 instances came from 8 unique users, and in 19 of these instances, the at-risk user keyed in to a location on campus. CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing tools may be useful in assisting organizations to identify persons at risk of COVID-19 through contact tracing, or in locating places that may need to be cleaned or disinfected after being visited by an index case. Incentives to continue the use of such tools can improve uptake, and their continued usage increases utility to both organizational and public health efforts. Parameters of digital tools, including MyCOVIDKey, should ideally be optimized to supplement existing contact tracing efforts. These tools represent a critical addition to manual contact tracing efforts during reopening and sustained regular activity.","output":"Understanding On-Campus Interactions With a Semiautomated, Barcode-Based Platform to Augment COVID-19 Contact Tracing: App Development and Usage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis E is an acute human liver disease in healthy individuals which may eventually become chronic.

We analysed the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in previously infected (recovered) or uninfected (naive) individuals that received mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2. While previously infected individuals sustained higher antibody titres than uninfected individuals post-vaccination, the latter reached comparable levels of neutralization responses to the ancestral strain after the second vaccine dose. T cell activation markers measured upon spike or nucleocapsid peptide in vitro stimulation showed a progressive increase after vaccination. Comprehensive analysis of plasma neutralization using 16 authentic isolates of distinct locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed a range of reduction in the neutralization capacity associated with specific mutations in the spike gene: lineages with E484K and N501Y/T (e.g., B.1.351 and P.1) had the greatest reduction, followed by lineages with L452R (e.g., B.1.617.2). While both groups retained neutralization capacity against all variants, plasma from previously infected vaccinated individuals displayed overall better neutralization capacity when compared to plasma from uninfected individuals that also received two vaccine doses, pointing to vaccine boosters as a relevant future strategy to alleviate the impact of emerging variants on antibody neutralizing activity.","output":"Impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants on mRNA vaccine-induced immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the first reactions of many distinguished commentators to the impact that the CoViD-19 pandemic had on people's religious life globally.

In this study, ordinary least square (global) and geographically weighted regression (local) methods are employed to explore the geographical relationships between COVID-19 deaths and different driving factors. It is also investigated whether geographical heterogeneity exists in the relationships. More specifically, in this paper, the geographical pattern of COVID-19 deaths and its relationships with different potential driving factors in India are investigated and analysed. Here, better knowledge and insights into geographical targeting of intervention against the COVID-19 pandemic can be generated by investigating the heterogeneity of spatial relationships. The results show that the local method (geographically weighted regression) generates better performance (R2 = 0:973) with smaller Akaike Information Criterion (AICc = -77:93) as compared to the global method (ordinary least square). The GWR method also comes up with lower spatial autocorrelation (Morans I = -0.0436 and p < 0:01) in the residuals.

We describe a case of GD diagnosed based on newly elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor autoantibody (TRAb) levels after SAT. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old Chinese man presented with right anterior neck pain, swelling, sore throat, cough, and fever. He had a diffuse tender goiter but no proptosis, lid lag, or stare. His TSH level was 0.03 mIU/mL (normal range [NR] 0.45-5.33 mIU/mL), serum free thyroxine (FT4) level was 2.40 ng/dL (NR 0.61-1.44 ng/dL), total triiodothyronine (TT3) level was 113 ng/dL (NR 87-178 ng/dL), TSI level was <0.10 IU/L (NR < 0.10 IU/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 21 mm/h (NR < 15 mm/h). After 7 weeks of prednisone, the symptoms resolved, FT4 level was 0.95 ng/dL, and TT3 level was 91 ng/dL. At 11 weeks after SAT onset, the TSH level was <0.01 mIU/mL, TT3 level was 257 ng/dL, FT4 level was 3.03 ng/dL, TSI level was 1.94 IU/L, then 3.42 IU/L 2 weeks later, TRAb level was 8.72 IU/L (NR < 2 IU/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 4 mm/h. After 1 month of methimazole, the FT4 level was 1.32 ng/dL and TT3 level was 110 ng/dL. Genetic testing revealed human leukocyte antigen-B35 and DRB1?15:01 positivity. DISCUSSION: GD after SAT is thought to be due to the activation of thyroid autoimmunity induced by SAT in genetically susceptible individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the induction of thyroid autoimmunity after SAT, resulting in GD, supporting TSI and/or TRAb testing if hyperthyroidism recurs. The presence of HLA alleles associated with SAT and GD suggests a genetic contribution to the development of thyroid autoimmunity.","output":"Graves Disease Following Subacute Thyroiditis in a Chinese Man"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of primary and revision arthroplasties of the hip and knee joint METHODS: This study compared the data on knee and hip arthroplasty procedures from 2 hospitals (primary and revision) conducted in two periods: the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland (from 4 March 2020 to 15 October 2020) and the corresponding period prior to the pandemic (from 4 March 2019 to 15 October 2019) We compared the epidemiological data, demographic data, and hospital stay duration data from these two periods RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated that the total number of hip arthroplasties conducted in 2020 decreased by 26% in comparison with 2019 In the case of knee arthroplasties, the total number of procedures in the evaluated period in 2020 decreased by 44% Our study also showed that the mean time of hospital stay for orthopedic patients following hip or knee arthroplasty was 22 87% shorter The female-to-male patient ratio decreased between the analyzed periods, and this was 22 96% lower during the pandemic CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic in these two hospitals in Poland led to reduced numbers of hip and knee replacement procedures, shorter hospital stays, and a decreased female-to-male patient ratio The mean age of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty remained unchanged during the national lockdown with respect to the pre-pandemic figure","output":"The Epidemiology of Hip and Knee Primary and Revision Arthroplasties during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preventative measures taken worldwide to decrease the transmission of COVID-19 have had a tremendous impact on youth.

Additionally, understanding the potential mechanisms of neurologic injury may guide efforts to better detect and ameliorate these complications. In this review, we synthesize a range of clinical observations and initial case series describing potential neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 and place these observations in the context of coronavirus neuro-pathophysiology as it may relate to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reported nervous system manifestations range from anosmia and ageusia, to cerebral hemorrhage and infarction. While the volume of COVID-19-related case studies continues to grow, previous work examining related viruses suggests potential mechanisms through which the novel coronavirus may impact the CNS and result in neurological complications. Namely, animal studies examining the SARS-CoV have implicated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 receptor as a mediator of coronavirus-related neuronal damage and have shown that SARS-CoV can infect cerebrovascular endothelium and brain parenchyma, the latter predominantly in the medial temporal lobe, resulting in apoptosis and necrosis. Human postmortem brain studies indicate that human coronavirus variants and SARS-CoV can infect neurons and glia, implying SARS-CoV-2 may have similar neurovirulence. Additionally, studies have demonstrated an increase in cytokine serum levels as a result of SARS-CoV infection, consistent with the notion that cytokine overproduction and toxicity may be a relevant potential mechanism of neurologic injury, paralleling a known pathway of pulmonary injury. We also discuss evidence that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be a vasculotropic and neurotropic virus. Early reports suggest COVID-19 may be associated with severe neurologic complications, and several plausible mechanisms exist to account for these observations.

A growing body of evidence indicates that workplace programmes based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are effective for improving employees general psychological health. However, there is a paucity of research examining the specific psychological and/or behavioural processes through which workplace ACT programmes transmit their beneficial effects. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the outcomes and putative processes of change in a 4-session ACT training programme designed to reduce psychological distress among healthcare staff (n = 98). Ninety-eight employees of a healthcare organisation were randomly allocated to the ACT intervention or to a waiting list control group. Study measures were administered on four occasions (baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up) over a three-month evaluation period. Results showed that the ACT intervention led to a significant decrease in symptoms of psychological distress and a less pronounced reduction in burnout. These effects were mediated primarily via an improvement in mindfulness skills and values-based behaviour and moderated by participants initial levels of distress. At four-week post-intervention, 48% of participants who received the ACT intervention showed reliable improvements in psychological distress, with just under half of the aforementioned improvements (46.15%) meeting criteria for clinically significant change. The results advance ACT as an effective stress management intervention for healthcare staff. The findings should be confirmed in a large scale randomised controlled trial with longer follow-up and cost-effectiveness analyses.","output":"A workplace Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for improving healthcare staff psychological distress: A randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels are often elevated in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Their prognostic role after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains to be elucidated. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single center study of patients with non-traumatic SAH admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Erasme Hospital (Brussels, Belgium) from 2006 to 2019. Exclusion criteria were previous history of liver cirrhosis or malignancies and early death (i.e. within 24a?h from ICU admission). Baseline information, clinical data, radiologic data were collected, the occurrence of DCI as well as serum ALP levels during the first 12 days of ICU stay. Unfavorable neurological outcome (UO) at 3 months was defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale of 1-3. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty patients were included; ALP levels increased from baseline after day 6 from admission, in particular among patients with an initial poor clinical status. There was no difference in the ALP levels between patients with or without DCI over time. Patients with UO had higher ALP levels over time than others; however, in the multivariable analysis, nor ALP levels on admission or the highest ALP value during the ICU stay were independently associated with UO. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that ALP levels had no prognostic role in SAH patients.

As consortia can involve supply chain organizations, together with regulatory bodies and universities, participation is predicated by partners with markedly different outcome goals and risk dispositions. Some are willing to go all-in for a long-term vision involving novel breakthroughs;others are focused on specific incremental gains. We draw from an eight-year dataset involving 98 entities, collaborating across five UK-based pharmaceutical sector consortia. We present case evidence from 14 projects where consortia are experimenting with a wide variety of digital initiatives, ranging from incremental to potentially game-changing (novel) innovations. A central issue here is the availability of alternative digital innovation pathways. So which pathway to take? We follow an abductive approach to examine the nature of these pathways and how consortia are organizing efforts for specific innovation performance and allied risk outcomes. We find that sequential pathways are characterized by tactical gains. Here, attractive cases determine the pathway choice, resulting in follow-on incremental activities. In contrast, simultaneous pathways require hypotheses development where immediate ROIs are not always apparent. Here, the consortium effect de-risks risk conversations, enabling partners to get internal buy-in. Navigating such pathways within consortia has theory and practice implications. For example, a surprising finding is the going all-in approach, often seen as loaded with risk, can be appropriate from a risk mitigation perspective for novel projects. As is the case with emerging consortia-led Covid-19 vaccines, where steps that are normally taken sequentially are being carried out simultaneously.","output":"Spreading Bets or Going All-In?

Considering the importance of these previous events and due to the lack of information on the coronavirus present in the bat population in Argentina, we decided to monitor their circulation in two provinces in which there is continuous contact of these animals with others (domestic and wild) and human beings. Methods & Materials Samples of pharyngeal swabs and fecal matter were collected from different species of bats from the provinces of Jujuy (northern Argentina) and La Pampa (central Argentina), and from other wild and domestic animals that cohabitated with bats. The samples were stored in RNA Shield? 1X until processing. The viral RNA extraction was performed with Quick-RNA Viral Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH?) and the cDNA with EasyScript First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (TRANS?). Each sample was analyzed individually by nested PCR directed to a conserved 440 bp fragment located within the viral polymerase gene (Chu et al., 2006). Results Preliminary results from 43 stool samples and 53 pharyngeal swabs from insectivorous and hematophagous bats demonstrated the presence of alfacoronavirus sequences in four fecal samples (3 insectivorous bats and 1 hematophagous bat) and in one pharyngeal swab sample from an insectivorous bat. Through comparison with GenBank sequences, the closest relatives identified were alphacoronaviruses of the species Myotis riparius/ nigricans, Molossus rufus and Desmodus rotundus. Interestingly, we found alphacoronavirus sequences of one species present in another bat species since the colonies were in close contact. Samples from other animal species are in the process of being analyzed. Conclusion The identification of new coronaviruses that naturally inhabit bat populations and in animal species that share the biological niche, contributes to the knowledge of viral evolution and the biology behind the jump between animal species.","output":"Circulation of coronavirus in bats from northern and central Argentina: preliminary study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While mRNA vaccines are proving highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to determine how booster doses and prior infection influence the immune defense they elicit, and whether they protect against variants. Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-na?ve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-na?ve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity but not quality of the T cell response, while in convalescents the second dose helped neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-na?ve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-na?ve counterparts.","output":"mRNA vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells recognize B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study explores the difference in COVID-19 corpse handling protocol rejection before and after the innovation in rapid molecular test (RMT) postmortem examination and providing negative pressure mortuary rooms.

Each of the corpses immediate family was explained the procedure for handling the body based on the fatwa of the religious institution and the hospitals standard operating system. The acceptance or rejection of the protocol, general characteristics of the corpse, and the reasons for refusal are documented. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, there were 16 probable COVID-19 corpses and 3 confirmed COVID-19 corpses. Rejection of the COVID-19 corpse protocol occurred six times. The main reason for rejection is that the death might not necessarily be caused by COVID-19, the bodys handling in the hospital is not following religious law, and the negative stigma of COVID-19. From June to August 2020, there were 42 probable COVID-19 corpses and 49 confirmed COVID-19 corpses. Rejection of the COVID-19 corpse protocol occurred eight times. The most rejection reason is that the deceased families do not believe the deceased died because of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in the COVID-19 corpse protocol rejection has occurred after applying RMT and providing a negative pressure mortuary room.

However, more evidence is needed to understand the population-level impact of the US vaccination rollout in the face of the changing landscape of COVID-19 pandemic in the US, including variants with higher transmissibility and immune escape. Objective: To quantify the population-level impact of the US vaccination campaign in averting cases, hospitalizations and deaths from December 12, 2020 to June 28, 2021. Design: Age-stratified agent-based model which included transmission dynamics of the Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants in addition to the original Wuhan-1 variant. Setting: Our model was calibrated to COVID-19 outbreak and vaccine rollout in the US. Model predictions were made at the country level. Participants: Simulated age-stratified population representing US demographics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cases, hospitalizations and deaths averted by vaccination against COVID-19 in the US, compared to the counterfactuals of no vaccination and vaccination administered at half the actual pace. Results: The swift vaccine rollout in the US curbed a potential resurgence of cases in April 2021, which would have been otherwise fuelled by the Alpha variant. Compared to the scenario without vaccines, we estimated that the actual vaccination program averted more than 26 million cases, 1.2 million hospitalizations and saved 279,000 lives. A vaccination campaign with half the actual rollout rate would have led to an additional 460,000 hospitalizations and 121,000 deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US has had an extraordinary impact on reducing disease burden despite the emergence of highly transmissible variants.

However, a requirement of physical distancing to date compromises their achievement. While mostly associated to COVID-19, physical distancing is not only required in a pandemic scenario, but also advised for several clinical conditions (e.g. immunocompromised individuals) or forced for specific social contexts (e.g. people living in remote areas worldwide). All these contexts advocate for the implementation of alternative healthcare models. The objective of this perspective is to highlight the benefits of remote administration of rehabilitative treatment, namely telerehabilitation, in counteracting physical distancing barriers in neurorehabilitation. Sustaining boosters of treatment outcome, such as compliance, sustainability, as well as motivation, telerehabilitation may adapt to multiple neurological conditions, with the further advantage of a high potential for individualization to patients or pathologys specificities. The effectiveness of telerehabilitation can be potentiated by several technologies available to date: virtual reality can recreate realistic environments in which patients may bodily operate, wearable sensors allow to quantitatively monitor the patients performance, and signal processing may contribute to the prediction of long-term dynamics of patient recovery. Telerehabilitation might spark its advantages far beyond the mere limitation of physical distancing effects, mitigating criticalities of daily neurorehabilitative practice, and thus paving the way to the envision of mixed models of care, where hospital-based procedures are complementarily integrated with telerehabilitative ones.

But the role of immune dysregulation of malignant patients on poor prognosis of COVID-19 has remained insufficiently investigated. Here we conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 2,052 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Cancer, n = 93; Non-cancer, n = 1,959), and compared the immunological characteristics of both cohorts. We used stratification analysis, multivariate regressions, and propensity-score matching to evaluate the effect of immunological indices. In result, COVID-19 patients with cancer had ongoing and significantly elevated inflammatory factors and cytokines (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8), as well as decreased immune cells (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells, NK cells, Th and Ts cells) than those without cancer. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cancer cohort (24.7%) than non-cancer cohort (10.8%). By stratification analysis, COVID-19 patients with immune dysregulation had poorer prognosis than those with the relatively normal immune system both in cancer and non-cancer cohort. By logistic regression, Cox regression, and propensity-score matching, we found that prior to adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was associated with an increased mortality risk of COVID-19 (p < .05); after adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was no longer an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19 (p > .30).

Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine associations between the use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. METHODS: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants included 1188 adults (mean age 37.4 years, SD 15.1; 980/1188, 82.5% female) and 963 adolescents (mean age 16.2 years, SD 1.2; 685/963, 71.1% female). Participants reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (ie, users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (ie, nonusers). RESULTS: Digital platforms include streaming services for exercise (eg, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook); subscriber fitness programs, via an app or online (eg, Centr and MyFitnessPal); facilitated online live or recorded classes, via platforms such as Zoom (eg, dance, sport training, and fitness class); sport- or activity-specific apps designed by sporting organizations for participants to keep up their skills (eg, TeamBuildr); active electronic games (eg, Xbox Kinect); and/or online or digital training or racing platforms (eg, Zwift, FullGaz, and Rouvy). Overall, 39.5% (469/1188) of adults and 26.5% (255/963) of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, MVPA (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), MSE (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to nonusers.

Generally, these documents reflect humanitarian perspectives and doctrine at the time of their drafting, and primarily address foreign military involvement in natural and humanitarian disasters. However, in the past decade, there have been significant changes in the geopolitical environment and global health landscapes. Foreign militaries have been increasingly deployed to public health emergencies with responses grounded in public health (rather than humanitarian) approaches, while public health issues are of increasing importance in other deployments. This paper reviews key international policy documents that regulate, guide or otherwise inform CMR in the context of recent events involving international CMR during public health emergency responses, grounded in analysis of a March 2017 Chatham House roundtable event on the subject. Major thematic concerns regarding the application of existing CMR guiding documents to public health emergencies became evident. These include a lack of consideration of public health factors as distinct from a humanitarian approach; the assertion of state sovereignty vis--vis the deployment of national militaries; the emergence of new armed, military and security groups and a lack of consensus surrounding the 'principle of last resort'. These criticisms and gaps-in particular, a consideration for public health contexts and approaches therein-should form the basis of future CMR drafting or revision processes to ensure effective, safe, and sustainable CMR during public health emergency response.","output":"Civil-military relations: a review of major guidelines and their relevance during public health emergencies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Approximately 75% of Chinese hypertensive patients have elevated homocysteine (Hcy).

Methods: This study was based on a community cohort recruited from 2016 to 2018 in the rural China. To maximize cost efficiency, we used a nested case-control design, including 3,533 first stroke cases and 3,533 controls matched for age 1 years, sex, and village. Individual associations of tHcy and traditional risk factors with the first stroke were examined, and their population-attributable risks (PARs) were estimated. Results: There was a significant dose-response association between first stroke and total Hcy (tHcy) levels, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.26) for tHcy 10-15 mol/L and 1.44 (1.22, 1.69) for tHcy  15 mol/L, all compared to tHcy < 10 mol/L. A similar trend was found for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. tHcy and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were independently and additively associated with the risk of first stroke (tHcy: 1.06 [1.02, 1.1]; SBP: 1.13 [1.1, 1.16]; P-interaction, 0.889). Among the ten main risk factors examined, the top two contributors to the first stroke were SBP and tHcy, with PARs of 25.73 and 11.24%, respectively. Conclusions: Elevated tHcy is the second most important contributor and acts additively with SBP to increase the risk of the first stroke. This finding underscores the importance of screening and treating elevated tHcy along with traditional risk factors to further reduce the burden of the first stroke in the high-risk populations.","output":"The Relative Contribution of Plasma Homocysteine Levels vs. Traditional Risk Factors to the First Stroke: A Nested Case-Control Study in Rural China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents AI-controlled robotic masks intended to empower women and allow them to communicate with one another.

This variant was estimated to be responsible for more than 96 per cent of cases reported between January and June 2021, being associated with increased transmissibility and disease severity, a reduction in neutralization antibodies and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, and diagnostic detection failure. Here we show that, following several importations predominantly from the USA, the Delta variant rapidly replaced Gamma after July 2021. However, in contrast to what was seen in other countries, the rapid spread of Delta did not lead to a large increase in the number of cases and deaths reported in Brazil. We suggest that this was likely due to the relatively successful early vaccination campaign coupled with natural immunity acquired following prior infection with Gamma. Our data reinforce reports of the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant and, considering the increasing concern due to the recently identified Omicron variant, argues for the necessity to strengthen genomic monitoring on a national level to quickly detect the emergence and spread of other VOCs that might threaten global health.","output":"Replacement of the Gamma by the Delta variant in Brazil: Impact of lineage displacement on the ongoing pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article, written at the time it was taking place, discusses the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on music education in schools, focusing on the UK.

This research explored a unique partnership between a Retired Senior and Volunteer Program (RSVP) and a school of nursing to administer a telehealth virtual simulation training for nurse practitioner students. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with nursing simulation coordinators and volunteers after the telehealth simulation exercise. The purpose of this research was to identify principles of successful virtual volunteer engagement for telehealth simulations. This initial pilot study encompassed debriefing interviews with volunteers (N = 3) and interviews with simulation coordinators (N = 2). Three major themes emerged within the response coding: 1) the benefits of virtual simulation volunteering, 2) technology as a facilitating factor and challenge, and 3) unique volunteer management considerations. Both volunteers and coordinators noted that volunteers derived positive emotional benefits and new insights from their participation. Coordinators discussed the authenticity factor that older adults brought to the simulation experience as a benefit to engaging older adult volunteers. Technology sub-themes included accessibility considerations, experience with the online format, and other logistical considerations in conducting telehealth simulation. Volunteer management sub-themes encompassed volunteer skills and motivations, the perceived successful aspects of training, and improvements for future simulations. Volunteers discussed an interest and connection to healthcare and education as a motivating factor for their participation in the telehealth simulation.

The forced oscillation technique (FOT) and its longitudinal relationship with spirometry and symptoms are unresolved. We examined concordance between longitudinal spirometry, FOT and symptom control, and determined FOT limits of agreement in stable asthma. METHODS Over a 3-year period, adults with asthma attending a tertiary clinic completed the asthma control test (ACT), fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), FOT and spirometry. Analysis included between-visit concordance for significant change using Cohen's kappa () and stable asthma FOT limits of agreement. RESULTS Data (n = 186) from 855 visits (mean  SD 4.6  3.0 visits), 114  95 days apart, were analysed. Between-visit concordance was moderate between reactance at 5 Hz (X5) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ) ( = 0.34, p = 0.001), and weak between ACT and FEV1 ( = 0.18, p = 0.001). Change in FeNO did not correlate with lung function or ACT ( < 0.05, p > 0.1). Stable asthma between visits (n = 75; 132 visits) had reduced lung function variability, but comparable concordance to the entire cohort. Limits of agreement for FEV1 (0.42 L), resistance at 5 Hz (2.06 cm H2 O s L-1 ) and X5 (2.75 cm H2 O s L-1 ) in stable asthma were at least twofold greater than published values in health. CONCLUSION In adults with asthma, there is moderate concordance between longitudinal change in FOT and spirometry. Both tests relate poorly to changes in asthma control, highlighting the need for multi-modal assessment in asthma rather than symptoms alone. The derivation of longitudinal FOT limits of agreement will assist in its clinical interpretation.","output":"Longitudinal monitoring of asthma in the clinic using respiratory oscillometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In deceased-donor liver transplantation settings, post-transplantation acute renal failure with the induction of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is known to have negative effects on graft and patient survivals. However, the impact of RRT in living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has not been well investigated. The aim of this study was to elucidate risk factors requiring RRT and prognostic factors after its induction. METHODS Clinical data on the consecutive 113 adult patients who underwent LDLT from March 2002 to May 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into 2 groups: RRT (n = 33) and Non-RRT (n = 80). The primary reasons for receiving RRT were hepatorenal syndrome (n = 17), sepsis (n = 12), and renal hypoperfusion (n = 4). RESULTS Although there were no significant differences in age or sex, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was significantly higher in the RRT group than in the Non-RRT group (23  13 vs 16  7; P = .002). The graft-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) was significantly lower in the RRT group (0.86  0.3 vs 0.99  0.2; P = .025). The 1- and 5-year patient survival rates were significantly higher in the Non-RRT group than in the RRT group (respectively, 91.3% and 84.3% vs 42.9% and 25.5%; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for receiving RRT were MELD score >20 (P = .044) and GRWR <0.7 (P = .039). In the RRT group, donor age >50 years (P = .042) and preoperative serum creatinine level >1.5 mg/dL (P = .049) were significant prognostic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS In adult LDLT patients, the induction of RRT after LDLT was a negative predictor of survival.

The British HIV Association (BHIVA) recommends formula-feeding infants born to WLHIV, eliminating postnatal transmission, but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic also stated that virologically-suppressed treated women with good adherence choosing to breastfeed may be clinically supported to do so. Guidelines on diagnostics for breastfed infants and maternal viral load (VL) monitoring reflected this, but little is understood about how this worked in clinical practice. Globally, data are lacking on breastfeeding by WLHIV in resource-rich settings.ObjectivesTo describe the picture of supported breastfeeding from 2012 to March 2020 in the UK using population-level data, with considerations for clinical practice in the COVID era.MethodsThe Integrated Screening Outcomes Surveillance Service (ISOSS) conducts surveillance of all pregnancies to WLHIV in the UK and of HIV-diagnosed children <16yrs. Infant feeding intention and actual method have been collected since 2012 with enhanced surveillance of cases of breastfeeding per BHIVA guidelines.ResultsAmong 7187 livebirth deliveries, 135 (1.9%) were reported as having planned and/or supported breastfeeding;18/135 were in women who breastfed 1 infant. Of these 135 pregnancies, 125 (93%) were in women diagnosed pre-pregnancy and 84% (112/133) in women born abroad. Median age at delivery was 35yrs (IQR: 31,40). Breastfeeding duration ranged from 1day-2years.Enhanced surveillance has been conducted for 102 cases to date. Reason(s) for breastfeeding were known in 81 cases and included: bonding (36), health benefits (36), family pressures (14), disclosure concerns (14) and finance (2) (>1 reason may be reported). Partners were unaware of maternal HIV status in 11/102 cases and GP was unaware in 10/100 (in 2/11, both GP and partner were unaware). There were problems with attendance for monthly VL testing in 22/102 cases.Breastfeeding was reported to have stopped in 90/102, ongoing in 9/102 and unknown in 3/102 (LTFU). Among 90 where breastfeeding stopped, 57 infants had a negative antibody test (18months);28 are awaiting confirmatory testing and 5 LTFU before infection status was confirmed. Breastfeeding was reported to have stopped owing to maternal VL rebound in 4/90 (2 infants negative, 2 awaiting confirmatory antibody). A further 3 reported 1 detectable maternal VL during breastfeeding (1 negative antibody test, 1 in follow-up and 1 LTFU). Among 9 ongoing breastfeeding cases, there was 1 VL blip.Challenges to data collection included access to maternal monthly test results by paediatric respondents and obtaining infant test results where care was transferred during breastfeeding.ConclusionsNumbers of supported breastfeeding cases remain low, and cases diverse regarding duration and attendance for monthly testing. Findings contribute to clinical awareness of the complexities involved in managing supported breastfeeding, including the importance (and challenges) of monthly testing to identify maternal VL blips and establish infant infection status post-breastfeeding. In recognition of the significant testing burden in the COVID-era, the BHIVA pregnancy guidelines March 2020 statement discourages supported breastfeeding.

In 2019, CLSI produced clinical breakpoints for Enterococcus spp. OBJECTIVES: To describe the distribution of MICs of daptomycin for enterococcal bloodstream infection (EBSI) isolates in a large Scottish health board, the indications for local daptomycin susceptibility testing and daptomycin doses used in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) infection. METHODS: We investigated all EBSIs over a 21a? month period and identified isolates tested against daptomycin. We recorded the distribution of MICs, as well as indications for daptomycin susceptibility testing and information on daptomycin dosing, where it was used. RESULTS: There were 293 blood culture isolates of Enterococcus spp., of which 37 had daptomycin susceptibility testing performed, from 31 individual patients. Of the 293 isolates, 103 were E. faecium, of which 63 were VREfm. Daptomycin testing was indicated by vancomycin resistance in 24/37 isolates. All E. faecium isolates tested were in the CLSI 'susceptible dose-dependent (SDD)' range of MICs. All other Enterococcus spp. tested were in the 'susceptible' range. Twelve patients received daptomycin, and dosing information was recovered for 10. Nine of these patients received 8-12a? mg/kg/day dosing. There were no recorded adverse drug reactions. Ten of 12 patients were alive at the time of data collection.

There is a high frequency of increased BMI in patients admitted to intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a major severity in patients with an excess of visceral adiposity. Patients at risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory syndrome are characterised by the high prevalence of pre-existing diseases (high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), most of them typically present in severely obese patients. Indeed, the biological role of adipose tissue in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely elucidated. SUMMARY: The forced isolation due to pandemic containment measures abruptly interrupted the rehabilitation programs to which many patients with severe obesity were enrolled. People affected by obesity, and especially those with severe obesity, should continue clinical rehabilitation programs, taking extra measures to avoid COVID-19 infection and reinforcing the adoption of preventive procedures. In this review, the available data on obesity and COVID-19 are discussed along with evidence-based strategies for maintaining the necessary continuous rehabilitation programs. KEY MESSAGES: Greater attention is needed for obese and severely obese patients in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a huge challenge for both patients and healthcare professionals. The adoption of new strategies to guarantee adequate and continuous multidisciplinary nutritional rehabilitation programs will be crucial to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk populations as well as the worsening of obesity-linked complications. Health authorities should be urged to equip hospitals with tools for the diffusion of telemedicine to maintain physician-patient communication, which is fundamental in chronic and complicated obese patients.","output":"Patients with Severe Obesity during the COVID-19 Pandemic: How to Maintain an Adequate Multidisciplinary Nutritional Rehabilitation Program?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with inflammatory arthritis represent a possible high-risk group to COVID-19 due to their immunosuppressive regimen designed to maintain low disease activity.

Furthermore, immunosuppression generally did not increase the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19, with the important exception of medium and high-dose glucocorticoid use. In addition, a small number of COVID-19 patients have developed new inflammatory arthritis; whether this represents an unmasking of previous subclinical disease or a bone fide virus-induced arthritis is unclear. Nevertheless, it appears that inflammatory arthritis patients currently on immunosuppression should continue their medication to prevent future flares and limit glucocorticoid usage.

In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices. Methods and findings We examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (silk, cotton, polyester), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Tests were done when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier and also when constructed as do-it-yourself face coverings. As a protective barrier and face covering, silk is more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. Silk face coverings repelled droplets as well as masks, but unlike masks they are hydrophobic and can be readily sterilized for immediate reuse. Conclusions Silk is an effective hydrophobic barrier to droplets, more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are readily re-useable via cleaning. Therefore, silk can serve as an effective material for protecting respirators under clinical conditions and as a material for face coverings.","output":"Silk fabric as a protective barrier for personal protective equipment and as a functional material for face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to assess the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 by performing a meta-analysis according to the air temperature and to determine if the temperature modifies the pandemic duration to the peak day for CFR of the COVID-19 A novel coronavirus spread began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and half a year after, more than 9 million total cases were confirmed worldwide Therefore, knowing the conditions favorable for the spread of the virus (including weather conditions) is crucial from the perspective of the entire population Using information from the World Health Organization, subgroup meta-analysis by temperature was performed Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox proportional hazards models was conducted Based on the conducted analysis we can conclude that in countries with temperature equal or lower than 14 8C the pooled CFR of COVID-19 is higher than in countries with tempera ture greater than 14 8C Besides, in countries with lower temperature the peak of the CFR appears after a longer time from the first case of the novel coronavirus than in countries with higher temperature","output":"Effects of Air Temperature on COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bronchitis is characterized by bronchial inflammation that results in ","output":"Bronchitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to assess the impact of an 8-day military training exercise on cognitive performance, and track its recovery in periods of reduced training load and partially restored sleep. BACKGROUND: Military personnel often work in challenging multi-stressor environments, where sleep loss is inevitable.

METHOD: A total of 57 male and female soldiers undergoing the Australian Army combat engineer Initial Employment Training course were recruited and tracked over a 16-day study period which included an 8-day field-based military training exercise. Cognitive performance was assessed via a computerised battery at seven time points across four sequential study periods; 1) baseline (PRE), 2) military field training exercise which included total sleep deprivation (EX-FIELD), 3) training exercise at simulated base with restricted sleep opportunities (EX-BASE), and 4) a 3-day recovery period (REC).

Lack of diversity is detrimental to patient care, physician well-being, and the relevance of cardiothoracic surgery on our nation's health. Recent events, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests, have further accentuated the gross inequities that underrepresented minorities face in our country and have reignited conversations on how to address bias and systemic racism within our institutions. The field of cardiothoracic surgery has a responsibility to adopt a culture of diversity and inclusion. This kind of systemic change is daunting and overwhelming. With bias ubiquitously entangled with everyday experiences, it can be difficult to know where to start. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Workforce on Diversity and Inclusion presents this approach for addressing diversity and inclusion in cardiothoracic surgery. This framework was adapted from a model developed by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and includes information and recommendations generated from our literature review on diversity and inclusion. A MEDLINE search was conducted using keywords \\"diversity,\\" \\"inclusion,\\" and \\"surgery,\\" and approaches to diversity and inclusion were drawn from publications in medicine as well as non-healthcare fields. Recommendations were generated and approved by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Executive Committee. We present an overarching framework that conceptualizes diversity and inclusion efforts in a series of concentric spheres of influence, from the global environment to the cardiothoracic community, institution, and the individual surgeon. This framework organizes the approach to diversity and inclusion, grouping interventions by level while maintaining a broader perspective of how each sphere is interconnected. We include the following key recommendations within the spheres of influence: It is important to note that each of the spheres of influence is interconnected. Interventions to improve diversity must be coordinated across spheres for concerted change. Altogether, this multilevel framework (global environment, cardiothoracic community, institution, and individual) offers an organized approach for cardiothoracic surgery to assess, improve, and sustain progress in diversity and inclusion.","output":"An Approach to Diversity and Inclusion in Cardiothoracic Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major differences in survival of men and women from infectious diseases and cancers have been highlighted by death rates from COVID-19 infections.

S. Lo is widely used as an antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory herbal medicine in SouthWest China. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activity and mechanism of sinoacutine (sino), one of the primary components extracted from this plant. METHODS A RAW264.7 cell model was established using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced for estimation of cytokines in vitro, qPCR was used to estimate gene expression, western blot analysis was used to estimate protein level and investigate the regulation of NF- B, JNK and MAPK signal pathway. In addition, an acute lung injury model was established to determine lung index and levels of influencing factors. RESULTS Using the RAW264.7 model, we found that sino reduced levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) but increased levels of IL-6. qPCR analysis revealed that sino (50, 25 g/ml) inhibited gene expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). western blot analysis showed that sino significantly inhibited protein levels of both iNOS and COX-2. Further signalling pathway analysis validated that sino also inhibited phosphorylation of p65 in the NF-B and c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathways but promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 in the MAPK signalling pathway. In addition, in a mouse model induced by LPS, we determined that sino reduced the lung index and the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), NO, IL-6 and TNF- in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in acute lung injury (ALI). CONCLUSION Taken together, our results demonstrate that sino is a promising drug to alleviate LPS-induced inflammatory reactions.","output":"Sinoacutine inhibits inflammatory responses to attenuates acute lung injury by regulating NF-B and JNK signaling pathways."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is rapidly spreading worldwide with over 1.9 million cases as of mid-April 2020. Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P<.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the initial epicenter in Wuhan City. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of social media data to predict COVID-19 disease severity, measure public reaction and behavior, and evaluate effectiveness of outbreak communication.","output":"Data Mining and Content Analysis of the Chinese Social Media Platform Weibo During the Early COVID-19 Outbreak: Retrospective Observational Infoveillance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global health crisis that needs well management of not only patients but also environments to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The gold standard RT-qPCR method is sensitive and rapid to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but does not answer if PCR-positive samples contain infectious virions. To circumvent this problem, we report an SDS-propidium monoazide (PMA) assisted RT-qPCR method that enables rapid discrimination of live and dead SARS-CoV-2 within 3 h. PMA, a photo-reactive dye, can react with viral RNA released or inside inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions under assistance of 0.005% SDS, but not viral RNA inside live virions. Formation of PMA-RNA conjugates prevents PCR amplification, leaving only infectious virions to be detected. Under optimum conditions, RT-qPCR detection of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 resulted in larger than 9 Ct value differences between PMA-treated and PMA-free groups, while less than 0.5 Ct differences were observed in the detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 ranging from 20 to 5148 viral particles. Using a cutoff Ct difference of 8.6, this method could differentiate as low as 8 PFU live viruses in the mixtures of live and heat-inactivated virions. Further experiments showed that this method could successfully monitor the natural inactivation process of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic surfaces during storage with comparable results to the gold standard plaque assay. We believe that the culture-free method established here could be used for rapid and convenient determination of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions in PCR-positive samples, which will facilitate better control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"Rapid determination of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in PCR-positive samples by SDS-PMA assisted RT-qPCR()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern society is suffering from many infectious microbes.

The aim of this study was to examine loneliness in relation to risk assessment, measures taken against risks, concerns, and social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. The cross-sectional study collected data from 3474 individuals from the USA, the UK, Norway, and Australia. Loneliness was measured with the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Multiple linear regression was used in the analysis of associations between variables. The results showed that concerns about finances were more strongly associated with social loneliness, while concerns about the future was more strongly associated with emotional loneliness. Longer daily time spent on social media was associated with higher emotional loneliness. In conclusion, pandemic-related concerns seem to affect perceptions of loneliness.

Double membrane vesicles generated during initiation of autophagy cascade act as a scaffold for the assembly of viral replication complexes and facilitate RNA synthesis. The use of autophagy inhibitors - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine initially appeared to be as a potential treatment strategy of COVID-19 patients but later remained at the center of debate due to high cytotoxic effects. In the absence of a specific drug or vaccine, there is an urgent need for a safe, potent as well as affordable drug to control the disease spread.

In this rare disease local control is highly dependent on the extent of surgery. Further treatment options are urgently needed.

The presented hypofractionated re-irradiation schedule with 5  4 Gy once per week immediately following wIRA-hyperthermia is a promising option to further reduce the radiation dose recommended so far. This could reduce side effects without compromising local control. ABSTRACT: Background: Radiation-associated angiosarcoma of the breast (RAASB) is a rare, challenging disease, with surgery being the accepted basic therapeutic approach. In contrast, the role of adjuvant and systemic therapies is a subject of some controversy. Local recurrence rates reported in the literature are mostly heterogeneous and are highly dependent on the extent of surgery. In cases of locally recurrent or unresectable RAASB, prognosis is very poor. Methods: We retrospectively report on 10 consecutive RAASB patients, most of them presenting with locally recurrent or unresectable RAASB, which were treated with thermography-controlled water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) superficial hyperthermia (HT) immediately followed by re-irradiation (re-RT). Patients with RAASB were graded based on their tumor extent before onset of radiotherapy (RT). Results: We recorded a local control (LC) rate dependent on tumor extent ranging from a high LC rate of 100% (two of two patients) in the adjuvant setting with an R0 or R2 resection to a limited LC rate of 33% (one of three patients) in patients with inoperable, macroscopic tumor lesions. Conclusion: Combined HT and re-RT should be considered as an option (a) for adjuvant treatment of RAASB, especially in cases with positive resection margins and after surgery of local recurrence (LR), and (b) for definitive treatment of unresectable RAASB.","output":"Radiation-Associated Angiosarcoma of the Breast and Chest Wall Treated with Thermography-Controlled, Contactless wIRA-Hyperthermia and Hypofractionated Re-Irradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic urged immense testing capacities as one cornerstone of infection control.

It is likely that some influences represent reversible changes in erythrocyte rigidity that may be involved in physiological regulation, while others represent the early stages of eryptosis, i.e., the red cell self-programmed death. For example, erythrocyte rigidification during exercise is probably a reversible physiological mechanism, while the alterations of red blood cells (RBCs) observed in pathological conditions (inflammation, type 2 diabetes, and sickle-cell disease) are more likely to lead to eryptosis. The splenic clearance of rigid erythrocytes is the major regulator of RBC deformability. The physicochemical characteristics of the surrounding environment (thermal injury, pH, osmolality, oxidative stress, and plasma protein profile) also play a major role. However, there are many other factors that influence RBC deformability and eryptosis. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the various elements and circulating molecules that might influence RBCs and modify their deformability: purinergic signaling, gasotransmitters such as nitric oxide (NO), divalent cations (magnesium, zinc, and Fe(2+)), lactate, ketone bodies, blood lipids, and several circulating hormones. Meal composition (caloric and carbohydrate intake) also modifies RBC deformability. Therefore, RBC deformability appears to be under the influence of many factors. This suggests that several homeostatic regulatory loops adapt the red cell rigidity to the physiological conditions in order to cope with the need for oxygen or fuel delivery to tissues. Furthermore, many conditions appear to irreversibly damage red cells, resulting in their destruction and removal from the blood. These two categories of modifications to erythrocyte deformability should thus be differentiated.","output":"Metabolic Influences Modulating Erythrocyte Deformability and Eryptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The monitoring and control of epidemics is one of the most relevant topics in the field of smart health within smart cities.

We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: The REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor before admission. Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin-angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04338009. FINDINGS: Between March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77). Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes. Compared with discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40-110] for continuation vs 81 [38-117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI -13 to 29]). There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died. 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (&#967;2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=077). There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.

MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days (SD 11.1) for COVID-19 negative with 20 (64.5%) patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0 (SD 12.2) and 31 (73.8%) among COVID-19 positive patients. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty (FI >0.35) had lower mBI scores on discharge [92.0 (6.7) not frail, 81.0 (15.4) mild frailty, 48.6 (20.4) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], lower PT scores on discharge [54.2 (3.9) nonfrail, 51.5 (8.0) mild frailty, 37.1 (9.7) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], and lower OT score on discharge [52.9 (3.2) nonfrail, 45.8 (9.4) mild frailty, 32.4 (7.4) moderate or worse frailty; P = .001].

The moment of the COVID-19 evolution in which immunothrombosis mechanisms are triggered is not established. Aim: To describe the kinetics of NETs release during COVID-19 hospitalization associating with thrombosis and death. Methods We quantified citrullinated H3 and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6), markers of NETs release, on 4 time points during COVID-19 hospitalization (admission, day 4, day 8 and last day) between May and July 2020. The association between changes in these markers levels and clinical outcomes was determined. Results 101 patients were included, the median days in-hospital were 15, 62% were men, 27% were obese, 43% were diabetic, 54% were hypertensive, 59% were critically ill, 11% had a thrombotic event and 21% died. IL-6 levels were high on admission in survivors (median 25.32, IQR 24.19-28.15) and non-survivors (median 24.19, IQR 12.51-27.19), but gradually decreased on day 4 (median 12.07, IQR 6.32-17.81), day 8 (median 9.34, IQR 5.18-17.59) and last day (median 8.64, IQR 4.81-14.89) in survivors. TNF- levels remained 2 times higher in non-survivors: admission (median 1.60, IQR 0.64-2.26), day 4 (median 1.78, IQR 1.02-2.60), day 8 (median 1.65, IQR 0.93-2.5), last day (median 2.41, IQR 1.31-4.06); than in survivors: admission (median 0.81, IQR 0.52-1.26), day 4 (median 0.84, IQR 0.44-1.16), day 8 (median 0.72, IQR 0.44-1.24), last day (median 0.69, IQR 0.4-1.14). CitH3 levels were similar between non-survivors at the beginning of hospitalization: admission (median 1.03, IQR 0.43-4.34), day 4 (median 1.1, IQR 0.65-3.45); as for survivors: admission (median 1.20, IQR 0.45-2.60), day 4 (median 1.27, IQR 0.64-3.29). On day 8, citH3 increased by 3-fold (median 3.80, IQR 1.98-10.15) in non-survivors and 2-fold (median 2.60, IQR 1.22-5.01) in survivors. While IL-6 and TNF- levels were similar between patients with and without thrombosis, citH3 levels increased shortly on day 4, before the occurrence of a thrombotic event: admission (median 1.64, IQR 0.44-4.14), day 4 (median 3.21, IQR 2.57-9.31); but it didn't change on non-thrombotic event patients: admission (median 1.05, IQR 0.44-2.50), day 4 (median 1.06, IQR 0.58-2.95). Conclusion Markers of inflammation and immunothrombosis were associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19; however, these disorders were detected in different moments during COVID-19 course. While an increased inflammatory response was observed since the beginning of hospitalization, markers of immunothrombosis arose latter during the course of the disease.

Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. METHODS We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 25th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 975th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. FINDINGS Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 567 (IQR 319-668) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (868, 95% uncertainty interval 846-889), Iceland (860, 841-876), and Sweden (856, 818-878) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (109, 96-119), the Central African Republic (110, 88-138), and Somalia (113, 95-131) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. INTERPRETATION GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000.

As part of this national effort, the French Military Medical Service (FMMS) is committed to the fight against COVID-19. This original report aimed to describe and detail actions that the FMMS has carried out in the nationwide fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in France, as well as overseas. Experts in the field reported major actions conducted by the FMMS during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. In just few weeks, the FMMS developed ad hoc medical capabilities to support national health authorities. It additionally developed adaptive, collective en route care via aeromedical and naval units and deployed a military intensive care field hospital. A COVID-19 crisis cell coordinated the French Armed Forces health management. The French Military Centre for Epidemiology and Public Health provided all information needed to guide the decision-making process. Medical centres of the French Armed Forces organised the primary care for military patients, with the widespread use of telemedicine. The Paris Fire Brigade and the Marseille Navy Fire Battalion emergency departments ensured prehospital management of patients with COVID-19. The eight French military training hospitals cooperated with civilian regional health agencies. The French military medical supply chain supported all military medical treatment facilities in France as well as overseas, coping with a growing shortage of medical equipment. The French Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute performed diagnostics, engaged in multiple research projects, updated the review of the scientific literature on COVID-19 daily and provided expert recommendations on biosafety. Finally, even students of the French military medical academy volunteered to participate in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, in an unprecedented medical crisis, the FMMS engaged multiple innovative and adaptive actions, which are still ongoing, in the fight against COVID-19. The collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems reinforced the shared objective to achieve the goal of 'saving the greatest number'.","output":"How do we fight COVID-19?

Therefore, health authorities further recommend screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed or high-risk HWs. Nevertheless, to date, the best/optimal method to screen HWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under debate, and data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs are still scarce. The present study aims to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate amongst HWs in a teaching hospital in Central Italy and the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology (index test) in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR assay (reference standard). (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study on the retrospective data of HWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and by an IgM/IgG serology assay on venous blood samples, irrespective of exposure and/or symptoms, was carried out. (3) Results: A total of 2057 HWs (median age 46, 19C69 years, females 60.2%) were assessed by the RNA RT-PCR assay and 58 (2.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with negative HWs, SARS-CoV-2-positives were younger (mean age 41.7 versus 45.2, p < 0.01; 50% versus 31% under or equal to 40 years old, p < 0.002) and had a shorter duration of employment (64 versus 125 months, p = 0.02). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in positive HWs than in negatives (55.2% versus 27.5%, p < 0.0001). In 44.8% of positive HWs, no exposure was traced. None of the positive HWs had a fatal outcome, none of them had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only one required hospitalization for mild/moderate pneumonia. In 1084 (51.2%) HWs, nasopharyngeal swabs and an IgM/IgG serology assay were performed. With regard to IgM serology, sensitivity was 0% at a specificity of 98.99% (positive predictive value, PPV 0%, negative predictive value, NPV 99.2%). Concerning IgG serology and irrespective of the time interval between nasopharyngeal swab and serology, sensitivity was 50% at a specificity of 99.1% (PPV 28.6%, NPV 99.6%). IgG serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive at the RNA RT-PCR assay by a nasopharyngeal swab. (4) Conclusions: Our experience in Central Italy demonstrated a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HWs, but higher than in the general population. Nearly half of the positive HWs reported no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy implemented. IgG serology seems useful when performed at least two weeks after an RNA RT-PCR assay. IgM serology does not seem to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. High awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mandatory for all people, but especially for HWs, irrespective of symptoms, to safeguard their health and that of patients.","output":"Prevalence of Sars-Cov-2 Infection in Health Workers (HWs) and Diagnostic Test Performance: The Experience of a Teaching Hospital in Central Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020, the world has been experiencing the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic It has spread out to more than 200 countries including Indonesia As of July 6, 2020, in Indonesia the number of people confirmed with COVID-19 was 64, 958 people with 3, 241 people declared dead The spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia has occurred in various places, such as markets, stations, terminals, and worship places The emergence of new government policy, namely the Adaptation of New Habits (New Normal), which aims to keep people productive and safe from COVID-19 during the pandemic, can backlash against people's productivity Therefore, a solution in the form of Integrated COVID-19 Early Prevention Devices (INCEPS) in preventing the spread of COVID-19 at public area is proposed with artificial intelligence-based smart-gate and website integration Here, the implementation of the proposed solution is in the form of smart gate design integrated with the INCEPS website to monitor community density in various places and to provide reminders for the public to more adhere in health protocols recommended by the government ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Design of smart-gate based on artificial intelligence possibly for COVID-19 early prevention at public area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive skin cancer with no survival benefit demonstrated using palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy in the setting of metastatic MCC. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1/PD1) have been approved in this setting after durable clinical response was demonstrated in several clinical trials. In this series, we present a multicentre real-world experience in using anti-PD-L1/PD1 in advanced MCC. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of all patients with metastatic MCC who were treated with at least one dose of anti-PD-L1/PD1 presenting to Sydney West Cancer Network (Westmead, Nepean and Blacktown hospitals) was performed between 2016 and 2020. Treatment response was assessed based on morphologic and/or metabolic changes of the disease on FDG-PET/CT scans. Primary end point investigated was objective response rate. Secondary outcomes included therapy toxicity, disease control and overall survival. RESULTS Thirteen patients received anti-PD-L1/PD1 with a median age of 82 (range 62-89). Two patients had undergone prior palliative chemotherapy. The median follow-up time was 17 months (range 2-34). The overall, complete and partial response rates were 77% (10), 54% (7) and 23% (3), respectively.

The median interval between the first SRFA and transplantation was 6.8 months (range, 0-71). The rate of residual vital tissue (RVT) could be assessed in 188 of 195 lesions in 96 of 97 patients by histological examination of the explanted livers using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Tdt-mediated UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) stains. Histopathological results were compared with the findings of the last computed tomography (CT) imaging before liver transplantation (LT). Median number and size of treated tumors were 1 (range, 1-8) and 2.5 cm (range, 1-8). Complete radiological response was achieved in 186 of 188 nodules (98.9%) and 94 of 96 patients (97.9%) and complete pathological response in the explanted liver specimen in 183 of 188 nodules (97.3%) and 91 of 96 patients (94.8%), respectively.

Pharmacological strategies aimed at modulating inflammation in COVID-19 are being evaluated worldwide. Several drug therapies targeting this excessive inflammation, such as tocilizumab, an interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, and intravenous immunoglobulin have been identified as potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract the cytokine storm. However, little attention is currently paid for non-drug therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory and immunological processes that may be useful for reducing COVID-19-induced complications and improving patient outcome. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates inflammation both in experimental models and preliminary data in human. Modulating the activity of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways (CAPs) described by the group of KJ Tracey has indeed become an important target of therapeutic research strategies for inflammatory diseases and sepsis.

Participants were seen face-to-face in clinic pre-COVID. During lock-down, they were posted questionnaires and contacted by telephone. The last clinic visit took place on the 12 March 2020, remote visits took place between 16 April and 28 Sep. 260 individuals at six sites (25 Belfast, 38 Birmingham, 25 Edinburgh, 101 London, 27 Manchester and 44 Nottingham) were asked about smoking habits. The MRC chronic bronchitis questionnaire, COPD Assessment test (CAT), Leicester cough questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire were completed in writing by the participant and returned by post or photographed and returned by email. At enrolment, the post-BD FEV1 was 3.81 (SD 0.8) litres, 101% (11) of GLI predicted. Comparisons were made by paired t-tests and chi-squared tests. RESULTS: Level of anxiety increased from 6.74 (SD 4.4) to 7.37 (SD 4.7, n=233;p=0.010) during lock-down;depression scores increased from 4.30 (3.9) to 5.14 (SD 4.1;n=233;p&lt;0.001).

Frontline healthcare workers (FHCW) directly involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have faced some physical and psychological challenges. This study explored the stigma and traumatic experiences of the FHCW during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Methods: : We recruited twenty FHCW directly involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients through purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted for all participants, and qualitative analysis of data was done using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Results: : Five themes identified were: Early stage of the pandemic (fear, anxiety, public fright and countries repatriating their citizens, the socio-economic impact of the pandemic and a call to duty for the FHCW);working with COVID-19 patients (excitement on patients recovery and duty stress);psychological, mental and emotional trauma;stigmatization (stigmatized by colleagues, family, friends or their residential communities, reasons for stigmatization which were fear of infection, limited knowledge of the virus and working at the isolation centre and the effect of stigma);and recommendations (education and awareness creation, government showing more care towards the FHCW and provision of health insurance for FHCW to take care of those that get infected in the line of duty). Conclusion: Stigmatization has proven to be a major challenge for FHCW in conducting their duties. The psychological impact experienced by FHCW may affect the quality of the services rendered by these workers. The study reveals the need of education and awareness creation in the ongoing pandemic. There is a need for the government and society to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of FHCW.","output":"Stigmatization and Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Healthcare Workers in Nigeria: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Schools were closed extensively in 2020C21 to counter SARS-CoV-2 spread, impacting students' education and wellbeing. With highly contagious variants expanding in Europe, safe options to maintain schools open are urgently needed. By estimating school-specific transmissibility, our study evaluates costs and benefits of different protocols for SARS-CoV-2 control at school. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. We used empirical contact data in a primary and a secondary school and data from pilot screenings in 683 schools during the alpha variant (B.1.1.7) wave in MarchCJune, 2021, in France. We fitted the model to observed school prevalence to estimate the school-specific effective reproductive number for the alpha (R(alpha)) and delta (B.1.617.2; R(delta)) variants and performed a costCbenefit analysis examining different intervention protocols. FINDINGS: We estimated R(alpha) to be 140 (95% CI 135C145) in the primary school and 146 (141C151) in the secondary school during the spring wave, higher than the time-varying reproductive number estimated from community surveillance. Considering the delta variant and vaccination coverage in Europe as of mid-September, 2021, we estimated R(delta) to be 166 (160C171) in primary schools and 110 (106C114) in secondary schools. Under these conditions, weekly testing of 75% of unvaccinated students (PCR tests on saliva samples in primary schools and lateral flow tests in secondary schools), in addition to symptom-based testing, would reduce cases by 34% (95% CI 32C36) in primary schools and 36% (35C39) in secondary schools compared with symptom-based testing alone. Insufficient adherence was recorded in pilot screening (median 53%). Regular testing would also reduce student-days lost up to 80% compared with reactive class closures. Moderate vaccination coverage in students would still benefit from regular testing for additional controlie, weekly testing 75% of unvaccinated students would reduce cases compared with symptom-based testing only, by 23% in primary schools when 50% of children are vaccinated. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic will probably continue to pose a risk to the safe and normal functioning of schools. Extending vaccination coverage in students, complemented by regular testing with good adherence, are essential steps to keep schools open when highly transmissible variants are circulating.

However, no study has previously linked measurements of viral aerosol emissions to transmission rates. METHODS: During Feb-Mar 2021, covid-19 cases that were close to symptom onset were visited with a mobile laboratory for collection of exhaled aerosol particles during breathing, talking and singing, respectively, and of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples. Aerosol samples were collected using a BioSpot-VIVAS and a NIOSH bc-251 two-stage cyclone, and all samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. We compared transmission rates between households with aerosol-positive and aerosol-negative index cases. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in at least one aerosol sample from 19 of 38 (50%) included cases. The odds ratio of finding positive aerosol samples decreased with each day from symptom onset (OR 0.55, 95CI 0.30-1.0, p=0.049). The highest number of positive aerosol samples were from singing, 16 (42%), followed by talking, 11 (30%), and the least from breathing, 3 (8%). Index cases were identified for 13 households with 31 exposed contacts. Higher transmission rates were observed in households with aerosol-positive index cases, 10/16 infected (63%), compared to households with aerosol-negative index cases, 4/15 infected (27%) (Chi-square test, p=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 cases were more likely to exhale SARS-CoV-2-containing aerosol particles close to symptom onset and during singing or talking as compared to breathing.

There are currently no standardized metrics to measure MAPP performance, thus it is necessary to measure the value of MAPPs to employers and clarify the need for their specific skills. OBJECTIVES: The first aim of this study was to identify a list of indicators to produce an MAPP value measurement tool, and the second aim was to determine its discriminant validity by showing that the MAPPval instrument differentiated the MAPP role from other internal stakeholders (regulatory affairs, market access, commercial, and patient advocacy) in terms of accountability for pharmaceutical company activities and level of engagement with external stakeholders. METHODS: MAPPs were recruited using convenience sampling via professional networks and completed a qualitative online survey to identify a list of key role indicators using a consensus method known as the Jandhyala method. Responses were coded and scored, and aggregated responses were presented to participants in a Consensus Round. Participants rated their agreement with each item on a 5-point Likert scale, from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Indicators that reached a consensus index of > 50% (CI  0.51) were retained in the final MAPP performance instrument. Participants retrospectively self-reported professional activities over a period of 12 months were used to validate the measure. A two-proportion z-test and MannCWhitney tests were used to determine discriminant validity by showing whether the value of the MAPP role as defined by the instrument was significantly different from that of other internal stakeholders in terms of their accountability for and external stakeholder benefit from each MAPP activity. RESULTS: In total, 11 MAPPs participated in the Jandhyala method, which generated 22 unique MAPP value indicators. Payor-targeted activities and journal publications had the two highest awareness indexes (1.00 and 0.98, respectively). The retrospective study confirmed the MAPPval instruments validity. MAPPs were the only internal stakeholder classified as accountable for at least one activity that benefited all four stakeholders. They were classified as accountable for activities that influenced significantly more external stakeholders than other internal stakeholders, even when activities influenced fewer than four external stakeholders. MAPPs were also accountable for significantly more activities recorded over the 12-month period than regulatory affairs, market access, commercial, and patient advocacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study generated and validated the first measure of MAPP value to pharmaceutical companies. MAPPs have unique value to pharmaceutical companies compared with other roles in terms of their accountability for activities that influence regulators, payors, prescribers, and patients. Through their accountability for pharmaceutical company activities and influence of external stakeholders, MAPPs play a key role in medicine adoption.

These patients recover rapidly, eliminating damage of sensory nerves. Discovering that S protein contains two ankyrin repeat binding motifs (S-ARBMs) and some TRP cation channels, implicated in OTC, have ankyrin repeat domains (TRPs-ARDs), I hypothesized that interaction of S-ARBMs and TRPs-ARDs could dysregulate the function of the latter and thus explains OTCD. Of note, some TRPs-ARDs are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, taste buds, trigeminal neurons in the oronasal cavity and vagal neurons in the trachea/lungs. Furthermore, this hypothesis is supported by studies that have shown: (i) respiratory viruses interact with TRPA1 and TRPV1 on sensory nerves and epithelial cells in the airways, (ii) the respiratory pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients is similar to lungs injuries produced by the sensitization of TRPV1 and TRPV4, and (iii) resolvin D1 and D2 shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation, directly inhibit TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPV3 and TRPV4.

Regarding body fluid samples, except for being used for nucleic acid testing, the relationship between COVID-19 and routine body fluid parameters is not known. Our aim was to investigate the value of urine biochemical parameters in the prediction of the severity of COVID-19. Methods A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 67, severe 42 and critical 10), and 45 healthy persons were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 was analyzed. Results The positive rates of urine occult blood (BLOOD) and proteinuria (PRO) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05); the urine specific gravity (SG) value was lower in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), and the urine potential of hydrogen (pH) value was higher in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.01). The positive rates of urine glucose (GLU-U) and PRO in the severe and critical groups were higher than those in the moderate group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively); other biochemical parameters of urine were not associated with the severity of COVID-19.

The lipid-derived messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA) acts as a satiety signal inhibiting food intake through the involvement of central noradrenergic and oxytocinergic neurons. We investigated the anti-binge effects of OEA in a rat model of binge-like eating, in which, after cycles of intermittent food restrictions/refeeding and palatable food consumptions, female rats show a binge-like intake of palatable food, following a 15-min exposure to their sight and smell (frustration stress). Systemically administered OEA dose-dependently (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(?1)) prevented binge-like eating. This behavioral effect was associated with a decreased activation (measured by mapping the expression of c-fos, an early gene widely used as a marker of cellular activation) of brain areas responding to stress (such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) and to a stimulation of areas involved in the control of food intake, such as the VTA and the PVN. These effects were paralleled, also, to the modulation of monoamine transmission in key brain areas involved in both homeostatic and hedonic control of eating. In particular, a decreased dopaminergic response to stress was observed by measuring dopamine extracellular concentrations in microdialysates from the nucleus accumbens shell, whereas an increased serotonergic and noradrenergic tone was detected in tissue homogenates of selected brain areas. Finally, a decrease in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels was induced by OEA in the central amygdala, while an increase in oxytocin mRNA levels was induced in the PVN. The restoration of a normal oxytocin receptor density in the striatum paralleled the oxytocinergic stimulation produced by OEA. In conclusion, we provide evidence suggesting that OEA might represent a novel potential pharmacological target for the treatment of binge-like eating behavior.","output":"Oleoylethanolamide decreases frustration stress-induced binge-like eating in female rats: a novel potential treatment for binge eating disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an unprecedented outbreak of viral pneumonia.

Objective: To identify the main consequences/sequelae on functional respiratory capacity in the elderly after CoViD-19. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the community. Functional aerobic capacity (2min step test), dyspnea perception (modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Questionnaire), respiratory and peripheral muscle strength (maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure, grip strength) and the Frailty Index (Clinical Fragility Scale) were assessed in 25 community-dwelling individuals aged []65 years, who have had a diagnosis of CoViD-19 for up to 6 months, and in an equal number of elderly people with the same characteristics without a known diagnosis of CoViD-19. Results: The elderly with a diagnosis of CoViD-19 up to 6 months presented a decrease in the values of maximum inspiratory pressure (p=0.001) and maximum expiratory pressure (p=0.015), in aerobic capacity (p<0.001) with significant presence of desaturation on exertion (p<0.001), and increased values of dyspnea perception (p=0.001) and Frailty Index (p=0.026).

SARS-CoV-2 emerging from Wuhan, China, took only three months to cover >200 countries worldwide by infecting more than 2.4 million people and killing more than 150,000 people. Although this infection at the early stage creates seasonal flu-like symptoms with a higher illness, it eventually causes a higher mortality. Epidemiological studies not only find the causes of many health issues but also suggest preventive measures. This study aimed to see the link between environment temperature and COVID-19 cases. STUDY DESIGN: The monthly average environment temperature (MAET) and various COVID-19 cases of a country were collected and analyzed to see the relationship between these parameters. METHODS: Univariate analysis and statistical modeling were used to determine the relationship between environment temperature and different COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: This study found that the majorities of the countries having higher COVID-19 cases are located in the higher latitude (colder region) in the globe. As of 20th April data available, statistical analyses by various methods have found that strong negative correlations with statistical significance exist between MAET and several COVID-19 cases including total cases, active cases, and cases per million of a country (Spearman correlation coefficients were -0.45, -0.42, and -0.50 for total cases, active cases, and cases/per million, respectively).

This report is an update with 10 additional patients in the series and includes bacterial contamination data. METHODS The patients in this human trial were scheduled to undergo diagnostic laparoscopy for abdominal staging of a pancreatic head mass. A second surgeon, blinded to the laparoscopic findings, performed a transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy (TEP). The findings of laparoscopic exploration were compared with that those of the TEP. Diagnostic findings, operative times, and clinical course were recorded. Bacterial contamination data were collected for the second cohort of 10 patients. Bacterial samples were collected from the scope before use and the abdominal cavity before and after creation of the gastrotomy. Samples were assessed for bacterial counts and species identification. Definitive care was rendered based on the findings from laparoscopy. RESULTS In this study, 20 patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy followed by DTEP. The average time for completion of diagnostic laparoscopy was 10 min compared with 21 min for TEP. The experience acquired during the initial 10 procedures translated to a 7-min decrease in TEP time for the second 10 cases. For 19 of the 20 patients, DTEP corroborated laparoscopic findings for surgical decision making. One endoscopic and five laparoscopic biopsies were performed. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed for 14 patients and palliative gastrojejunostomy for 6 patients. No cross-contamination of the peritoneum or infectious complications were noted.

The present study aimed to determine whether RES protects against myocardial ischemic injury in association with the inhibition of NF-B-dependent inflammation and the enhancement of antioxidant defenses in mice following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Male C57/BL mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups as follows: The sham-operated (sham) group, AMI + vehicle group and AMI + RES group. Rat H9C2 cells were also used to examine the effects of RES on hypoxia-induced oxidative injury in vitro. Redox homeostasis in the mouse myocardium and rat H9C2 cells was determined post-treatment. The mRNA and protein levels of phosphorylated (p-)IB kinase (p-IKK), p-nuclear factor (NF)-B p65, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. It was found that RES slightly protected the myocardium against ischemic injury in mice, while it prevented the hypoxia-induced apoptosis of H9C2 cells. RES decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). RES also downregulated the protein and/or mRNA levels of p-IKK, p-NF-B p65, IL-1, IL-6, NGF and IGF-1 at 7 and 28 days after infarction. On the whole, these data indicate that RES protects the myocardium against ischemic injury in association with the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Thus, RES has the potential to be used as an adjunctive therapeutic drug for heart diseases.","output":"Resveratrol protects against myocardial ischemic injury via the inhibition of NF-B-dependent inflammation and the enhancement of antioxidant defenses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, the need for effective treatments for COVID-19 led to the idea of \\"repurposing\\" drugs for antiviral treatment. Several antipsychotics and antidepressants have been tested for in vitro activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Chlorpromazine, other phenothiazine antipsychotics, and the antidepressant fluoxetine were found to be rather potent in these studies. However, whether effective plasma concentrations can be obtained with clinically accepted doses of these drugs is not clear. Data of COVID-19 patients are not yet available but several clinical studies are currently underway. The specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine is a potent Sigma-1 receptor agonist and reduces inflammation in animal models of cytokine-stress. Accordingly, fluvoxamine treatment was superior to placebo in reducing impaired respiratory function and other symptoms of inflammation in COVID-19 patients in a placebo-controlled clinical study and another open clinical trial. The beneficial effects of fluvoxamine on the course of COVID-19 were recently confirmed in a large placebo-controlled double-blind trial with several hundred patients. Inflammation represents a major risk factor for many psychiatric disorders which explains the high susceptibilitiy of COVID- 19 patients for psychiatric diseases. Many antidepressants and antipsychotics possess anti-inflammatory properties independent of sigma-1 activity which might be important to reduce psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 patients and to improve respiratory dysfunction and other consequences of inflammation. This might explain the rather unspecific benefit which has been reported for several cohorts of COVID-19 patients treated with different psychotropic drugs.

The technical and oncologic differences between these modalities are unclear. METHODS We conducted a matched-cohort analysis of patients undergoing open MWA or RFA for CRLM at a tertiary-care center between 2008 and 2011; the primary endpoint was ablation-site recurrence. Tumors were matched by size, clinical-risk score, and arterial-intrahepatic or systemic chemotherapy use. Outcomes were compared using conditional logistic regression and stratified log-rank test. RESULTS We matched 254 tumors (127 per group) from 134 patients. MWA and RFA groups were comparable by age, gender, median number of tumors treated, proximity to major vessels, and postoperative complication rates. Patients in the MWA group had lower ablation-site recurrence rates (6% vs. 20%; P < 0.01). Median follow-up, however, was significantly shorter in the MWA group (18 months [95% confidence interval 17-20] vs. 31 months [95% confidence interval 28-35]; P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates of ablation-site recurrence at 2 years were significantly lower for the lesions treated with MWA (7% vs. 18%, P: 0.01).

With no clinically approved drugs, the global health system is struggling to find an effective treatment measure. At this crucial juncture, screening of plant-derived compounds may be an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. The present study investigated the binding affinity of phytocompounds with 3-Chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro) and Papain-like proteases (PLpro) of SARS-CoV2 using in-silico techniques. A total of 32 anti-protease phytocompounds were investigated for the binding affinity to the proteins. Docking was performed in Autodock Vina. Pharmacophore descriptors of best ligands were studied using LigandScout. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of apo-protein and ligand-bound complexes was carried out in YASARA software. The druglikeness properties of phytocompounds were studied using ADMETlab. Out of 32 phytochemicals, amentoflavone and gallocatechin gallate showed the best binding affinity to 3CLpro (-9.4 kcal/mol) and PLpro (-8.8 kcal/mol). Phytochemicals such as savinin, theaflavin-3,3-digallate, and kazinol-A also showed strong affinity. MD simulation revealed ligand-induced conformational changes in the protein with decreased surface area and higher stability. The RMSD/F of proteins and ligands showed stability of the protein suggesting the effective binding of the ligand in both the proteins. Both amentoflavone and gallocatechin gallate possess promising druglikeness property.

Several inflammatory markers have been used to assess severity in COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Few studies, however, have shown these markers as predictor of mortality. The common laboratory test for assessing severity in COVID-19 patients includes interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). AIM: The aims of this study were determine the relationship between the two inflammatory biomarkers and mortality as well as their cutoff values in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 80 confirmed patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit of a secondary hospital in Indonesia between August and December 2020. They were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings at admission and during the disease. The primary outcome was mean level IL-6 and CRP of severe COVID-19 patients on admission. The secondary outcome was cutoff of IL-6 and CRP to predict mortality during the first 14 days of hospitalization. RESULTS: CRP and IL-6 levels were evaluated as prognostic factors for outcome using the ROC curve. A total of 80 confirmed patients consisting of 53 (71.25%) survivors and 23 (28.75%) non-survivors. Mortality was weakly correlated with levels of IL-6 (r = 0.249) and CRP (r = 0.247). The IL-6 cutoff was 101.64 pg/ml (AUROC 0.658 (95% CI 0.529 C 0.787);p = 0.028).

While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from more than one thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods: Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia, and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in 7 languages (English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian). Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results: 1047 participations (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%), and others (3%) were included in the analysis. Findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. Large decreases (p < 0.001) in the amount of social activity through family (?58%), friends/neighbors (?44.9%), or entertainment (?46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower life satisfaction (?30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, the social contact score through digital technologies significantly increased (p < 0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (+24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology.

Interestingly, a statistically significant positive correlation was observed between vitamin D serum levels and PaO2 (p = 0.03), SO2 (p = 0.05), PaO2/FiO2 (p = 0.02), while a statistically significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D serum levels and D-dimer (p = 0.04), C-reactive protein (p = 0.04) and percentage of O2 in a venturi mask (p = 0.04). A negative correlation was also observed between vitamin D serum levels and severity of radiologic pulmonary involvement, evaluated by computed tomography: in particular, vitamin D was found significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with either multiple lung consolidations (p = 0.0001) or diffuse/severe interstitial lung involvement than in those with mild involvement (p = 0.05). Finally, significantly lower vitamin D serum levels were found in the elderly COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization, compared to those who survived (median 3.0 vs 8.4 ng/mL, p = 0.046). Conclusions: This study confirms that 25OH-vitamin D serum deficiency is associated with more severe lung involvement, longer disease duration and risk of death, in elderly COVID-19 patients. The detection of low vitamin D levels also in younger COVID-19 patients with less comorbidities further suggests vitamin D deficiency as crucial risk factor at any age.","output":"Vitamin D and Lung Outcomes in Elderly COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The understanding and interpretation of speech can be affected by various external factors.

In this study, we investigated the multiparametric ultrasound findings of patients with post-vaccine lymphadenopathy and compared these findings among different anti-COVID-19 vaccines. We evaluated patients presenting with post-anti-COVID-19 lymphadenopathy. The presence, size, location, number, morphology, cortexChilum, superb microvascular imaging and elastosonography of lymph nodes were assessed. They were axillary and supraclavicular ipsilateral to the injection site. Prevalent ultrasound features included oval morphology, asymmetric cortex with hilum evidence, central and peripheral vascular signals at superb microvascular imaging and elastosonography patterns similar to the surrounding tissue. We found no significant differences between the three COVID-19 vaccines: the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine and Modernas mRNA-1273 vaccine. Some ultrasound lymph node features, such as round morphology, no hilum evidence and hard pattern, may mimic pathological lymph nodes. An awareness of the patients history (vaccine injection and oncological history) and ultrasound findings may help in the early recognition of this clinical scenario and in the appropriate selection of patients for a short-term US follow-up. ABSTRACT: Background: Post-anti-COVID-19 vaccine lymphadenopathy has recently been described in the literature. In this study, we investigated the multiparametric US findings of patients with post-vaccine lymphadenopathy and compared these findings among different anti-COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 24 patients who underwent US between January and May 2021 due to post-anti-COVID-19 lymphadenopathy. The presence, size, location, number, morphology, cortex-hilum, superb microvascular imaging (SMI) and elastosonography of lymph nodes were assessed. Descriptive statistics were calculated and differences among anti-COVID-19 vaccines were analyzed using the KruskalCWallis test. A p-value  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Sixty-six nodes were assessed. They were axillary (mean 1.6 cm  0.16) in 11 patients (45.8%) and supraclavicular (mean 0.9 cm  0.19) in 13 patients (54.2%). In 20 patients (83.3%), the number of nodes was 3. Prevalent US features included oval morphology (18, 75%), asymmetric cortex with hilum evidence (9, 37.5%), central and peripheral vascular signals (12, 50%) at SMI and elastosonography patterns similar to the surrounding tissue (15, 71.4%). No significant differences among the three anti-COVID-19 vaccines were observed (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Anti-COVID-19 vaccines may present lymphadenopathy with worrisome US features regarding size, shape, morphology, cortex-hilum, SMI and elastosonography. An awareness of the patients history and US findings may help in the early recognition of this clinical scenario and in the appropriate selection of patients for a short-term US follow-up.","output":"Lymphadenopathy after the Anti-COVID-19 Vaccine: Multiparametric Ultrasound Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, our breast cancer screening activities have been interrupted. In June 2020, they resumed, calling for mandatory safe procedures to properly manage patients and staff. Methods: A protocol supporting medical activities in breast cancer screening was created, based on six relevant articles published in the literature and in the following National and International guidelines for COVID-19 prevention. The patient population, consisting of both screening and breast ambulatory patients, was classified into one of four categories: 1. Non-COVID-19 patient; 2. Confirmed COVID-19 in an asymptomatic screening patient; 3. suspected COVID-19 in symptomatic or confirmed breast cancer; 4. Confirmed COVID-19 in symptomatic or confirmed breast cancer. The day before the radiological exam, patients are screened for COVID-19 infection through a telephone questionnaire. At a subsequent in person appointment, the body temperature is checked and depending on the clinical scenario at stake, the scenario-specific procedures for medical and paramedical staff are adopted. Results: In total, 203 mammograms, 76 breast ultrasound exams, 4 core needle biopsies, and 6 vacuum-assisted breast biopsies were performed in one month. Neither medical nor paramedical staff were infected on any of these occasions.

The impetuous entrance of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy in March 2020, after the onset and diffusion in China, found the health system widely unfit to face the large amount of infected patients. The matter of this investigation was to evaluate how pandemic fear and guidelines for limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus could have impacted the regular supply of radiotherapy (RT) and the outcome of the treatments. Materials and Methods. From March 9, 2020, to May 29, 2020, a register has been established to record patients that cancelled or postponed the RT appointment. The reasons were as follows: (1) patients whose appointments were postponed by the staff according to national guidelines;(2) patients who asked themselves to postpone the appointment;(3) patients who interrupted the treatment for causes directly or indirectly related to the pandemic;(4) patients who cancelled their care path. Results. A total number of 277 patients started regular RT, and 384 respected their computed tomography (CT) simulation appointment, but 60 of them had alteration of their therapeutic pathway. Among these, 18 cancelled their appointment. 42 patients asked to postpone their procedure. Twenty-seven out of 42 adduced directly or indirectly SARS-CoV-2 infection-related reasons. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the regular RT delivery to oncologic patients, owing to the delay or cancellation of procedures with the likely effect to observe worsening of local disease control and reduced survival rates in the future.

Although previous work has revealed important interconnections between autophagy and EVP-mediated secretion, our molecular understanding of these secretory events during endolysosome inhibition remains incomplete. Here, we delineate a secretory autophagy pathway upregulated in response to endolysosomal inhibition that mediates the EVP-associated extracellular release of autophagic cargo receptors, including p62/SQSTM1. This extracellular secretion is highly regulated and critically dependent on multiple ATGs required for the progressive steps of early autophagosome formation as well as Rab27a-dependent exocytosis. Furthermore, the disruption of autophagosome maturation, either due to genetic inhibition of the autophagosome-to-autolyosome fusion machinery or blockade via the SARS-CoV2 viral protein ORF3a, is sufficient to induce robust EVP-associated secretion of autophagy cargo receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that this ATG-dependent, EVP-mediated secretion pathway buffers against the intracellular accumulation of autophagy cargo receptors when classical autophagic degradation is impaired. Based on these results, we propose that secretory autophagy via EVPs functions as an alternate route to clear sequestered material and maintain proteostasis in response to endolysosomal dysfunction or impaired autophagosome maturation.","output":"Autophagy cargo receptors are secreted via extracellular vesicles and particles in response to endolysosomal inhibition or impaired autophagosome maturation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To compare the physical characteristics of 3 laser-protected endotracheal tubes (LPETs) commonly used in endoscopic laser surgery. To report potential intraoperative problems related to LPET use and suggest practical solutions. STUDY DESIGN Comparative analysis. SETTING Academic laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Physical characteristics of the Mallinckrodt Laser-Flex (MTL), Medtronic Laser-Shield II (ML-II), and Rusch LaserTubus (RL) were compared. The effect of bending LPETs on airflow resistance was estimated with a pressure transducer. The force required to pull each tube through the glottis and the pressure exerted during this maneuver were measured in a fresh cadaveric human larynx. RESULTS The design features and physical characteristics of LPETs differ, including varying balloon-tip lengths. Bending LPETs to acute angles caused significant pressure increase within the RL tube ( 3.42 cm H2O) and minimal change within the ML-II ( 0.12 cm H2O) and MTL ( 0.21 cm H2O) tubes. The average force required to pull the RL (48.12 g, P = .003) and MTL (282.4 g, P = .001) tubes through the glottis was 7.6 and 44.5 greater than that for the ML-II (6.39 g). When pulled through the vocal folds, the ML-II cuff exerted no detectable pressure, whereas higher pressures were measured for the RL (2.2 cm H2O) and MTL (6.5 cm H2O) tubes. CONCLUSION The ML-II tube had the most favorable characteristics, with minimal pressure during extubation and resistance to kinking. The RL tube kinks readily with a resultant increase in resistance to airflow. The MTL tube extends farther into the trachea due to a relatively elongated balloon-tip configuration. Future LPET designs should incorporate features that avoid intraoperative difficulties related to airway protection and ventilation.","output":"A Comparison of Laser-Protected Endotracheal Tubes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2019-nCoV is a virulent virus belonging to the coronavirus family that caused the new pneumonia (COVID-19) which has spread internationally very rapidly and has become pandemic.

The proposed SIR-Poisson model is able to predict the range of the infected cases in a future period. More precisely, it is used to infer the transmission of the COVID-19 in the three Maghreb Central countries (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco).

The estimated average number of contacts by an infected individual with others was around 2 for Tunisia and 3 for Algeria and Morocco. Relying on inferred scenarios, although the pandemic situation would tend to decline, it has not ended. From this perspective, the risk of COVID-19 spreading still exists after the deconfinement act.

Accordingly, testing is crucial for mitigating the economic and public health effects. In order to facilitate point-of-care diagnosis, this study aims at presenting a label-free electrochemical biosensor as a powerful nanobiodevice for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection. Utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody onto the electrode surface as a specific platform in an ordered orientation through staphylococcal protein A (ProtA) is highly significant in fabricating the designed nanobiodevice. In this sense, the screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O NCs), which provide a large surface area in a very small space, was applied in order to increase the ProtA loading on the electrode surface. Accordingly, the sensitivity and stability of the sensing platform significantly increased. The electrochemical evaluations proved that there is a very good linear relationship between the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and spike protein contents via a specific binding reaction in the range 0.25 fg mL-1 to 1 g mL-1. Moreover, the assay when tested with influenza viruses 1 and 2 was performed in 20 min with a low detection limit of 0.04 fg mL-1 for spike protein without any cross-reactivity. The designed nanobiodevice exhibited an average satisfactory recovery rate of ~ 97-103% in different artificial sample matrices, i.e., saliva, artificial nasal, and universal transport medium (UTM), illustrating its high detection performance and practicability.

However, it reflects the spinal mechanism of immobility rather than the subcortical mechanism of analgesia. Recently, the surgical pleth index (SPI) derived from photoplethysmographic waveform was shown to reflect the intraoperative analgesic component. This study was designed to compare the SPI values produced by equi-MAC of two commonly used volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane. Methods: Seventy-two patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery were randomly assigned to two groups receiving either sevoflurane (n = 36) or desflurane (n = 36). General anesthesia was maintained with the respective volatile anesthetic only. A vaporizer was adjusted to maintain end-tidal anesthetic concentration at age-corrected 1.0 MAC throughout the study period. The SPI value as an analgesic estimate and the bispectral index (BIS) value as a hypnotic estimate were recorded at predefined time points during the standardized surgical procedure. Results: During the steady state of age-corrected 1.0 MAC, mean SPI values throughout the entire study period were significantly higher in the sevoflurane group than in the desflurane group (38.1  12.8 vs. 30.7  8.8, respectively, P = 0.005), and mean BIS values were significantly higher in the sevoflurane group than in the desflurane group (40.7  5.8 vs. 36.8  6.2, respectively, P = 0.008).

ADEM is an uncommon illness in adults, thus the precise incidence is unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: 38 year old female with no prior history besides prior COVID infection 6 months ago, presented with 2 day history of nausea, intractable vomiting, ataxia, confusion, and generalized weakness.Initial MRI brain reported numerous white matter lesions supratentorially and infratentorially. LP demonstrated oligoclonal bands, WBC 14, no xanthochromia. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and received 5 day course of Solumedrol, with no improvement. Her mental status worsened, and she required mechanical ventilation. She later developed rigidity of the neck and lower extremities, with meningeal signs and dystonia. EEG was done for dystonia but no epileptiform activity was captured. The HIV, syphilis Ig G antibody, ANA Ab, HSV and enterovirus PCR were negative. A continuous EEG for 48 hours did not capture any seizure activity.A repeat MRI Brain demonstrted worsening white matter lesions with symmetrical distribution through thalamus, basal ganglia, internal capsule, and brainstem (Figure 1). Spinal MRI revealed no abnormal enhancement. Given the large monophasic infratentorial and supratentorial lesions ADEM was suspected. Patient received IVIG treatment and plasmapheresis, with mild clinical improvement to date. DISCUSSION: ADEM is theorized to be an immunologically mediated demyelinating disease triggered by a febrile illness or recent vaccination, eliciting an inflammatory response affecting the central nervous system. Possible mechanisms may include either molecular mimicry or direct inflammatory damage to myelinated neurons. Radiographically, the T2/FLAIR (MRI) lesions of ADEM are diffuse, asymmetric, often irregular, patchy areas of homogeneous signal hyperintensities often involving both gray and white matter with over half of the cases involving infratentorial structures. ADEM diagnosis remains a challenge and is particularly difficult to differentiate from MS. In contrast to MS, ADEM should be suspected whenever a patient presents with a prodromal viral illness, fever, neck stiffness, ataxia and encephalopathy. Unlike MS, ADEM does not follow a relapsing-remitting course. Treatment involves high dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasmapheresis. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of ADEM entails careful clinical assessment and characteristic imaging findings, as no clear criteria exist. It should be highly suspected in patients with atypical MS.

Abnormalities in pulmonary function after COVID-19 infection have been described. The determinants of these abnormalities are unclear. We hypothesized that inflammatory biomarkers and CT scan parameters at the time of infection would be associated with abnormal gas exchange at short term follow-up. Methods: : We studied subjects who were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and then discharged. Serum inflammatory biomarkers, CT scan, and clinical characteristics were assessed during the hospitalization. CT images were evaluated by Functional Respiratory Imaging with automated tissue segmentation algorithms of the lungs and pulmonary vasculature. Volumes of the pulmonary vessels that were 5mm (BV5), 5-10mm (BV5_10), and 10mm (BV10) in cross sectional area were analyzed. Additionally, the amount of opacification on CT (i.e. ground glass opacities) was quantified in each patient. Pulmonary function tests were performed 2-3 months after discharge. We divided subjects into those with a DLCO <80% predicted (Low DLCO) and those with a DLCO 80% predicted (Normal DLCO) based on these pulmonary function tests. Results: : 38 subjects were included in our analysis. 31 out of 38 (81.6%) subjects had a DLCO<80% predicted. Hemoglobin, inflammatory biomarkers, spirometry and lung volumes were similar between groups. CT opacification and BV5 were not different between groups, but both Low and Normal DLCO groups had lower BV5 measures compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 and BV10 measures were higher in the Low DLCO group compared to the Normal DLCO group. Both BV5_10 and BV10 in the Low DLCO group were greater compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 was independently associated with DLCO<80% in multivariable logistic regression (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01, 1.64). BV10 negatively correlated with DLCO% predicted (r=-0.343, p=0.035). Conclusions: : Low DLCO is common after COVID-19 infection, and abnormalities in pulmonary vascular volumes at the time of hospitalization are independently associated with a low DLCO. There was no relationship between inflammatory biomarkers during hospitalization and DLCO. These findings suggest that pulmonary vascular abnormalities during hospitalization with COVID-19 might have long-lasting effects on pulmonary function.","output":"RE: Association of Abnormal Pulmonary Vasculature on CT Scan for COVID-19 Infection with Decreased Diffusion Capacity in Follow Up: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although high sensitive imaging modalities such as MRI and PSMA PET/CT are becoming available for prostate cancer (PCa), the clinical benefit of an earlier detection of subclinical disease remains yet undetermined.

Therefore, we adopted the LUS-OSAUS tool to assess the competencies of a group of LUS-trained undergraduates. Existing no prior practical applications of the LUS-OSAUS, our aim was to investigate the practical utility of this tool and its applicability in the evaluation of US-trained medical students. METHODS: Eight undergraduates (two males, six females) were enrolled on a voluntary basis to receive a theoretical and practical training in LUS. Once completed their training, each student performed an LUS examination on a different patient hospitalized for respiratory symptoms. The same eight patients were also scanned by a senior resident in emergency medicine for a comparison with students results. Students and the senior resident were tested by an examiner using the LUS-OSAUS tool. We compared the scores obtained by operators in all areas of competence of the LUS-OSAUS, the total scores, and the time needed to complete the sonographic task. RESULTS: Median students score in the single items of the scale was significantly lower than the ones obtained by the senior resident (4.0 [3.3C5.0] vs. 5.0 [5.0C5.0]; p < 0.0001). Students scored significantly lower than the senior resident in each item, except for B-line identification, choice of the correct transducer, and suggested focused questions. Median total score was also lower for students compared to the senior resident (70.5 [61.0C74.8] vs. 84.0 [83.5C84.3] (p = 0.0116). Median time required to complete the examination was significantly higher for students (14.1 [12.8C16.1] vs. 4.7 [3.9C5.2] min, p = 0.0117). CONCLUSIONS: The LUS-OSAUS tool allowed for a standardized and comprehensive assessment of students competencies in lung ultrasound, and helped to discriminate their level of expertise from that of a more experienced operator. The scale also specifically tests the theoretical knowledge of trainees, thus making redundant the use of questionnaires designed for this purpose.

This finding spurred investigation into using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA and track the appearance and spread of COVID-19 in communities. SARS-CoV-2 is present at low levels in wastewater, making sample concentration a prerequisite for sensitive detection and utility in WBE. Whereas common methods for isolating viral genetic material are biased toward intact virus isolation, it is likely that a relatively low percentage of the total SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in wastewater is contained within intact virions. Therefore, we hypothesized that a direct unbiased total nucleic acid extraction method could overcome the cumbersome protocols, variability and low recovery rates associated with the former methods. This led to development of a simple, rapid, and modular alternative to existing purification methods. In an initial concentration step, chaotropic agents are added to raw sewage allowing binding of nucleic acid from free nucleoprotein complexes, partially intact, and intact virions to a silica matrix. The eluted nucleic acid is then purified using manual or semi-automated methods. RT-qPCR enzyme mixes were formulated that demonstrate substantial inhibitor resistance. In addition, multiplexed probe-based RT-qPCR assays detecting the N1, N2 (nucleocapsid) and E (envelope) gene fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were developed. The RT-qPCR assays also contain primers and probes to detect Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), a fecal indicator RNA virus present in wastewater, and an exogenous control RNA to measure effects of RT-qPCR inhibitors. Using this workflow, we monitored wastewater samples from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Dane County, Wisconsin. We also successfully sequenced a subset of samples to ensure compatibility with a SARS-CoV-2 amplicon panel and demonstrated the potential for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection. Data obtained here underscore the potential for wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious agents in communities.","output":"A Direct Capture Method for Purification and Detection of Viral Nucleic Acid Enables Epidemiological Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes, can induce inflammatory programming of macrophages. The macrophage scavenger receptor CD163 internalizes and degrades hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complexes built due to intravascular hemolysis. Clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between impaired scavenging of Hb-Hp complexes via CD163 and diabetic vascular complications. Our aim was to identify whether hyperglycemia is able to amplify inflammation via Hb-Hp complex interactions with the immune system. M(IFN), M(IL-4), and control M0 macrophages were differentiated out of primary human monocytes in normo- (5 mM) and hyperglycemic (25 mM) conditions. CD163 gene expression was decreased 5.53 times in M(IFN) with a further decrease of 1.99 times in hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia suppressed CD163 surface expression in M(IFN) (1.43 times). Flow cytometry demonstrated no impairment of Hb-Hp uptake in hyperglycemia. However, hyperglycemia induced an inflammatory response of M(IFN) to Hb-Hp1-1 and Hb-Hp2-2 uptake with different dynamics. Hb-Hp1-1 uptake stimulated IL-6 release (3.03 times) after 6 h but suppressed secretion (5.78 times) after 24 h. Contrarily, Hb-Hp2-2 uptake did not affect IL-6 release after 6h but increased secretion after 24 h (3.06 times). Our data show that hyperglycemia induces an inflammatory response of innate immune cells to Hb-Hp1-1 and Hb-Hp2-2 uptake, converting the silent Hb-Hp complex clearance that prevents vascular damage into an inflammatory process, hereby increasing the susceptibility of diabetic patients to vascular complications.","output":"Hyperglycemia Induces Inflammatory Response of Human Macrophages to CD163-Mediated Scavenging of Hemoglobin-Haptoglobin Complexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the advent of COVID19, Infection control practices were followed rampantly in all health institutions.

However, traditional methods rely on laborious operations and bulky devices. On the other hand, point-of-care (POC) methods suffer from limited robustness and accuracy. Therefore, it is of urgent demand to develop POC devices for rapid and accurate diagnosis of infections to fulfill on-site militarized requirements. METHODS: We developed a wave-shaped microfluidic chip (WMC) assisted multiplexed detection platform (WMC-MDP). WMC-MDP reduces detection time and improves repeatability through premixing of the samples and reaction of the reagents. We further combined the detection platform with the streptavidinCbiotin (SA-B) amplified system to enhance the sensitivity while using chemiluminescence (CL) intensity as signal readout. We realized simultaneous detection of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on the detection platform and evaluated the sensitivity, linear range, selectivity, and repeatability. Finally, we finished detecting 15 samples from volunteers and compared the results with commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: Detection of CRP, PCT, and IL-6 exhibited good linear relationships between CL intensities and concentrations in the range of 1.25C40 g/ml, 0.4C12.8 ng/ml, and 50C1600 pg/ml, respectively. The limit of detection of CRP, PCT, and IL-6 were 0.54 g/ml, 0.11 ng/ml, and 16.25 pg/ml, respectively. WMC-MDP is capable of good adequate selectivity and repeatability. The whole detection procedure takes only 22 min that meets the requirements of a POC device. Results of 15 samples from volunteers were consistent with the results detected by commercial ELISA kits. CONCLUSIONS: WMC-MDP allows simultaneous, rapid, and sensitive detection of CRP, PCT, and IL-6 with satisfactory selectivity and repeatability, requiring minimal manipulation. However, WMC-MDP takes advantage of being a microfluidic device showing the coefficients of variation less than 10% enabling WMC-MDP to be a type of point-of-care testing (POCT). Therefore, WMC-MDP provides a promising alternative to POCT of multiple biomarkers. We believe the practical application of WMC-MDP in militarized fields will revolutionize infection diagnosis for soldiers.

It is vitally important to accurately pinpoint novel variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in order to understand the molecular features of novel mutations and manage the on-going battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on A105V mutation in the ORF7a accessory protein. Sequencing and clinical data showed that this mutation is associated with increased severity and lethality in a group of Romanian patients, despite a lower viral copy number and a lower number of associated comorbidities. This effect is primarily due to increased protein stability through allosteric effects as shown by molecular dynamics analyses. This behavior manifests especially among residues 39C56, and the ones adjacent to 26C30 loop, placed in direct contact with potential interaction partners. Together, the results provide novel insights into the role of ORF7a in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic follows an unpredictable evolution, driven by both host-related factors such as mobility, vaccination status, and comorbidities and by pathogen-related ones. The pathogenicity of its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 virus, relates to the functions of the proteins synthesized intracellularly, as guided by viral RNA. These functions are constantly altered through mutations resulting in increased virulence, infectivity, and antibody-evasion abilities. Well-characterized mutations in the spike protein, such as D614G, N439K, 69C70, E484K, or N501Y, are currently defining specific variants; however, some less studied mutations outside the spike region, such as p. 3691 in NSP6, p. 9659 in ORF-10, 8782C > T in ORF-1ab, or 28144T > C in ORF-8, have been proposed for altering SARS-CoV-2 virulence and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we focused on A105V mutation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a accessory protein, which has been associated with severe COVID-19 clinical manifestation. Molecular dynamics and computational structural analyses revealed that this mutation differentially alters ORF7a dynamics, suggesting a gain-of-function role that may explain its role in the severe form of COVID-19 disease.","output":"A Conservative Replacement in the Transmembrane Domain of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a as a Putative Risk Factor in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The light turkey syndrome (LTS), in which birds weigh less than their standard breed character at the marketing time, is believed to be a consequence of viral enteritis at an early age (3C5weeks) from which the birds never fully recover. In a previously published study, we collected fecal pools from 2, 3, 5 and 8week old turkey poults (80 pools from LTS farms and 40 from non-LTS farms) and examined them for the presence of astro-, rota-, reo-, and coronaviruses. To determine the presence of additional enteric viruses, we analyzed a fecal pool by Illumina sequencing and found picobirnavirus (PBV). Segments 1 and 2 of this virus shared 45.8%aa and 60.9C64.5%aa identity with genogroup I of human PBV, respectively. Primers based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and capsid genes were designed for detection and molecular characterization of PBVs in the 120 fecal pools described above. From LTS farms, 39 of 80 (48.8%) pools were PBV positive while 23 of 40 (57.5%) were positive from non-LTS farms. The phylogenetic analysis of 15 randomly selected strains divided them into four subgroups within genogroup I (subgroups 1ACD). Nine strains were in subgroup IA showing 69.9C76.4%nt identity with human PBV GI strainVS111 from the Netherlands.

Abnormal liver chemistry tests of varying severities occur in a majority of patients. However, there is a dearth of accompanying liver histologic studies in these patients.

Liver biopsies were analyzed under light microscopy, portions of liver tissue were hybridized with a target probe to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 S gene, and small sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue were processed for electron microscopy. RESULTS: The liver histology of both cases showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with prominent bile duct damage, endotheliitis, and many apoptotic bodies. In situ hybridization and electron microscopy suggest the intrahepatic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the findings of which may indicate the possibility of direct cell injury.

They collated six different datasets collected at different time-periods to conduct the present study. Based on 2,202 observations, they conducted logistic regression analyses to test the proposed relationships. Findings: The authors find that financial literacy reduces the odds of being financially fragile by 9.1%. Furthermore, they find that financially literate consumers having high financial confidence are less financially fragile during COVID-19. Besides, the adverse impact of financial literacy on financial fragility is more for consumers having more than less wealth. The interaction with race is not significant, suggesting that financial literacy cuts across racial boundaries. Practical implications: Financial fragility is an important factor having numerous deleterious consequences. The authors study found that financial confidence, psychological factor and wealth economic factor enhances the negative effect of financial literacy on financial fragility. Banks and financial institutes can develop mechanisms to infuse confidence in individuals during the pandemic to reduce their financial fragility. Policymakers and governments may increase awareness related to debt management practices and design financial literacy interventions to reduce financial fragility among individuals.

Studies were independently evaluated and selected for potential analysis. Five of 35 articles initially selected met the inclusion criteria. An additional Google Scholar search identified some striking statements from relevant authorities or scientists about the difficulty of living with dementia in the era of COVID\\\\19, and were also reported. To summarize, dementia\\\\related behaviours, increased age, and comorbid health conditions may increase the risk of contracting the virus. People with dementia in their own homes may already feel isolated, and additional rules for self\\\\isolation may make this worse. As COVID\\\\19 is spreading worldwide, governments and health authorities should devise better criteria for accessing intensive care units and allocating ventilators. If someone is given preference for medical care, it should be because that person has a better short\\\\term prognosis, not simply because that person is younger than someone else.","output":"Dementia in the era of COVID\\\\19.

Minor swelling at the snakebite site, skeletal muscle, and renal damage, and severe neurological signscharacterize the crotalic envenomation. This case report aims to present epidemiological, clinical, and pathological dataof two cases of Crotalus durissus spp envenomation in dogs in the Northeast of Brazil.Cases: Envenomation by Crotalus durissus spp. was recorded in two dogs in Patos, State of Paraba, Brazil. In Case 1,the dog presented flaccid paralysis, hyporeflexia, a deficit of cranial nerves, epistaxis, and gingival hemorrhages. Laboratory assay showed proteinuria, myoglobinuria, regenerative thrombocytopenia, and increased serum activities of creatinekinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The dogwas medicated with crotalic antivenom and wholly recovered from local and systemic clinical signs. In Case 2, the dogdied and was detected fang marks at the ventral region of the left mandible (two small parallel perforations spaced 2.0 cmapart) at the snakebite site. Cyanosis of the oral cavity, congestion, and hemorrhages in several organs were observed atnecropsy. Tubular nephrosis, muscular necrosis, hepatocytes swelling were observed. The owners witnessed snakebites,and the rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus spp.) identified by the rattle at the end portion of the tail in both cases.Discussion: Natural South American rattlesnake envenomation presents complex clinical signs that makes diagnosis achallenge for veterinary practitioners.

Here, we established an all-in-one cKO system, which enables highly efficient generation of cKO cells and simultaneous gene modifications, including epitope tagging and reporter gene knock-in. We applied this system to mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and generated RNA helicase Ddx1 cKO ESCs. The targeted cells displayed endogenous promoter-driven EGFP and FLAG-tagged DDX1 expression, and they were converted to Ddx1 KO via FLP recombinase. We further established TetFE ESCs, which carried a reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) expression cassette and a tetracycline response element (TRE)-regulated FLPERT2 cassette in the Gt(ROSA26)Sor locus for instant and tightly regulated induction of gene KO. By utilizing TetFE Ddx1F/F ESCs, we isolated highly pure Ddx1F/F and Ddx1-/- ESCs and found that loss of Ddx1 caused rRNA processing defects, thereby activating the ribosome stress-p53 pathway. We also demonstrated cKO of various genes in ESCs and homologous recombination-non-proficient human HT1080 cells. The frequency of cKO clones was remarkably high for both cell types and reached up to 96% when EGFP-positive clones were analyzed. This all-in-one cKO system will be a powerful tool for rapid and precise analyses of gene functions.","output":"A novel all-in-one conditional knockout system uncovered an essential role of DDX1 in ribosomal RNA processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has affected millions of individuals around the world and has posed a significant challenge to global healthcare. From the early days of the pandemic, it became clear that it is highly contagious and that human mobility contributes significantly to its spread. In this paper, we utilize graph representation learning to capitalize on the underlying relationship of population movement with the spread of COVID-19. Specifically, we create a graph where the nodes correspond to a country's regions, the features include the region's history of COVID-19, and the edge weights denote human mobility from one region to another. Subsequently, we employ graph neural networks to predict the number of future cases, encoding the underlying diffusion patterns that govern the spread into our learning model. Furthermore, to account for the limited amount of training data, we capitalize on the pandemic's asynchronous outbreaks across countries and use a model-agnostic meta-learning based method to transfer knowledge from one country's model to another's. We compare the proposed approach against simple baselines and more traditional forecasting techniques in 4 European countries. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the usefulness of GNNs in epidemiological prediction. Transfer learning provides the best model, highlighting its potential to improve the accuracy of the predictions in case of secondary waves, given data from past/parallel outbreaks.","output":"Transfer Graph Neural Networks for Pandemic Forecasting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke, enhanced stroke severity, and other comorbidities. However, AF is often asymptomatic, and frequently remains undiagnosed until complications occur. Current screening approaches for AF lack either cost-effectiveness or diagnostic sensitivity; thus, there is interest in tools that could be used for population screening. An AF risk prediction algorithm, developed using machine learning from a UK dataset of 2,994,837 patients, was found to be more effective than existing models at identifying patients at risk of AF. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of this risk prediction algorithm combined with diagnostic testing for the identification of AF in a real-world primary care setting. Eligible participants (aged 30 years and without an existing AF diagnosis) registered at participating UK general practices will be randomised into intervention and control arms. Intervention arm participants identified at highest risk of developing AF (algorithm risk score  7.4%) will be invited for a 12?lead electrocardiogram (ECG) followed by two-weeks of home-based ECG monitoring with a KardiaMobile device. Control arm participants will be used for comparison and will be managed routinely. The primary outcome is the number of AF diagnoses in the intervention arm compared with the control arm during the research window. If the trial is successful, there is potential for the risk prediction algorithm to be implemented throughout primary care for narrowing the population considered at highest risk for AF who could benefit from more intensive screening for AF.

We estimated prevalence, incidence and persistence of probable mental disorders in a cohort of Spanish healthcare workers (Covid-19 waves 1 and 2) -and identified associated risk factors. METHODS: 8996 healthcare workers evaluated on 5 MayC7 September 2020 (baseline) were invited to a second web-based survey (OctoberCDecember 2020). Major depressive disorder (PHQ-8  10), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7  10), panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-5  7), and alcohol use disorder (CAGE-AID  2) were assessed. Distal (pre-pandemic) and proximal (pandemic) risk factors were included. We estimated the incidence of probable mental disorders (among those without disorders at baseline) and persistence (among those with disorders at baseline). Logistic regression of individual-level [odds ratios (OR)] and population-level (population attributable risk proportions) associations were estimated, adjusting by all distal risk factors, health care centre and time of baseline interview. RESULTS: 4809 healthcare workers participated at four months follow-up (cooperation rate = 65.7%; mean = 120 days s.d. = 22 days from baseline assessment). Follow-up prevalence of any disorder was 41.5%, (v. 45.4% at baseline, p < 0.001); incidence, 19.7% (s.e. = 1.6) and persistence, 67.7% (s.e. = 2.3). Proximal factors showing significant bivariate-adjusted associations with incidence included: work-related factors [prioritising Covid-19 patients (OR = 1.62)], stress factors [personal health-related stress (OR = 1.61)], interpersonal stress (OR = 1.53) and financial factors [significant income loss (OR = 1.37)]. Risk factors associated with persistence were largely similar. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the prevalence of probable mental disorders among Spanish healthcare workers during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was similarly high to that after the first wave. This was in good part due to the persistence of mental disorders detected at the baseline, but with a relevant incidence of about 1 in 5 of HCWs without mental disorders during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Health-related factors, work-related factors and interpersonal stress are important risks of persistence of mental disorders and of incidence of mental disorders. Adequately addressing these factors might have prevented a considerable amount of mental health impact of the pandemic among this vulnerable population. Addressing health-related stress, work-related factors and interpersonal stress might reduce the prevalence of these disorders substantially.

chicken challenged with E. maxima. A total of 576 one-day old male broiler chicks were completely randomized to 8 treatments with 6 replicated cages and 12 birds per cage. The treatment diets consisted of nonchallenge control (NC, corn-SBM based diet), challenge control (CC), 10% rapeseed (10RS), 30% rapeseed (30RS), 20% canola (20CLM), 40% canola (40CLM), 500 ppm AITC (500AITC), and 1,000 ppm AITC (1000AITC). At d 14, all birds were challenged, except NC group, with a subclinical dose of E. maxima. Intestinal permeability was conducted on 5 d post-infection (dpi) and for oocyst shedding 5 to 6 dpi feces were pooled and collected. On 6 dpi, growth performance, lesion score, histomorphology, and gene expression were measured. The growth performance result showed that 10RS and 30RS groups had lower BW, BWG, FI, and higher FCR (P < 0.0001). During the challenge and overall periods, NC group had highest BW, BWG, and FI, and lowest FCR. The inclusion of canola meal showed lower performance during prechallenge period but was able to catch up BWG during challenge period. The AITC levels showed similar growth performance to CC group. Intestinal permeability for 20CLM, 40CLM, 500AITC and 1000AITC was similar to NC group, whereas CC, 10RS, and 30RS had higher permeability compared to NC (P < 0.0001). Oocyst shedding was significantly lower for 40CLM and NC, whereas all other treatments had higher oocyst shedding (P < 0.0001). All the challenged treatment groups had higher lesion score and microscore than NC (P < 0.0001). Histomorphology data showed that jejunum villus height (VH) for 1000AITC was similar to NC group, whereas CC group had the lowest VH (P = 0.01). The 30RS group had lower VH: crypt depth (CD) ratio in the jejunum and ileum. The gene expression at 6 dpi for claudin1, occludin, IL2, IL6, GLUT5, EAAT, B(o)AT, and LAT1 was significantly changed among the treatments. The results suggest that 30RS retards growth performance and deteriorate gut health during coccidiosis and should not be fed to chicken during the starter phase. Canola meal showed decline in growth prechallenge but maintained growth and intestinal health during the challenge period at 40% inclusion. AITC at 1,000 ppm showed similar growth as control group, but with improved gut health during the challenge period. Canola meal could be a good alternative to SBM especially during coccidiosis, whereas AITC needs to be tested vigorously in animal feeding regime.","output":"Influence of Brassica spp. rapeseed and canola meal, and supplementation of bioactive compound (AITC) on growth performance, intestinal-permeability, oocyst shedding, lesion score, histomorphology, and gene expression of broilers challenged with E. maxima"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The propagation of infectious diseases through social interactions can be mitigated when health measures aim to reduce or remove the results of these interactions This is the scenario of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adopted quarantine policies, from social distancing to lockdown, and of immunization programs When a sufficient number of interactions is suppressed, the spread of an infectious disease is ended achieving herd immunity, defined as the indirect protection given by immune individuals to susceptible individuals Here we describe the preliminaries of a stochastic cellular automaton based framework designed to emulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of static individuals interacting only via Moore neighbourhood of radius one, with a view to analyze the impact of initially immune individuals on the dynamics of COVID-19 This impact was measured comparing a progression of initial immunity ratio from 0 to 90% of the population with the number of susceptible individuals not contaminated, the peak value of active cases, the total number of deaths and the emulated pandemic duration in days A herd immunity threshold of 60% was obtained from this procedure, which is in tune with the estimates of the currently available medical literature Nevertheless, more accurate results demand more research efforts including better analysing the model probabilities of propagation and duration ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Preliminaries on a Stochastic Cellular Automaton Based Framework for Studying the Population Dynamics of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to imaging diagnostics has been shown to result in accurate treatment, management, and optimal outcomes. Particularly in low-income and low-middle-income countries (LICs, LMICs), access is limited due to a lack of adequate resources. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, access to imaging services is critical at every tier of the health system. Optimizing imaging services in low-resource settings is best accomplished by prescriptive, integrated, and coordinated tiered service delivery that takes contextual factors into consideration. To our knowledge, this is the first recommendation for optimized, specific imaging care delivery by tier. A model for tier-based essential imaging services informs and guides policymakers as they set priorities and make budgetary decisions. In this paper, we recommend a framework for tiered imaging services essential to reduce the global burden of disease and attain universal health coverage (UHC). A lack of access to basic imaging services, even at the lowest tier of the health system, can no longer be justified by cost. Worldwide, affordable modalities of modern ultrasound and X-ray are becoming an accessible mainstay for the investigation of common conditions such as pregnancy, pneumonia, and fractures, and are safely performed and interpreted by qualified professionals. Finally, given the vast gap in access to imaging resources between LMICs and high-income countries (HICs), a scale-up of tiered imaging services in low-resource settings has the potential to reduce health disparities between, and within countries.

METHODS: Patients aged 18-68 years who had recovered from COVID-19 at least two weeks previously were recruited from March 18, to June 30, 2020 in a study protocol at the Italian hospitals of Pavia and Mantova. RESULTS: During the study period, 494/512 donors recruited were judged eligible and underwent 504 plasmapheresis procedures. Eighty-five percent (437/512) of the CP donors were males. The average time between symptom recovery and CP donation was 36.6 (20.0) days. Four hundred and eighty-eight plasmapheresis procedures (96.8%) were concluded and each unit was divided into two subunits (total 976) with an average volume of 316.2 (22.7) mL. Ninety-three percent (460/494) of CP donors at the time of plasma donation had a neutralizing IgG titer &#8805;1:80. Plasmapheresis-related adverse reactions occurred in 2.6% (13/504) of cases; all the reactions were mild and none required therapeutic intervention.

Policies influence behaviors, and behaviors react spontaneously to information. Further, masks give people a false sense of security and increase mobility. The close public transport policy increased COVID-19 new cases. We also conducted sensitivity analysis and found that some policies hold robustly, such as the policies of school closing, restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home requirements, international travel controls, facial coverings, and vaccination. The counterfactual tests suggest that, as of early March 2021, if governments had mandated masking policies early in the epidemic, the cases and deaths would have been reduced by 18% and 14% separately.

If left unchecked, these outbreaks can easily spill over the prison walls to threaten the general public. Moreover, these risks are heightened by preexisting environmental conditions, especially overcrowding. It is thus paramount to establish effective protocols for prevention, early detection and outbreak management. The purpose of this article is to document a strategy that been at least partially successful in reducing the damage that could potentially be caused by a sustained SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within a correctional facility. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis on patients' and health-care workers' medical records to obtain demographic and clinical information. Descriptive data analysis was then carried out. FINDINGS: In total, the authors tested 453 people with oropharyngeal swabs from March 15, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Of these people, 58 were positive and 395 were negative, with a prevalence of 12.8%.Of the 453 patients, 60 were health workers: 24 tested positive for SARS-CoV2 ribonucleic acid (RNA); 18 developed symptoms; and three needed hospitalization.Among patients in detention, 34 resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two were hospitalized and later died. Both had severe preexisting conditions; they were aged 76 and 59 years old, respectively. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: In this study, the authors describe the design and effective implementation of prevention and containment measures against SARS-CoV-2 within the walls of a correctional facility. The authors describe how they rapidly created clean confinement sections to isolate cases in an environment designed for security at the expense of virus containment and how educational efforts have played a vital role in their strategy.","output":"Locking out the virus: management of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an Italian prison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), represents a pandemic threat to global public health. To date, a530,000 people died of this disease worldwide. Presently, researchers/clinicians are adopting the drug repurposing strategy to combat this disease. It has also been observed that some repurposed anti-viral drugs may serve as potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro, a key component of viral replication. Apart from these anti-viral drugs, recently dexamethasone (an important corticosteroid) is effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients. However, the mechanism behind the mode of its action is not so clear. Additionally, the effect of other well-known corticosteroids to control this disease by inhibiting the proteolytic activity of Mpro is ambiguous. In this study, we have adopted computational approaches to understand these aspects. Six well-known corticosteroids (cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone and dexamethasone) and two repurposed drugs (darunavir and lopinavir) against COVID-19 were subjected for molecular docking studies. Two of them (betamethasone and dexamethasone) were selected by comparing their binding affinities with selected repurposed drugs toward Mpro. Betamethasone and dexamethasone interacted with both the catalytic residues of Mpro (His41 and Cys145). Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that these two Mpro-corticosteroid complexes are more stable, experience less conformational fluctuations and more compact than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complexes. These findings were additionally validated by MM-GBSA analysis. This study provides corroboration for execution of anti-COVID-19 activity of dexamethasone. Our study also emphasizes on the use of another important corticosteroid (betamethasone) as potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Potential therapeutic use of corticosteroids as SARS CoV-2 main protease inhibitors: a computational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper employs a skills-based approach to identify individual and jofactors most likely to be impacted by social distancing measures and practices due to","output":"EU Jobs at Highest Risk of Covid-19 Social Distancing: Will the Pandemic Exacerbate Labour Market Divide?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mediation analysis is difficult when the number of potential mediators is larger than the sample size.

Further, effective therapeutic agents for COVID-19 are limited, and as a result, the identification of potential small molecule antiviral drugs is of particular importance. A critical antiviral target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)), and our aim was to identify lead compounds with potential inhibitory effects. We performed an initial molecular docking screen of 300 small molecules, which included phenolic compounds and fatty acids from our OliveNet? library (224), and an additional group of curated pharmacological and dietary compounds. The prototypical -ketoamide 13b inhibitor was used as a control to guide selection of the top 30 compounds with respect to binding affinity to the M(pro) active site. Further studies and analyses including blind docking were performed to identify hypericin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and SRT2104 as potential leads. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that hypericin (G = -18.6 and -19.3 kcal/mol), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (G = -50.8 and -42.1 kcal/mol), and SRT2104 (G = -8.7 and -20.6 kcal/mol), formed stable interactions with the M(pro) active site. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that, albeit, not as potent as the covalent positive control (GC376), our leads inhibited the M(pro) with activity in the micromolar range, and an order of effectiveness of hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside > SRT2104 > SRT1720.

The recent escalation of genome-wide sequencing (GS) applications in population diagnostics will not only enable the assessment of risks of transmitting well-defined monogenic disorders at preconceptional stages (i.e. carrier screening), but also facilitate identification of multifactorial genetic predispositions to sub-lethal pathologies, including those affecting reproductive fitness. Through GS, the acquisition and curation of reproductive-related findings will warrant the expansion of genetic assessment to new areas of genomic prediction of reproductive phenotypes, pharmacogenomics and molecular embryology, further boosting our knowledge and therapeutic tools for treating infertility and improving women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE In this article, we review current knowledge and potential development of preconception genome analysis aimed at detecting reproductive and individual health risks (recessive genetic disease and medically actionable secondary findings) as well as anticipating specific reproductive outcomes, particularly in the context of IVF. The extension of reproductive genetic risk assessment to the general population and IVF couples will lead to the identification of couples who carry recessive mutations, as well as sub-lethal conditions prior to conception. This approach will provide increased reproductive autonomy to couples, particularly in those cases where preimplantation genetic testing is an available option to avoid the transmission of undesirable conditions. In addition, GS on prospective infertility patients will enable genome-wide association studies specific for infertility phenotypes such as predisposition to premature ovarian failure, increased risk of aneuploidies, complete oocyte immaturity or blastocyst development failure, thus empowering the development of true reproductive precision medicine. SEARCH METHODS Searches of the literature on PubMed Central included combinations of the following MeSH terms: human, genetics, genomics, variants, male, female, fertility, next generation sequencing, genome exome sequencing, expanded carrier screening, secondary findings, pharmacogenomics, controlled ovarian stimulation, preconception, genetics, genome-wide association studies, GWAS. OUTCOMES Through PubMed Central queries, we identified a total of 1409 articles. The full list of articles was assessed for date of publication, limiting the search to studies published within the last 15 years (2004 onwards due to escalating research output of next-generation sequencing studies from that date). The remaining articles' titles were assessed for pertinence to the topic, leaving a total of 644 articles. The use of preconception GS has the potential to identify inheritable genetic conditions concealed in the genome of around 4% of couples looking to conceive. Genomic information during reproductive age will also be useful to anticipate late-onset medically actionable conditions with strong genetic background in around 2-4% of all individuals. Genetic variants correlated with differential response to pharmaceutical treatment in IVF, and clear genotype-phenotype associations are found for aberrant sperm types, oocyte maturation, fertilization or pre- and post-implantation embryonic development. All currently known capabilities of GS at the preconception stage are reviewed along with persisting and forthcoming barriers for the implementation of precise reproductive medicine. WIDER IMPLICATIONS The expansion of sequencing analysis to additional monogenic and polygenic traits may enable the development of cost-effective preconception tests capable of identifying underlying genetic causes of infertility, which have been defined as 'unexplained' until now, thus leading to the development of a true personalized genomic medicine framework in reproductive health.","output":"Preconception genome medicine: current state and future perspectives to improve infertility diagnosis and reproductive and health outcomes based on individual genomic data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a known complication of COVID-19. It may have a different pathogenesis and worse outcome compared to stroke in patients without COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 and out-of-hospital stroke onset might have different characteristics compared to patients with COVID-19 and in-hospital stroke onset. The aim of our study was to analyze the characteristics of patients with stroke with and without COVID-19 and of patients with COVID-19 with in-hospital and out-of-hospital stroke. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to our hospital with ischemic stroke between October 2020 and February 2021. We compared functional outcome, lab test, demographic, and clinical characteristics between patients with or without COVID-19. We performed a sub-analysis comparing patients with COVID-19 and in-hospital and out-of-hospital stroke onset. RESULTS: We included in the final analysis 137 patients of whom 26 with COVID-19. Half (13) had out-of-hospital stroke and half in-hospital stroke onset. Overall, patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality compared to the control group (27% vs 9%, p: 0.02), and non-significantly lower rate of good functional outcome (50% vs 63%, p: 0.22). Patients with COVID-19 and out-of-hospital stroke had higher rate of good functional outcome (69% vs 39%, p: 0.05), higher lymphocyte count, and lower D-dimer compared with patients with in-hospital stroke onset. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stroke and COVID-19 had higher mortality compared to patients without COVID-19. Among patients with COVID-19 those with out-of-hospital stroke had better outcome and fewer blood test abnormalities compared to patients with in-hospital stroke.

OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in mortality rates after hospitalization for nonCSARS-CoV-2 conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and how mortality varies by characteristics of the admission and hospital. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study from January 2019 through September 2021 using 100% of national Medicare claims, including 4626 US hospitals. Participants included 8 448 758 individuals with nonCCOVID-19 medical admissions with fee-for-service Medicare insurance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome was mortality in the 30 days after admission with adjusted odds generated from a 3-level (admission, hospital, and county) logistic regression model that included diagnosis, demographic variables, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, and hospital prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: There were 8 448 758 nonCSARS-CoV-2 medical admissions in 2019 and from April 2020 to September 2021 (mean [SD] age, 73.66 [12.88] years; 52.82% women; 821 569 [11.87%] Black, 438 453 [6.34%] Hispanic, 5 351 956 [77.35%] White, and 307 218 [4.44%] categorized as other). Mortality in the 30 days after admission increased from 9.43% in 2019 to 11.48% from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021 (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.19-1.21) in multilevel logistic regression analyses including admission and hospital characteristics. The increase in mortality was maintained throughout the first 18 months of the pandemic and varied by race and ethnicity (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.23-1.30 for Black enrollees; OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.27 for Hispanic enrollees; and OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.17-1.19 for White enrollees); Medicaid eligibility (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.24-1.27 for Medicaid eligible vs OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.16-1.18 for noneligible); and hospital quality score, measured on a scale of 1 to 5 stars with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.22-1.31 for 1 star vs OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08-1.15 for 5 stars). Greater hospital prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with greater increases in odds of death from the prepandemic period to the pandemic period; for example, comparing mortality in October through December 2020 with October through December 2019, the OR was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.39-1.49) for hospitals in the top quartile of SARS-CoV-2 admissions vs an OR of 1.19 (95% CI, 1.16-1.22) for admissions to hospitals in the lowest quartile. This association was mostly limited to admissions with high-severity diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The prolonged elevation in mortality rates after hospital admission in 2020 and 2021 for nonCSARS-CoV-2 diagnoses contrasts with reports of improvement in hospital mortality during 2020 for SARS-CoV-2. The results of this cohort study suggest that, with the continued impact of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to implement interventions to improve access to high-quality hospital care for those with nonCSARS-CoV-2 diseases.","output":"Hospitalizations and Mortality From NonCSARS-CoV-2 Causes Among Medicare Beneficiaries at US Hospitals During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the status of health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic in China and to evaluate the regional difference of telehealth.

When the mice received a boosting vaccine injection, anamnestic response was observed in the groups of adjuvanted vaccine. Furthermore, the secretion of cytokines in splenocytes, such as interferon (IFN)-, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-10, was significantly enhanced after adjuvantation of S-protein vaccine with SQ@NP; however, this was not the case for the vaccine adjuvanted with conventional aluminum mineral salts.

This study aims to understand the role of subjective probabilistic inference in updating information for decision-making procedures under uncertainty. We show that adding uncertainty of trade-offs in decision-making criteria induces more inconsistent present preferences. We find that subjective probabilistic inference results in different levels of information acquisition, which plays a central role in many everyday cases of forecasting. The result of forecasting exerts substantive constraints on cognitive processes and shapes a type of restriction or stimulus in decision-making procedures. As uncertainty increases, generated fear of losses turns into an obstacle to the information acquisition process, and especially participants with low probabilistic inference tend to overestimate or underestimate future unknown rewards. In addition, our experiment shows that risk preference does not play a key role in decision-making procedures under unknown uncertainty. This finding is an experimental manifestation of Knights argument (Risk, uncertainty, and profit, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1921), which explains unknown uncertainty, and shows the relationship between cognitive ability and time inconsistency.

Features of this newly recognized condition may include fever, hypotension, severe abdominal pain and cardiac dysfunction, evidence of inflammation, and single or multi organ dysfunction in the absence of other known infections.

Fatigue tests were performed by stimulating the muscles with a series of tetanic trains. Our results show that a substantial sustained force gradually develops during the fatigue test. This sustained force persists after peak tetanic forces have declined to a fraction of their initial magnitude. The observed sustained force during in situ fatigue tests is consistent with the courtship behaviour of these lizards and probably reflects physiological specialization. The results of molecular analysis reveal that the jaw muscles contain masticatory and tonic myosin fibres.

After the third flat period, the number of daily newly diagnosed cases predicted by the model began to increase around December 1, 2021, and reached a peak in December, and the number of cases will drop to a very low level after May 2022. According to our research results, due to the large number of asymptomatic infections, the spread of the epidemic is not easy to stop completely in a short time. However, when the epidemic enters a period of flat time, nucleic acid testing is performed, and asymptomatic infections are isolated at home for 14 days (the recovery period of symptomatic infection is about 10 days) may be an option that can be considered to interrupt the transmission of the case.","output":"Dynamic analysis and evaluation of asymptomatic infection in the spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has placed a significant burden on the healthcare system, making it necessary to implement new tools that allow patients to be monitored remotely and guarantee quality and continuity of care.

ObjectiveTo characterize COVID-19 symptoms during the Omicron period compared to pre-Delta and Delta variant periods and assess the duration of COVID-19 BinaxNOW rapid antigen test positivity during the Omicron variant surge. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis public health surveillance study was undertaken between January 2021-January 2022, at a walk-up community COVID-19 testing site in San Francisco, California. Testing with BinaxNOW rapid antigen tests was available regardless of age, vaccine status, or symptoms throughout. Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe characterized the prevalence of specific symptoms for people with a positive BinaxNOW test during the Omicron period and compared it to the pre-Delta and Delta periods. During the Omicron period, we examined differences in symptoms by age and vaccine status. Among people returning for repeat testing during Omicron period, we estimated the proportion with a positive BinaxNOW antigen test between 4-14 days from symptom onset or since first positive test if asymptomatic. ResultsOf 63,277 persons tested, 18,301 (30%) reported symptoms and 4,568 (25%) tested positive for COVID-19. During the Omicron period, 41.6% (3032/7283) of symptomatic testers tested positive, and the proportion reporting cough (67.4%) and sore throat (43.4%) was higher than during Delta and pre-Delta periods. Congestion was higher during Omicron (38.8%) than during the pre-Delta period and loss of taste/smell (5.3%) and fever (30.4%) were less common. Fevers and myalgias were less common among persons who had received boosters compared to unvaccinated people or those who received the primary series. Five days after symptom onset, 31.1% of people with COVID-19 stated their symptoms were similar or worsening. An estimated 80.2% of symptomatic re-testers remained positive five days after symptom onset and 60.5% after ten days. Conclusions and RelevanceCOVID-19 upper respiratory tract symptoms were more commonly reported during the Omicron period compared to pre-Delta and Delta periods, with differences by vaccination status. Antigen test positivity remained high after 5 days, supporting guidelines requiring a negative test to shorten the isolation period. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDuring the Omicron period, are there differences in COVID-19 symptomatology compared to the pre-Delta and Delta periods and how long do rapid antigen tests remain positive? FindingsIn this community-based surveillance study we detected differences in symptomatology between the Omicron period and prior variant-periods, and by age and vaccination status. Five days after symptom onset, 80% remained positive with a BinaxNOW test. MeaningDuring the Omicron period, differences in symptomatology may be due to rising population immunity and a new variant.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: 32 patients with subacute thyroiditis with insufficient result from NSAIDs treatment were randomly divided into two groups. The 1st group received two intrathyroid steroid injections, the 2nd group received oral prednisone. The results of the treatment were evaluated via ultrasound and evaluation of ESR and CRP at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. RESULTS Results: Patients of the 1st group showed much faster result at the ultrasound compared to the 2nd group: mean decrease in hypoechogenity area 44,42% vs 16,35% at week 2, p < 0,001; 93,29% vs 75,98% at week 4, p < 0,001; 97,8% vs 95,24% at week 8, p = 0,4; mean decrease in ESR 66,34% vs 51,92% at week 2, p = 0,023; 84,43% vs 74,94% at week 4, p = 0,023; mean decrease in CRP 26,53% vs 20,77% at week 2, p = 0,024, 33,77% vs 29,98%, at week 4, p = 0,026.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional population-based online survey. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in 22 provinces of the DRC. Five provinces with a satisfactory number of respondents were included in the analysis: Haut Katanga, Kasa?-Central, Kasa?-Oriental, Kinshasa and North Kivu. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were people aged 18 years, living in the DRC. A total of 3268 participants were included in the study analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Both convenience sampling (surveyors themselves contacted potential participants in different districts) and snowball sampling (the participants were requested to share the link of the questionnaire with their contacts) methods were used. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We computed adherence scores using responses to 10 questions concerning COVID-19 preventive measures recommended by the WHO and the DRC Ministry of Health. We used logistic regression analysis with generalised estimating equations to identify factors of poor adherence. We also asked about the presence or absence of flu-like symptoms during the preceding 14 days, whether a COVID-19 test was done and the test result. RESULTS: Data from 3268 participants were analysed. Face masks were not used by 1789 (54.7%) participants. Non-adherence to physical distancing was reported by 1364 (41.7%) participants. 501 (15.3%) participants did not observe regular handwashing. Five variables were associated with poor adherence: lower education level, living with other people at home, being jobless/students, living with a partner and not being a healthcare worker. CONCLUSION: Despite compulsory restrictions imposed by the government, only about half of the respondents adhered to COVID-19 preventive measures in the DRC. Disparities across the provinces are remarkable.

METHODS Elite kayak rowers (10 men and 7 women) were supplemented with either 80 mgkg body massd of -alanine or placebo for 8 wk. Muscular fatigue development was investigated by applying a 2-min elbow flexor maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). EMG was recorded continuously, and voluntary activation was determined 30, 60, 90, and 115 s into the 2-min MVC. In addition, performance was evaluated as 1000-m and 5  250-m kayak ergometer rowing. RESULTS Force reduction during the 2-min MVC was similar before and after supplementation with -alanine (30.9%  10.3% vs 36.0%  14.1%) and placebo (35.5%  7.7% vs 35.1%  8.0%). No time effect was apparent in voluntary activation during the 2-min MVC. In addition, there was no detectable effect of -alanine supplementation on 1000-m kayak ergometer performance (-alanine: 0.26%  0.02% vs placebo: -0.18%  0.02%) or accumulated 5  250-m time (-alanine: -1.0%  0.3% vs placebo: -1.0%  0.2%).

Factors such as surgical technique or mesh features are thought to be highly influent. The aim was to evaluate the impact of the defect size, the mesh overlap and the fixation depth on VHR using both physical and numerical models. METHODS The physical model was developed to mimic a passive abdominal wall. Healthy, damaged, and repaired configurations were evaluated using a spherical plunger. The associated numerical (Finite Elements) model was first loaded by a plunger for validation. A parametric study was then conducted with the numerical model loaded by a uniform pressure. Two defect sizes (3.5  5 cm and 8.25  12 cm elliptic shape), two overlaps (2 and 5 cm), and two fixation depths (peritoneum or muscle) were investigated for both passive and active abdominal walls. RESULTS With the physical model, the repaired configuration was 22 % stiffer than the damaged configuration. The statistical analysis of the parametric study showed that the defect size was the most influential parameter regarding the stress in the mesh, the bulging and the pull-out force at the fixation points. The overlap was influential in terms of stress in the mesh. The fixation depth was not influential. These trends increased with the abdominal wall activity. CONCLUSION Increase of the defect size and decrease of the overlap affected significantly the VHR mechanical performances. Such numerical models could help to better understand the behavior of the repaired abdominal wall and finally to reduce the clinical complications.","output":"Impact of the defect size, the mesh overlap and the fixation depth on ventral hernia repairs: a combined experimental and numerical approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Women with substance use disorders (SUD) receive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with behavioral interventions and counseling for recovery. Evidence supports the use of yoga for SUD; however few studies specifically feature women. OBJECTIVES: Community-based yoga may add to health promotion through preferable physical activity for women in recovery. The aims of this study are to explore demographics and quantitative measures relevant to recovery and capture and understand the subjective experience of one session of yoga. STUDY DESIGN: The study design involves Descriptive/Cross-sectional. METHODOLOGY: Women in an inpatient SUD center attending weekly optional off-site yoga for recovery were recruited to capture first-time attendance. Survey data included Medical Outcomes Survey 12-item short-form (SF-12), Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), demographics, and narrative reflections. Recruitment opportunities occurred weekly during ongoing hour-long classes. RESULTS: Twenty-nine women (average age 36.6) with primarily opiate-based addictions completed surveys. SF-12 was below the normative value of 50 for both subscales. BRS scores showed averages on the low end of normal resiliency. The frequency of responses to writing prompts confirmed physical and mental well-being through yoga intervention. Women shared potential relapse prevention specifically attributed to the mindfulness component of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The SF-12, BRS, and TMS are brief, valid, and reliable and can be easily incorporated in clinical practice or future research. Suboptimal SF-12 scores were found in women with SUD and, therefore important to note in the context of recovery to optimize treatment.

Despite non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distance, mask-wearing, and restrictive lockdown, the daily confirmed cases remain growing. Vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna, and Gamaleya Institute reach more than 90% efficacy and sustain the vaccination campaigns in multiple countries. However, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but the new SARS-CoV-2 variants demand to inquire if the vaccines will be highly protective or induce permanent immunity. Further, in the first quarter of 2021, vaccine supply is scarce. Consequently, some countries that are applying the Pfizer vaccine will delay its second required dose. Likewise, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. Therefore, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Following some of the WHO-SAGE recommendations, we formulate an optimal control problem with mixed constraints to describe vaccination schedules. Our solution identifies vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. These optimal policies ensure the vaccination coverage of a prescribed population fraction in a given time horizon and preserve hospitalization occupancy below a risk level. We explore \\"via simulation\\" plausible scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced, and natural immunity.

The COVID-19 pandemic reduced theatre capacity and caused a delay to CTEV patients treatment. A new standard operating procedure that allowed the tenotomies to be performed under local anaesthetic in the clinic was introduced. This study was looking into the safety, feasibility and parents perspective of this procedure. METHODS: The study was prospectively registered as a service improvement project and followed the SQUIRE guidelines (Ogrinc et al. in BMJ Qual Saf 25:986C992, 2016). All consecutive patients requiring a tenotomy were included. Data was collected prospectively including demographics, Pirani score and a carers satisfaction questionnaire.

Longer-term effects of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 are unknown. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 beyond day 28 and its impact on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance and antibody response in COVACTA were investigated. METHODS: Adults in Europe and North America hospitalised with COVID-19 (N = 452) between April 3, 2020 and May 28, 2020 were randomly assigned (2:1) to double-blind intravenous tocilizumab or placebo and assessed for efficacy and safety through day 60. Assessments included mortality, time to hospital discharge, SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasopharyngeal swab and serum samples, and neutralising anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04320615. FINDINGS: By day 60, 245% (72/294) of patients in the tocilizumab arm and 250% (36/144) in the placebo arm died (weighted difference C05% [95% CI C91 to 80]), and 670% (197/294) in the tocilizumab arm and 639% (92/144) in the placebo arm were discharged from the hospital.

In this extraordinary research context of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, publishers are announcing that their coronavirus-related articles will be made immediately accessible in appropriate open repositories, like PubMed Central, agreeing upon funders' and researchers' instigation. Methods: This work uses Unpaywall, OpenRefine and PubMed to analyse the level of openness of articles about COVID-19, published during the first quarter of 2020. It also analyses Open Access (OA) articles published about previous coronavirus (SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV) as a means of comparison. Results: A total of 5,611 COVID-19-related articles were analysed from PubMed. This is a much higher amount for a period of 4 months compared to those found for SARS CoV-1 and MERS during the first year of their first outbreaks (335 and 116 articles, respectively). Regarding the levels of openness, 88.8% of the SARS CoV-2 papers are freely available; similar rates were found for the other coronaviruses. Deeper analysis showed that (i) 67.4% of articles belong to an undefined Bronze category; (ii) 76.4% of all OA papers don't carry any license, followed by 10.4% which display restricted licensing.

The four trajectories: stable-low, (no probable diagnosis), stable-high (stable probable diagnosis), exacerbation (no probable diagnosis at T1, probable diagnosis at T2), recovery (probable diagnosis at T1, no probable diagnosis at T2).ResultsThree anxiety trajectories predicted probable somatic symptoms (stable-high OR=6.451;exacerbation OR=5.379;recovery OR=2.025) compared with the stable-low trajectory.

Host immune response is a key factor determining disease severity of influenza infection, presenting an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for treatments. Among the multiple signal transduction pathways regulating the host immune activation and function in response to IAV infections, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are important signalling axes, downstream of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), activated by IAVs that regulate various cellular processes in immune cells of both innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, aberrant MAPK activation underpins overexuberant production of inflammatory mediators, promoting the development of the cytokine storm, a characteristic of severe respiratory viral diseases. Therefore, elucidation of the regulatory roles of MAPK in immune responses against IAVs is not only essential for understanding the pathogenesis of severe influenza, but also critical for developing MAPK-dependent therapies for treatment of respiratory viral diseases. In this review, we will summarise the current understanding of MAPK functions in both innate and adaptive immune response against IAVs and discuss their contributions towards the cytokine storm caused by highly pathogenic influenza viruses.","output":"Regulation of Host Immune Responses against Influenza A Virus Infection by Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background AlloDerm Ready To Use (RTU) is a sterile version of AlloDerm regenerative tissue matrix, developed in response to concerns regarding the potential risk of infectious complications with the latter aseptic matrix.

Methods Consecutive patients who underwent tissue-expander/implant reconstruction with the use of AlloDerm RTU from March 2011 to September 2012 were included in this analysis. Biopsies of AlloDerm RTU/capsule interface were obtained at the time of expander/implant exchange and evaluated for evidence of cellularization, vascularization, and inflammatory reaction. Data on postoperative complications were retrieved from patient records. Results A total of 116 biopsy specimens from 68 patients were obtained. At biopsy, on visual inspection, nearly all grafts were fully integrated within the host tissue. Histologically, graft specimens demonstrated mild-to-moderate neovascularization and cellular repopulation with no inflammatory cells. All patients were followed for 5 years postoperatively. Short-term postoperative complications of skin necrosis, seroma, and infection occurred in 10.3%, 4.3%, and 2.6% of reconstructions, respectively.

Plus-strand (+)RNA viruses have limited coding potential necessitating that they co-opt an unknown number of host factors to facilitate their replication in host cells. Global genomics and proteomics approaches performed with Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model host have led to the identification of 250 host factors affecting TBSV RNA replication and recombination or bound to the viral replicase, replication proteins, or the viral RNA. The roles of a dozen host factors involved in various steps of the replication process have been validated in yeast as well as a plant host. Altogether, the large number of host factors identified and the great variety of cellular functions performed by these factors indicate the existence of a truly complex interaction between TBSV and the host cell. This review summarizes the advantages of using a simple plant virus and yeast as a model host to advance our understanding of virusChost interactions at the molecular and cellular levels. The knowledge of host factors gained can potentially be used to inhibit virus replication via gene silencing, expression of dominant negative mutants, or design of specific chemical inhibitors leading to novel specific or broad-range resistance and antiviral tools against (+)RNA plant viruses.","output":"Chapter 4 Global Genomics and Proteomics Approaches to Identify Host Factors as Targets to Induce Resistance Against Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Von Ebners glands of the rat are minor salivary serous glands in the posterior portion of the tongue.

In this investigation, circadian rhythm in feeding was established under a normal 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with the rats eating primarily during the dark period. At lights on, the size of the acinar cells and the area of the inclusive secretory granules, and the amount of digestive enzyme activity (lingual lipase and amylase) remaining in the gland was significantly less than in the mid-afternoon, after very little daylight food consumption. However, after 7 days of continuous light the circadian rhythm was altered: the food consumption during the normal night-time hours (5 p.m. to 8 a.m.) went from 88% of total 24 h food consumption to 45%, and during normal daylight hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) from 12% to 55%. These changes were correlated with histometric findings of a near reversal of the areas of acinar cells and secretory granules of a.m. and p.m. samples under continuous light. Lingual lipase activity in the glands went from 35% under 12 h light to 61% under continuous light in the a.m. and from 65% to 39% in the p.m. Amylase activity also showed nearly a reversal in activity remaining in the gland, from 36% at 12 h light to 58% at 24 h light in the a.m. and 64% to 41% for the p.m. samples.

METHODS: During 1C19 May 2020, 2 testing strategies were implemented in 12 tiers or housing units of the Cook County Jail, Chicago, Illinois. Detained persons were approached to participate in serial testing (n = 137) and offered tests at 3 time points over 14 days (day 1, days 3C5, and days 13C14). The second group was offered a single test and interview at the end of a 14-day quarantine period (day 14 group) (n = 87). RESULTS: 224 detained persons were approached for participation and, of these, 194 (87%) participated in 1 interview and 172 (77%) had 1 test. Of the 172 tested, 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the serial testing group, 17 (89%) new cases were detected, 16 (84%) on day 1, 1 (5%) on days 3C5, and none on days 13C14; in the day 14 group, 2 (11%) cases were identified. More than half (12/19; 63%) of the newly identified cases were presymptomatic or asymptomatic.

This can greatly reduce the amount of starting clinical materials for a systematic screening of CD8(+) T cell epitopes. In addition, this greatly enhanced capacity enables the incorporation of irrelevant epitopes for determining the non-specific killing activity of CD8(+) T cells, thereby allowing to measure the actual epitope-specific cytotoxicity activities.

Besides, our results from human PBMCs and three independent infectious animal models (MERS, influenza and malaria) further reveal that IFN expression by epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells does not always correlate with their cell-killing potential, highlighting the need for using cytotoxicity assays in specific contexts (e.g., evaluating vaccine candidates).

Herein, thein silicointeraction of main licorice components against SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed in order to introduce promising antiviral phytochemicals. A set of 56 licorice compounds was subjected to high throughput virtual ligand screening using the spike receptor-binding domain, main protease, papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or endoribonuclease non-structural protein, as well as human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, as antiviral targets. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) based on the docking energy, along with absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) parameters, was considered for the selection of the most suitable compounds. Six licorice components, including two triterpenoids (glycyrrhizic acid and licorice saponin C2) and four flavonoids (liquiritin apioside, glucoliquiritin apioside, glucoliquiritin, and glyasperin A), were finally obtained as acceptable ligands. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with the results of binding free energy confirmed the stable fitting of the screened compounds into the active site of the selected targets, suggesting glycyrrhizic acid to have the highest affinity to all targets. Moreover, the binding mode and the key amino acids interacting with the licorice compounds in each target after the MD simulation were considered. The results suggest licorice as a promising substance to be further investigated in experimental models in SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing its therapeutic effect to be, at least in part, due to antiviral properties. Glycyrrhizic acid, already considered as a licorice major active ingredient, seems to have a significant role in antiviral effects.

This paper treats mainstream news about the current pandemic as a valuable entry point for analyzing the relationship between science and politics in the public sphere, where the outbreak must be both understood and confronted through appropriate public-health policy decisions. In doing so, the paper aims to examine which actors, institutions, and experts dominate the SARS-CoV-2 media narratives, with particular attention to the roles of political, medical, and scientific actors and institutions within the pandemic crisis. The study relies on a large dataset consisting of all SARS-CoV-2 articles published by eight major Italian national newspapers between January 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020. These articles underwent a quantitative analysis based on a topic modeling technique. The topic modeling outputs were further analyzed by innovatively combining ad-hoc metrics and a classifier based on the stacking ensemble method (combining regularized logistic regression and linear stochastic gradient descent) for quantifying scientific salience. This enabled the identification of relevant topics and the analysis of the roles that different actors and institutions engaged in making sense of the pandemic. The results show how the health emergency has been addressed primarily in terms of political regulation and concerns and only marginally as a scientific matter. Hence, science has been overwhelmed by politics, which, in media narratives, exerts a moral as well as regulatory authority. Media narratives exclude neither scientific issues nor scientific experts; rather, they configure them as a subsidiary body of knowledge and expertise to be mobilized as an ancillary, impersonal institution useful for legitimizing the expansion of political jurisdiction over the governance of the emergency.","output":"Politics overwhelms science in the Covid-19 pandemic: Evidence from the whole coverage of the Italian quality newspapers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy (LAPG) with esophagogastrostomy using the double-flap technique has been reported to rarely cause gastroesophageal reflux. However, quantitative evaluation of the reflux has hardly been performed. The aim of this study was to clarify the superiority of the double-flap technique of LAPG with esophagogastrostomy compared with the OrVil technique in terms of preventing gastroesophageal reflux. METHODS A total of 40 and 51 patients who underwent LAPG with esophagogastrostomy using the double-flap and OrVil techniques, respectively, for upper one-third gastric cancer were included in this study. Of these, 22 and 13 patients in the double-flap and OrVil groups, respectively, consented to undergo a 24-h impedance-pH monitoring test at 3 months postoperatively. Postoperative complications, including gastroesophageal reflux and anastomotic stricture, were assessed retrospectively. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in the patients' background between both groups, except for a higher D1+ dissection rate observed in double-flap group than in the OrVil group (93% vs 25%, P < 0.001). Operative time was significantly longer in the double-flap group than in the OrVil group (353 min vs 280 min, P < 0.001).

DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the CINAHL for relevant articles was performed. Studies examining measures of both the innate and the adaptive immune system in adult CNCP patients in L-TOT (4 weeks of intake) were included. Outcomes and the level of evidence were analyzed. RESULTS Three-hundred-eighty-two studies were identified; however, 376 were excluded (352 inappropriate methodology, 21 duplicates, 3 full-text could not be obtained) and one RCT and five cross-sectional studies were included and analyzed. L-TOT compared with no treatment was associated with a lower percentage of NK cells, a lower absolute number of CD56bright NK cells, a higher absolute number of IL-2 activated NK cells and a higher concentration of IL-1 as a response to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists stimulation (Pam3CSK4, LPS, Imiquimod). No other significant differences were reported. Generalizability of the results was limited due to inconsistency of outcomes and an overall low quality of the studies.

Serological surveys have shown that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus that infects all children by the age of 5C10 years and has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years. hMPV is a member of the Metapneumovirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family, a group of negative-stranded RNA viruses.

Based on numerical simulations, this study used statistical data for the empirical validation of its theoretical deductions and discussed how to improve the effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control considering population migration variables. Statistics regarding the numbers of infected people in various provinces were obtained from the epidemic-related data reported by Chinas National Health Commission.

Epidemic prevention and control should focus on regions with better economic conditions than the epidemic region. Prevention and control efforts should focus on the more populated neighboring provinces having convenient transportation links with the epidemic region. To prevent and control epidemic spread, priority should be given to elucidating the destinations and directions of population migration from the domestic origin of infections, and then stemming population migration or human-to-human contact after such migration.

Areas addressed include a brief history of the COVID-19 viral pandemic, a description of the virus, the regulatory response to the pandemic, the screening of employees, the persistence on inanimate surfaces, cleaning and disinfection of manufacturing facilities, use of GMP-mandated personal protective equipment to counter the spread of the disease, the role of air changes in viral clearance, approaches to risk assessment and mitigation. Biological medicinal products have a great record of safety, yet the cell cultures used for production can be susceptible to viruses, and contamination events have occurred. Studies on SARS-CoV-1 for its ability to replicate in various mammalian cell lines used for biopharmaceutical manufacturing suggest SARS-CoV-2 poses low risk and any contamination would be detected by currently used adventitious virus testing. The consequences of the potential virus exposure of manufacturing processes, as well as the effectiveness of mitigation efforts are discussed. The pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, traversing many geographies and companies that range from large multinationals to mid and small size operations.

Neutrophils are involved in the development of sepsis due to their essential role in host defense. COVID-19 is a viral sepsis. Disfunction of neutrophils in sepsis has been described in previous studies, however, little is known about the role of microRNA-let-7b (miR-let-7b), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) activity in neutrophils and how they participate in the development of sepsis. In this study, we investigated the regulatory pathway of miR-let-7b/TLR4/NF-&#954;B in neutrophils. We also explored the downstream cytokines released by neutrophils following miR-let-7b treatment and its therapeutic effects in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic mice. Six-to-eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice underwent CLP following treatment with miR-let-7b agomir. Survival (n=10), changes in liver and lungs histopathology (n=4), circulating neutrophil counts (n=4), the liver-body weight ratio (n=4-7), and the lung wet-to-dry ratio (n=5-6) were recorded. We found that overexpression of miR-let-7b could significantly down-regulate the expression of human-derived neutrophilic TLR4 at a post-transcriptional level, a decreased level of proinflammatory factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), and an upregulation of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in vitro. After miR-let-7b agomir treatment in vivo, neutrophil recruitment was inhibited and thus the injuries of liver and lungs in CLP-induced septic mice were alleviated (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively), less weight loss was reduced, and survival in septic mice was also significantly improved (p=0.013).

OBJECTIVE: To describe typical imaging findings in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, imaging studies and clinical data from children treated for multisystem inflammatory syndrome were collected from multiple centres. Standardised case templates including demographic, biochemical and imaging information were completed by participating centres and reviewed by paediatric radiologists and paediatricians. RESULTS: We included 37 children (21 boys; median age 8.0 years). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 15/37 (41%) children and immunoglobulins in 13/19 children (68%). Common clinical presentations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (68%), rash (54%), conjunctivitis (38%) and cough (32%). Thirty-three children (89%) showed laboratory or imaging findings of cardiac involvement. Thirty of the 37 children (81%) required admission to the intensive care unit, with good recovery in all cases. Chest radiographs demonstrated cardiomegaly in 54% and signs of pulmonary venous hypertension/congestion in 73%. The most common chest CT abnormalities were ground-glass and interstitial opacities (83%), airspace consolidation (58%), pleural effusion (58%) and bronchial wall thickening (42%). Echocardiography revealed impaired cardiac function in half of cases (51%) and coronary artery abnormalities in 14%. Cardiac MRI showed myocardial oedema in 58%, pericardial effusion in 42% and decreased left ventricular function in 25%. Twenty children required imaging for abdominal symptoms, the commonest abnormalities being free fluid (71%) and terminal ileum wall thickening (57%). Twelve children underwent brain imaging, showing abnormalities in two cases. CONCLUSION: Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome showed pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal and brain imaging findings, reflecting the multisystem inflammatory disease.

METHODS: All adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 20 January 2020 to 15 May 2020 were identified. HCQ users were defined as patients who had been pretreated with HCQ for at least 30 days until the date of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The prevalence of positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 was compared between HCQ users and nonusers. RESULTS: Of a total of 216,686 individuals who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, 743 (0.3%) were pretreated with HCQ. The prevalence of positive results was not significantly different between HCQ users (2.2%) and nonusers (2.7%; P = 0.35), with an odds ratio of 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.48-1.30).

Here we analyze in detail the nuclear role of M for the first time using a range of novel approaches, including quantitative analysis of de novo cell transcription in situ in the presence or absence of RSV infection or M ectopic expression, as well as in situ DNA binding. We show that M, dependent on amino acids 110C183, inhibits host cell transcription in RSV-infected cells as well as cells transfected to express M, with a clear correlation between nuclear levels of M and the degree of transcriptional inhibition. Analysis of bacterially expressed M protein and derivatives thereof mutated in key residues within Ms RNA binding domain indicates that M can bind to DNA as well as RNA in a cell-free system. Parallel results for point-mutated M derivatives implicate arginine 170 and lysine 172, in contrast to other basic residues such as lysine 121 and 130, as critically important residues for inhibition of transcription and DNA binding both in situ and in vitro. Importantly, recombinant RSV carrying arginine 170/lysine 172 mutations shows attenuated infectivity in cultured cells and in an animal model, concomitant with altered inflammatory responses.

We find that although COVID-19 is associated with wholesale activation of a broad set of signaling pathways across myeloid and lymphoid cell populations, STAT3 phosphorylation predominated in both monocytes and T cells. STAT3 phosphorylation was tightly correlated with circulating IL-6 levels and high levels of phospho-STAT3 was associated with decreased markers of myeloid cell maturation/activation and decreased ex-vivo T cell IFN- production, demonstrating that during COVID-19 dysregulated cellular activation is associated with suppression of immune effector cell function.

Images were quantified using a custom research-oriented quantification software calculating vessel area density (VAD) and flux and a commercially developed, clinic-oriented quantification software (Cirrus 11.0, Carl Zeiss Meditec) calculating perfusion density (PD) and flux index (FI). Effect of signal strength on the reliability of OCTA parameters was also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 120 non-glaucomatous eyes, intrasession CVW were 4.2% for VAD, 5.3% for flux, 1.5% for PD and 2.0% for FI. The intersession CVW were 6.5% for VAD, 8.0% for flux, 2.0% for PD and 3.2% for FI. The intrasession ICC ranged from 0.928 to 0.945, and intersession ICC ranged from 0.811 to 0.866.

We hypothesized that TREM\\\\1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand\\\\independent TREM\\\\1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high\\\\density lipoprotein (HDL)\\\\mimicking complexes GF9\\\\HDL and GA/E31\\\\HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5\\\\week alcohol feeding with the Lieber\\\\DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM\\\\1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol\\\\fed mice, and TREM\\\\1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase.

Several factors affect NK cytotoxic activity rendering it dysfunctional and thereby impeding the ability to scavenge abnormal cells as a part of immune escaping mechanisms induced by different types of cancers. NK cells play a crucial role augmenting the activity of various types of anticancer mAb since dysfunctional NK cells are the main reason for the low response to these therapies. To this light, we examined the phenotypic characters of the circulating NK cells isolated from HCC patients compared to healthy controls. Then, dysfunctional NK cells, from HCC patients, were reactivated with cytokines cocktail and their cytotoxic activity with the anti-EGFR mAb \\"cetuximab\\" was investigated. This showed a downregulation of patients NK cells activating receptors (NKP30, NKP46, NKG2D and CD16) as well as CD56 and up-regulation of NKG2A inhibitory receptor. We also reported an increase in aberrant CD56- NK cells subset in peripheral blood of HCC patients compared to healthy controls. Thus, confirming the dysfunctionality of peripheral NK cells isolated from HCC patients. Cytokines re-activation of those NK cells lead to upregulation of NK activating receptors and downregulation of inhibitory receptor. Moreover, the percentage of aberrant CD56- NK cells subset was reduced. Here, we proved that advanced HCC patients have an increased percentage of more immature and noncytotoxic NK cell subsets in their peripheral blood, which might account for the low cytotoxicity noticed in those patients. A significant improvement in the cytotoxicity against HCC was noticed upon using reactivated NK cells combined with cetuximab. Therefore, this study highlights the potential recruitment of NK immune cells along with cetuximab to enhance cytotoxicity against HCC.","output":"Restoring NK cells functionality via cytokine activation enhances cetuximab-mediated NK-cell ADCC: A promising therapeutic tool for HCC patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Data on the novel coronavirus (CoV) respiratory disease (COVID-19) in cancer patients (pts) are limited In some individuals, CoV infection triggers an aberrant inflammatory response, leading to lung tissue damage Cancer pts treated with immunotherapy (IT) may therefore be more at risk for COVID-19 infection and related complications Methods: We performed a thorough review of the literature on CoV pathogenesis and cancer, selecting shared features of the two disease entities to develop a risk-assessment score to quantify both the risk of infection and the risk implied in cancer treatment delays Results: The score includes clinical and laboratory variables (Table) Pts' characteristics include: age, presence of comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic systemic infections), obesity, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), and concomitant steroid treatment (&gt;10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent, lasting for &gt;1-month period) Disease characteristics include: lung cancer diagnosis, history of thoracic radiotherapy (RT) (only for pts with extra-thoracic tumours) Treatment characteristics include: line of treatment, type (IT or combined IT/chemotherapy [CT] considered high-risk, followed by CT, and other anticancer drugs), history of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) Laboratory tests include: levels of neutrophil-to-lymphocite ratio (NLR), lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) Based on the resulting score, pts can be divided in the following categories of risk: low (score 7) [Formula presented] Conclusions: There is a strong rationale supporting the presented data as potential risk factors for COVID-19 in cancer pts The present score is currently undergoing validation on a wide population of cancer pts to confirm its role and potentially help physicians treatment decisions Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"Developing a risk assessment score for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COPD is a major cause of disability, but little is known about how disability develops in this condition. METHODS The authors analysed data from the Function, Living, Outcomes and Work (FLOW) Study which enrolled 1202 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members with COPD at baseline and re-evaluated 1051 subjects at 2-year follow-up. The authors tested the specific hypothesis that the development of specific non-respiratory impairments (abnormal body composition and muscle strength) and functional limitations (decreased lower extremity function, poor balance, mobility-related dyspnoea, reduced exercise performance and decreased cognitive function) will determine the risk of disability in COPD, after controlling for respiratory impairment (FEV(1) and oxygen saturation). The Valued Life Activities Scale was used to assess disability in terms of a broad range of daily activities. The primary disability outcome measure was defined as an increase in the proportion of activities that cannot be performed of 3.3% or greater from baseline to 2-year follow-up (the estimated minimal important difference). Multivariable logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS Respiratory impairment measures were related to an increased prospective risk of disability (multivariate OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.44 for 1 litre decrement of FEV(1) and OR 1.57 per 5% decrement in oxygen saturation; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.18). Non-respiratory impairment (body composition and lower extremity muscle strength) and functional limitations (lower extremity function, exercise performance, and mobility-related dyspnoea) were all associated with an increased longitudinal risk of disability after controlling for respiratory impairment (p<0.05 in all cases). Non-respiratory impairment and functional limitations were predictive of prospective disability, above-and-beyond sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status and respiratory impairment (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.65 to 0.75; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Development of non-respiratory impairment and functional limitations, which reflect the systemic nature of COPD, appear to be critical determinants of disablement.

After a literature review and field surveys, all weak, strong, threatening, and opportunity points were collected and were listed using the internal factor evaluation (IFE) and external factor evaluation (EFE) matrices and then were prioritized and weighted. Next, given the sum of scores of IFE and EFE, the SWOT matrix was constructed, the disease prevention and control strategies in the complex was determined, and finally, experts proposed corrective measures to improve the current situation. The results of the IFE matrix (IFE) analysis showed that in terms of corona control, there are more weaknesses than strengths within the company (the score of this matrix was 201.12). Also the score of 165 on the EFE matrix indicated that external threats were predominant, compared to external opportunities of company.

METHODS: We implemented telephone follow-ups of 314 patients with BPH who were diagnosed at the Urology Clinic of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University before January 24, 2020, and who were admitted to the hospital for reexamination after the epidemic was controlled in China, and we conducted research and analysis of their disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In the follow-up, we found 245 patients (79.3%) over 60 years of age and 187 patients (60.5%) with underlying disease. There were 47 patients (15.2%) who returned for consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and of these, 18 were admitted to the hospital for follow-up consultation, and 29 patients underwent consultation via the internet or telephone. Eleven patients underwent surgery during the pandemic, and of these, three experienced emergency surgery. We encountered 65 patients (24.4%) who self-administered medications irregularly and 54 patients (20.3%) who self-medicated and adjusted the dosage and drug types themselves. There were 302 patients (97.7%) who wished to be reexamined during the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of treatment, the proportion of patients awaiting observation declined from 13.9% to 4.4%, and the proportion of patients awaiting surgery increased from 4.9% to 16.4%. Using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scale, the percentage of patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms increased from 79.9% to 90.1%, and the proportion with a quality of life (QOL) score  5 rose from 82.5% to 88.9%. The proportions of patients exhibiting storage, voiding, and postmicturition symptoms in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) increased from 77.3%, 21.7%, and 18.8% to 91.9%, 27.5%, and 25.5%, respectively; those manifesting hematuria and urinary retention increased from 0.9% and 0.6% to 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively; those with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 4 ng/ml rose from 10.0% to 15.1%; patients with a maximum flow rate (Qmax) < 15 ml/s increased from 82.5% to 92.3%, and the proportion with a Qmax < 10 ml/s increased from 8.7% to 15.4%; the individuals with a prostate volume > 30 ml increased from 94.1% to 97.0%; the percentage of men with a bladder residual urine volume > 10 ml was augmented from 81.6% to 89.3%, and patients with prostate nodules on physical examination were elevated from 1.0% to 1.7%. We uncovered no prostate cancer in patients, and the proportion of patients administered the combination drug increased from 78.9% to 91.2%. Compared with patients receiving online or telephone consultations, patients undergoing reexamination at the hospital were better controlled. When we conducted a survey of whether patients chose to go to a public or private hospital for follow-up, we found that 46.6% of the patients chose to go to a private medical institution. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 greatly affected the treatment of patients with BPH. When conditions permit, we recommend that patients first consider going to the hospital for evaluation; however, when this is not possible, medical institutions should provide telephone or online consultation for patients with BPH.

There is a clear need for companies and regulators to manage the risk from proposed ML systems before they harm people. To achieve this, private and public sector actors first need to identify the risks posed by a proposed ML system. A system's overall risk is influenced by its direct and indirect effects. However, existing frameworks for ML risk/impact assessment often address an abstract notion of risk or do not concretize this dependence. We propose to address this gap with a context-sensitive framework for identifying ML system risks comprising two components: a taxonomy of the first- and second-order risks posed by ML systems, and their contributing factors. First-order risks stem from aspects of the ML system, while second-order risks stem from the consequences of first-order risks. These consequences are system failures that result from design and development choices. We explore how different risks may manifest in various types of ML systems, the factors that affect each risk, and how first-order risks may lead to second-order effects when the system interacts with the real world. Throughout the paper, we show how real events and prior research fit into our Machine Learning System Risk framework (MLSR). MLSR operates on ML systems rather than technologies or domains, recognizing that a system's design, implementation, and use case all contribute to its risk. In doing so, it unifies the risks that are commonly discussed in the ethical AI community (e.g., ethical/human rights risks) with system-level risks (e.g., application, design, control risks), paving the way for holistic risk assessments of ML systems.","output":"The Risks of Machine Learning Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: .

We ascertained the time course of intradialytic arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) in MHD patients between 4 weeks pre-diagnosis and the week post-diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a quality improvement project in confirmed COVID-19 in-center MHD patients from 11 dialysis facilities. In patients with an arterio-venous access, SaO(2) was measured 1/min during dialysis using the Crit-Line monitor (Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA, USA). We extracted demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data, and COVID-19-related symptoms from the patients electronic health records. RESULTS: Intradialytic SaO(2) was available in 52 patients (29 males; mean  standard deviation age 66.5  15.7 years) contributing 338 HD treatments. Mean time between onset of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 and diagnosis was 1.1 days (median 0; range 0C9). Prior to COVID-19 diagnosis the rate of HD treatments with hypoxemia, defined as treatment-level average SaO(2) <90%, increased from 2.8% (2C4 weeks pre-diagnosis) to 12.2% (1 week) and 20.7% (3 days pre-diagnosis). Intradialytic O(2) supplementation increased sharply post-diagnosis. Eleven patients died from COVID-19 within 5 weeks. Compared with patients who recovered from COVID-19, demised patients showed a more pronounced decline in SaO(2) prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, hypoxemia may precede the onset of clinical symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19. A steep decline of SaO(2) is associated with poor patient outcomes.

One of the methods of detecting these types of changes in COVID-19 patients is an electroencephalogram (EEG) test, which allows information to be obtained about the functioning of the brain as well as diagnosing diseases and predicting their consequences. The aim of the study was to review the latest research on changes in EEG in patients with COVID-19 as a basis for further quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) diagnostics and EEG neurofeedback training. Description of the state of knowledge: Based on the available scientific literature using the PubMed database from 2020 and early 2021 regarding changes in the EEG records in patients with COVID-19, 17 publications were included in the analysis. In patients who underwent an EEG test, changes in the frontal area were observed. A few patients were not found to be responsive to external stimuli. Additionally, a previously non-emerging, uncommon pattern in the form of continuous, slightly asymmetric, monomorphic, biphasic and slow delta waves occurred. Conclusion: The results of this analysis clearly indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes changes in the nervous system that can be manifested and detected in the EEG record. The small number of available articles, the small number of research groups and the lack of control groups suggest the need for further research regarding the short and long term neurological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for unquestionable confirmation that observed changes were caused by the virus per se and did not occur before.

Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5d or 10d of intravenous RDV once daily plus standard of care (SoC), or SoC only. For this analysis, patients were followed through discharge, d14, or death. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics associated with clinical improvement in oxygen support (2-point improvement on a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from discharge to death) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression methods. RESULTS: 584 patients were randomized and treated (5/10d RDV, n=384; SoC: n=200). 159 (27%) were 65y, 227 (39%) female, 328 (61%) white, 102 (19%) Asian, and 99 (19%) Black. 252 participants (43%) were enrolled in Europe, 260 (45%) North America (NA), and 72 (12%) in Asia.

To understand how government leaders' messages shape emotional and cognitive responses of citizens, we designed a 2x2 vignette experiment in which we manipulate the framing (pessimistic vs. optimistic) and content of the message (specific vs. general) delivered by a political leader. Results from 436 participants showed that while the tone of leader's messages has significant implications for the levels of anxiety and evaluation of the government's truthfulness and its overall response to the crisis, the content of the leader's message matters less.

This paper proposes a model to predict COVID-19 patients admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The model is built upon robust known classification algorithms, including classic Machine Learning Classifiers (MLCs), an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and ensemble learning. This models strength in predicting COVID-19 infected patients is shown by performance analysis of various MLCs and error metrics. Among other used ML models, the ANN model resulted in the highest accuracy, 97.9% over other models. Mean Squared Error showed that the ANN method had the lowest error (0.0809). In conclusion, this paper could be beneficial to ICU staff to predict ICU admission based on COVID-19 patients clinical characteristics. ? 2021.

In general, such expression vectors often suffered from relatively low and unpredictable expression levels, as well as genome instability. In an attempt to circumvent these disadvantages, the possibility to express a foreign gene [encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)] from within the nidovirus replicase gene, which encodes two large polyproteins that are processed proteolytically into the non-structural proteins (nsps) required for viral RNA synthesis, has now been explored. A viable recombinant of the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus, EAV-GFP2, was obtained, which contained the eGFP insert at the site specifying the junction between the two most N-proximal replicase-cleavage products, nsp1 and nsp2. EAV-GFP2 replication could be launched by transfection of cells with either in vitro-generated RNA transcripts or a DNA launch plasmid. EAV-GFP2 displayed growth characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus and was found to maintain the insert stably for at least eight passages. It is proposed that EAV-GFP2 has potential for arterivirus vector development and as a tool in inhibitor screening. It can also be used for fundamental studies into EAV replication, which was illustrated by the fact that the eGFP signal of EAV-GFP2, which largely originated from an eGFP-nsp2 fusion protein, could be used to monitor the formation of the membrane-bound EAV replication complex in real time.","output":"An infectious recombinant equine arteritis virus expressing green fluorescent protein from its replicase gene."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: In this study, we investigated the acute exacerbation and outcomes of COPD patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 and evaluated the prevalence and mortality of COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19. Methods: A prospectively recruited cohort of 489 COPD patients was retrospectively followed-up for their conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic from December 2019 to March 2020 in Hubei, China. In addition, the features of 821 discharged patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Of the 489 followed-up enrolled COPD patients, 2 cases were diagnosed as confirmed COVID-19, and 97 cases had exacerbations, 32 cases of which were hospitalized, and 14 cases died. Compared with the 6-month follow-up results collected 1 year ago, in 307 cases of this cohort, the rates of exacerbations and hospitalization of the 489 COPD patients during the last 4 months decreased, while the mortality rate increased significantly (2.86% vs 0.65%, p=0.023). Of the 821 patients with COVID-19, 37 cases (4.5%) had pre-existing COPD. Of 180 confirmed deaths, 19 cases (10.6%) were combined with COPD. Compared to COVID-19 deaths without COPD, COVID-19 deaths with COPD had higher rates of coronary artery disease and/or cerebrovascular diseases. Old age, low BMI and low parameters of lung function were risk factors of all-cause mortality for COVID-19 patients with pre-existing COPD. Conclusion: Our findings imply that acute exacerbations and hospitalizations of COPD patients were infrequent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: VigiBase data were used to analyze the reported ADEs linked to HCQ. The data were analyzed based on age, gender, and seriousness of ADEs at the System Organ Classification level and the individual Preferred Term level. Results: The majority were above 18 years(91.6%) and from Europe(41.6%). A total of 5,315 ADEs were associated with HCQ use in COVID-19. Of these, 918 ADEs were attributed to CVS and reported from 773 patients. Grossly, CVS ADEs were associated with concomitant use of HCQ and azithromycin(AZM), and only 40 ADEs were solely due to HCQ. The majority were serious (69.3%) and resolved afterward (51%). In CVS ADEs, there were 366 cardiac disorders, 38 vascular disorders, and 514 ADEs under investigation. Among the cardiac disorders, palpitation was the most typical (N=65), followed by bradycardia(N=44) and tachycardia(N=33). Among arrhythmias, QT prolongation (N=469), atrial fibrillation (N=25), and ventricular tachycardia(N=16) were common.

However, little is known about which pandemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in four age groups in the Polish population during the COVID-19 lockdown; (ii) differences in perceived difficulties related to the pandemic in these groups; and (iii) which factors and difficulties related to the pandemic are the best predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHOD: A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The sample was representative of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed the following online: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, a Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, a Social Support Scale, and a Scale of Pandemic-Related Difficulties. RESULTS: Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Household relationship difficulties were among the most significant predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus was one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18 and 29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms exclusively in the youngest group. CONCLUSIONS: The youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members are the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. It is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the various challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown in Poland.

An attempt to reduce infection and spread of the disease, for most nations, has led to a lockdown period, where people's movement has been restricted resulting in a consequential impact on employment, lifestyle behaviours and wellbeing. As such, this study aimed to explore adults' thoughts and behaviours in response to the outbreak and resulting lockdown measures. METHODS: Using an online survey, 1126 adults responded to invitations to participate in the study. Participants, all aged 18 years or older, were recruited using social media, email distribution lists, website advertisement and word of mouth. Sentiment and personality features extracted from free-text responses using Artificial Intelligence methods were used to cluster participants. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated that there was varied knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19 and high concern about infection, severe illness and death, spread to others, the impact on the health service and on the economy. Higher concerns about infection, illness and death were reported by people identified at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Behavioural clusters, identified using Artificial Intelligence methods, differed significantly in sentiment and personality traits, as well as concerns about COVID-19, actions, lifestyle behaviours and wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This time-sensitive study provides important insights into adults' perceptions and behaviours in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown. The use of Artificial Intelligence has identified that there are two behavioural clusters that can predict people's responses during the COVID-19 pandemic, which goes beyond simple demographic groupings.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of self-reported sedative drug use among medical students attending the College of Medicine and Health Science (CMHS) students at the University of Gondar (UoG). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from May to July 2018 in CMHS at UoG. Data were collected using a pre-tested self-administered standard questionnaire. Data were collected, entered into a computer using Epi Info 7 software, and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Frequency, mean, and standard deviation were used to describe descriptive statistics, and binary and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between different variables and sedative drug use; P <0.05 was used to declare association. RESULTS: Of the 422 students who returned questionnaires, 26 (6.2%) participants were reported sedative drug use at some time since enrollment. Of these, 61.54% participants used antihistamine drugs.

COVID-19 is associated with excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, blood coagulation activation and fibrin formation. Current management of patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) is based on supportive care and the mortality rate is high. Blood hypercoagulability -documented by increase in D-Dimers and decrease in antithrombin (AT) -is frequently encountered among COVID-19 patients. Aim: Identification of patients with COVID-19 being at high risk for clinical deterioration is a challenging issue for an earlier adapted treatment and positive clinical outcome. we aimed to identify the most relevant clinical and haematological risk factors for worsening of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients by and constructing an accurate risk assessment tool, COMPASS-COVID-19. Methods: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n=430) were divided in derivation (n=310) and validation (n=120) cohorts. They were stratified to those hospitalized at the conventional ward (C-group) and those with worsening disease (W-group) admitted in ICU. The study endpoint was disease worsening. All patients were routinely evaluated with full blood count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-Dimers, antithrombin and protein C activity. Data from the first hospitalization day at the conventional ward or the ICU were analyzed. Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities were routinely registered. Results: In the derivation cohort, compensated DIC was diagnosed in 8.2% of patients in the C-group and in 28.2% of patients in the W-group (p=0.001). Compared to the C-group, the patients in the W-group had significantly lower levels of AT, PC, platelets, lymphocyte, monocyte and red blood cell counts as well as, hemoglobin and hematocrit. They had significantly higher levels of fibrinogen, DDimers, white blood cells and neutrophils counts. No difference was noted in eosinophil and basophil counts. Hematological predictors for disease worsening: Increase of fibrinogen (OR= 9.50, 95% CI:2.23-40.54) and D-Dimer levels (OR=7.65, 95% CI:2.67-21.87), a platelet count lower than 100x109/L (OR=7.60, 95% CI:1.55-37.35) and a positive compensated DIC-ISTH score (OR=4.58, CI:2.09-10.07) were major determinants of disease worsening risk. Deficiency of AT activity (OR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.18-3.85), PT prolongation (OR=2.43, 95% CI:1.15-5.13), leukocytosis (OR=1.86, 95%CI:1.04-3.33), lymphopenia with lymphocyte count lower than 1.5 G/L (OR=3.37, CI:1.58-7.21) were significant risk factors for worsening disease.

The score at 18 points cut-off value identified as high risk for disease worsening 90% of patients at the W-group and 38% of the patients at the C-group. The sensitivity and the specificity of the score were 94% and 58% respectively and the negative and positive predictive values were 96% and 45% respectively. Conclusion: The COMPASS-COVID- 19 score derived from multivariate analysis and includes obesity, gender, hemoglobin, lymphocyte and the cDIC-ISTH score (including platelet count, prothrombin time, D-Dimers antithrombin and protein C levels). The score has a very good discriminating capacity to stratify patients at high and low risk for worsening disease, with AUC value at 0.77, sensitivity 81% and specificity 60%.

METHODS: We collected data from publicly available databases on COVID-19 death rates through October 28, 2020, clinical covariates, and social determinants of health indicators at the U.S. county level. We utilized negative binomial regression to assess the association between social determinants of health and COVID-19 mortality focusing on racial disparities in mortality. RESULTS: Counties with higher death rates had a higher proportion of Black residents and greater levels of adverse social determinants of health. A one percentage point increase in percent Black residents, percent uninsured adults, percent low birthweight, percent adults without high school diploma, incarceration rate, and percent households without internet in a county increased COVID-19 death rates by 0.9% (95% CI 0.5%C1.3%), 1.9% (95% CI 1.1%C2.7%), 7.6% (95% CI 4.4%C11.0%), 3.5% (95% CI 2.5%C4.5%), 5.4% (95% CI 1.3%C9.7%), and 3.4% (95% CI 2.5%C4.2%), respectively.

Antibodies were identified from unpaired donor B-cell and serum repertoires using yeast surface display, proteomics, and public light chain screening. Cryo-EM and functional characterization of the antibodies identified N3C1, an antibody that binds avidly (K(d,app) = 68 pM) to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and robustly neutralizes the virus in vitro.

The aim of this study was to create a model that successfully predicts, from clinical measures and demographics, in-hospital mortality in a sample of TBI patients admitted to the emergency department. Of the 4881 TBI patients who were screened at the emergency department at a high-level first aid duty hospital in northern Taiwan, 3331 were assigned in triage to Level I or Level II using the Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale from January 2008 to June 2018. The most significant predictors of in-hospital mortality in TBI patients were the scores on the Glasgow coma scale, the injury severity scale, and systolic blood pressure in the emergency department admission. This study demonstrated the effective cutoff values for clinical measures when using machine learning to predict in-hospital mortality of patients with TBI.

Data on all respiratory infections occurring in infancy were collected prospectively and viral aetiology ascertained. Atopy was measured by skin prick tests at 6 months, and 2 and 5 yrs. History of wheeze and doctor-diagnosed eczema and asthma was collected regularly until 10 yrs of age. At 10 yrs, 60% of the cohort was atopic, 25.9% had current eczema, 18.4% current asthma and 20.4% persistent wheeze. 35.8% experienced at least one lower respiratory infection (LRI) associated with fever and/or wheeze in first year of life. Children who had wheezy or, in particular, febrile LRI in infancy and were atopic by 2 yrs, were significantly more likely to have persistent wheeze (RR 3.51, 95% CI 1.83-6.70; p<0.001) and current asthma (RR 4.92, 95% CI 2.59-9.36; p<0.001) at 10 yrs.

However, conflicting data are obtained for intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between obesity and in-hospital mortality of ICU patients with COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were included retrospectively. The following data were collected: comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), the severity of ARDS assessed with PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratios, disease severity measured by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), management and outcomes. RESULTS: For a total of 222 patients, there were 34 patients (15.3%) with normal BMI, 92 patients (41.4%) who were overweight, 80 patients (36%) with moderate obesity (BMI:30C39.9 kg/m(2)), and 16 patients (7.2%) with severe obesity (BMI  40 kg/m(2)). Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. Patients with moderate obesity had a lower mortality rate (13.8%) than patients with normal weight, overweight or severe obesity (17.6%, 21.7%, and 50%, respectively; P = 0.011. Logistic regression showed that patients with a BMI  29 kg/m(2) (odds ratio [OR] 3.64, 95% CI 1.38C9.60) and those with a BMI > 39 kg/m(2) (OR 10.04, 95% CI 2.45C41.09) had a higher risk of mortality than those with a BMI from 29 to 39 kg/m(2).

As a consequence, CIT are usually associated with higher risk of infections, secondary neoplasms and autoimmune disorders. A better understanding of the biology of the disease has led to the development of therapeutic strategies which not only act against malignant B-cells but also reactivate and enhance the patients own anti-tumor immune response. Here, we review the current understanding of the underlying interplay between the malignant cells and non-malignant immune cells that may promote tumor survival and proliferation. In addition, we review the available evidence on how different treatment options for CLL including CIT regimens, small molecular inhibitors (i.e, BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors) and T-cell therapies, affect the immune system and their clinical consequences. Finally, we propose that a dual therapeutic approach, acting directly against malignant B-cells and restoring the immune function is clinically relevant and should be considered when developing future strategies to treat patients with CLL.","output":"Restoration of the immune function as a complementary strategy to treat Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia effectively"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to test a set of epidermal traits in two legume species with contrasting chemical, physical, and micromorphological leaf-surface features to assess which ones would determine higher PM retention.

We evaluated leaf-surface roughness at two hierarchical levels, leaf wettability, epidermal-cell anticlinal-wall undulation, epidermal-cell perimeter, and the micromorphology and chemical composition of epicuticular waxes.

The dysregulation of the gasotransmitter system is associated with numerous disorders ranging from inflammatory diseases to cancers. However, the relevance of these endogenous gasotransmitters, prodrug donors and inhibitors in inflammatory dermatological disorders has not yet been thoroughly reviewed and discussed. AIM OF REVIEW: This review discusses the recent progress and will provide perspectives on endogenous gasotransmitters in the context of inflammatory dermatological disorders. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Endogenous gasotransmitters nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) are signaling molecules that regulate several physiological and pathological processes. In addition, sulfur dioxide (SO?), methane (CH(4)), hydrogen gas (H(2)), ammonia (NH(3)), and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) can also be generated endogenously and may take part in physiological and pathological processes. These signaling molecules regulate inflammation, vasodilation, and oxidative stress, offering therapeutic potential and attracting interest in the field of inflammatory dermatological disorders including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne, rosacea, and chronic skin ulcers. The development of effective gas donors and inhibitors is a promising alternative to treat inflammatory dermatological disorders with controllable and precise delivery in the future.","output":"Recent advances on endogenous gasotransmitters in inflammatory dermatological disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, live music spaces - and the practices which produce them as economically viable - have found themselves in crisis.

In this paper, we present a Lefebvrian analysis of live music, highlighting the complex ways in which space is produced and consumed within a live music environment. By extending this framing to consider Lefebvre's conceptualisation of dominated and appropriated space, we argue that the economic viability of live music stems from its spatiality, and that ongoing responses to the crisis require greater sensitivity to the spatial practices of music production and consumption. ? 2021 International Association for the Study of Popular Music.

Here we studied the genetic association between APOE and COVID-19 in Finnish biobank, autopsy and prospective clinical cohort datasets. In line with previous work, our data on 2611 cases showed that APOE4 carriership associates with severe COVID-19 in intensive care patients compared with non-infected population controls after matching for age, sex and cardiovascular disease status. Histopathological examination of brain autopsy material of 21 COVID-19 cases provided evidence that perivascular microhaemorrhages are more prevalent in APOE4 carriers. Finally, our analysis of post-COVID fatigue in a prospective clinical cohort of 156 subjects revealed that APOE4 carriership independently associates with higher mental fatigue compared to non-carriers at six months after initial illness. In conclusion, the present data on Finns suggests that APOE4 is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and post-COVID mental fatigue and provides the first indication that some of this effect could be mediated via increased cerebrovascular damage.

This work has investigated for the first time the use of abundant, un-modified agricultural wastes and by-products (AWBs) from grape, wheat, barley and flax production, to reduce the concentration of Cd, a highly toxic and mobile heavy metal, in contaminated water. At concentrations of 1.1 mg Cd per L, flax and grape waste were found superior in removing Cd compared with a granular activated carbon used in water treatment, which is both more expensive and entails greater CO2 emissions in its production. At a pH representative of mine effluents, where Cd presents its greatest mobility and risk as a pollutant, grape and flax waste showed capacity for effective bulk water treatment due to rapid removal kinetics and moderate adsorption properties: reaching equilibrium within 183 and 8 min - adsorption capacities were determined as 3.99 and 3.36 mg Cd per g, respectively. The capacity to clean contaminated effluents was not correlated with the surface area of the biosorbents. Surface chemistry analysis indicated that Cd removal is associated with exchange with Ca, and chemisorption involving CdCO3, CdS and CdO groups. This work indicates that some AWBs can be directly (i.e. without pre-treatment or modification) used in bulk to remediate effluents contaminated with heavy metals, without requiring further cost or energy input, making them potentially suitable for low-cost treatment of persistent (e.g. via mine drainage) or acute (e.g. spillages) discharges in rural and other areas.","output":"Agricultural wastes from wheat, barley, flax and grape for the efficient removal of Cd from contaminated water."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Increasing focus on reducing morbidity from latissimus dorsi flaps has led to the evolution of muscle-sparing variants and perforator-based flaps. This study aimed to investigate the vascular anatomy of the muscle-sparing variant and to describe its application as a free flap based on the descending branch of the thoracodorsal artery. METHODS Twelve fresh cadavers underwent anatomical dissection and angiographic injection studies of the thoracodorsal arterial system. The musculocutaneous territories of the descending and transverse branches to the latissimus dorsi muscle were identified and assessed using three-dimensional reconstruction software of computed tomography imaging results. In the clinical study, five patients underwent reconstruction of a variety of defects using the free descending branch muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap. RESULTS Three- and four-dimensional (computed tomography) angiography demonstrated perfusion of the latissimus dorsi muscle by the transverse and descending branches, with overlap of vascular territories via cross-linking vessels. The descending branch supplied a slightly greater cutaneous area overlying the muscle, although differences between both branches were not significant (p = 0.76). In the clinical study, the free muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap provided excellent coverage with no flap complications or seroma. CONCLUSIONS The free muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap based on the descending branch of the thoracodorsal artery is a viable reconstructive option.

For Hurricane Laura, we estimate that 499,500 [90% Credible Interval (CI): 347,500, 624,000] people evacuated the Texan counties, that no single county accumulated more than 2.5% of hurricane evacuees, and that there were 2,900 [90% CI: 1,700, 5,800] exportations of Covid-19 across the state. In general, reception estimates were concentrated in regions with higher population densities. Nonetheless, higher importation risk is expected in small Districts, with a maximum number of importations of 10 per 10,000 residents in our case study. Overall, we present a flexible and transferable framework that captures spatial heterogeneity and incorporates geographic components for predicting population movement in the wake of a natural disaster. As hurricanes continue to increase in both frequency and strength, our framework can be deployed in response to anticipated hurricane paths to guide disaster preparedness and planning.","output":"Estimating Importation Risk of Covid-19 in Hurricane Evacuations: A Prediction Framework Applied to Hurricane Laura in Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a recently published letter to the editor of this journal, the authors have called for the need to establish psychological support structures that cater to people's mental health in this time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

The MAPK cascades are mainly composed by three proteins, MAPKKKs, MAPKKs and MAPKs. Some signals induce MAPKKK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of MAPKK that phosphorylate and activate MAPK. Afterward, MAPKs can act either in the cytoplasm or be imported into the nucleus to activate other proteins or transcription factors. In the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the pathway for nitrogen (N) assimilation is well characterized, yet its regulation still has many unknown features. Nitric oxide (NO) is a fundamental signal molecule for N regulation, where nitrate reductase (NR) plays a central role in its synthesis. The MAPK cascades could be regulating N assimilation, since it has been described that the phosphorylation of NR by MAPK6 promotes NO production in Arabidopsis thaliana. We have identified the proteins involved in the MAPK cascades in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, finding 17 MAPKs, 2 MAPKKs and 108 MAPKKKs (11 MEKK-, 94 RAF- and 3 ZIK-type) that have been structurally and phylogenetically characterized. The genetic expressions of MAPKs and the MAPKK were slightly regulated by N. However, the genetic expressions of MAPKKKs RAF14 and RAF79 showed a very strong repression by ammonium, which suggests that they may have a key role in the regulation of N assimilation, encouraging to further analyze in detail the role of MAPK cascades in the regulation of N metabolism.","output":"Identification of the MAPK Cascade and its Relationship with Nitrogen Metabolism in the Green Alga

America where obesity is highly prevalent. The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been fully documented. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including BMI, and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 in a single French center. RESULTS: Obesity (BMI > 30) and severe obesity (BMI > 35) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (P < 0.01, &#967;2 test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI > 35 (85.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (P < 0.05) and BMI (P < 0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI > 35 versus patients with BMI < 25 was 7.36 (1.63-33.14; P = 0.02).

To date, COVID-19 remains a life-threatening pandemic with little to no targeted therapeutic recourse. The discovery of novel antiviral agents, such as vaccines and drugs, can provide therapeutic solutions to save human beings from severe infections; however, there is no specifically effective antiviral treatment confirmed for now. Thus, great attention has been paid to the use of natural or artificial antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as these compounds are widely regarded as promising solutions for the treatment of harmful microorganisms. Given the biological significance of AMPs, it was obvious that there was a significant need for a single platform for identifying and engaging with AMP data. This led to the creation of the dbAMP platform that provides comprehensive information about AMPs and facilitates their investigation and analysis. To date, the dbAMP has accumulated 26 447 AMPs and 2262 antimicrobial proteins from 3044 organisms using both database integration and manual curation of >4579 articles. In addition, dbAMP facilitates the evaluation of AMP structures using I-TASSER for automated protein structure prediction and structure-based functional annotation, providing predictive structure information for clinical drug development. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing have been applied to generate large-scale sequencing reads from various environments, enabling greatly improved analysis of genome structure. In this update, we launch an efficient online tool that can effectively identify AMPs from genome/metagenome and proteome data of all species in a short period. In conclusion, these improvements promote the dbAMP as one of the most abundant and comprehensively annotated resources for AMPs.

In our model, we introduce a general branching process in a changing (but not random) environment. With this branching process, we estimate the probability of extinction and the expected number of infected individuals for different control measures. We also use this branching process to calculate the generating function of the number of infected individuals at any given moment. The model and methods are designed using important infections of farmed animals, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza as motivating examples, but have a wider application, for example to emerging human infections that lead to strict quarantine of cases and suspected cases (e.g. SARS) and contact and movement restrictions.","output":"A branching model for the spread of infectious animal diseases in varying environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consecutive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic made teaching and learning tasks harder for veterinary anatomy faculties and students worldwide compared to the prepandemic scenario.

Absent an effective vaccine, preventive measures used, some of which are being relaxed, have included school closures, restriction of movement, and banning of large gatherings. Our goal was to estimate the association of voter turnout with county-level COVID-19 risks. METHODS: We used publicly available data on voter turnout in the March 10 primary in three states, COVID-19 confirmed cases by day and county, and county-level census data. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to estimate the association of voter turnout with COVID-19 incidence, adjusted for county-level population density and proportions: over age 65 years, female, Black, with college education, with high school education, poor, obese, and smokers. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk was associated with voter turnout, most strongly in Michigan during the week starting 3 days postelection (risk ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.33). For longer periods, the association was progressively weaker (risk ratio 0.98-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased absentee-ballot voting in the primary, our results suggest an association of voter turnout in at least one state with a detectable increase in risks associated with and perhaps due to greater exposures related to the primary.","output":"The association of voter turnout with county-level coronavirus disease 2019 occurrence early in the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spotlighted respiratory infections and the value of effective vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been remarkably effective; however, influenza vaccine effectiveness has been reported to be lower among active duty military populations than in the general public (18% vs 36%). The Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED) study compares 3 FDA-licensed influenza vaccine types (egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant) to assess differences in immunogenicity and effectiveness in adults. METHODS: Participants in the 3rd year of PAIVED (2020/21 influenza season) were enrolled from October 2020 through January 2021. Participants received weekly surveys about influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) experienced in the past week; if they reported an ILI, they were queried about symptom duration and severity, and asked to self-collect a nasal swab and dried blood sample. Four weeks later, more information about symptom duration and illness burden was obtained via telephone interview, and the participant collected a second blood sample. RESULTS: PAIVED year 3 enrolled 3,269 participants (Table 1). 278 participants reported 1 ILI , while 60 reported 2 ILIs, and 18 reported 3 ILIs. No pathogen was identified for most processed ILI samples (78%); the most common viruses were SARS-CoV-2 (25, 12%), rhinovirus (24, 12%), and seasonal coronaviruses (4, 2%). No influenza has been identified thus far. Among those participants who had convalescent ILI visits (275), the median duration of the reported ILIs was 9 days (IQR 5, 15), with a median of 4 days (IQR 2, 7) of limited activity, and 2 days (IQR 0, 3) with fever. Three individuals were hospitalized. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: There have been relatively low rates of ILI identified in this study during this season, with only 11% of the participants reporting an ILI so far, consistent with low rates of non-COVID-19 ILI reported elsewhere during the current pandemic. We anticipate some influenza cases may be identified as more samples are processed. Planned analyses include calculating comparative influenza vaccine effectiveness to inform future vaccine purchasing decisions, as well as comparing serological response to the different vaccines.

Yet such limitations have impacted peoples physical activity. This study examined relationships between changes in physical activity and resilience, emotions, and depression during two lockdowns in Israel. An online survey was completed twice by 135 participants during two consecutive lockdowns. The results indicate that resilience and positive emotions were higher, and negative emotions and depression were lower during the second lockdown compared to the first oneeven though people spent less time performing physical activity in the later lockdown. Moreover, negative emotions significantly decreased among people who reported increased physical activity during the second lockdown [M = 2.2 (SD = 0.9) compared to M = 1.9 (SD = 0.8) on a scale of 1C5] and increased among those who reported a reduction in activity [M = 1.8 (SD = 0.7) compared to M = 2.2 (SD = 0.7)]. It could therefore be concluded that while the Israeli populations resilience is higher compared to other populations (who do not regularly deal with crisis situations), their increased physical activity was associated with better resilience and emotions and lower depression scores.

Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients transferred from facilities where CTP (using automated RAPID software) was routinely performed and group 2 consisted of patients transferred from facilities that did not perform perfusion imaging. RESULTS We identified a total of 132 patients, all of whom were transferred to our center, from April 2014 to April 2017. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. A total of 34 patients were transferred from a facility after CTP (group 1) and 98 were transferred from a facility with no CTP (group 2).

The COVID-19 pandemic poses both challenges and opportunities to this process. This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on aspects of Irish healthcare during the first nine months of the pandemic and considers the implications for Slintecare implementation. Methods: Secondary analysis was undertaken on publicly available data on three key domains of the Irish healthcare system: primary care, community-based allied healthcare, and hospitals. Descriptive statistics were computed using Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: Up to March 2021, 3.76 million COVID-19 tests were performed by Irelands public healthcare system, 2.48 million (66.0%) of which were referred from the community. General practitioners delivered 2.31 million telephone triages of COVID-19 symptoms, peaking in December 2020 when 416,607 consultations occurred. Patient numbers across eight allied healthcare specialties fell by 35.1% versus previous years, with the greatest reductions seen in speech and language therapy (49.0%) and audiology (46.1%). Hospital waiting lists increased from 729,937 to 869,676 (or by 19.1%) from January 2019 to January 2021. In January 2021, 629,919 patients awaited a first outpatient clinic appointment, with 170,983 (27.1%) waiting longer than 18 months. The largest outpatient lists were observed in orthopaedic surgery (n=77,257);ear, nose and throat surgery (n=68,073);and ophthalmology (n=47,075). The proportion of patients waiting more than 12 months for a day-case gastrointestinal endoscopy rose from 6.0% in January 2020 to 19.0% in January 2021. Conclusions: Healthcare activity has been significantly disrupted by COVID-19, leading to increased wait times and greater barriers to healthcare access during the pandemic. Yet, Irelands health system responses also revealed strong willingness and ability to adapt and to implement novel solutions for healthcare delivery, rapidly and at scale.

Such dramatic societal changes might cause overall sleep health to decrease (stress view), to remain unchanged (resilience view), or even to improve (reduced work/schedule burden view). We addressed this question using longitudinal, cross-sectional, and retrospective recall methodologies in 699 American adult participants in late March 2020, two weeks following the enactment of social distancing and shelter-in-place policies in the United States. Relative to baseline data from mid February 2020, cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses demonstrated that average sleep quality was unchanged, or even improved, early in the pandemic. However, there were clear individual differences: approximately 25% of participants reported that their sleep quality had worsened, which was explained by stress vulnerability, caregiving, adverse life impact, shift work, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic has detrimentally impacted some individuals sleep health while paradoxically benefited other individuals sleep health by reducing rigid work/school schedules such as early morning commitments.","output":"Sleep Health Early in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in the United States: Integrating Longitudinal, Cross-Sectional, and Retrospective Recall Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic and global health crisis Although normal operation and services in many libraries have been greatly disrupted, academic libraries in the United States were reportedly responding to challenges by pivoting to new ways to meet the users needs This observational study was designed to investigate the status, services, and resources disclosed via websites of academic medical/health sciences libraries (MHSLs) in the United States and document how they adapted and continued to provide support to help fight the health crisis and the resulting infodemic through various means A complete list of members was obtained from the website of the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) The U S -based AAHSL member institutions were included in this study Each American academic MHSL website and its associated webpages were browsed;web contents were categorized and analyzed based on four research questions proposed by this study A descriptive analysis was conducted to summarize all findings A total of 157 AAHSL member institutions were included in the study These libraries spread all over the United States, and 90% of them announced closures of library buildings and facilities A significant number of MHSLs quickly adapted to the evolving situation and transitioned their services and instruction to the online environment The COVID-19 information sources adopted by MHSLs included the following ranked by frequency from high to low: The U S government agencies such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Library of Medicine, the World Health Organization, publishing communities, professional Journals, organizations, local institutions, government agencies, and news channels In addition, MHSLs undertook a series of actions to support academic communities and local healthcare professionals including resource curation, clinical care support, education, and outreach to the public Through library guides, MHSLs provided comprehensive and customized search queries to help researchers locate the latest and relevant publications to COVID-19, curated multiple data resources and data exploration, and visualization tools, and selected the latest biomedical and health evidence in a wide range of topics Other featured resources and services were associated with ethical issues (i e , racism and prejudice), educational and entertainment information (e g , virtual tours of parks), and personal experience documentation This observational study is the most recent investigation and documentation on the status, services, and resources of the academic MHSLs in the United States during the initial U S outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic Although the current health crisis is taking a heavy toll on libraries nationwide, MHSLs are still managing to play a vital role in supporting the academic communities, healthcare facilities, and the general public and fighting against the pandemic and the resulting information crisis","output":"How American Academic Medical/Health Sciences Libraries Responded to the COVID-19 Health Crisis: An Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed patient-provider communication in HIV care; data were from the 2019 Positive Perspectives Survey of people living with HIV (PLHIV) from 25 countries (n = 2389).

In particular, survivors of critical illness have significantly elevated risk of developing lasting cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we examine the role of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids in neuropsychiatric outcomes following critical illness. Illness is marked by acute elevation of free cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone suppression, which typically normalize after recovery; however, prolonged dysregulation can sometimes occur. High glucocorticoid levels can cause lasting alterations to the plasticity and structural integrity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and this mechanism may plausibly contribute to impaired memory and cognition in critical illness survivors, though specific evidence is lacking. Glucocorticoids may also exacerbate inflammation-associated neural damage. Conversely, current evidence indicates that glucocorticoids during illness may protect against the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. We propose future directions for research in this field, including determining the role of persistent glucocorticoid elevations after illness in neuropsychiatric outcomes, the role of systemic vs neuroinflammation, and probing unexplored lines of investigation on the role of mineralocorticoid receptors and the gutCbrain axis.

Methods: Oil red O staining was used to determine the effect of HSP on hepatic steatosis in rat liver tissues. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to functional enrichment analysis by bioinformatics. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of GRP94, ATF6, ATF4, p-PERK, p-IRE1, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in liver tissues and THP-1 cell lines, and the expression of GRP94 and p-PERK in vitro was detected through immunofluorescence staining. Results: HSP significantly decreased the weight gain, hepatic steatosis but not serum lipid profile and suppressed the serum levels of inflammatory factors in HFD-fed rats. It was revealed by bioinformatics analysis that the inflammatory response and IRE1 activation were enriched signaling pathways in NAFLD. The expression of ERS-related biomarkers, GRP94, ATF6, ATF4, p-PERK and p- IRE1, was significantly suppressed by HSP in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the inflammatory markers, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, were also decreased by HSP in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining exposed that the expression of GRP94 and p-PERK was decreased by HSP in vitro.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. METHODS: We present a data-driven method to quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), could lead to the change of malaria transmission potential in 2020. First, we adopt a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate epidemiological parameters in each country by fitting the time series of the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases. Then, we simulate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 under two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing, and (2) early identification and isolation of cases. Based on the simulated epidemic curves, we quantify the impact of COVID-19 epidemic and NPIs on the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Finally, by treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020, we evaluate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential based on the notion of vectorial capacity. RESULTS: We conduct case studies in four malaria-endemic countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia, in Africa. The epidemiological parameters (i.e., the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the duration of infection [Formula: see text] ) of COVID-19 in each country are estimated as follows: Ethiopia ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ), Nigeria ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ), Tanzania ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ), and Zambia ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ). Based on the estimated epidemiological parameters, the epidemic curves simulated under various NPIs indicated that the earlier the interventions are implemented, the better the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, the effect of combined NPIs is better than contact restriction and social distancing only. By treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020 as a baseline, our results show that even with stringent NPIs, malaria transmission potential will remain higher than expected in the second half of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: By quantifying the impact of various NPI response to the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential, this study provides a way to jointly address the syndemic between COVID-19 and malaria in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. The results suggest that the early intervention of COVID-19 can effectively reduce the scale of the epidemic and mitigate its impact on malaria transmission potential.","output":"Accessing the syndemic of COVID-19 and malaria intervention in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare patient characteristics and midterm outcomes after RFA for unresectable Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian and European cohorts. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was based on retrospective analysis of 279 patients (mean 64.8  12.1 years; 208 males) treated with RFA for de novo HCC in tertiary referral centers in Singapore and the Netherlands, with median follow-up of 28.2 months (quartiles: 13.1-40.5 months). Cumulative incidence of recurrence and death were analyzed using a competing risk model. RESULTS Age was higher in the Asian group: 66.5 versus 60.1 years (p < 0.0001). The most common etiology was hepatitis B in the Asian group (48.0 %) and alcohol-induced cirrhosis in Europeans (54.4 %); p < 0.001. Asian patients had less advanced disease: 35.5, 55.0, and 3.0 %, respectively, had BCLC 0, A, and B versus 21.5, 58.2, and 15.2 % in the European group (p = 0.01). The cumulative incidences of recurrence in the Asian group at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years were 37.0, 56.4, 62.3, and 67.7 %, respectively, compared to 32.6, 47.2, 49.7, and 53.4 % in the European group (p = 0.474).

CONCLUSION Similar short-term treatment outcomes are achieved with RFA in HCC patients in the South-East Asian and Northern-European populations. Midterm recurrence and death rates differ between the groups as a result of differences in baseline patient characteristics and patient selection.

Here we describe a novel case of hirudotherapy in an intubated patient with macroglossia related to oral trauma and venous congestion. The patient was a 23-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity initially admitted to an outside hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. She received early treatment with supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab but developed worsening respiratory failure requiring intubation on hospital day 13. Despite neuromuscular blockade and proning, she remained difficult to oxygenate and was transferred to our hospital 24 days after admission. Weaning of pharmacologic paralysis was complicated by ongoing ventilator dyssynchrony, and she continued to require deep sedation with multiple agents, including phenobarbital. Her respiratory status gradually improved, but weaning of sedation was marked by agitation and tongue biting. On day 50, significant isolated tongue edema was noted. Further trauma was observed on the ventral aspect of the swollen tongue where it came into contact with the teeth. High-level ventilatory support precluded tracheostomy, and conservative management with repositioning of the endotracheal tube and insertion of a bite block did not resolve the edema. The otolaryngology service was consulted, and the decision was made to trial an application of medicinal leeches. The patient received two courses of hirudotherapy with packing of the oropharynx to prevent leech migration, resulting in significant improvement of her edema. Among already mechanically ventilated patients, macroglossia remains a rare but documented complication. Endotracheal tube position and proning are the most frequently implicated etiologies. In this instance, oral trauma from tongue-biting coupled with impaired lymphovascular return from extrinsic impingement on the swollen tongue were thought to be the cause. Therapeutic options are limited and include ice, elevation, bite block placement, intravenous steroids, manual reduction and compression wrapping. In extreme cases, tracheostomy and even partial glossectomy have been performed. Hirudotherapy is well described in modern clinical practice among facial reconstructive surgeons for the management of venous congestion and resultant compromise of pedicle or microvascular tissue-free transfer flaps. Few case reports in the trauma literature have described its use with macroglossia on presentation, but its use in cases of post-intubation trauma appears novel. Given the frequent contribution of venous congestion in intubated patients with macroglossia, hirudotherapy should be considered a logical treatment modality in cases where conservative measures are unsuccessful.","output":"Hirudotherapy in the management of post-intubation macroglossia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treatment-related pneumonitis represents a major challenge in oncology patients undergoing therapy, and imaging plays an essential role in detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of pneumonitis in these patients.

African-American, Latinx, and Asian-American youth often achieve admirable academic success despite limited social capital and high early life stress by adopting a striving persistent behavioral style (SPBS).

Unfortunately, a young persons resilience in one domain (i.e., academic) can come at a cost in other domains, including physical and mental health morbidities that are under-identified and under-treated. Indeed, research suggests a link between SPBS in the face of adversity and later health morbidities among ethnic minority youth.

(2) To define modifiable clinical variables that reduce the magnitude of antenna coupling. BACKGROUND Mechanisms of electrosurgical burns where monitoring devices contact the surgical patient are unclear. Antenna coupling occurs when the \\"bovie\\" active electrode (electrically active transmitting antenna) emits energy, which is captured by a nonelectrically active wire (electrically inactive receiving antenna) in close proximity without direct contact. METHODS Monopolar radiofrequency energy was delivered to a laparoscopic instrument (electrically active transmitting antenna), whereas other nonelectrically active wires (electrically inactive receiving antenna) including electrocardiogram (EKG) lead, nonactive \\"bovie\\" pencil, and nerve electrode monitor were placed in proximity. Temperature changes of tissue placed adjacent to the electrically inactive receiving antennae were measured. RESULTS Nonelectrically active wires (receiving antenna) increase tissue temperature when lying parallel to the active electrode cord: EKG pad 2.4C  1.2C (P = 0.002), \\"bovie\\" pencil tip 90C  9C (P < 0.001), and nerve electrode monitor 106C  12C (P < 0.001). Factors that reduced the heat generated by antenna coupling included the following: increasing angulation between transmitting and receiving antennae (parallel = 90C  9C; 45 angle = 53C  10C; perpendicular = 35C  11C; P < .001), increasing separation distance between parallel transmitting and receiving antenna (<1 cm = 90C  9C; 15 cm = 44C  18C; 30 cm = 39C  2C; P < .001); and decreasing generator power setting (15 W = 59C  11C; 30 W = 90C  9C; 45 W = 98C  8C; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Antenna coupling occurs in common operating room scenarios.

A credible way of managing the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is by reducing risk factors. This understanding has led to the development and recommendation for the clinical use of cardiovascular risk stratification tools. These tools enhance clinical decision-making. However, there is a lag in the implementation of these tools in most countries. This systematic review seeks to synthesise the current knowledge of the factors influencing the implementation of cardiovascular risk scoring in primary care settings. METHODS We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature for studies of any design relating to the topic. Titles, abstracts and full texts were independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers. This was followed by quality assessment and data extraction. We analysed data using an integrated and best fit framework synthesis approach to identify these factors. Quantitative and qualitative forms of data were combined into a single mixed-methods synthesis. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used as the guiding tool and template for this analysis. RESULTS Twenty-five studies (cross-sectional n = 12, qualitative n = 9 and mixed-methods n = 4) were included in this review. Twenty (80%) of these were conducted in high-income countries. Only four studies (16%) included patients as participants. This review reports on a total of eleven cardiovascular risk stratification tools. The factors influencing the implementation of cardiovascular risk scoring are related to clinical setting and healthcare system (resources, priorities, practice culture and organisation), users (attributes and interactions between users) and the specific cardiovascular risk tool (characteristics, perceived role and effectiveness). CONCLUSIONS While these findings bolster the understanding of implementation complexity, there exists limited research in the context of low and middle-income countries. Notwithstanding the need to direct resources in bridging this gap, it is also crucial that these efforts are in concert with providing high-quality evidence on the clinical effectiveness of using cardiovascular risk scoring to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes of mortality and morbidity.

CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, which is an important mediator of leukocyte chemotaxis during the immune response. A deletion mutation (32) in this gene interferes with the response of immune cells, impairing viral clearance. We evaluated the CCR532 polymorphism (rs333) in individuals of the Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. METHODS: A total of 330 subjects with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, evaluated at health services in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil between June 2009 and August 2010, were genotyped for the 32 deletion (rs333). The cases were classified according to the progression of infection into a group of hospitalized patients (n = 156) and a group of non-hospitalized patients (n = 174). RESULTS: No significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of the CCR532 polymorphism were observed between non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients (p = 0.289 and p = 0.431, respectively). CONCLUSION: The 32 deletion in the CCR5 gene is not associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the Brazilian admixed population.

Methods: The observations of social distancing, daily deaths, infections along with the needed hospital resources for COVID-19 patient hospitalizations including the numbers of all hospital beds, beds needed in ICUs and infection wards, nursing staffs needed in ICUs and infection wards were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) by the University of Washington. The observations of social distancing were based on the reduction in human contact relative to background levels for each location quantified by cell phone mobility data collected from IHME. The weighted data per 100,000 population gathered in a 40-day period of the first wave of the pandemic in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Statistical technique of panel data analysis is used to measure the associations between our social distancing and COVID-19 indicators in long-run. Results: Results of dynamic long-run models confirm that a 1% rise in social distancing by reducing human contacts may decline daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, beds/nurses needed in ICUs and beds/nurses needed in infection wards due COVID-19 pandemic by 1.13%, 15.26%, 1.10%, 1.17% and 1.89%, respectively. Moreover, results of error correction models verify that if the equilibriums between these series are disrupted by a sudden change in social distancing, the lengths of restoring back to equilibrium are 67, 62, 40, 22 and 49 days for daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, nurses/beds needed in ICUs and nurses/beds needed in infection wards, respectively. Conclusion: Proper social distancing was a successful policy for tackling COVID-19 with falling mortality and infection rates as well as the needed hospital resources for patient hospitalizations in Nordic countries. The results alert governments of the need for continuously implementing social distancing policies while using vaccines to prevent outbreaks and reduce the burden of patient hospitalizations on nursing and medical staff.","output":"Role of social distancing in tackling COVID-19 during the first wave of pandemic in Nordic region: Evidence from daily deaths, infections and needed hospital resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herbal medicines are widely consumed by the people of Pakistan for the treatment of various diseases.

We aimed to explore the pandemic's impact on the well-being and cognition of older adults living in the United States (US), Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. METHODS: 1,608 (646 White, 852 Latino, 77 Black, 33 Asian; 72% female) individuals from the US and four Latin American countries aged  55 years completed an online survey regarding well-being and cognition during the pandemic between May and September 2020. Outcome variables (pandemic impact, discrimination, loneliness, purpose of life, subjective cognitive concerns) were compared across four US ethnoracial groups and older adults living in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. FINDINGS: Mean age for all participants was 66.7 (SD = 7.7) years and mean education was 15.4 (SD = 2.7) years. Compared to Whites, Latinos living in the US reported greater economic impact (p < .001, (p)(2) = 0.031); while Blacks reported experiencing discrimination more often (p < .001, (p)(2) = 0.050). Blacks and Latinos reported more positive coping (p < .001, (p)(2) = 0.040). Compared to Latinos living in the US, Latinos in Chile, Mexico, and Peru reported greater pandemic impact, Latinos in Mexico and Peru reported more positive coping, Latinos in Argentina, Mexico, and Peru had greater economic impact, and Latinos in Argentina, Chile, and Peru reported less discrimination.

To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs are based on serum detection of Abs to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralizing Abs) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that is known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of Ags released from infected cells could stimulate Ab responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other nonstructural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titer IgG, IgM, and IgA Ab responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher Ab titers in these assays associated with more-severe disease, and no cross-reactive Abs against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG Abs specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 Ags can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent Ag in infected patients that can be used in serological tests, and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, noninvasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Cysteine-like Protease Antibodies Can Be Detected in Serum and Saliva of COVID-19-Seropositive Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic is here to stay- evident from the second wave that is severely affecting global population.

Relative free energy of binding for all the phytochemicals were calculated by MM/PBSA. Minimum energy structures were extracted from their free energy landscapes and were subjected to PSN-ENM-NMA and network centrality analysis. Results showed that the phytochemical binding changes the residue-residue interaction network. Network communities increase while hubs and links decrease. Metapath rewiring occurs through residues Phe456 in spike protein, Thr26 and Tyr118 in main protease, Val49 and Phe156 in NSP3, Leu98 in NSP9, Leu4345 in NSP10, Phe440 and Phe843 in NSP12.

The detection of NAb against SARS-CoV-2 is a simple and direct approach for evaluating a vaccines effectiveness. In this study, a direct, rapid, and point-of-care bicolor lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) was developed for NAb against SARS-CoV-2 detection without sample pretreatment, and which was based on the principle of NAb-mediated blockage of the interaction between RBD and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In the bicolor LFIA, red and blue latex microspheres (LMs) were used to locate the test and control lines, leading to avoidance of erroneous interpretations of one-colored line results. Under the optimal conditions, NAb against SARS-CoV-2 detection carried out using the bicolor LFIA could be completed within 9 min, and the visible limit of detection was about 48 ng/mL. Thirteen serum samples were analyzed, and the results showed that the NAb levels in three positive serum samples were equal to, or higher than, 736 ng/mL.

In particular, the number of severe courses of the disease is still dramatically high. An efficient drug therapy that helps to improve significantly the fatal combination of damages in the airway epithelia, in the extensive pulmonary microvascularization and finally multiorgan failure, is missing. The physiological, inorganic polymer, polyphosphate (polyP) is a molecule which could prevent the initial phase of the virus life cycle, the attachment of the virus to the target cells, and improve the epithelial integrity as well as the mucus barrier. Results: Surprisingly, polyP matches perfectly with the cationic groove on the RBD. Subsequent binding studies disclosed that polyP, with a physiological chain length of 40 phosphate residues, abolishes the binding propensity of the RBD to the ACE2 receptor. In addition to this first mode of action of polyP, this polymer causes in epithelial cells an increased gene expression of the major mucins in the airways, of MUC5AC and MUC1, as well as a subsequent glycoprotein production. MUC5AC forms a gel-like mucus layer trapping inhaled particles which are then transported out of the airways, while MUC1 constitutes the periciliary liquid layer and supports ciliary beating. As a third mode of action, polyP undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds in the airway system by alkaline phosphatase, releasing metabolic energy.

The aim of this survey was to understand current national practices and sentiment concerning ERAS for renal transplant recipients in the UK. METHODOLOGY: A national web-based survey was sent to consultant surgeons at all 23 UK adult renal transplant units. Completed questionnaires were collected between May and July 2020. Data were analysed according to individual responses and grouped according to the existence of formal ERAS pathways within units. RESULTS: All transplant units were represented in this survey. Three units had a formal ERAS pathway for all recipients. Of the remaining units, 65.9% considered implementing an ERAS pathway in the near future. The most commonly perceived barrier to ERAS implementation was 'embedded culture within transplant units' (54.8% of respondents). A fifth of respondents insert surgical drains selectively and 11.7% routinely discontinue patient-controlled analgesia on postoperative day 1. Most respondents routinely remove urinary catheters on day 5 (70%) and ureteric stents 4-6 weeks post-transplantation (81.7%). Median length of stay for deceased donor kidney transplant recipients was lower in units with ERAS programmes (5-7 days versus 8-10 days, respectively). The main cited barriers for discharge were 'suboptimal fluid balance' and 'requirement of treatment for rejection'.

At that time data on patients with rheumatic diseases and immunomodulatory treatment was lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to analyze the influence of the SARS-CoV?2 pandemic on the clinical treatment strategy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 16 March and 31 July 2020 all patients who consecutively presented at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Klinikum rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich were included in the study. Individual treatment adjustments were based on clinical judgment and the recommendations for action of the German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh). RESULTS: A total of 322 patients were included. The most frequent diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis with 17%, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) with 14% and SLE with 12%. Of the patients 262 were on DMARD treatment and 77 received oral glucocorticoids. There were 5 cases of suspected SARS-CoV?2 infection; however, no patient verifiably became ill due to COVID-19. In 40 patients, treatment adjustments were done due to the pandemic, whereby 3 patients developed a flare of the underlying disease. In retrospect, treatment de-escalation occurred most frequently in AAV, IgG4-related disease, immunosuppressive treatment with rituximab and the simultaneous presence of malignant diseases. CONCLUSION: The total lack of confirmed SARS-CoV?2 infections in an otherwise strongly affected region could indicate that the infection risk for SARS-CoV?2 is not substantially increased for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of olfaction and taste disorders in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and their association with other clinical manifestations and patient evolution during hospitalization. METHODS: 248 patients, admitted to three public hospitals in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, were prospectively included: Hospital das Clnicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG), Hospital Jlia Kubitschek (HJK) and Hospital Eduardo de Menezes (HEM), who, upon admission to hospital, presented with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory variables and outcomes during hospitalization were prospectively collected from the electronic medical records. The collection of sociodemographic and symptomatology data during the acute phase was carried out prospectively in electronic medical records and confirmed with the patients at a subsequent outpatient visit. RESULTS: The most frequently reported symptoms were dyspnea (77.4%), cough (69.8%) and fever (55.2%). During the acute phase of the disease, 95 (38.3%) and 87 (35.1%) patients reported taste and olfaction disorders, respectively. There was a lower prevalence of dysosmia among patients with previous comorbidities (p < 0.05).

Therefore, countries are encouraged to work towards more resilient health systems. This qualitative study aims to examine the performance of the health system of the Dutch Caribbean island of Cura?ao regarding the prevention and control of VBDs in the last decade by using the WHO health system building blocks. METHODS: From November 2018 to December 2020, a multi-method qualitative study was performed in Cura?ao, applying content analysis of documents (n = 50), five focus group discussions (n = 30), interviews with experts (n = 11) and 15 observation sessions. The study was designed based on the WHO framework: health system building blocks. Two cycles of inductive and deductive coding were employed, and Nvivo software was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: This studys data highlighted the challenges (e.g. insufficient oversight, coordination, leadership skills, structure and communication) that the departments of the health system of Cura?ao faced during the last three epidemics of VBDs (2010C2020). Furthermore, low levels of collaboration between governmental and non-governmental organisations (e.g. semi-governmental and private laboratories) and insufficient capacity building to improve skills (e.g. entomological, surveillance skills) were also observed. Lastly, we observed how bottlenecks in one building block negatively influenced other building blocks (e.g. inadequate leadership/governance obstructed the workforce's performance). CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers potential organisational bottlenecks that have affected the performance of the health system of Cura?ao negatively. We recommend starting with the reinforcement of oversight of the integrated vector management programme to ensure the development, implementation and evaluation of related legislation, policies and interventions. Also, we recommend evaluating and reforming the existing administrative and organisational structure of the health system by considering the cultural style, challenges and barriers of the current health system. More efforts are needed to improve the documentation of agreements, recruitment and evaluation of the workforce's performance. Based on our findings, we conceptualised actions to strengthen the health system's building blocks to improve its performance for future outbreaks of infectious diseases.

The present study examined adolescents' academic worries amid the COVID-19 pandemic and their perspectives on pandemic-related changes in teacher and peer relations. Participants were 452 adolescents (55% female) between the ages of 11 and 17, who completed online surveys asking them about their worries about their schoolwork and educational futures, perceived support from teachers, and perceptions of electronic (cyber) bullying during the pandemic. Results indicated that COVID-related academic worries pertaining to motivation to focus on and complete schoolwork were most frequent. High school students and female students reported heightened academic worries compared to middle school students and male students. In addition, the majority of adolescents indicated decreased support from teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including more than two-thirds (69%) who reported reduced communication with teachers. Adolescents perceived relative consistency in electronic (cyber) bullying throughout the pandemic, and a third of students indicated that cyberbullying has become more of a problem and increased in frequency during this time period. Perceived changes in cyberbullying were consistent across grade level and gender. Findings emphasize the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' secondary schooling experiences and underscore the importance of bolstering social resources to minimize the short- and long-term impact of the pandemic on students' academic functioning.

To facilitate these beneficial effects it is important to explore the perspectives of health care professionals (HCPs) on the integration of placebo effects in clinical care. Three themes were investigated: knowledge about placebo effects and factors that contribute to these, frequency of placebo use, and attitudes toward acceptability and transparency of placebo use in treatment. Methods: A cross-sectional survey, according to the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys guidelines and STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE), was conducted in the Netherlands in 2020. The survey was conducted in two samples: a (nested) short survey in 78 nurses during working shifts (sample 1) and an extended online survey in 47 general HCPs e.g., medical psychologists, oncologists, surgeons (sample 2). Results: Respondents from both samples reported to be somewhat or quite familiar with placebo effects (24.0 and 47.2%, respectively). From the six placebo mechanisms that were presented, mind-body interaction, positive expectations, and brain activity involved in placebo effects were rated as the most influential factors in placebo effects [F((5,119)) = 20.921, p < 0.001]. The use of placebo effects was reported in 53.8% (n = 42) of the nurses (e.g., by inducing positive expectations), and 17.4% of the HCPs (n = 8 reported to make use of pure placebos and 30.4% of impure placebos (n = 14). Attitudes toward placebo use in treatment were acceptant, and transparency was highly valued (both up to 51%). Conclusions: The findings from this study address knowledge gaps in placebo effects in practice and provide insights in attitudes toward the integration of placebo effects from HCPs.

The proposed technique is the consolidation of both the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) and Human urbanization algorithm (HUA) based Recurrent Perceptron Neural Network (RPNN), and hence it is named as TSVD-HUARPNN technique. TSVD is matrix decomposition, this technique qualify the outcome it as fast or not. In the proposed work, the qualification of the results from the TSVD is improved by a lemma theorem; it is a proven proposition which is used to obtain a larger and optimal result. For that reason, it is also known as a \\"helping theorem\\" or an \\"auxiliary theorem\\". Here, it has two modules for power system fault analysis: (i) fault detection, (ii) fault classification. The first process of the proposed system is the generation of the dataset of normal and abnormal conditions of transmission line parameters of power system using TSVD. The extracted dataset is assessed by HUA-based RPNN system to classify the fault analysis that occurs in transmission system. The TSVD-HUARPNN system is used to predict and classify the fault present in the transmission line. The proposed TSVD-HUARPNN system ensures the system with less complexity for the detection and classification of the fault, therefore the accuracy of the system is increased. By then, the proposed model is activated in MATLAB/Simulink, its performance is evaluated with the existing models. The performance with noise at 20 dB of the proposed technique is 99.77%.","output":"Optimally detecting and classifying the transmission line fault in power system using hybrid technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Spondyloarthropathy patients have reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL) compared to general population. Biological treatment strategies in real life aim to reduce patients' symptoms and different HRQL parameters would share the same behavior as patients' symptoms and disease activity. Objectives: We aim to assess the differences in HRQL reported by spondyloarthropathy patients during the first six months of biological therapy according to the treatment effectiveness. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study of six months of follow-up in spondyloarthropathy patients who are newly on biological therapy. A basal visit and 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up visits were conducted. We analyzed changes during follow-up in the HRQL parameters reported by patients through AsqoL and ASAS-health-index questionnaires. Moreover we measured functional disability through HAQ and BASFI index, disease activity by BASDAI, ASDAS-CRP and ASDAS-ESR index. Statistical analyses were achieved using R software, through multivariate linear regression models for continuous data and Bayesian mixed ordinal regression models with monotonic effect for ordinal data. The corresponding odd ratios (OR) were calculated with their confidence intervals (CI 95%). Results: We included 53 patients (71.77% male), the 73.58% diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and the 26.42% with axial spondyloarthritis. Mean age at the beginning of treatment was 48.74 (11.21) years, mean age at diagnosis was 41.57 (11.97) and mean disease evolution was 7.19 (9.24) years. 60.42% of them exhibited HLAb27 positivity. 34 patients started biological therapy with TNF- inhibitors and 19 with IL-17 inhibitors. The 81.13% of patients were under monotherapy, and the other 18.87% was treated with DMARDs. The 77.36% of the total number of patients was on the biological therapy at 6 months of follow-up, while the 22.64% discontinued at 6 months of follow-up (9 due to inefficacy and 3 due to adverse effects). 42 patients completed the follow-up at 6 months, and 3 patients achieved until visit 3 due to treatment failure. In 1 case visit 1 and in 7 cases visit 3 could not be performed due to COVID19 pandemic situation. We observed a significant correlation among AsqoL and ASAS-hi values with disease activity indexes (BASDAI, ASDAS-CRP, ASDAS-ESR) and functional disability (HAQ, BASFI). The statistical analyses showed a significant association where AsqoL and ASAS-hi values are significantly decreased in treatment failures compared to the successful treatment (, and in patients with previous biological therapy compared to na?ve patients. No effect of years of disease evolution and the type of biological treatment in the AsqoL and ASAS-hi values was observed. (See Table 1) These results were consistent with the significant association found among the disease activity and functional disability with the biological therapy efficacy and the previous biological treatment. Conclusion: The AsqoL and ASAS-hi questionnaire results are correlated with disease activity and functional disability and showed the same behaviour as these parameters, being also associated to the biological therapy efficacy as well as to previous biological therapies. The HRQL variables would be additional clinical results that make it possible to achieve a better management of biological therapies in spondyloarthropathy patients.","output":"Health-related quality of life measures in spondyloarthropaty patients under biological therapies in real life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the crude mortality rate could reach 49% in critical patients.

Finally, we intend to evaluate neutrophil associated genes as targets for host directed therapy to reduce pathological damage caused by NETosis. Methods: Quantitative PCR will be used to quantify expression of specific genes identified in the blood of individuals with active lung disease (n=30), compared to those from healthy (n=30) and latently infected individuals (LTBI) (n=30). In addition, temporal events associated with NETosis will be measured using live microscopy in a neutrophil in vitro model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Candidate genes found to be associated with NETosis will be targeted with pharmaceutical inhibitors.

The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","output":"A Multibasic Cleavage Site in the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Is Essential for Infection of Human Lung Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To compare the characteristics of compulsory admissions (CAs) and voluntary admissions (VAs) in a General Hospital Psychiatric Unit (GHPU), and to assess whether CA and VA patients outcomes improved during hospitalisation and followup in mental health services (MHS) based on community continuity of care. Design and methods: Observational longitudinal study comparing 19 CAs and 83 VAs consecutively admitted to GHPU of Udine, Italy, and followed-up for six-months by MHS. Five psychometric scales assessed psychosocial and clinical characteristics for each patient at admission (T0), discharge (T1) and follow-up (T2). Statistical analyses were performed using: multivariate logistic regression for comparing CA and VA; Friedman 2 and Mann-Whitney tests for outcomes improvement. Results: Being hospitalised for a psychotic crisis was the most significant predictor of CA (OR = 5.07). An outcomes improvement was observed from T0 to T1 in almost all psychometric tests, while from T1 to T2 only for PSP-A (useful social activities), CGI-S (severity of illness) and CGI-EI (drugs efficacy related to side effects). CA was associated to lower performances in all scales at T0, in GAF and CGI-S at T1, while no difference with VA was observed at T2. Conclusions: CA and VA patients improved to a same extent during hospitalisation and follow-up, particularly in relation to social functioning. This fosters the hypothesis that communitybased MHS using a longitudinal continuity of care model might achieve recovery in a long-term perspective. Future research may benefit by considering patients subjective experiences and assessing long-term improvement in those who received personcentred interventions.","output":"Are patients improving during and after a psychiatric hospitalisation?

DLSP built onto previous efforts by malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) programs and supported the expansion of the diagnostic expertise and capacity in KEMRI and the Ministry of Health. First, DLSP developed laboratory capacity for surveillance of diarrheal, respiratory, zoonotic and febrile illnesses to understand the etiology burden of these common illnesses and support evidenced-based decisions on vaccine introductions and recommendations in Kenya. Second, we have evaluated and implemented new diagnostic technologies such as TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) to detect emerging or reemerging pathogens and have recently added a next generation sequencer (NGS). Third, DLSP provided rapid laboratory diagnostic support for outbreak investigation to Kenya and regional countries. Fourth, DLSP has been assisting the Kenya National Public Health laboratory-National Influenza Center and microbiology reference laboratory to obtain World Health Organization (WHO) certification and ISO15189 accreditation respectively. Fifth, we have supported biosafety and biosecurity curriculum development to help Kenyan laboratories safely and appropriately manage infectious pathogens. These achievements, highlight how in collaboration with existing CDC programs working on HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, the Global Health Security Agenda can have significantly improve public health in Kenya and the region.

In each case, one or a small set of viral surface transmembrane glycoproteins mediates fusion. Viral fusion proteins vary in their mode of activation and in structural class. These features combine to yield many different fusion mechanisms. Despite their differences, common principles for how fusion proteins function are emerging: In response to an activating trigger, the metastable fusion protein converts to an extended, in some cases rodlike structure, which inserts into the target membrane via its fusion peptide. A subsequent conformational change causes the fusion protein to fold back upon itself, thereby bringing its fusion peptide and its transmembrane domainand their attached target and viral membranesinto intimate contact. Fusion ensues as the initial lipid stalk progresses through local hemifusion, and then opening and enlargement of a fusion pore. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of how fusion proteins are activated, how fusion proteins change conformation during fusion, and what is happening to the lipids during fusion. We also briefly discuss the therapeutic potential of fusion inhibitors in treating viral infections.","output":"The Many Mechanisms of Viral Membrane Fusion Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infections with SARS-CoV-2 continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality. Interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 blockade have been proposed as therapeutic strategies in COVID-19, but study outcomes have been conflicting. We sought to study whether blockade of the IL-6 or IL-1 pathway shortened the time to clinical improvement in patients with COVID-19, hypoxic respiratory failure, and signs of systemic cytokine release syndrome. METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial, in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, hypoxia, and signs of a cytokine release syndrome across 16 hospitals in Belgium. Eligible patients had a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 with symptoms between 6 and 16 days, a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2):FiO(2)) of less than 350 mm Hg on room air or less than 280 mm Hg on supplemental oxygen, and signs of a cytokine release syndrome in their serum (either a single ferritin measurement of more than 2000 g/L and immediately requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation, or a ferritin concentration of more than 1000 g/L, which had been increasing over the previous 24 h, or lymphopenia below 800/mL with two of the following criteria: an increasing ferritin concentration of more than 700 g/L, an increasing lactate dehydrogenase concentration of more than 300 international units per L, an increasing C-reactive protein concentration of more than 70 mg/L, or an increasing D-dimers concentration of more than 1000 ng/mL). The COV-AID trial has a 2  2 factorial design to evaluate IL-1 blockade versus no IL-1 blockade and IL-6 blockade versus no IL-6 blockade. Patients were randomly assigned by means of permuted block randomisation with varying block size and stratification by centre. In a first randomisation, patients were assigned to receive subcutaneous anakinra once daily (100 mg) for 28 days or until discharge, or to receive no IL-1 blockade (1:2). In a second randomisation step, patients were allocated to receive a single dose of siltuximab (11 mg/kg) intravenously, or a single dose of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) intravenously, or to receive no IL-6 blockade (1:1:1). The primary outcome was the time to clinical improvement, defined as time from randomisation to an increase of at least two points on a 6-category ordinal scale or to discharge from hospital alive. The primary and supportive efficacy endpoints were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the safety population. This study is registered online with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04330638) and EudraCT (2020-001500-41) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between April 4, and Dec 6, 2020, 342 patients were randomly assigned to IL-1 blockade (n=112) or no IL-1 blockade (n=230) and simultaneously randomly assigned to IL-6 blockade (n=227; 114 for tocilizumab and 113 for siltuximab) or no IL-6 blockade (n=115). Most patients were male (265 [77%] of 342), median age was 65 years (IQR 54C73), and median Systematic Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at randomisation was 3 (2C4). All 342 patients were included in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. The estimated median time to clinical improvement was 12 days (95% CI 10C16) in the IL-1 blockade group versus 12 days (10C15) in the no IL-1 blockade group (hazard ratio [HR] 094 [95% CI 073C121]). For the IL-6 blockade group, the estimated median time to clinical improvement was 11 days (95% CI 10C16) versus 12 days (11C16) in the no IL-6 blockade group (HR 100 [078C129]). 55 patients died during the study, but no evidence for differences in mortality between treatment groups was found. The incidence of serious adverse events and serious infections was similar across study groups. INTERPRETATION: Drugs targeting IL-1 or IL-6 did not shorten the time to clinical improvement in this sample of patients with COVID-19, hypoxic respiratory failure, low SOFA score, and low baseline mortality risk.

Mobile app developers check their users' reviews frequently to clarify the issues experienced by users or capture the new issues that are introduced due to a recent app update. App reviews have a dynamic nature and their discussed topics change over time. The changes in the topics among collected reviews for different versions of an app can reveal important issues about the app update. A main technique in this analysis is using topic modeling algorithms. However, app reviews are short texts and it is challenging to unveil their latent topics over time. Conventional topic models suffer from the sparsity of word co-occurrence patterns while inferring topics for short texts. Furthermore, these algorithms cannot capture topics over numerous consecutive time-slices. Online topic modeling algorithms speed up the inference of topic models for the texts collected in the latest time-slice by saving a fraction of data from the previous time-slice. But these algorithms do not analyze the statistical-data of all the previous time-slices, which can confer contributions to the topic distribution of the current time-slice. We propose Adaptive Online Biterm Topic Model (AOBTM) to model topics in short texts adaptively. AOBTM alleviates the sparsity problem in short-texts and considers the statistical-data for an optimal number of previous time-slices. We also propose parallel algorithms to automatically determine the optimal number of topics and the best number of previous versions that should be considered in topic inference phase.

The spatial dissemination of droplets varies according to their initial velocity. After a short literature review, our goal was to determine the velocity of the exhaled air during vocal exercises. METHODS: A propylene glycol cloud produced by 2 e-cigarettes' users allowed visualization of the exhaled air emitted during vocal exercises. Airflow velocities were measured during the first 200 ms of a long exhalation, a sustained vowel /a/ and varied vocal exercises. For the long exhalation and the sustained vowel /a/, the decrease of airflow velocity was measured until 3 s. Results were compared with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study using boundary conditions consistent with our experimental study. RESULTS: Regarding the production of vowels, higher velocities were found in loud and whispered voices than in normal voice. Voiced consonants like /?/ or /v/ generated higher velocities than vowels. Some voiceless consonants, e.g., /t/ generated high velocities, but long exhalation had the highest velocities. Semi-occluded vocal tract exercises generated faster airflow velocities than loud speech, with a decreased velocity during voicing. The initial velocity quickly decreased as was shown during a long exhalation or a sustained vowel /a/. Velocities were consistent with the CFD data. CONCLUSION: Initial velocity of the exhaled air is a key factor influencing droplets trajectory. Our study revealed that vocal exercises produce a slower airflow than long exhalation.

Specimens provided from urogenital, rectal and pharyngeal sites were analyzed using nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to detect CT/NG. Prevalence estimates of CT/NG, overall and by anatomical site were calculated. All estimates are RDS-adjusted. RESULTS: Among 1177 GBM, the prevalence of rectal, urogenital, pharyngeal and overall were respectively 2.4%, 0.4%, 0.4% and 2.8% for CT infections, and 3.1%, 0.4%, 3.5% and 5.6% for NG infections. If testing had been limited to the urogenital site, 80% and 94% of CT and NG infections, respectively, would have been missed. CONCLUSIONS: This community-based study among GBM shows that the CT prevalence was about half of that observed for NG. A large part of CT/NG infections involves only the extragenital sites, highlighting the need for systematic multisite screening regardless of symptoms. In the mist of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited CT/NG screening capacity due to test kits shortage, it might be considered to prioritize rectal and pharyngeal CT/NG testing over urogenital testing in asymptomatic GBM.","output":"Community-based Prevalence Estimates of Chlamydia Trachomatis and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Infections among Gay, Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men in Montral, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid/protein complex synthesized by the alveolar epithelium and secreted into the airspaces, where it coats and protects the large respiratory airCliquid interface.

The CSF of Neuro-COVID patients exhibited an expansion of dedifferentiated monocytes and of exhausted CD4(+) T cells. Neuro-COVID CSF leukocytes featured an enriched interferon signature; however, this was less pronounced than in viral encephalitis.

Nowhere in the world is such interest more palpable than in Western countries, including Norway. An expanding amount of literature has demonstrated that preexisting socio-economic inequalities have affected Covid-19 control programs through a disruption of immigrants uptake to preventive measures. Nonetheless, until very recently, no qualitative research has been conducted to address the impact of socio-economic and socio-cultural factors on immigrants uptake on preventive measures of Covid-19 in Norway. Methods: An interview-based qualitative study consisting of 88 participants (49 women and 39 men) from 10 immigrant ethnic groups were carried out. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling and snowballing. In-depth interviews were held through telephone or online for those who have experience in the use of zoom or teams. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis Results: We found that participants attitudes toward the pandemic in general, and more specifically their adherence to preventive measures, have increased over time. However, the number of barriers that hinder immigrants from adhering to preventive measures were identified and classified more broadly into three main subthemes: 1) socio-economic barriers; 2) socio-cultural barriers, and 3) other barriers. Socio-economic barriers include overcrowded households, working in first-line jobs, education and language. Socio-cultural barriers include collectivist culture, religious fatalism and risk perception toward the pandemic. Conclusion: To reduce the health inequality that arises from overcrowded housing, there is a need for a long-term strategy to help improve the housing situation of low-income immigrant families that live in overcrowded households. In addition, increasing health literacy and more generally, the integration of immigrants, may also reduce the effect of socio-cultural factors on an immigrant's uptake of preventive measures.","output":"Uptake of Covid-19 preventive measures among 10 immigrant ethnic groups in Norway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug nanoformulations hold remarkable promise for the efficient delivery of therapeutics to a disease site.

The key question that the authors try to address in this manuscript is whether there is value in using and refining current animal models for this pre-clinical testing, or whether these should be relinquished in favor of new, more human-relevant non-animal methods. ABSTRACT: Respiratory diseases constitute a huge burden in our society, and the global respiratory drug market currently grows at an annual rate between 4% and 6%. Inhalation is the preferred administration method for treating respiratory diseases, as it: (i) delivers the drug directly at the site of action, resulting in a rapid onset; (ii) is painless, thus improving patients compliance; and (iii) avoids first-pass metabolism reducing systemic side effects. Inhalation occurs through the mouth, with the drug generally exerting its therapeutic action in the lungs. In the most recent years, orally inhaled drugs (OIDs) have found application also in the treatment of systemic diseases. OIDs development, however, currently suffers of an overall attrition rate of around 70%, meaning that seven out of 10 new drug candidates fail to reach the clinic. Our commentary focuses on the reasons behind the poor OIDs translation into clinical products for the treatment of respiratory and systemic diseases, with particular emphasis on the parameters affecting the predictive value of animal preclinical tests. We then review the current advances in overcoming the limitation of animal animal-based studies through the development and adoption of in vitro, cell-based new approach methodologies (NAMs).","output":"Preclinical Development of Orally Inhaled Drugs (OIDs)Are Animal Models Predictive or Shall We Move Towards In Vitro Non-Animal Models?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is aimed to point out the current state of the COVID-19 pandemics in Italy.

The Sars-Cov-2 virus enters enterocytes through a novel mechanism via ACE- 2 receptors, which are expressed throughout the GI tract, especially in the mid-gut. Small bowel and colonic inflammation and alteration of the gut microbiome (altered inflammasome) have been observed. AIMS: We report a cluster of cases during the first and second wave UK pandemics involving young patients with unexplained segmental CT-proven colitis. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with CT proven colitis with no history of IBD, ischaemic colitis or significant medical comorbidities were included. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (median age 33 years; 8 females) were admitted under Emergency General Surgery between Mar 2020 & Jan 2021. All patients were previously well with no history of IBD, ischaemic colitis or significant medical comorbidities. Thirteen patients underwent CT imaging, showing evidence of colitis in 12, with changes affecting the right colon predominating. Campylobacter jejuni was identified in 4 of 7 stool cultures but only 1 patient had a positive PCR nasal swab and another had COVID antibodies detected in serum. Endoscopic and histological appearances of those undergoing colonoscopy were non-specific. CONCLUSION: These cases may represent Covid-19 involvement of the gut. Nasal swabs are not validated for use in the GI tract and detection of SARS-Cov-2 virus requires faecal or mucosal sampling.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the usage of face masks has become mandatory in many situations. Acoustic attenuation of sound pressure by the mask tissue reduces speech perception ability especially in noisy situations. Mask also impede the process of speech information from sight of the moving mouth (lip reading). In a prospective exploratory experimental study including 17 normal hearing participants, speech perception in noise and listening effort were measured with and without a surgical mask or an N95 mask between the speech signal and the listener. Additionally, the influence of the masks on the acoustic frequency spectrum was measured. Averaged over all noise signals, speech perception threshold in noise was significantly reduced by 1.6 dB (95% CI[1.0, 2.1]) by a surgical mask and by 2.7 dB (95% CI[2.2, 3.2]) using an N95 mask. The 50%-listening effort signal-to-noise ratio was not significantly increased by 0.58 dB (95% CI[0.4, 1.5]) by a surgical mask but significantly increased by 2.2 dB (95% CI[1.2, 3.1]) using an N95 mask. In acoustic measures the amplitudes were reduced by the mask tissue by up to 8 dB at frequencies above 1 kHz while no reduction was observed below 1 kHz. We conclude that face masks reduce speech perception and increase listening effort in different noise signals. Together with an additional interference by missing lip reading the compound effect of face masks would have a relevant impact on daily life communication already in normal hearing subjects.","output":"Influence of face surgical and N95 face masks on speech perception and listening effort in noise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In India, 100,340 confirmed cases and 3155 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 were reported as of May 18, 2020. Due to absence of specific vaccine or therapy, non-pharmacological interventions including social distancing, contact tracing are essential to end the worldwide COVID-19. We propose a mathematical model that predicts the dynamics of COVID-19 in 17 provinces of India and the overall India. A complete scenario is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date, which in turn divulges the predicted inflection point and ending phase of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed model monitors the dynamics of six compartments, namely susceptible (S), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), infected (I), isolated infected (I q) and quarantined susceptible (S q), collectively expressed SARII qS q. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values and the sensitive parameters are estimated from the real data on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between uninfected and infected individuals by quarantined the susceptible individuals, can effectively reduce the basic reproduction number. Our model simulations demonstrate that the elimination of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is possible by combining the restrictive social distancing and contact tracing. Our predictions are based on real data with reasonable assumptions, whereas the accurate course of epidemic heavily depends on how and when quarantine, isolation and precautionary measures are enforced.","output":"Modeling and forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoimmunity has emerged as a characteristic of the post-COVID syndrome (PCS), which may be related to sex.

Thirty pre-pandemic healthy individuals were included as a control group. The median age of patients was 49 years (IQR: 37.8 to 55.3). There were 47 males. The median post-COVID time was 219 (IQR: 143 to 258) days. Latent autoimmunity and polyautoimmunity were found in 83% and 62% of patients, respectively. Three patients developed an overt autoimmune disease. IgG antibodies against IL-2, CD8B, and thyroglobulin were found in more than 10% of the patients. Other IgG autoantibodies, such as anti-interferons, were positive in 5C10% of patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were found in > 85% of patients and were positively correlated with autoantibodies, age, and body mass index (BMI). Few autoantibodies were influenced by age and BMI. There was no effect of gender on the over- or under-expression of autoantibodies. IgG anti-IFN- antibodies were associated with the persistence of respiratory symptoms.

However, the association of individuals beliefs in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 with mental health and well-being issues has not been investigated. This association creates an assessable channel to identify and provide assistance to people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide the first evidence that belief in conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is a predictor of the mental health and well-being of health care workers. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 252 health care workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data regarding distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and the data regarding life and job satisfaction with linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 252 sampled health care workers in Ecuador, 61 (24.2%) believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 82 (32.5%) experienced psychological distress, and 71 (28.2%) had anxiety disorder. Compared to health care workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to report psychological distress and anxiety disorder and to have lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction among health care workers. This finding will enable mental health services to better target and provide help to mentally vulnerable health care workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Belief in a COVID-19 Conspiracy Theory as a Predictor of Mental Health and Well-Being of Health Care Workers in Ecuador: Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffs create a seal to protect against secretion entry to the lungs. Cuff inflation currently is recommended at 20-30 cm H2O pressure. ETT designs have variable seal performance in bench studies using rigid tracheal models lacking the dynamic characteristics of the human trachea. We compared ETT designs within a new, biorealistic tracheal model to assess cuff and suction performance in the setting of a compliant trachea. METHODS Three ETT designs (Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo, KimVent Microcuff, and Sheridan/HVT) were tested for performance by simulant leakage below the cuff and air leakage (measured as return tidal volume  80% delivered) over a range of cuff (5-25 cm H2O) and end-expiratory pressure (PEEP 0-15 cm H2O). Subglottic suction channel performance was tested in 2 ETTs (TaperGuard Evac [Covidien] and ISIS HVT [Teleflex]) as time to evacuate the simulant. RESULTS All ETT cuffs provided effective seals at an inflation pressure of 12 cm H2O when PEEP was  5 cm H2O. The Microcuff ETT sealed at the lowest pressure of 6 cm H2O, whereas the Sheridan/HVT cuff sealed at 12 cm H2O (P = .01). With a PEEP of 15 cm H2O, a reciprocal increase in air leak occurred, requiring a cuff inflation up to 22 cm H2O to maintain a return tidal volume at  80% delivered. Suction channel performance improved in the lateral position compared with supine for both ETT designs during continuous 15 mm Hg suction pressure (P = .001).

Although the result of reading this secret information contains a few errors, error-free secret information is obtainable when it is used with RSA cryptanalysis techniques. We performed a series of attacks incorporating RAMBleed and eventually retrieved the OpenSSL RSA private key, indicating that secret information is obtainable with high probability.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-five patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome treated with lopinavir/ritonavir in addition to a standard treatment protocol adopted by the Hospital Authority were matched with controls retrieved from the Hospital Authority severe acute respiratory syndrome central database. Matching was done with respect to age, sex, the presence of co-morbidities, lactate dehydrogenase level and the use of pulse steroid therapy. The 75 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir were divided into two subgroups for analysis: lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment, and lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy. These groups were compared with matched cohorts of 634 and 343 patients, respectively. Outcomes including overall death rate, oxygen desaturation, intubation rate, and use of pulse methylprednisolone were reviewed. RESULTS The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%), when compared with a matched cohort who received standard treatment (15.6% and 11.0% respectively, P<0.05) and a lower rate of use of methylprednisolone at a lower mean dose.

Digital finance has brought certain impact on economic growth, industrial structure, and resident income, which may affect pollution. The nexus of digital finance and environment in China is thus worth exploring. By revising the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve model with income inequality variable, this paper decomposes the environmental effects of economic activities into income growth effect, industrial structure effect and income inequality effect, and use panel data of Chinas provinces to conduct an empirical analysis. The results reveal the following: (1) the Environmental Kuznets Curve is still valid in sample, and digital finance can reduce air and water pollution (as measured through SO(2) and COD emission) directly; (2) in the influence mechanism, digital finance can alleviate income inequality and promote green industrial structure, thus reducing pollution indirectly, but the scale effect of income growth outweighs the technological effect, which increases pollution indirectly; and (3) digital finance has a threshold effect on improving the environment, then an acceleration effect appears after a certain threshold value. From the regional perspective, digital finance development in eastern regions is generally ahead of central and western regions, and the effects of environmental improvement in the eastern regions are greater. According to the study, this paper suggest that digital finance can be an effective way to promote social sustainability by alleviating income inequality and environmental sustainability by reducing pollution.","output":"Does the digital finance revolution validate the Environmental Kuznets Curve?

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic international travel largely ceased. In 2020 there were six HBB courses taught, compared to over 100 global trips and master training courses taught in 2019. In 2020, learners at all levels began utilizing video-based platforms for meetings, lectures, and even social activities. In the present study, we analyzed whether HBB could be modified into a video-based course. Methods: Prior to the start of the course, two HBB master trainers modified the HBB curriculum into a condensed hybrid course. Participants were randomly divided into two cohorts based on learner type;an in-person learner group and a Zoom learner group in a separate conference room. Participants were given a pre and post-course confidence survey consisting of 10 statements answered using a 10-point Likert scale. Responses were assigned a numerical value from zero to nine, with increasing numerical value indicating increased confidence. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS to run Wilcoxon signed rank tests to compare pre and post-test responses. After the course, each participant completed a previously validated written knowledge check and was observed by a trained instructor on two objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE). All participants passed both the knowledge check and both OSCE's. Results: Figure 1 shows the average Likert scale score for each survey question pre-course and postcourse by learner type. Figure 1: Pre and Post HBB Course Confidence Rating by Learner Type When comparing pre-and post-course survey data among the in-person learners, all questions had a statistically significant increase in confidence (p=0.005). Among Zoom learners, there was also a statistically significant increase from pre-course to post-course confidence (p=0.005). There was no statistically significant difference between the Zoom or In Person learners' confidence in skills or knowledge (p= 0.747). Conclusions: Our data shows teaching HBB through a video-based platform is an effective alternative to in-person learning. The development of this course serves as a model for global health education, with large impacts both during and after the current pandemic. This model would reduce the monetary cost of HBB training trips, and has the potential to reach delivery providers in rural or unsafe areas that were previously inaccessible. In addition, follow up studies show that long term skill acquisition declines over time. Video-communication platforms would facilitate the implementation of frequent reassessments in areas with existing HBB infrastructure.","output":"Helping babies breathe (HBB) in a pandemic: Breathing new life into an established curriculum by utilizing a video communication platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 9th International Workshop on Theorem-Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'20) was scheduled to happen on June 29 as a satellite of the IJCAR-FSCD 2020 joint meeting, in Paris.

Methods: Flight attendants were surveyed online with DASS-21 in May 2019 (N = 105; sample 1) and April 2020 (N = 1119; sample 2), complemented with questions about working conditions (in 2019) and existential fears and fear of job loss (in 2020). Results: Sample 1 revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress highly correlated with the subjective assessment of working conditions, but not with objectifiable parameters. Sample 2 showed significant positive correlations between existential fears and fear of job loss with depression, anxiety and stress. Crew members, grounded in April 2020, showed significantly higher scores in depression and stress, while still flying individuals had more clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Mean value comparisons between sample 1 and 2 in DASS-21 revealed a significant increase in symptoms at the time of crisis with effect sizes of d = 0.63 for depression, d = 0.26 for anxiety, and d = 0.52 for stress.

The aim of this exploratory study was to estimate changes in family circumstances, social and economic stability, care requirements and access to health services for patients during their first 12 months after ICU discharge. METHODS: Multi-center questionnaire-based study of survivors of critical illness at 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. RESULTS: Data for 293 consenting patients who spent greater than 48 hours in one of 22 UK ICUs were obtained at 6 and 12 months post-ICU discharge. There was little evidence of a change in accommodation or relationship status between pre-admission and 12 months following discharge from an ICU. A negative impact on family income was reported by 33% of all patients at 6 months and 28% at 12 months. There was nearly a 50% reduction in the number of patients who reported employment as their sole source of income at 12 months (19% to 11%) compared with pre-admission. One quarter of patients reported themselves in need of care assistance at 6 months and 22% at 12 months. The majority of care was provided by family members (80% and 78%, respectively), for half of whom there was a negative impact on employment. Amongst all patients receiving care, 26% reported requiring greater than 50 hours a week. Following discharge, 79% of patients reported attending their primary care physician and 44% had seen a community nurse. Mobility problems nearly doubled between pre-admission and 6 months (32% to 64%). Furthermore, 73% reported moderate or severe pain at 12 months and 44% remained significantly anxious or depressed. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of critical illness in the UK face a negative impact on employment and commonly have a care requirement after discharge from hospital. This has a corresponding negative impact on family income. The majority of the care required is provided by family members. This effect was apparent by 6 months and had not materially improved by 12 months.

METHODS: We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 737 patients with criteria for severe COVID-19 and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. We extracted data for epidemiological analysis, medical history, and medications, as well as baseline laboratory tests. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 and nonparametric tests, medians, and interquartile ranges (IQR). A p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 65.3% were men, with a median age of 59 years (IQR 46C70) and a median of 10 days of hospital stay (IQR 6C16), more than 40% had diabetes, hypertension, and/or obesity, and 0.8% used steroids chronically.

OBJECTIVES: To describe and assess the early results of a novel telehealth workflow in which remote providers collaborate with in-person nursing to evaluate and discharge well-appearing, low-risk ED patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was completed 3 weeks after implementation. Metrics include the number of patients evaluated, number of patients discharged without in-person contact, telehealth wait time and duration, collection of testing, ED length of stay (ED-LOS), 72-h return, number of in-person health care provider contacts, and associated PPE use. RESULTS: Among 302 patients evaluated by telehealth, 153 patients were evaluated and discharged by a telehealth provider with reductions in ED-LOS, PPE use, and close contact with health care personnel. These patients had a 62.5% shorter ED-LOS compared with other Emergency Severity Index level 4 patients seen over the same time period. Telehealth use for these 153 patients saved 413 sets of PPE.

Although most (74.8%) participants valued influenza vaccination positively and declared that it should be mandatory, some misconceptions around influenza persist. The general practitioner was the main source of trusted information on influenza vaccines, while social networks were judged to be the least reliable. Younger and less affluent individuals, subjects not vaccinated in the previous season, and those living in smaller communities showed lower odds of receiving the 2020/21 season influenza vaccination. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have positively influenced the propensity of being vaccinated against 2020/21 seasonal influenza.

With its recent outbreaks in Europe, there is a pressing need for efficacious antivirals. We presented here the identification and characterization of a novel virostatic molecule against BTV, an aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative named compound 003 (C003). The virostatic efficacy of C003 could be improved via chemical modification, leading to a de novo synthesized compound 052 (C052). The 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) of C003 and C052 were determined at 1.760.73 M and 0.270.12 M, respectively. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC(50)) of C003 was over 100 M and the CC(50) of C052 was at 82.69 M. Accordingly, the 50% selective index (SI(50)) of C003 and C052 against BTV was over 57 and 306, respectively. The inhibitory effect of C003/C052 on BTV-induced apoptosis was also confirmed via the inhibition of caspase-3/-7 activation post BTV infection. C003/C052 could inhibit BTV induced CPE even when added as late as 24 h.p.i., indicating that they might act at late stage of viral life-cycle. C003/C052 could reduce over two-logs of both the progeny virus production and the number of genomic viral RNA copies. Interestingly, both the activation of host autophagy and viral protein expression were inhibited post BTV infection when cells were treated with C003 and C052, suggesting that C003/C052 might act as virostatic agents via inhibiting host autophagy activation. Although further investigations might be needed to pin down the exact mechanism of C003/C052, our finding suggested that these compounds might be potent lead compounds with potential novel mechanism of action against BTV.","output":"Novel Virostatic Agents against Bluetongue Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates various ways in which a pandemic such as the novel coronavirus, could be predicted using different mathematical models It also studies the various ways in which these models could be depicted using various visualization techniques This paper aims to present various statistical techniques suggested by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in order to represent the epidemiological data The main focus of this paper is to analyse how epidemiological data or contagious diseases are theorized using any available information and later may be presented wrongly by not following the guidelines, leading to inaccurate representation and interpretations of the current scenario of the pandemic;with a special reference to the Indian Subcontinent","output":"How Misuse of Statistics Can Spread Misinformation: a Study of Misrepresentation of Covid-19 Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 affects vulnerable populations including elderly individuals and patients with cancer.

Although physical distancing effectively reduces short-range airborne transmission, many infections have occurred when sharing room air despite maintaining distancing. We propose two simple parameters as indicators of infection risk for this situation. They combine the key factors that control airborne disease transmission indoors: virus-containing aerosol generation rate, breathing flow rate, masking and its quality, ventilation and air cleaning rates, number of occupants, and duration of exposure. COVID-19 outbreaks show a clear trend in relation to these parameters that is consistent with an airborne infection model, supporting the importance of airborne transmission for these outbreaks. The observed trends of outbreak size vs. risk parameters allow us to recommend values of the parameters to minimize COVID-19 indoor infection risk. All of the pre-pandemic spaces are in a regime where they are highly sensitive to mitigation efforts. Measles outbreaks occur at much lower risk parameter values than COVID-19, while tuberculosis outbreaks are observed at much higher risk parameter values. Since both diseases are accepted as airborne, the fact that COVID-19 is less contagious than measles does not rule out airborne transmission.

We also looked for possible predictors of vaccine acceptance among the study sample. Methods A structured questionnaire prepared after consultation with experts in the field and guided by the Report of the SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy was administered among 2,953 HCWs. Upon obtaining informed consent, apart from demographic information, we collected information on trust in vaccines and health authorities, and agreement to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Results Although 69% of the participants agreed to accept a vaccine, there was high heterogeneity in agreement between HCWs in low and lower-middle income countries (L-LMICs) and upper-middle- and high-income countries (UM-HICs), with acceptance rates of 62 and 75%, respectively.

Four major types of lignin-carbohydrate bonds are reported in the literature, namely, benzyl ethers, benzyl esters, phenyl glycosides, and acetyl ester linkages. Ester's linkages in the plant cell wall are labile to alkaline pretreatments, such as ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX), which uses liquid or gaseous ammonia to cleave those linkages in the plant cell wall and reduce biomass recalcitrance. Two competing reactions, notably hydrolysis and ammonolysis, take place during AFEX pretreatment process, producing different aliphatic and aromatic acids, as well as their amide counterparts. AFEX pretreated grasses and agricultural residues are known to increase conversion of biomass to sugars by four- to five-fold when subjected to commercial enzyme hydrolysis, yielding a sustainable feedstock for producing biofuels, biomaterials, and animal feed. Animal feed trials on dairy cows have demonstrated a 27% increase in milk production when compared to a control feedstock. However, the presence of carboxamides in feedstocks could promote neurotoxicity in animals if consumed beyond a certain concentration. Thus, there is the need to overcome regulatory hurdles associated with commercializing AFEX pretreated biomass as animal feed in the United States. This manuscript demonstrates a modified pretreatment for increasing the digestibility of industrial byproducts such as Brewer's spent grains (BSG) and high-fiber meal (HFM) produced from BSG and dry distillers grains with soluble (DDGS), while avoiding the production of carboxamides. The three industrial byproducts were first treated with calculated amounts of alkali such as NaOH, Ca(OH)2, or KOH followed by AFEX pretreatment. We found that 4% alkali was able to de-esterify BSG and DDGS more efficiently than using 2% alkali at both 10 and 20% solids loading. AFEX pretreatment of de-esterified BSG, HFM, and DDGS produced twofold higher glucan conversion than respective untreated biomass. This new discovery can help overcome potential regulatory issues associated with the presence of carboxamides in ammonia-pretreated animal feeds and is expected to benefit several farmers around the world.","output":"A New Method to Overcome Carboxyamide Formation During AFEX Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic Biomass"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused human respiratory infections with a high case fatality rate since 2012.

We demonstrated that human primary intestinal epithelial cells, small intestine explants, and intestinal organoids were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain robust viral replication. We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid. In polarized Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell inserts, apical MERS-CoV inoculation was more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice. Histological examination revealed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice, as shown by the presence of virus-positive cells, progressive inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines, which were exaggerated in the mice pretreated with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole.

To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs.

Currently, in Pakistan, rail tracks are inspected by an acoustic-based manual system that requires a railway engineer as a domain expert to differentiate between different rail tracks faults, which is cumbersome, laborious, and error-prone. This study proposes the use of traditional acoustic-based systems with deep learning models to increase performance and reduce train accidents. Two convolutional neural networks (CNN) models, convolutional 1D and convolutional 2D, and one recurrent neural network (RNN) model, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are used in this regard. Initially, three types of faults are considered, including superelevation, wheel burnt, and normal tracks. Contrary to traditional acoustic-based systems where the spectrogram dataset is generated before the model training, the proposed approach uses on-the-fly feature extraction by generating spectrograms as a deep learning models layer. Different lengths of audio samples are used to analyze their performance with each model. Each audio sample of 17 s is split into 3 variations of 1.7, 3.4, and 8.5 s, and all 3 deep learning models are trained and tested against each split time. Various combinations of audio data augmentation are analyzed extensively to investigate models performance. The results suggest that the LSTM with 8.5 split time gives the best results with the accuracy of 99.7%, the precision of 99.5%, recall of 99.5%, and F1 score of 99.5%.","output":"Railway Track Inspection Using Deep Learning Based on Audio to Spectrogram Conversion: An on-the-Fly Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic to severe disease with life-threatening complications. Understanding the persistence of immune responses in asymptomatic individuals merit special attention because of their importance in controlling the spread of the infections. We here studied the antibody and T cell responses, and a wide range of inflammation markers, in 56 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals, identified by a population screen after the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These, mostly asymptomatic individuals, were reanalyzed 7-8 months after their infection together with 115 age-matched seronegative controls. We found that 7-8 months after the infection their antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein declined whereas we found no decrease in the antibodies to Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) when compared to the findings at seropositivity identification. In contrast to antibodies to N protein, the antibodies to S-RBD correlated with the viral neutralization capacity and with CD4(+) T cell responses as measured by antigen-specific upregulation of CD137 and CD69 markers. Unexpectedly we found the asymptomatic antibody-positive individuals to have increased serum levels of S100A12, TGF-alpha, IL18, and OSM, the markers of activated macrophages-monocytes, suggesting long-term persistent inflammatory effect associated with the viral infection in asymptomatic individuals.

The Seattle Washington metropolitan area was one of the first in the United States affected by the pandemic. As a result, the anatomic pathology services at the University of Washington experienced significant changes in operational volumes early in the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of COVID-19 and both state and institutional policies implemented to mitigate viral transmission (including institutional policies on non-urgent procedures) on anatomic pathology volumes. DESIGN: Accessioned specimens from January 2020 to June 2020 was evaluated as COVID-19 and institutional policies changed. The data were considered in these contexts: subspecialty, billable CPT codes, and intraoperative consultation. Comparable data were retrieved from 2019 as a historical control. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall accessioned volume (up to 79%) from pre-pandemic levels, during bans on non-urgent procedures when compared to 2020 pre- COVID-19 volumes and historical controls. The gastrointestinal and dermatopathology services were most impacted, while breast and combined head&neck/pulmonary services were least impacted. CPT code 88305, for smaller/biopsy specimens, had a 63% reduction during non-urgent procedure bans. After all bans on procedures were lifted, the overall volume plateaued at 89% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease in specimen volume was most strongly associated with bans on non-urgent procedures. While all departmental areas had a decrease in volume, the extent of change varied across subspecialty and specimen types.

We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong. METHODS: We included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables. We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge. We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patientsage and the time from onset to admission. FINDINGS: After the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.2C7.7). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8C16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2C52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric  distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0C9.6) and 55.0% (45.3C64.7), respectively. Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Patientsage was strongly associated with outcome. The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.

The risk of viral transmission to healthcare professionals and patients has strongly influenced the patient triage before endoscopy, the setting of the waiting rooms, the hygienic protocols for the endoscopic suites and the instruments, the use of the personal protective devices. Since government restrictions, the need to limit the access to hospitals only for urgent or oncological treatments, either for ambulatory procedures or for admissions to wards, has postponed many elective exams. Aim of the study was to assess how the EUS procedures have changed as compared to 2019 in an endoscopy unit of a provincial capital hospital in Lombardy (Italy). Materials and methods: We retrospectively compared our EUS procedures in the COVID period (March 2020 - February 2021) to those in the pre-COVID period (March 2019 - February 2020). less than the previous 12 months (-17.7%);this decrease concerned (-20.3%) than the inpatients (-15.6%).

In the second phase our procedures did not decrease (160 from July 2020 to October 2020, 151 from July 2019 to October 2019). In the third phase (November 2020 - February 2021) the procedures were 123, while from November 2019 to February 2020 they had been 155 (-20.6%). As regards the final EUS diagnosis, in the COVID period 25.2% of cases resulted neoplastic diseases, whereas in the 12-months before malignancy was detected in 23.4% of Conclusions: The drop rate in our EUS activity was parallel to the COVID incidence in Lombardy, that showed a first peak (with up to 6000 new cases / day) from March 2020 to May 2020, a following low-incidence plateau (with <1000 cases / day) from June 2020 to September 2020, and a successive second peak (with >10000 cases / day) from October 2020 to February 2021. This tendency could reflect either the outpatients low propensity to schedule exams in the riskiest periods, or the transformation of some internal medicine or surgical wards in COVID divisions when the need for such admissions was greater.

We analyzed COVID-19 death data reported daily in the Epidemiological Bulletin of the State Health Secretariat of Maranh?o and calculated the reporting delay from March 23 to August 29, 2020. A semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to illustrate the impact of death reporting delay and test the effectiveness of a Bayesian Nowcasting in improving data quality. Only 17.8% of deaths were reported without delay or the day after, while 40.5% were reported more than 30 days late. Following an initial underestimation due to reporting delay, 644 deaths were reported from June 7 to August 29, although only 116 deaths occurred during this period. Using the Bayesian nowcasting technique partially improved the quality of mortality data during the peak of the pandemic, providing estimates that better matched the observed scenario in the city, becoming unusable nearly two months after the peak. As delay in death reporting can directly interfere with assertive and timely decision-making regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brazilian epidemiological surveillance system must be urgently revised and notifying the date of death must be mandatory.

Monitoring the levels of IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 is important during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to plan an adequate and evidence-based public health response. Methods: : We compared the levels of serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in three groups: i) individuals without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 who received one or two doses of either an mRNA-based (Comirnaty BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech or Spikevax mRNA-1273/Moderna) or an adenoviral-based vaccine (Vaxzervia ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 /Oxford-Astra Zeneca) (n=227), ii) unvaccinated individuals with evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 (n=109), and iii) individuals with evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 who received at least one dose of a vaccine (n=30). Unvaccinated individuals without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 were used as a control group (n=211). Results: : The levels of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in all three groups were significantly higher ( p <0.001) compared to the control group. The highest levels of virus-specific IgG antibodies were observed in individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received at least one dose of a vaccine. Our analyses also revealed that the levels of specific anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were higher in individuals who received two doses of a licensed vaccine, regardless of the vaccine technology (mRNA-based and adenoviral vector-based). Furthermore, anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were higher in previously uninfected participants who received at least one dose of a vaccine compared to the unvaccinated individuals with evidence of prior infection. Conclusions: : Our results indicate that vaccine-induced responses lead to higher levels of IgG antibodies compared to those produced following infection with the virus. In agreement with previous studies, our results suggest that among individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, even a single dose of a vaccine is adequate to elicit high levels of humoral immunity.","output":"Seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Cyprus (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] In this work, breathing-caloric effect is introduced as a new term to define very large thermal changes that arise from the combination of structural changes and gas adsorption processes occurring during breathing transitions.

This outbreak led to the demise of over 50 million domestic birds and occurred mainly during the northward spring migration of adult avian populations. OBJECTIVES: There have been no experimental examinations of the pathogenesis, transmission, and population impacts of this virus in adult wild waterfowl with varying exposure histories-the most relevant age class. METHODS: We captured, housed, and challenged adult wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with HPAIV H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 and measured viral infection, viral excretion, and transmission to other mallards. RESULTS: All inoculated birds became infected and excreted moderate amounts of virus, primarily orally, for up to 14 days. Cohoused, uninoculated birds also all became infected. Serological status had no effect on susceptibility. There were no obvious clinical signs of disease, and all birds survived to the end of the study (14 days). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, adult mallards are viable hosts of HPAIV H5N2 regardless of prior exposure history and are capable of transporting the virus over short and long distances. These findings have implications for surveillance efforts. The capture and sampling of wild waterfowl in the spring, when most surveillance programs are not operating, are important to consider in the design of future HPAIV surveillance programs.","output":"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N2 (clade 2.3.4.4) challenge of mallards age appropriate to the 2015 midwestern poultry outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to characterize commercially-available cotton fabrics to determine their suitability as materials for construction of cloth masks for personal and public use to reduce infectious disease spread. The study focused on cottons because of their widespread availability, moderate performance and they are recommended for inclusion in home-made masks by international health authorities. Fifty-two cottons were analyzed by electron microscopy to determine fabric characteristics and fabric weights. Sixteen fabrics were selected to test for breathability and to construct 2-ply cotton masks of a standard design to use in quantitative fit testing on a human participant. Cotton mask fitted filtration efficiencies (FFEs) for 0.02C1 m ambient and aerosolized sodium chloride particles ranged from 40 to 66% compared with the mean medical mask FFE of 552%. Pressure differentials across 2-ply materials ranged from 0.57 to > 12 mm H(2)O/cm(2) on samples of equal surface area with 6 of 16 materials exceeding the recommended medical mask limit. Models were calibrated to predict 2-ply cotton mask FFEs and differential pressures for each fabric based on pore characteristics and fabric weight. Models indicated cotton fabrics from 6 of 9 consumer categories can produce cloth masks with adequate breathability and FFEs equivalent to a medical mask: T-shirt, fashion fabric, mass-market quilting cotton, home dcor fabric, bed sheets and high-quality quilting cotton. Masks from one cloth mask and the medical mask were re-tested with a mask fitter to distinguish filtration from leakage. The fabric and medical masks had 3.7% and 41.8% leakage, respectively. These results indicate a well fitted 2-ply cotton mask with overhead ties can perform similarly to a disposable 3-ply medical mask on ear loops due primarily to the superior fit of the cloth mask which compensates for its lower material filtration efficiency.","output":"Fitted filtration efficiency and breathability of 2-ply cotton masks: Identification of cotton consumer categories acceptable for home-made cloth mask construction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep Learning is a very active and important area for building Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) applications.

The aim of this study is to examine whether stress, anxiety, and depression are associated with patient-reported disease activity, after accounting for important factors. METHODS: We administered a survey to an axSpA cohort from a single center with well-defined demographic and disease characteristics. We included questions about job status changes, exercise, medication use, disease activity (by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI]), and psychological factors (stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety). Separate multivariable linear models examined the associations between perceived stress, anxiety, and depression with the BASDAI.

Some recent theories believed that mitochondrial markers are upregulated in response to high fat induced T2DM; however, the reasons and the affected factors are still uncertain. In this regard, we aimed to investigate the effect of high fat induced T2DM on mitochondrial markers of skeletal muscle, and an herbal component along with endurance exercise, as probable treatments, in AGE-rich high-fat diet (AGEs-HFD) induced T2DM mice. METHODS: T2DM was induced by 16 weeks of AGEs-HFD consumption in male C57BL/6 mice, followed by 8 weeks of drugs ingestion and endurance exercise treatments (n = 6 in each group and total number of 42 mice). The herbal component was an aquatic extract of Salvia officinalis, Trigonella foenum-graecum, Panax ginseng, and Cinnamomum zeylanicum, termed SGTC. We then examined the relative expression of several mitochondrial markers, including Ppargc1, Tfam, and electron transport chain genes and ATP levels, in skeletal muscle samples. RESULTS: T2DM was successfully induced according to morphological, biochemical, and molecular observations. All mitochondrial markers, including Ppargc1a, Tfam, Cpt2, and electron transport chain genes, were upregulated in T2DM group compared to controls with no significant changes in the ATP levels. Most mitochondrial markers were downregulated by drug treatment compared to T2DM, but the ATP level was not significantly altered. All mitochondrial markers were upregulated in exercised group compared to T2DM with mild increase in the ATP level. The Ex + SGTC group had moderate level of mitochondrial markers compared to T2DM, but the highest ATP production. CONCLUSION: The highly significant overexpression of mitochondrial markers may be in response to free fatty acid overload. However, the lack of significant change in the ATP level may be a result of ROS generation due to electron leakage in the AGEsRAGE axis and electron transport chain. Almost all treatments ameliorate mitochondrial markers overexpression. The SGTC appears to regulate this with its antioxidant properties. Instead, exercise upregulated mitochondrial markers efficiently; however, the most efficient results, i.e. the most ATP production among the treatments, were observed in the Ex + SGTC group.

Using this approach, we rigorously show how the time-varying under-reporting of infected cases will artificially inflate the inferred probability of elimination and hence lead to early (false- positive) end-of-epidemic declarations. Contrastingly, we prove that incorrectly identifying imported cases as local will deceptively decrease this probability, resulting in late (false-negative) declarations. Failing to sustain intensive surveillance during the later phases of an epidemic can therefore substantially mislead policymakers on when it is safe to remove travel bans or relax quarantine and social distancing advisories.

Major technical limitations in that study were difficulties in delivering the device and a few cases in which the Enterprise vascular reconstruction device (stent) was used as a bailout procedure. The Enterprise, which has relatively less radial force and more flexibility than other intracranial stents, is an ideal device for revascularization as it is easily delivered through tortuous intracranial vessels. We tested the safety and effectiveness of this stent as the primary revascularization device for AIS in an FDA-approved investigational device exemption prospective cohort study. METHODS Twenty patients presenting with AIS due to confirmed intracranial large vessel occlusion within 8 h of onset of stroke symptoms were treated with the Enterprise as the primary revascularization device. The primary outcome was recanalization to Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow of 2. Perioperative safety was measured by major complication incidence within 30 days of stent revascularization. A secondary measure of outcome was 30-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. RESULTS Recanalization to TIMI 2 (n=6) or 3 (n=12) flow was achieved in 18 patients (90% revascularization rate). Three major complications were noted (15%) including one myocardial infarction, one symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and one ischemic stroke in a distribution other than the qualifying vessel. Good outcome (mRS 2) was obtained in 10 patients (50%).

Over the two last years the novel coronavirus infection, COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become one of the urgent health and social problems. Reports on the SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasiveness raise the question as to whether the infection could be related to an increased risk of seizure recurrence in patients with concomitant epilepsy and COVID-19. Objective: to study the seizure dynamics in patients with epilepsy recovered after COVID-19 by analyzing clinical observations. Material and methods. A single-center retrospective uncontrolled open-label observational study regarding an impact of COVID-19 on the course of epilepsy was performed. Patients with epilepsy recovered after COVID-19 were interviewed between January and February 2021 by using a questionnaire containing three sets of questions. The study included 13 patients suffering from COVID-19 along with epilepsy: 7 cases (54%) of genetic (idiopathic) generalised form, 6 cases (46%) of focal form. The mean age was 34.3112.68 years. Results. Seizure remission prior to COVID-19 was noted in 10 patients (77%), with no seizure control found in 3 cases (23%) of focal epilepsy at the time of COVID-19. No seizure frequency rise was observed in any case. No recurrent seizures were detected. Electroencephalographic follow-up showed no exacerbated seizures compared to the pre-infection parameters. Monotherapy with anti-epileptic drugs was used in 61% of cases. Levetiracetam monotherapy was administered to 50% of patients, and as a part of a polytherapy regimen C to 100%. Conclusion. The research findings and literature data show that patients with epilepsy are not at greater risk than the general population. Young age, seizure remission, absence of somatic comorbidities, modern drug use with no interaction with antibiotics and antivirals for the coronavirus disease treatment can be considered as positive predictive value of the course of epilepsy with COVID-19.

To prevent or control HAIs, evaluating the organisms isolated from the critically maintained areas is considered of epitome importance and everlasting practice in the healthcare industry. Identifying such organisms and screening them for antibiotic resistance is mandatory, but it also helps professionals understand colonization trends. Sensitive areas of healthcare setups were screened monthly from years 2017 to 2020. A total of 4400 samples of hospital hygiene, e.g., intravenous drip stands, ventilator surface, anesthetist's trolley, patient's bed, instrument trolley, etcetera, were collected. Isolated organisms were cultured and screened using the CLSI technique. E. coli, Pseudomonas spp., and Klebsiella spp. were found in both previous to COVID current samples. Multidrug-resistant organisms were subjected to molecular characterization to detect the presence of carbapenem genes. Evaluation data of both pre-and during Coronavirus Disease or COVID-19 were compared. The prevalence of pathogenic (Klebsiella spp., E. coli, and Pseudomonas spp.) and nonpathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus spp.) strains in healthcare setups decreased drastically (Klebsiella spp. from 80% to 20%, E.coli from 90% to 10% and Pseudomonas spp. from 80% to 20%).

For improving the physical functions affected by a neurological disorder, rehabilitation procedures are mandatory, and they must be performed regularly. Unfortunately, neurorehabilitation procedures have disadvantages in terms of costs, accessibility and a lack of therapists. This paper presents Immersive Neurorehabilitation Exercises Using Virtual Reality (INREX-VR), our innovative immersive neurorehabilitation system using virtual reality. The system is based on a thorough research methodology and is able to capture real-time user movements and evaluate joint mobility for both upper and lower limbs, record training sessions and save electromyography data. The use of the first-person perspective increases immersion, and the joint range of motion is calculated with the help of both the HTC Vive system and inverse kinematics principles applied on skeleton rigs. Tutorial exercises are demonstrated by a virtual therapist, as they were recorded with real-life physicians, and sessions can be monitored and configured through tele-medicine. Complex movements are practiced in gamified settings, encouraging self-improvement and competition. Finally, we proposed a training plan and preliminary tests which show promising results in terms of accuracy and user feedback. As future developments, we plan to improve the systems accuracy and investigate a wireless alternative based on neural networks.","output":"Flexible Virtual Reality System for Neurorehabilitation and Quality of Life Improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter discusses the emergence of canine parvovirus (CPV), the evidence concerning the previous emergence of mink enteritis virus (MEV) as the cause of a new disease in minks in the 1940s, and the mechanisms that determine the host ranges and other specific properties of the viruses of cats, minks, and dogs. The viruses are classified as the feline parvovirus subgroup of the genus Parvovirus, within the family Parvoviridae. Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), MEV, and CPV are classified as host range variants. In addition to the viruses of cats, minks, and dogs, similar viruses naturally infect many species within the families Felidae, Canidae, Procyonidae, Mustelidae, and possibly the Viverridae. The differences in virulence for minks observed after inoculation of MEV or FPV suggests that there are subtle differences between FPV and MEV that have yet to be defined. Genetic mapping studies indicate that only three or four sequence differences between the FPV and CPV-2 isolates within the VP-1 lVP-2 gene determine all of the specific properties of CPV that have been defined: the pH dependence of hemagglutination, the CPV-specific epitope, and the host range for canine cells and dogs.","output":"Emergence, Natural History, and Variation of Canine, Mink, and Feline Parvoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2016, the monetary policy framework moved towards flexible inflation targeting and a six member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was constituted for setting the policy rate With this step towards modernization of the monetary policy process, India joined the set of countries that have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework The Consumer Price Index (CPI combined) inflation target was set by the Government of India at 4% with  2% tolerance band for the period from August 5, 2016 to March 31, 2021 In this backdrop, the paper reviews the evolution of monetary policy frameworks in India since the mid-1980s It also describes the monetary policy transmission process and its limitations in terms of lags and rigidities It highlights the importance of unconventional monetary policy measures in supplementing conventional tools especially during the easing cycle Further, it examines the voting pattern of the MPC in India and compares this with that of various developed and emerging economies The synchronization of cuts in the policy rate by MPCs of various countries during the global slowdown in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic in the early 2020s is also analysed","output":"Monetary policy framework in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virologically confirmed cases of a new coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) in the world are rapidly increasing, leading epidemiologists and mathematicians to construct transmission models that aim to predict the future course of the current pandemic.

This retrospective study aimed to assess the outcome of immunocompromised critically ill patients with candidemia. Secondary objectives were to describe clinical phenotypes of these patients, Candida ecology, and factors associated with mortality. RESULTS Overall, 121 patients were included in this study. Median delay from candidemia to first antifungal therapy was 3 days, in line with the observed delay of blood culture positivity. Candia albicans was the main Candida specie identified (54%), and susceptibility of Candida to fluconazole and echinocandins was of, respectively, 70% and 92%. Hospital mortality was of 60%. After adjustment for confounders, severity as assessed by the need for vasopressors (HR 1.8, CI95% 1.1-3.1), need for mechanical ventilation (HR 2.0, CI95% 1.1-3.8) and allogenic stem cell transplantation (HR 2.5, CI95% 1.1-6.0) were independently associated with poor outcome. Candida specie, susceptibility and treatment strategies were not associated with outcome. CONCLUSIONS Candidemia in immunocompromised critically ill patients is associated with a grim outcome. Despite the high prevalence of Candida non-albicans species, neither C. species nor its susceptibility was associated with outcome.

Recent studies have identified preliminary evidence of widening disparities in suicidal behaviors across sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status among college students. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of on-campus and off-campus suicide interventions, nor is collated information available for different types of screening, assessment, treatment, and postvention plans. Further challenges have been identified since the COVID-19 pandemic, calling for cost-effective and innovative interventions to address increased rates of suicidal behaviors among college students facing unprecedented stressors. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol describes the first systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the most effective and cost-effective intervention components for universal and targeted (indicated and selected) suicide prevention among college students in a global context. Special attention will be placed on disparities in suicide prevention across sociodemographic subgroups, inclusive interventions beyond campus, global context, and intervention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sensitive search strategy will be executed across MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest), Scopus, Global Index Medicus, SciELO, African Journals Online, Global Health (CABI), and Google Scholar. Data extraction and evaluation will be conducted by three independent researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed. A multilevel meta-regression model and subgroup analysis will be used to analyze the data and estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: The initial search was completed in December 2020 and updated with additional other-language studies in March 2020. We expect the results to be submitted for publication in mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing rates of suicidal behaviors among college students, few preventative efforts have targeted this population, and fewer focus on factors that might place specific demographic groups at heightened risk. The impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviors among college students highlights and exacerbates the urgent need for rapid and effective interventions that might differ from traditional approaches. This equity-focused study will address these gaps and provide a valuable analysis of the effectiveness of suicide prevention programs and interventions. Findings will inform clinicians, researchers, policy makers, families, and organizations about evidence-based interventions for reducing the gaps in the suicide crisis among college students from different sociodemographic groups.

As in other countries, Nigerian policymakers had to make rapid and consequential decisions with limited understanding of transmission dynamics and the efficacy of available control measures. We present an account of the Nigerian COVID-19 response based on co-production of evidence between political decision-makers, health policymakers and academics from Nigerian and foreign institutions, an approach that allowed a multidisciplinary group to collaborate on issues arising in real time. Key aspects of the process were the central role of policymakers in determining priority areas and the coordination of multiple, sometime conflicting inputs from stakeholders to write briefing papers and inform effective national decision making. However, the co-production approach met with some challenges, including limited transparency, bureaucratic obstacles and an overly epidemiological focus on numbers of cases and deaths, arguably to the detriment of addressing social and economic effects of response measures. Larger systemic obstacles included a complex multitiered health system, fragmented decision-making structures and limited funding for implementation. Going forward, Nigeria should strengthen the integration of the national response within existing health decision bodies and implement strategies to mitigate the social and economic impact, particularly on the poorest Nigerians. The co-production of evidence examining the broader public health impact, with synthesis by multidisciplinary teams, is essential to meeting the social and public health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and other countries.","output":"Lessons from co-production of evidence and policy in Nigeria's COVID-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleocytoplasmic transport of signaling modulators is essential for regulating cellular responses to extracellular stimulation and stress, as well as pathogen infection.

Treatment with an XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of XPO1 reduced KSHV lytic replication but had no effect on KSHV entry and trafficking. XPO1 inhibition induced retention of autophagy adaptor protein p62 (SQSTM1) in the nucleus, which enhanced activation of TBK1 and IRF3. As a result, nuclear accumulation of p62 increased expression of innate immune-related genes including IRF7, ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3, leading to a reduction of KSHV lytic replication.
