Objective: To evaluate the in-vitro antiviral activity of Fema Sakthi? (FS) by eliciting the inhibition of cytopathic effect of Human Coronavirus (HCoV) on African Green Monkey kidney cells (VERO cells). Materials and Method: The cytopathic effect (CPE) was performed on Vero cells with Human Coronavirus 229E, a type of Coronavirus associated with respiratory infections. The Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) was evaluated using Reed-Muench method. 100 TCID50 of HCoV 229E viral suspensions were added to VERO cell culture to induce the cytopathic effect. Uninfected and untreated cells were used as control and five concentrations (62.5, 125, 250, 500 & 1000 g/mL) of Fema Sakthi? (FS) were used to study the anti-viral activity. After incubation for 72 hours, the cell viability was observed under the inverted microscope after staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Results: Fema Sakthi? (FS) was found to exhibit inhibition of cytopathic effect at lower concentrations (62.5, 125 and 250 g/mL) but at higher concentrations (500 and 1000 g/mL), the formulation itself was cytotoxic to the cells. Conclusion: This preliminary study showed that FS has antiviral activity at lower concentrations 62.5, 125 and 250 g/mL on the VERO cells. However, further specific studies have to be carried out to confirm the anti-viral activity and clinical efficacy using other preclinical and clinical models of Human Coronavirus (HCoV) including COVID-19.

Here we aimed to discover new sepsis loci by completing the first admixture mapping study of sepsis in Canary Islanders, leveraging their distinctive genetic makeup as a mixture of Europeans and African ancestries. We used a case-control approach and inferred local ancestry blocks from genome-wide data from 113,414 polymorphisms genotyped in 343 patients with sepsis and 410 unrelated controls, all ascertained for grandparental origin in the Canary Islands (Spain). Deviations in local ancestries between cases and controls were tested using logistic regressions, followed by fine-mapping analyses based on imputed genotypes, in silico functional assessments, and gene expression analysis centered on the region of interest. The admixture mapping analysis detected that local European ancestry in a locus spanning 1.2 megabases of chromosome 8p23.1 was associated with sepsis (lowest p = 1.37  10(?4); Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.51; 95%CI = 0.40C0.66).

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the experiences and psychosocial problems of nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey. SETTINGS: The data were collected between 9 May and 12 May 2020, in Istanbul, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 10 nurses, who cared for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The research employed the descriptive phenomenological approach. The interviews were conducted face-to-face via the internet and were analysed with Colaizzi's seven-step method. RESULTS: The experiences and psychosocial problems among nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorised under three themes, which were further divided into subcategories. The theme of the effects of the outbreak was divided into working conditions, psychological effects and social effects; the theme of short-term coping strategies was divided into normalisation, refusal to dwell on experiences, avoidance, expression of emotions and distraction; and the theme of necessities was divided into psychosocial support and resource management. CONCLUSION: The nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey were adversely affected, both psychologically and socially, by the pandemic; they used short-term coping strategies, and they needed psychosocial support and resource management.

METHODS: The authors conducted an attitude survey on remote learning among trainees and faculty members approximately 3 months after the transition from in-person to remote learning. The authors then conducted a faculty training on best practices in online teaching followed by an evaluation survey. Study findings were examined descriptively and by Fisher's exact testing. RESULTS: The response rates for the attitudes survey were 68% among trainees and 61% among faculty. Trainees and faculty perceived in-person learning more favorably than remote learning across a variety of domains, including overall enjoyment, interpersonal connection, ability to communicate, and concentration. Despite these trends, only 10% of trainees and 14% of faculty felt that all lectures would be most effectively delivered in-person when this becomes possible again. The response rate for the faculty training evaluation survey was 16%. Compared to non-attendees, faculty attendees reported more confidence in their ability to teach remotely (89% vs 56%, p=0.02) and but not increased optimism (89% vs 63%, p=0.06).

The results were derived from metabolic monitoring in Thuringia (Germany), during 2009-2019. A total of 361,584 measured values, of 13 different metabolic variables, were assigned to parity (primiparous and multiparous) and stage of lactation (10 classes from -30 to 300 days in milk). The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied for the evaluation of differences regarding parity or the stage of lactation. Non-esterified fatty acids, beta hydroxybutyrate, and the activity of aspartate aminotransferase in serum were clearly affected by parity and lactation. Serum concentrations of cholesterol, bilirubin, and phosphorus, as well as the serum activity of glutamate dehydrogenase, were affected by the stage of lactation, while parity impacted urea concentration.

The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study at the Antoine Bclre Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on one nasopharyngeal sample. RESULTS: A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever (15.8%), myalgia (36.8%) and anosmia (31.6%), was suggestive of previous infection. CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks after the end of French lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A very high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women, which is comparable to that of the general population, must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic. The traces of a past active circulation of the virus in this fragile population during the spring wave should encourage public health authorities to take specific measures for this independent at-risk group, in order to reduce viral circulation in pregnant patients.","output":"Post lockdown COVID-19 seroprevalence and circulation at the time of delivery, France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To expand the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) fluorescence labeling toolbox beyond covalent conjugation of external dyes (e.g. ATTO-, Alexa Fluor-, or cyanine dyes), we herein explore fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) as a novel approach to endow fluorescent properties to ASOs.

In addition to a comprehensive photophysical characterization, we assess the label-induced effects on the gapmers RNA affinities, RNA-hybridized secondary structures, and knockdown efficiencies. Importantly, we find practically no perturbing effects for gapmers with single FBA incorporations in the biologically critical gap region and, except for pA, the FBAs do not affect the knockdown efficiencies. Incorporating two cytosine FBAs in the gap is equally well tolerated, while two adenine analogues give rise to slightly reduced knockdown efficiencies and what could be perturbed secondary structures. We furthermore show that the FBAs can be used to visualize gapmers inside live cells using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, enabling comparative assessment of their uptake.

RESULTS: Seventy-four COVID-19 patients were included in this study. COVID-19 staged as mild in 34 patients, moderate in 26 and severe in 14 cases. There were no significant differences in olfactory scores across the different COVID-19 severity groups. In the patient series, the median plasma level of IL-6 was 7.7 pg/mL (IQR 3.7-18.8). The concentration of IL-6 was found to be significantly correlated with the severity of COVID-19 with a directly proportional relationship. The correlation between IL-6 plasma concentrations and olfactory scores was weak (rs = 0.182) and not significant (p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients, psychophysical olfactory scores did not show significant correlations with the plasma levels of a well-recognized negative prognostic factor such as IL-6.

Most common symptoms at presentation were fever (62%), myalgia (33%), cough (33%), and headache (33%). Dyspnea occurred in only 19% patients. Hospitalization was required for 13 (62%) with a time from symptoms onset to admission of 5 (1-12) days. In 38%, supplementary oxygen was needed, 19% required intensive care, and 10% mechanical ventilation. Main complications were bacterial pneumonia (38%), renal replacement therapy (19%), sepsis (10%), venous thromboembolism (10%), and pancreatitis (5%). Immunosuppression therapy was modified in 48% (in majority 89%, reduced). Median hospitalization time was 17 (8-28) days.

We sought to understand the impact of geography on aneurysm retreatment in patients enrolled in the Matrix and Platinum Science Trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS Post hoc analysis was performed on data from the Matrix and Platinum Science trial. Patients were stratified as either North American or international. Baseline patient demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, procedural complications, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were compared. RESULTS We evaluated 407 patients from 28 North American sites and 219 patients from 15 international sites. Patient demographics differed significantly between North American and international sites. Aneurysms were well occluded postprocedure more often at international than North American sites (P < .001). Stents were used significantly more often at North American sites (32.7% [133 of 407]) compared with international sites (10.0% [22 of 219]; P < .001). At 455 days, there was no difference in the proportion of patients alive and free of disability (P = .56) or with residual aneurysm filling (P = .10). Ruptured aneurysms were significantly more likely to have been retreated at North American sites within the first year (P < .001) and at 2 years (P < .001). Among all patients for whom the treating physician believed there to be Raymond 3 aneurysm filling at follow-up, absolute rates of retreatment at international and North American sites were similar by 2-year follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to validate a rehab and reconditioning program (RRP) for adductor injuries through a panel of experts and determine the effectiveness of this program through its application in professional soccer. DESIGN: A 20-item RRP was developed, which was validated by a panel of experts anonymously and then applied to 12 injured male professional soccer players. SETTING: Soccer pitch and indoor gym. PARTICIPANTS: Eight rehabilitation fitness coaches (age = 33.25 [2.49] y) and 8 academic researchers (age = 38.50 [3.74] y) with PhDs in sports science and/or physiotherapy. The RRP was applied to 12 male professional players (age = 23.75 [4.97] y; height = 180.56 [8.41] cm; mass = 76.89 [3.43] kg) of the Spanish First and Second Division (La Liga). INTERVENTIONS: The experts validated an indoor and on-field reconditioning program, which was based on strengthening the injured muscle and retraining conditional capacities with the aim of reducing the risk of reinjury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aiken V for each item of the program and number of days taken by the players to return to full team training. RESULTS: The experts evaluated all items of the program very highly as seen from Aiken V values between 0.77 and 0.94 (range: 0.61-0.98) for all drills, and the return to training was in 13.08 (1.42) days.

The cerebellum is vital to sensorimotor control and reduced cerebellar volumes in ASD have been documented. Our study examined the extent to which cerebellar volumes are associated with multiple sensorimotor behaviors in ASD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight participants with ASD and 34 typically developing (TD) controls (8C30 years) completed a structural MRI scan and precision grip testing, oculomotor testing, or both. Force variability during precision gripping as well as absolute error and trial-to-trial error variability of visually guided saccades were examined. Volumes of cerebellar lobules, vermis, and white matter were quantified. The relationships between each cerebellar region of interest (ROI) and force variability, saccade error, and saccade error variability were examined. RESULTS: Relative to TD controls, individuals with ASD showed increased force variability. Individuals with ASD showed a reduced volume of cerebellar vermis VI-VII relative to TD controls. Relative to TD females, females with ASD showed a reduced volume of bilateral cerebellar Crus II/lobule VIIB. Increased volume of Crus I was associated with increased force variability. Increased volume of vermal lobules VI-VII was associated with reduced saccade error for TD controls but not individuals with ASD. Increased right lobule VIII and cerebellar white matter volumes as well as reduced right lobule VI and right lobule X volumes were associated with greater ASD symptom severity. Reduced volumes of right Crus II/lobule VIIB were associated with greater ASD symptom severity in only males, while reduced volumes of right Crus I were associated with more severe restricted and repetitive behaviors only in females. CONCLUSION: Our finding that increased force variability in ASD is associated with greater cerebellar Crus I volumes indicates that disruption of sensory feedback processing supported by Crus I may contribute to skeletomotor differences in ASD. Results showing that volumes of vermal lobules VI-VII are associated with saccade precision in TD but not ASD implicates atypical organization of the brain systems supporting oculomotor control in ASD. Associations between volumes of cerebellar subregions and ASD symptom severity suggest cerebellar pathological processes may contribute to multiple developmental challenges in ASD.","output":"Cerebellar Volumes and Sensorimotor Behavior in Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a multifactorial investigation of a SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 outbreak in a large meat processing complex in Germany.

STUDY DESIGN Randomised controlled crossover trial with balanced allocations. SETTING Brisbane, Australia (August 2019 - March 2020) PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy women (36  9 years) INTERVENTIONS: 45minutes of resting, infrared sauna or indoor bicycling PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: tympanic/skin temperatures; respiratory rate; blood pressure; arterial stiffness; heart rate variability RESULTS: Tympanic temperatures were elevated during infrared sauna as compared to both control (mean diff = +1.05oC  SEM 0.12 oC, 95% C.I.: 0.73 - 1.36, p < 0.0005) and exercise (mean diff = +0.79oC  SEM 0.12 oC, 95% C.I.: 0.49 - 1.08, p<0.0005). Respiratory rates were higher during exercise as compared to both control (mean diff = +7.66  SEM 1.37, 95% C.I.: 4.09 - 11.23, p < 0.0005) and infrared sauna (mean diff = +6.66  SEM 1.33, 95% C.I.: 3.20 - 10.11, p < 0.0005).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The CR model focuses on community and population health outcomes associated with the policies and practices of the housing, public education, law enforcement, and criminal justice sectors as CR measures. The model demonstrates how behaviors of these systems interact and produce outcome measures such as employment, homelessness, educational attainment, incarceration, and mental and physical health. RESULTS The policies and practices within housing, public schools, law enforcement, and criminal justice can suppress resilience for families and communities because they are shaped by structural racism and influence the character and nature of resources that promote optimal community health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS Community resilience is relational and place-based and varies depending on the demographic makeup of residents, historical patterns of place-based racism and discrimination, jurisdictional policy, and investment priorities-all influenced by structural racism.

Countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an agent-based model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The agent-based model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of total COVID-19 cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford County, KS, USA. Different interventions, including contact tracing, are applied on a scaled-down version of New York City, USA, and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with city-wide lockdown results in the effective reproduction number (R(t)) to fall below 1 within 3 weeks of intervention. For 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated, and the spread is contained within 3 months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lockdown can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lockdown can go a long way to contain the spread.

This study aimed to analyze the symptomatic and clinical characteristics of study participants based on the medical records of participants hospitalized with COVID-19 in Uzbekistan. METHODS: We collected all data from medical records of COVID-19 confirmed patients in 19 hospitals from 13 regions of Uzbekistan between March 15 and April 30. We selected 1,030 patients discharged from the hospitals after COVID-19 treatment as study participants, excluding those with missing data. Further, we collected demographics, symptoms, clinical outcomes, and treatment data through medical records. RESULTS: More than half (57.6%) of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were males, and the median age was 36.0 years. The most frequent symptoms at the first inspection on hospital admission of all patients were fatigue (59.7%), dry cough (54.1%), pharyngalgia (31.6%), headache (20.6%), and anorexia (12.5%).

However, questions remain about the role of the injectable agent, particularly in the context of regimens using new and repurposed drugs. We compared the effectiveness of an injectable-containing regimen to that of an all-oral regimen among patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis who received bedaquiline- and/or delamanid as part of their multidrug regimen. METHODS: Patients with a positive baseline culture were included. Six-month culture conversion was defined as two consecutive negative cultures collected >15a? days apart. We derived predicted probabilities of culture conversion and relative risk using marginal standardisation methods. RESULTS: Culture conversion was observed in 83.8% (526/628) of patients receiving an all-oral regimen and 85.5% (425/497) of those receiving an injectable-containing regimen. The adjusted relative risk comparing injectable-containing regimens to all-oral regimens was 0.96 (95%CI: 0.88-1.04).

When convolution kernels are positive, their formal equivalence with probability distributions allows one to use imprecise probability theory to achieve such an imprecise convolution. However, many kernels can have negative values, in which case the previous equivalence does not hold anymore. Yet, we show mathematically in this paper that, while the formal equivalence is lost, the computational tools used to describe sets of probabilities by intervals on the singletons still retain their key properties when used to approximate sets of (possibly) non-positive kernels. We then illustrate their use on a single application that consists of filtering a human electrocardiogram signal by using a low-pass filter whose order is imprecisely known.

The patients sociodemographic and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory test results, clinical and radiological findings, treatment protocols and prognoses were recorded. RESULTS: We incidentally diagnosed COVID\\\\19 pneumonia in 81 asymptomatic patients. All patients presented to the emergency department with traumatic injuries. Of these, 38 (46%) were injured in in\\\\vehicle traffic accidents; 27 (34%) out\\\\of\\\\vehicle traffic accidents; 14 (18%) simple falls; and 2 (2%) falls from a height. Only 42 (48%) patients had a history of suspected contact with a COVID\\\\19 positive individual. The mean time to symptom onset of 81 patients was 5  2 days. An analysis based on thoracic computerised tomography findings showed that the common finding found in all patients was ground glass opacity (GGO). While 55 (68%) patients had GGO alone, 10 (12%) had additional fine reticulations; 6 (7%) had an additional halo sign; 6 (7%) had an additional air bronchogram and 4 (5%) had an additional area of consolidation.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted through a digital questionnaire, which was completed by 1,985 respondents between March 29 and April 12. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), the 9-Item Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. RESULTS: The 62.4% of the surveyed population reported signs of psychological distress. It was found that being a woman, being 18 to 27 years old, living with family members or a partner, smoking, and having a poor sleep quality were the significant risk factors.

Although the serological relationships among ruminant pestiviruses require further clarification, there is growing evidence for two antigenic groups, one of which predominates in cattle and one in sheep. The success of pestiviruses stems from the ability of the non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype of the virus to cross the placenta and establish a persistent infection (PI) in the developing foetus. This biotype should be regarded as the normal biotype with the cytopathic (CP) biotype being an abnormal virus that is usually isolated only from PI animals dying from mucosal disease. Recent molecular evidence points to CP viruses arising from their NCP counterparts by recombination events that include the insertion of host RNA and/or the duplication of viral RNA sequences. However, the biological mechanism through which CP viruses kill cells remains unknown. Virtually all CP and NCP viruses cause only mild, transient clinical symptoms in healthy adult animals and stimulate a protective immune response. Despite the urgent requirement for a safe, effective vaccine, there is still no commercial vaccine that has been shown to immunize dams so that foetal infection is prevented. In the absence of an effective vaccine, reliable diagnostic techniques are essential to implement effective control measures. There is now a range of monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for identifying PI or convalescent animals.

The principal is similar to focusing the suns rays with a magnifying glass, causing a burn at the focal point. This can be done with ultrasound if the usual diagnostic energy is increased 10,000 times. The ultrasound energy is generated under water and the energy passed noninvasively into the body to a sharp focus where it destroys tissue. The technology is rapidly evolving. In urology, trials have been done in a number of areas but the two which are most promising at the present time are for the treatment of renal and prostate cancers. Treatment of renal cancer is currently limited by the position of the kidneys due to the ribs and the presence of perinephric fat, but treatment for prostate cancer is becoming more established. ABSTRACT: This review provides an introduction to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and reviews its historical and current use in urological surgery. Current and historical literature (1927C2020), including that describing trials and review articles in the medical and ultrasonic literature, has been reviewed, using Pub Med and Cochrane search engines. HIFU is currently one of a number of treatments for prostate cancer, both as a primary treatment that can be repeated, and as a salvage treatment post-radiotherapy. HIFU is not yet sufficiently mature to be a standard treatment for renal cancer or other urological diseases, although there has been some success in early clinical trials. As the technology improves, this situation is likely to change. HIFU has been understood as a concept for a century, and has been applied in experimental use for half that time. It is now an accepted treatment with low morbidity in many diseases outside the scope of this review. In urological surgery, prostate HIFU is accepted as a localised treatment in selected cases, with potentially fewer side effects than other localised therapies. Currently the treatment for renal cancer is hindered by the perinephric fat and the position of the kidneys behind the ribs; however, as the technology improves with image fusion, faster treatments, and the ability with phased array transducers and motion compensation to overcome the problems caused by the ribs and breathing, successful treatment of kidney tumours will become more of a reality. In due course, there will be a new generation of machines for treating prostate cancer. These devices will further minimise the side effects of radical treatment of prostate cancer.","output":"A Review of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound in Urology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What happens when a public university decides to construct a cross-disciplinary, cross-functional initiative to explore the future, build capacity to be more ?future ready? and resilient, and serve as a resource for the university and broader community to help them do the same?

METHODS This single center, retrospective study was conducted at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University. Data were extracted from the prospective institutional registry database of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict risk factors. RESULTS A total of 170 consecutive adult patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Ninety-four patients were included in the final analysis. The incidence of agitation and hyperactive delirium was 35% in our population of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported postcardiotomy patients. Agitation and delirium usually occurred within the first 3 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Multivariable analysis showed that history of previous stroke (without preoperative cognitive dysfunction; odds ratio, 4.425, 95% confidence interval: 1.171-16.716; p = 0.028) and mean arterial pressure reduction (before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation) ? 49 mmHg (odds ratio, 7.570, 95% confidence interval: 2.366-24.219, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for agitation and hyperactive delirium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.

Despite the availability of safe and efficacious vaccines, achieving herd immunity remains a challenge due in part to rapid viral evolution. Multiple variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged, the latest being the heavily mutated Omicron, which exhibits the highest resistance to neutralizing antibodies from past vaccination or infection. Currently approved vaccines generate robust systemic immunity, yet poor immunity at the respiratory tract. We have demonstrated that a polymersome-based protein subunit vaccine with wild type (WT) spike protein and CpG adjuvant induces robust systemic immunity (humoral and T cell responses) in mice. Both antigen and adjuvant are encapsulated in artificial cell membrane (ACM) polymersomes C synthetic, nanoscale vesicles that substantially enhance the immune response through efficient delivery to dendritic cells. In the present study, we have formulated a vaccine candidate with the spike protein from Beta variant and assessed its immunogenicity in golden Syrian hamsters. Two doses of ACM-Beta spike vaccine administered via intramuscular (IM) injection evoke modest serum neutralizing titers that are equally efficacious towards WT and Beta viruses. In contrast, the ACM-WT spike vaccine induces a predominantly WT-specific serum neutralizing response with pronounced reduction in potency towards the Beta variant. Remarkably, immunogenicity of the ACM-Beta spike vaccine is greatly enhanced through intranasal (IN) administration. Following IN challenge with the Beta variant, IM-immunized hamsters are fully protected from disease but not infection, displaying similar peak viral RNA loads in oral swabs as non-vaccinated controls. In contrast, hamsters IN vaccinated with ACM-Beta spike vaccine are protected from disease and infection, exhibiting a 100-fold drop in total and subgenomic RNA load as early as day 2 post challenge. We further demonstrate that nasal washes from IN-but not IM-immunized animals possess virus neutralizing activity that is broadly efficacious towards Delta and Omicron variants. Altogether, our results show IN administration of ACM-Beta spike vaccine to evoke systemic and mucosal antibodies that cross-neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Our work supports IN administration of ACM-Beta spike vaccine for a next-generation vaccination strategy that not only protects against disease but also an infection of the respiratory tract, thus potentially preventing asymptomatic transmission.","output":"Next-generation intranasal Covid-19 vaccine: a polymersome-based protein subunit formulation that provides robust protection against multiple variants of concern and early reduction in viral load of the upper airway in the golden Syrian hamster model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last few decades, the nature of life sciences research has changed enormously, generating a need for a workforce with a variety of computational skills such as those required to store, manage, and analyse the large biological datasets produced by next-generation sequencing.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the reasons and the necessity of transportation to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance and the outcomes of these cases with the admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic period and during the same period in 2019. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in which patients transported to the ED by ambulance in April 2019 and April 2020 were compared. The primary outcomes were the changes in the number and diagnoses of patients who were transferred to the ED by ambulance during the COVID-19 period. The secondary outcome was the need for patients to be transferred to the hospital by ambulance. RESULTS: A total of 4,466 patients were included in the study. During the COVID-19 period, there was a 41.6% decrease in ED visits and a 31.5% decrease in ambulance calls. The number of critically ill patients transported by ambulance (with diagnoses such as decompensated heart failure [P <.001], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] attack (P = .001), renal failure [acute-chronic; P = .008], angina pectoris [P <.001], and syncope [P <.001]) decreased statistically significantly in 2020. Despite this decrease in critical patient calls, non-emergency patient calls continued and 52.2% of the patients transported by ambulance in 2020 were discharged from the ED.

The pandemic's rapid evolution has resulted in a knowledge gap in how COVID-19 has affected MS clinical practice. Our objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice patterns in a nationwide cohort of MS clinicians across the United States. METHODS: In collaboration with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), we developed a 28-item SurveyMonkey(TM) electronic questionnaire exploring MS specialists perceptions of how COVID-19 has altered how they prescribe MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), provide telehealth and other services, and view issues affecting their own well-being including re-deployment to the front lines of COVID-19 care and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). NMSS staff sent a recruitment email containing the electronic survey link to 188 clinicians who serve on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US, 86 (45.7%) of whom were MS specialist physicians. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 188 potential respondents (45.7%) from 32 US states completed the survey including 45 physicians (41 neurologists, 3 physiatrists and 1 family physician), 18 rehabilitation therapists, 7 psychologists, 6 nurse practitioners, 4 social workers, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurses and 2 health professionals from other disciplines. More than 80% of all respondents working on-site in a health care setting believed they had adequate PPE. More than 41% were able to distance safely from others at work. Nearly 10% of respondents reported they had been re-deployed to the front lines of COVID-19 patient care, and an additional 16.9% anticipated being re-deployed. Among the MS specialist physician subgroup, nearly one-third reported using telemedicine to provide over 75% of their clinical care. Only 16.7% believed COVID-19 had not changed how they prescribe DMTs. Therapies prescribed more often during the pandemic included -IFNs (28.6% of prescribers), natalizumab (23.8%), glatiramer acetate (21.4%) and teriflunomide (19%). DMTs prescribed less often included alemtuzumab (64.3% of prescribers), cladribine (54.8%), ocrelizumab and rituximab (50%), and fingolimod and siponimod (40.5%). For at least some of their patients during the pandemic, some MS specialists reported suspending certain DMTs including alemtuzumab (21.4% of prescribers), ocrelizumab and rituximab (16.7%) and cladribine (11.9%). Others reported extending DMT dosing intervals for natalizumab (38.1%), fingolimod and siponimod (11.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide survey, MS specialist physicians and other clinicians serving on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US reported profound changes in how they are delivering MS care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Results of a Nationwide Provider Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) earlier known only as the Wuhan virus, expanded its circle and finally spreading its routes to India The guidelines/considerations published by various government organizations for management of dead bodies in context of COVID-19 were reviewed The problem arrived when experts found some loopholes in government guidelines and other social issues were raised in different parts of country regarding the final rituals of deceased died due to suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 Some cases were also observed in neighboring countries also In this article, light was thrown on utility of body bags for handling dead bodies, environmental cleaning, autopsy & embalming related issues, precautions in case of community deaths etc We tried to discuss the issues in light of available guidelines by government of India and other international guidelines","output":"Considerations related to safe handling of dead bodies of deceased persons with covid-19: Issues and review of guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thymosin &#945;1 therapy was commonly used in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), while its impact on outcomes and which patients could benefit from thymosin &#945;1 therapy were uncertain.

Coronavirus has become an issue of transnational concern. The importance of the media in the coverage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria and its implications among Nigerian populace cannot be overestimated. This study evaluates how Nigerian media depict the coronavirus pandemic and how the depictions shape people's perception and response to the pandemic. Methods: The study employed a quantitative design (newspaper content analysis and questionnaire). The content analysis examines the nature of media coverage of coronavirus in Nigeria and China using four major national newspapers (The Sun, The Vanguard, The Guardian and The Punch). The period of study ranged from January 2020 to March 2020. A total of 1070newspaper items on coronavirus outbreak were identified across the four newspapers and content-analysed. Results: The finding shows that the coverage of the pandemic was dominated by straight news reports accounting for 763 or (71.3%) of all analysed items. This was followed by opinions 169(15.8%), features 120 (11.2%) and editorials 18 (1.7%) respectively. The Punch 309 (28.9%)reported the outbreak more frequently than The Sun 266 (24.9%), The Guardian 258 (24.1%), and Vanguard 237 (22.1%). Finding further suggests that the framing pattern adopted by the newspapers helped Nigerians to take precautionary measures. Conclusion: Continuous reportage of COVID-19 has proved effective in creating awareness about safety and preventive measures thereby helping to 'flatten the curve' and contain the spread of the virus.

The emergence and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused confusion, anxiety and fear among the community, including university students. Anxiety to the COVID-19 pandemic causes various psychological manifestations, including fear of disease transmission, loss of loved ones, and decline in future socio-economic aspects. Anxiety can also lead to physical responses like gastrointestinal symptoms. This study aimed to determine the relationship between anxiety to COVID-19 pandemic and gastrointestinal symptoms complained by university students. Methods: This observational analytic study using cross-sectional approaches involved 311 university students of Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Anxiety to COVID-19 pandemic was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale questionnaire, while gastrointestinal symptoms were measured using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Result: Of the 311 respondents, 157 (50.5%) of them felt anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic, with 28 (9%) and 13 (4.2%) students experienced severe and very severe anxiety, respectively. Besides, 264 (84.9%) university students complained of gastrointestinal symptoms, both upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. There was a significant relationship between the level of anxiety to COVID-19 pandemic and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Old age and underlying illnesses are associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients. However, whether frailty, a common geriatric syndrome of reduced reserve to stressors, is associated with poor prognosis among older COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of our study is to investigate the association between frailty and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged  60 years. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 114 hospitalized older patients ( 60 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted between 7 February 2020 and 6 April 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data on admission were extracted from electronic medical records. All patients were assessed for frailty on admission using the FRAIL scale, in which five components are included: fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight. The outcome was the development of the severe disease within 60 days. We used the Cox proportional hazards models to identify the unadjusted and adjusted associations between frailty and severe illness. The significant variables in univariable analysis were included in the adjusted model. RESULTS: Of 114 patients, (median age, 67 years; interquartile range = 64C75 years; 57 [50%] men), 39 (34.2%), 39 (34.2%), and 36 (31.6%) were non-frail, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. During the 60 days of follow-up, 43 severe diseases occurred including eight deaths. Four of 39 (10.3%) non-frail patients, 15 of 39 (38.5%) pre-frail patients, and 24 of 36 (66.7%) frail patients progressed to severe disease. After adjustment of age, sex, body mass index, haemoglobin, white blood count, lymphocyte count, albumin, CD8+ count, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, frailty (HR = 7.47, 95% CI 1.73C32.34, P = 0.007) and pre-frailty (HR = 5.01, 95% CI 1.16C21.61, P = 0.03) were associated with a higher hazard of severe disease than the non-frail. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, assessed by the FRAIL scale, was associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease among older COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggested that the use of a clinician friendly assessment of frailty could help in early warning of older patients at high-risk with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"The association between frailty and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged over 60 years in China: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To obtain a list of recommendations about clinical and radiological factors affecting outcome in thoraco-lumbar fractures with the aim of helping spine surgeons in daily practice.

One explanation is the fear of complications due to anastomotic dehiscence in oesophagojejunal anastomosis known to carry high morbidity and mortality. The introduction of staplers have contributed to making anastomosis safer and easier to perform and has facilitated more advanced laparoscopic surgery. In open surgery, most surgeons use a circular stapler for oesophagojejunal anastomosis or a hand sutured technique. Both techniques are difficult to use in laparoscopic surgery, especially if the oesophagus is narrow. To facilitate the creation of oesophagojejunal anastomoses, we have adopted a technique with a linear stapled anastomosis. Our method is based on a stapling technique where the oesophagus is divided above the gastric cardia followed by a oesophagojejunostomy performed with Covidien's new Endo GIA-60? Ultra Universal stapler. The residual opening is closed with a 3-0 re-absorbable suture. PATIENTS AND METHODS From June 2009 to May 2012, 14 men and 16 women (median age=66 years, range=39-84 years) underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy due to gastric cancer. RESULTS One patient died during hospital stay; corresponding to a postoperative mortality of 3,3%. Leakage in the oesophagojejunal anastomosis occurred in three patients (10%). Two of the patients with leakage in the oesophagojejunal anastomosis had an additional duodenal bulb leakage, which might have caused anastomotic dehiscence. The patients had a median postoperative hospital stay of six days (range=3-156 days). Six patients had a re-operation due to complications, including one endoscopic stent application in the anastomosis. CONCLUSION Even though a leakage rate of 10% can be considered high, this study describes a simple method for performing oesophagojejunostomy after gastrectomy by a laparoscopic approach independently of the width of the oesophagus. This study also shows that laparoscopic gastrectomy can be performed in more advanced stages of gastric cancer.","output":"Laparoscopic minimally invasive total gastrectomy with linear stapled oesophagojejunostomy--experience from the first thirty procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat persepsi ujaran berdasarkan pengalaman psikologis tenaga kesehatan (perawat) yang menangani Coronavirus.

Daily infection and death rates from January 22, 2020 through April 15, 2021 for the United States (US) were downloaded from the US Center for Disease Control COVID-19 website. A Savitzky-Golay filter estimated the moving time average of each data sequence with 5 different window-sizes. A locally-designed inflection point identification algorithm with a variable length line-fitting sub-routine identified peak infection and death rates, and quantified the time-delay between a peak infection and subsequent death rate. Although filter window-size did not affect the time-delay calculation (p = 0.99), there was a significant effect of fitting-line length (p < 0.001). A significant effect of time-delay length was found among three infection outbreaks (p < 0.001), and there was a significant difference between time-delay lengths (p < 0.01). A maximum D-CFR of approximately 7% occurred during the first infection outbreak; however, starting approximately 2.5 months after the first peak, a significant negative linear trend (p < 0.001) in the D-CFR continued until the end of the analyzed data.

As an outbreak begins, epidemiological investigations and traditional public health responses are generally mounted very quickly. However, patient-centred research is usually not prioritised when planning and enacting the response. Instead, the clinical research response occurs subsequent to and separate from the public health response, and is inadequate for evidence-based decision-making at the bedside or in the offices of public health policymakers. DISCUSSION: The deficiencies of the clinical research response to severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus demonstrate that current research models do not adequately inform and improve the quality of clinical care or public health response. Three suggestions for improvements are made. First, integrate the data and sample collection needs for clinical and public health decision-making within a unified framework, combined with a risk-based, rather than a discipline-based, approach to ethical review and consent. Second, develop clinical study methods and tools that are specifically designed to meet the epidemiological and contextual challenges of emerging and epidemic infectious diseases. Third, invest in investigator-led clinical research networks that are primed and incentivised to respond to outbreak infections, and which can call on the support and resources of a central centre of excellence. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial that the field of epidemic science matures to place patients at the heart of the response. This can only be achieved when patient-centred research is integrated in the outbreak response from day one and practical steps are taken to reduce the barriers to the generation of reliable and useful evidence.","output":"Modernising epidemic science: enabling patient-centred research during epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The massive emergence of COVID19 cases in the first phase of pandemic within an extremely short period of time suggest that an undetected earlier circulation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred, as documented by several papers in different countries, including a few that reported positive cases even earlier the first cases identified in Wuhan.

In contrast, the impact on research has been variable. To classify the pandemic-related effect on research, the development of the number of scientific publications of the German ORL university hospitals before and during the pandemic was analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The publication performance between 2015 and 2020 of the 39 current chairmen was surveyed using a literature search (Pubmed). All entries relating to the chairmen of the university hospital as first, last or co-author were included. The absolute and relative development of each author's publication performance was determined and evaluated using nonparametric statistical methods. RESULTS: A total of 2420 publications could be documented. From 2015 to 2019, an average of 368 publications were published per year. In 2020, this number increased by 57.9a??% to 581 publications. While the number of monthly publications remained constant between 2015 and 2019, a significant increase was seen from May 2020 up to a maximum of 74 publications in September 2020. In 2020, 34 articles (5.9a??%) had a thematic relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with 7 of these papers (20.6a??%) resulting from cross-site publications. CONCLUSION: In 2020, the number of scientific publications was raised to more than 1.5 times the usual annual publications. This increase was clearly related in time to the reduction of elective patient care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. Probably, free time capacities enabled this increased publication output.

RESULTS One-quarter of IPFs were in counties with high or very high COVID-19 vulnerability. On average, 84% of patients at IPFs were screened for influenza immunization status and were offered an immunization if indicated. Only 57% of patients had their records transmitted to another provider within 24 hours of discharge, and 50% had a follow-up visit with a mental health provider within 30 days.

Blood samples were collected before inoculation and at day post-inoculation (dpi) 3, 6, 9 and 12 and tested for the presence of PRRSV antibody and RNA, PCV2 antibody and DNA, complete blood counts, and interferon gamma (IFN-) levels. Regardless of concurrent PCV2 infection, VR-2385 initially replicated at higher levels and reached peak replication levels at dpi 6. Pigs infected with VR-2385 had significantly higher amounts of viral RNA in serum on both dpi 3 and dpi 6, compared to pigs infected with NC16845b. The peak of NC16845b virus replication occurred between dpi 9 and dpi 12 and was associated with a delayed anti-PRRSV antibody response in these pigs.

Unfortunately, there is no cure for this disease, which highlights the need for further investigation about the pathophysiology of this disease to provide clues for developing novel therapeutic regimens. Herein, we identified that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, a potent lymphangiogenic factor, is up-regulated in endometriotic cells and contributes to increased lymphangiogenesis. Bioinformatic analysis and molecular biological characterization revealed that VEGF-C is negatively regulated by an orphan nuclear receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII). Further studies demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines, via suppression of COUP-TFII level, induce VEGF-C overexpression. More importantly, we show that functional VEGF-C is transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance the lymphangiogenic ability of lymphatic endothelial cells. Autotransplanted mouse model of endometriosis showed lenvatinib treatment abrogated the increased lymphatic vessels development in the endometriotic lesion, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and immune cells infiltration, indicating that blocking VEGF-C signaling can reduce local chronic inflammation and concomitantly endometriosis development. Evaluation of EV-transmitted VEGF-C from patients' sera demonstrates it is a reliable noninvasive way for clinical diagnosis. Taken together, we identify the vicious cycle of inflammation, COUP-TFII, VEGF-C, and lymphangiogenesis in the endometriotic microenvironment, which opens up new horizons in understanding the pathophysiology of endometriosis.

COVID-19 results in extra 15 million unintended pregnancies over a year. Almost all previous studies conducted about unintended pregnancy were before COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic among women attending antenatal care in public hospitals of southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: This study was cross-sectional and conducted among women attending antenatal care at public hospitals of southwest Ethiopia from June 14 to July 14, 2021. Data were collected using a face-to-face interview. Factors associated with unintended pregnancy were analyzed using binary and multiple logistic regressions with an adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Finally, the p-value was used as a graded measure of evidence to quantify the degree of significance. RESULTS: A total of 405 women participated in this study. The overall prevalence of unintended pregnancy was 19.5% (95% CI: 1.44C6.92) among women attending antenatal care during COVID-19 pandemic. Of which, 50.6% were mistimed and 49.4% unwanted.

These ROS originate from activated neutrophils in infections and in immune and autoimmune reactions, from tissue deposits of ferritin, and from futile cycling of cytochrome P450 (CYP) following exposure to persistent chemicals, and may be perpetuated by the actions of complement, cytokines and eicosanoids. Acute inflammation is normally arrested by removal of ROS by tissue glutathione (GSH) and the antioxidant vitamins, A, C and E, all of which are regenerated by NADH and NADPH. Failure of this antioxidant defence system can lead to oxidative stress and to chronic inflammatory disease, including surgical shock and MSOF. The roles of oxidative stress and microcirculatory arrest in promoting MSOF, and of GSH, the antioxidant defence system, and fibronectin in preventing this, are reviewed in the light of recent experimental studies of surgical shock, including fasting, anaesthesia, hepatic ischaemia and reperfusion.","output":"The pathogenesis of inflammatory disease: Surgical shock and multiple system organ failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. Vitamin D in particular may perturb viral cellular infection via interacting with cell entry receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), ACE2. Dietary fiber, fermented by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, has also been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we highlight the importance of an optimal status of relevant nutrients to effectively reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the immune system during the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"Strengthening the Immune System and Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress through Diet and Nutrition: Considerations during the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article deals with the results of the online survey on the problems and needs of Ukrainian educators toward the use of the digital tools for distance teaching and learning conducted by the Comparative Studies Department for Information and Education Innovations of the Institute of Information technologies and Learning Tools of the National Academy of Educational Science (NAES) of Ukraine in 2021.

In this paper, we aimed to quantify the total utility and quality of life loss resulting from Covid-19-related government restrictions imposed at the national, regional and global levels. METHODS: We conducted quality of life online surveys in France, India, Italy, UK and the United States of America between June 21st and September 13th 2021, and used regression models to estimate the average quality of life loss due to light and severe restrictions in these countries. We then combined estimated disutility weights from the pooled sample with the latest data on Covid-19 restrictions exposure in each country to estimate the total disutility generated by restrictions at the national, regional and global level. We also embedded a discrete choice experiment (DCE) into the online survey to estimate average willingness to pay to avoid specific restrictions. FINDINGS: A total of 947 surveys were completed. Thirty-five percent of respondents were female, and 69.5% were between 18 and 39 years old. The weighted average utility weight was 0.71 (95% CIs 0.69C0.74) for light restrictions, and 0.65 (0.63C0.68) for severe restrictions. At the global scale, this implies a total loss of 3259 million QALYs (95% 3021, 3496) as of September 6th, 2021, with the highest burden in lower and upper middle-income countries. Utility losses appear to be particularly large for closures of schools and daycares as well as restaurants and bars, and seem relatively small for wearing masks and travel restrictions. INTERPRETATION: The results presented here suggest that the QALY losses due to restrictions are substantial. Future mitigation strategies should try to balance potential reductions in disease transmission achievable through specific measures against their respective impact on quality of life. Additional research is needed to determine differences in restriction-specific disutilities across countries, and to determine optimal policy responses to similar future disease threats.

It includes 9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol to analyse long-term OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment strategies (i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol enables the quantifications of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like OA (COA), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, a range of 43.7-100%).

This study estimated the regional resistance of MSME sales revenues and identified the regional economic factors that affect resistance by analyzing South Korea, a country with one of the lowest economic impact projections from COVID-19. Resistance was estimated by comparing sales revenues and changes in resistance observed during the early COVID-19 period to those recorded in the same weeks (weeks 6 to 9) of 2019. The factors that affect regional resistance were determined by conducting robust regression and spatial regression analyses. The results show that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, a direct risk factor, is negatively related to regional resilience, while diversity is positively related to regional resistance.

The frequency of cardiac injury remains highly uncertain and confounded in current publications; myocarditis is one of several mechanisms that have been proposed. METHODS We prospectively assessed patients with myocardial injury hospitalized for COVID-19 using transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy. RESULTS Eighteen patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury were included in this study. Echocardiography revealed normal to mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 52.5% (46.5%-60.5%) but moderately to severely reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain of -11.2% (-7.6% to -15.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance showed any myocardial tissue injury defined by elevated T1, extracellular volume, or late gadolinium enhancement with a nonischemic pattern in 16 patients (83.3%). Seven patients (38.9%) demonstrated myocardial edema in addition to tissue injury fulfilling the Lake-Louise criteria for myocarditis. Combining cardiac magnetic resonance with speckle tracking echocardiography demonstrated functional or morphological cardiac changes in 100% of investigated patients. Endomyocardial biopsy was conducted in 5 patients and revealed enhanced macrophage numbers in all 5 patients in addition to lymphocytic myocarditis in 1 patient. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any biopsy by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Finally, follow-up measurements of left ventricular global longitudinal strain revealed significant improvement after a median of 52.0 days (-11.2% [-9.2% to -14.7%] versus -15.6% [-12.5% to -19.6%] at follow-up; P=0.041).

Some recent guidelines have favored general anesthesia (GA) in patients perceived as high risk for intraprocedural conversion from sedation to GA, including those with dominant hemispheric occlusions/aphasia or baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >15. We aim to identify the rate and predictors of conversion to GA during MT in a high-volume center where monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is the default modality. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained MT database from January 2013 to July 2020 was undertaken. Analyses were conducted to identify the predictors of intraprocedural conversion to GA. In addition, we analyzed the GA conversion rates in subgroups of interest. RESULTS: Among 1919 MT patients, 1681 (87.6%) started treatment under MAC (median age 65 years (IQR 55-76); baseline NIHSS 16 (IQR 11-21); 48.4% women). Of the 1677 eligible patients, 26 (1.6%) converted to GA including 1.4% (22/1615) with anterior and 6.5% (4/62) with posterior circulation strokes. The only predictor of GA conversion was posterior circulation stroke (OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.67 to 14.96, P=0.004). The conversion rates were numerically higher in right than in left hemispheric occlusions (1.6% vs 1.2%; OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.19, P=0.47) and in milder than in more severe strokes (NIHSS &#8804;15 vs >15: 2% vs 1.2%; OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.36, P=0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the overall rate of conversion from MAC to GA during MT was low (1.6%) and, while higher in posterior circulation strokes, it was not predicted by either hemispheric dominance or stroke severity.

Viruses that replicate in the nucleus adopt different strategies to hijack cellular export factors and achieve cytoplasmic translation of their mRNAs. No export receptors are known in plants, but Arabidopsis TREX resembles the mammalian complex, with a conserved hexameric THO core associated with ALY and UIEF proteins, as well as UAP56 and MOS11. The latter protein is an orthologue of mammalian CIP29. The nuclear export mechanism for viral mRNAs has not been described in plants. To understand this process, we investigated the export of mRNAs of the pararetrovirus CaMV in Arabidopsis and demonstrated that it is inhibited in plants deficient in ALY, MOS11 and/or TEX1. Deficiency for these factors renders plants partially resistant to CaMV infection. Two CaMV proteins, the coat protein P4 and reverse transcriptase P5, are important for nuclear export. P4 and P5 interact and co-localise in the nucleus with the cellular export factor MOS11. The highly structured 5' leader region of 35S RNAs was identified as an export enhancing element that interacts with ALY1, ALY3 and MOS11 in vitro.","output":"Nuclear export of plant pararetrovirus mRNAs involves the TREX complex, two viral proteins and the highly structured 5' leader region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Medication dosing errors can occur during microinfusions when there is vertical pump displacement or multidrug infusion through a single intravenous path. We compared flow rate variability between new-generation cylinder-type infusion pumps and conventional infusion pumps under simulated conditions. METHODS We evaluated the flow rates during microinfusions using different infusion pumps (syringe pump with 10/30/50-mL syringes, peristaltic pump, and cylinder pump). Two visible dyes were used as model drugs. The study samples were quantified using spectrophotometry. For vertical displacement, the infusion pumps were moved up and down by 60 cm during microinfusions at 0.5 mLh-1 and 2 mLh-1. In the multi-infusion study, the second drug flow was added through 4 linearly connected stopcocks either upstream or downstream of the first drug. We compared the total error dose between the cylinder pump and the syringe pump with a Mann-Whitney U test and additionally estimated the effects of the infusion pumps on total error doses by linear regression analysis. RESULTS There were repetitive patterns of temporary flow increases when the pump was displaced upward and flow decreases when the pump was displaced downward in all settings. However, the amount of flow irregularities was more pronounced at the lower infusion rate and in the syringe-type pump using larger volume syringes. The total error dose increased in the syringe pump loaded with a 50-mL syringe compared to that of the new cylinder pump (regression coefficient [] = 4.66 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.60-7.72]; P = .008). The initiation and cessation of a new drug during multidrug microinfusion in the same intravenous path affected the lower rate first drug leading to a transient flow rate increase and decrease, respectively. The change in flow rate was observed regardless of the port selected for addition of the second drug, and the total error dose of the first drug did not significantly vary when an upstream or a downstream port was selected. CONCLUSIONS In the microinfusion settings, attention must be paid to the use of the syringe pump loaded with large-volume syringes. The novel cylinder pump could be considered as a practical alternative to syringe pumps with small syringes given its flow stability without the need for frequent drug replacement.","output":"Simulation Analysis of Flow Rate Variability During Microinfusions: The Effect of Vertical Displacement and Multidrug Infusion in Conventional Infusion Pumps Versus New Cylinder-Type Infusion Pumps."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world has moved toward rigorous containment measures due to the spread of a novel coronavirus, it is crucial to push the boundaries of clinical data obtaining methods using real-time capturing facilities.

While several functional studies are underway to understand the consequences of FOXP2 variation, this study aims to expand previous findings to clinically and genetically related phenotypes and neuroanatomical features among subjects with ADHD. The sample included 407 adults with ADHD and 463 controls. Genotyping was performed on the Infinium PsychArray-24 BeadChip, and the FOXP2 gene region was extracted. A gene-wide approach was adopted to evaluate the combined effects of FOXP2 variants (n = 311) on ADHD status, severity, comorbidities, and personality traits. Independent risk variants presenting potential functional effects were further tested for association with cortical surface areas in a subsample of cases (n = 87).

Hospital transfusion guidelines may be difficult to locate and not agree with national guidelines. We developed and tested a dedicated app providing national evidence-based guidelines for use at the point of care to help clinicians make better decisions when authorising blood. METHODS/MATERIALS We identified areas of blood authorisation with high frequency of component use and evidence of widespread unnecessary authorisation. We developed seven representative clinical scenarios where the transfusion of blood components may or may not benefit the adult patient. Responding doctors were invited to select their authorisation choice via an online questionnaire, initially without and then with access to the app. Adherence to guidelines was assessed with and without aid of the app. RESULTS Using the app, doctors were much more likely to select the correct decision, in accordance with national guidance. Compared with baseline measurements, decisions improved by 67% for RBC, 58% for platelets and 73% for FFP. These improvements were statistically significant.

This investigation aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic effects of chloroquine and azithromycin observed in a large previously conducted healthy volunteer study. Healthy adult volunteers (n = 119) were randomized into five arms: placebo, chloroquine alone (600 mg base), or chloroquine with either 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 1500 mg of azithromycin all given daily for three days. Chloroquine and azithromycin levels, measured using LC-MS/MS, and electrocardiograph intervals were recorded at frequent intervals. Time-matched changes in the PR, QRS, and heart rate-corrected JTc, and QTc intervals were calculated and the relationship with plasma concentrations was evaluated using linear and nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Chloroquine and azithromycin pharmacokinetics were described satisfactorily by two- and three-compartment distribution models, respectively. No drug-drug interaction between chloroquine and azithromycin was observed. Chloroquine resulted in concentration-dependent prolongation of the PR, QRS, and JTc intervals with a minimal additional effect of azithromycin. QRS widening contributed approximately 28% of the observed QT prolongation. Chloroquine causes significant concentration-dependent delays in both ventricular depolarization and repolarization.

RESULTS: We found that although there was no significant difference between PT and PTT values in patients and healthy counterparts, the fibrinogen values in patients were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the values of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer in all COVID-19 cases were considerably higher than those in control people (p < 0.05). Of note, FDP and D-dimer in patients with regular COVID-19 infection were lower than patients with severe forms. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the conduction of routine blood coagulation test could be a beneficial supplementary approach for early diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, our study shed more light on the therapeutic value of anti-coagulant-based treatment for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with severe type of the disease.","output":"Contribution value of coagulation abnormalities in COVID-19 prognosis: a bright perspective on the laboratory pattern of patients with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Effective management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires large-scale testing to identify and isolate infectious carriers. Self-administered buccal swab and saliva collection are convenient, painless, and safe alternatives to the current healthcare worker (HCW)-collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: A cross-sectional single-centre study was conducted on 42 participants who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via an NPS within the past 7 days. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained for each test. The positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for the saliva samples and buccal swabs, and compared with NPS. RESULTS: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive by any one of the three tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7%, and OA 69.0%; the buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100%, and OA 73.8%. CONCLUSION: Self-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs showed only moderate agreement with HCW-collected NPS. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false-negatives, minimize discomfort, and reduce the risk of spread to the community and HCWs.","output":"Validation of self-collected buccal swab and saliva as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Venous thromboembolic disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the setting of large volume pulmonary embolism.

People can become infected by touching infected objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. We need proper and hygienic authentication systems for granting access to authorized users at various places such as companies, universities, banks, etc. Today there are multiple biometric systems that can serve this purpose, but to maintain hygiene we need systems that are contactless in nature thus to reduce spread of infections through touch. The palm vein pattern is distinctive biometric identity of individuals that is also a safe and reliable biometric authentication technique. The major advantage of palm vein biometric that we consider in our proposed system is that this kind of authentication can be done in a contactless way. Here, we propose an authentication system that uses palm vein pattern biometric to authenticate users in a contactless way. We have also added the functionalities of temperature detection and blood oxygen level detection to this system. These health symptoms are the major symptoms of various fatal virus infections such as the coronavirus.

Level of anxiety was evaluated using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. We used ordinal multivariable logistic regression to estimate the associations of anxiety level with potential risk and protective factors, and further developed a new score to simplify the assessment of anxiety disorder during COVID-19 crisis. Results: : Among 19,802 participants (mean [SD] age, 25.3 [8.1], years;10,121 [51.1%] men), we found that those who were front-line medical personnel, suffered from chronic diseases, with present symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection or contact history had 112%, 93%, 40% and 15% increase risk of higher anxiety level;while those with knowledge about personal protective measures or wore masks had 75% and 29% lower risk of higher anxiety level respectively.

An increasing demand, not only in quantity but also in diversity, drives the constant development and improvement of production platforms. The N-glycosylation pattern on biopharmaceuticals plays an important role in activity, serum half-life and immunogenicity. Therefore, production platforms with tailored protein N-glycosylation are of great interest. Plant-based systems have already demonstrated their potential to produce pharmaceutically relevant recombinant proteins, although their N-glycan patterns differ from those in humans. Plants have shown great plasticity towards the manipulation of their glycosylation machinery, and some have already been glyco-engineered in order to avoid the attachment of plant-typical, putatively immunogenic sugar residues. This resulted in complex-type N-glycans with a core structure identical to the human one. Compared to humans, plants lack the ability to elongate these N-glycans with 1,4-linked galactoses and terminal sialic acids. However, these modifications, which require the activity of several mammalian enzymes, have already been achieved for Nicotiana benthamiana and the moss Physcomitrella. Here, we present the first step towards sialylation of recombinant glycoproteins in Physcomitrella, human 1,4-linked terminal N-glycan galactosylation, which was achieved by the introduction of a chimeric 1,4-galactosyltransferase (FTGT). This chimeric enzyme consists of the moss 1,4-fucosyltransferase transmembrane domain, fused to the catalytic domain of the human 1,4-galactosyltransferase. Stable FTGT expression led to the desired 1,4-galactosylation. However, additional pentoses of unknown identity were also observed. The nature of these pentoses was subsequently determined by Western blot and enzymatic digestion followed by mass spectrometric analysis and resulted in their identification as -linked arabinoses. Since a pentosylation of 1,4-galactosylated N-glycans was reported earlier, e.g., on recombinant human erythropoietin produced in glyco-engineered Nicotiana tabacum, this phenomenon is of a more general importance for plant-based production platforms. Arabinoses, which are absent in humans, may prevent the full humanization of plant-derived products. Therefore, the identification of these pentoses as arabinoses is important as it creates the basis for their abolishment to ensure the production of safe biopharmaceuticals in plant-based systems.","output":"Unexpected Arabinosylation after Humanization of Plant Protein N-Glycosylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because the optimal treatment for COVID-19 is still unknown, it is important to explore every potential way of improving the chances of survival for COVID-19 patients.

The impact on clinical and laboratory parameters was assessed. A clinical improvement was observed in 62 (79%) patients, and 10 (13%) patients died from COVID-19. No side effects of the convalescent plasma treatment were observed. When plasma was administered earlier than 7 days from diagnosis, the total hospitalization time was shorter (p < 0.05). Plasma efficacy was inferior to remdesivir in endpoints such as the necessity and duration of oxygen therapy, the duration of hospitalization, and mortality rate, and inferior to other drugs in the case of the duration of hospitalization and the necessity of constant oxygen therapy, but comparable in most other measured endpoints. A comparison of a 30-day mortality rate in patients who received plasma and remdesivir (4/25, 16%) and who received only plasma (6/53, 11%) showed no significant difference. Convalescent plasma efficacy is inferior to remdesivir when treating COVID-19 patients but the addition of remdesivir to plasma does not improve the treatment effectiveness.

SL residents with poor social relationships may be at risk for increased health service use. We describe the demographic and health service use patterns of lonely and socially isolated SL residents and to quantify associations between loneliness and social isolation on unplanned emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using population-based linked health administrative data from Alberta, Canada. All SL residents aged 18 to 105 years who had at least one Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) assessment between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2018 were observed. Loneliness and social isolation were measured as a resident indicating that he/she feels lonely and if the resident had neither a primary nor secondary caregiver, respectively. Health service use in the 1 year following assessment included unplanned ED visits, hospital admissions, admission to higher levels of SL, admission to NH and death. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models examined the association between loneliness and social isolation on the time to first unplanned ED visit. RESULTS: We identified 18,191 individuals living in Alberta SL facilities. The prevalence of loneliness was 18% (n = 3238), social isolation was 4% (n = 713). Lonely residents had the greatest overall health service use. Risk of unplanned ED visit increased with loneliness (aHR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04C1.15) but did not increase with social isolation (aHR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84C1.06).

Periodontitis is a polymicrobial and multifactorial disease involving both host and environmental factors. Tissue destruction is primarily associated with hyperresponsiveness of the host resulting in release of inflammatory mediators. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a major role in bacterial stimulation and tissue destruction. In addition, these cytokines are thought to underlie the associations between periodontitis and systemic conditions. Current research suggests that increased release of cytokines from host cells, referred to as the cytokine storm, is associated with disease progression in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An intersection between periodontitis and pulmonary disease is biologically plausible. Hence, we reviewed the evidence linking COVID-19, cytokines, and periodontal disease. Plaque control is essential to prevent exchange of bacteria between the mouth and the lungs, reducing the risk of lung disease. Understanding these associations may help identify individuals at high risk and deliver appropriate care at early stages.","output":"Nexus between COVID-19 and periodontal disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has recently caused a global health crisis and an effective interventional therapy is urgently needed. Remdesivir is one effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA replication. It supersedes other NTP analogues because it not only terminates the polymerization activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), but also inhibits the proofreading activity of intrinsic exoribonuclease (ExoN). Even though the static structure of Remdesivir binding to RdRp has been solved and biochemical experiments have suggested it to be a \\"delayed chain terminator\\", the underlying molecular mechanisms is not fully understood. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of Remdesivir on nucleotide addition and proofreading. We found that when Remdesivir locates at an upstream site in RdRp, the 1'-cyano group experiences electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge (Asp865-Lys593), which subsequently halts translocation. Our findings can supplement the current understanding of the delayed chain termination exerted by Remdesivir and provide an alternative molecular explanation about Remdesivir's inhibitory mechanism. Such inhibition also reduces the likelihood of Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on 3'-terminal nucleotides. Furthermore, our study also suggests that Remdesivir's 1'-cyano group can disrupt the cleavage site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduction in the cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible and novel mechanisms at the molecular level of how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","output":"1'-Ribose cyano substitution allows Remdesivir to effectively inhibit nucleotide addition and proofreading during SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), threatens humanity in terms of health and economy as it spreads extremely fast and causes massive epidemics all over the world. In the absence of a vaccine, social isolation and hygienic measures are the only way to curb the virus. Methods In our study, the Hungarian spread of COVID-19 is modelled by applying a modified SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) compartment model, which takes into account the route of disease transmission not only from infected, but from latent individuals (exposed compartment) as well. The differences between the modified model and the traditional SEIR model has been evaluated. The different scenarios of disease spreading simulate the effect of the different level of interventions (social distancing and hygienic measures) taken place in Hungary. The modelling also considers the population and mobility data which are also essential in case of infectious disease spreading. For controlling the disease in the long-term a network-based analysis is provided based on the concept of the epidemic threshold and the identification of super-spreader population groups. Results According to sensitivity analysis of the modified SEIR model, disease transmission of latent individuals has the greatest effect on the number of infections. Based on the results, the applied interventions have a great impact on the disease spreading and are effective in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic., a network-based analysis is provided based on the concept of the epidemic threshold and the identification of super-spreader population groups. According to the results of the network-based study, the proportion of people to be sampled for an effective disease control is the function of the identified people with high number of contacts in social networks who act as super-spreaders. Conclusion Applying network-based random, selective and targeted sampling, testing and isolation of affected individuals would yield significantly different sample sizes, highlighting the importance of super-spreaders. Network analysis (but also all computational science methods) need large amount of good quality data and the spread of these methods could be supported by easy-to-use tools.

Developing and evaluating rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic tests is an absolute priority. The current study was designed to assess diagnostic performances of an antigen-based rapid detection test (COVID-VIRO(R)) in a real-life setting. MethodsTwo nasopharyngeal specimens of symptomatic or asymptomatic adult patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department or voluntarily accessing the COVID-19 Screening Department of the Regional Hospital of Orleans, France, were concurrently collected. COVID VIRO(R) diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were assessed in comparison to real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results. A subset of patients underwent an additional oropharyngeal and/or a saliva swab for rapid testing. Results121 patients already having a confirmed infection and 127 patients having no evidence of recent or ongoing infection were enrolled, for a total of 248 couple of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Overall COVID-VIRO(R) sensitivity was 96.7% (IC: 93.5%-99.9%). In asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients having symptoms for more than 4 days and those having a RT-qPCR Cycle threshold value [a?]32, sensitivity was of 100%, 95.8% and 91.9% respectively. The concordance between RT-qPCR and COVID VIRO(R) rapid test was 100% for the 127 patients with no SARS-CoV-2 infection. ConclusionCOVID-VIRO(R) test had 100% specificity and above 95% sensitivity, better than WHO recommendations (specificity [a?]97-100%, sensitivity [a?]80%).

They had high blood proportion of degranulated neutrophils and elevated plasma levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase and MPO-DNA complexes, which are typical markers of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Their neutrophils display dysfunctional mitochondria, defective oxidative burst, increased glycolysis, glycogen accumulation in the cytoplasm, and increase glycogenolysis. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (F-1) is stabilized in such cells, and it controls the level of glycogen phosphorylase L (PYGL), a key enzyme in glycogenolysis.

Biosensors have attracted increasing interest because they allow efficacious, sensitive, selective, rapid, and low-cost diagnosis. Biosensors are analytical devices based on receptors for the process of detection and transducers for response measuring. Biosensors can be based on electrochemical, piezoelectric, thermal, and optical transduction mechanisms. Early virus identification provides critical information about potentially effective and selective therapies, extends the therapeutic window, and thereby reduces morbidity. The sensitivity and selectivity of graphene can be amended via functionalizing it or conjoining it with further materials. Amendment of the optical and electrical features of the hybrid structure by introducing appropriate functional groups or counterparts is especially appealing for quick and easy-to-use virus detection. Various techniques for the electrochemical detection of viruses depending on antigen-antibody interactions or DNA hybridization are discussed in this work, and the reasons behind using graphene and related carbon nanomaterials for the fabrication are presented and discussed. We review the existing state-of-the-art directions of graphene-based classifications for detecting DNA, protein, and hormone biomarkers and summarize the use of the different biosensors to detect several diseases, like cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes, to sense numerous viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, rotavirus, Zika virus, and hepatitis B virus, and to detect the recent pandemic virus COVID-19. The general concepts, mechanisms of action, benefits, and disadvantages of advanced virus biosensors are discussed to afford beneficial evidence of the creation and manufacture of innovative virus biosensors.

It was the aim of this study to evaluate the performance and turnaround times of a new point-of-care multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) system for rapid identification of pathogens and antibiotic resistance markers. We assessed the applicability of the system under real-life conditions in critical ill patients with HAP. METHODS We enrolled forty critical ill patients with clinical signs for HAP into an observational study. Two samples of respiratory secretions were collected during one course of aspiration and cMD and mPCR testing (Unyvero, Curetis AG, Holzgerlingen, Germany) were performed immediately. The mPCR device was operated as a point-of-care system at the intensive care unit. We compared turnaround times, results of pathogen identification and results of antibiotic resistance testing of both methods. RESULTS Mean turnaround times (min-max) were 6.5 h (4.7-18.3 h) for multiplex PCR and 71 h (37.2-217.8 h) for conventional microbiology (final cMD results, incomplete results neglected). 60% (n = 24) of the mPCR tests were completely valid. Complete test failure occurred in 10% (n = 4) and partial test failure occurred in 30% (n = 12). We found concordant results in 45% (n = 18) and non-concordant results in 45% (n = 18) of all patients. 55% (n = 16) of the results were concordant in patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) > 5 (n = 29). Concordant results included three cases of multidrug resistant bacteria. MPCR frequently detected antibiotic resistance markers that were not found by cMD. CONCLUSIONS Unyvero allowed point-of-care microbial testing with short turnaround times. The performance of the system was poor. However, an improved system with a more reliable performance and an extended microbial panel could be a useful addition to cMD in intensive care medicine.

Current guidelines are divergent, sometimes contradictory, and often insufficiently detailed to guide practice decisions. OBJECTIVES This study aimed at establishing treatment recommendations at the patient-specific level. STUDY DESIGN Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), the appropriateness of different treatment options for osteoporotic VCFs was assessed. SETTING The assessment was conducted by a European multidisciplinary panel of 12 experts. METHODS The appropriateness of non-surgical management (NSM), vertebroplasty (VP), and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) was determined for 128 hypothetical patient profiles. These were unique combinations of clinical factors considered relevant to treatment choice (time since fracture, MRI findings, impact and evolution of symptoms, spinal deformity, ongoing fracture process, and pulmonary dysfunction). After 2 individual rating rounds and plenary meetings, appropriateness statements (appropriate, inappropriate, and uncertain) were calculated for all clinical scenarios. RESULTS Disagreement dropped from 31% in the first round to 7% in the second round. Appropriateness outcomes showed specific patterns for the 3 treatments. For three-quarters of the profiles, only one treatment was considered appropriate: NSM 25%, VP 6%, and BKP 45%. NSM was usually appropriate in patients with a negative MRI or a positive MRI without other unfavorable conditions (poor outcomes for the other variables). VP was usually appropriate in patients with a positive MRI, time since fracture  6 weeks, and no spinal deformity. BKP was recommended for all patients with an ongoing fracture process, and also in most patients with a positive MRI and  1 other unfavorable factor.

However, little is known about the animals' fate after release. Therefore, to address these uncertainties, it is essential to adequately describe how the injured animals were treated and managed before releasing into the wild; moreover, post-release monitoring should also be performed. Herein, we document for the first time the process of rescue, surgery, and rehabilitation of severely injured Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus; endangered species in South Korea) and their fate after returning to the wild. CASE PRESENTATION A six-year-old female (bear-01) and a three-year-old male (bear-02) bears were injured by an illegal snare and collision with a bus, respectively. Bear-01 had broad muscle necrosis and ruptures from the snared ankle on the right thoracic limb, with myiasis, and elbow disarticulation was performed. In bear-02, a non-reducible comminuted fracture of the left humerus was confirmed radiologically, and the operation was performed by using dual plate fixation with hydroxyapatite and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2. The bear-01 and -02 were completely healed approximately 30 and 60 days after surgery, respectively. After that, they underwent rehabilitation for 8 and 25 days, respectively, in an outdoor enclosure similar to their natural habitat. Bear-01 and -02 were released into the wild after 45 and 99 days after surgery, respectively, and their mean daily movement distance during the first 30 days after releasing was 2.9  2.1 and 1.3  1.6 km, respectively. The annual mean 95% Kernel home-range size of bear-01 and bear-02 was 265.8 and 486.9 km2, respectively. They hibernated every winter, gained weight, gave birth to cubs (bear-01), were not found to have any abnormalities in the veterinary tests, and were not involved in any conflicts with humans after returning to the wild. CONCLUSIONS Bears without one leg or those with dual plates could adapt well in their natural habitat, which shows that our surgical and post-operative treatments were effective.

ITP itself as well as its treatments have multifaceted, often poorly understood impacts on patients quality of life (QoL). These effects include impact on activities of daily living, emotional health, energy, ability to think well and clearly, and productivity in the workplace. There are limited data on which individual aspects of ITP are perceived both by patients and physicians as having the greatest impact on QoL. Understanding patients perspectives is vital to optimize their QoL by specifying particular areas in need of therapy. I-WISh 1.0 was an exploratory, cross-sectional survey in which 1507 patients with ITP and 472 physicians across 13 countries completed separate, but related, online surveys that included assessments of ITP signs and symptoms, impact of symptoms, and patient-physician relationships. These findings have been presented at previous ASH and EHA congresses, and manuscripts are currently in preparation. However, although I-WISh 1.0 provided considerable insights into unexplored facets of the effects of ITP, an all-too-large number of gaps in understanding still remain. In response to this, I-WISh 2.0 is currently being developed. The objectives of the I-WISh 2.0 patient and physician cross-sectional surveys include: (1) to further explore the burden of fatigue and how it affects patients' lives, including what makes it better or worse;(2) to assess the emotional impact of living with chronic ITP, especially in relation to depression;(3) to assess how treatments for ITP can impact activities of daily living (positively and negatively);(4) to further relate effects of treatment to patients' QoL;and (5) to explore how telemedicine affects healthcare delivery for patients with ITP. Furthermore, data from subsets of patients will address (6) the impact of COVID-19 in patients with ITP;and (7) special issues affecting ITP in pregnancy. A steering committee of ITP expert physicians and patient advocacy group representatives are designing and will endorse the patient and physician surveys now nearing readiness after several meetings to determine the areas of greatest need of assessment. In addition, a control group will be included. Survey launch and data collection are scheduled to commence in early Q4 2020. Patients and physicians will complete similar online surveys. Both patient and physician surveys include a screener and sections of questions related to the specific objectives of I-WISh 2.0. The surveys include updates to key topics in I-WISh 1.0 (impact of fatigue, impact on daily life, treatment of ITP, emotional impact of ITP);validated patient-reported outcome tools to measure fatigue (MFIS-5), presence and severity of depression (PHQ-9), work-related burden (WPAI), and impact on quality of life (ILQI) tools;and questions related to COVID-19, telemedicine (remote patient monitoring), and pregnancy and ITP. Patients will be recruited to I-WISh 2.0 via treating physicians and patient advocacy groups, and will be included if they are  18 years of age, diagnosed with ITP, and agree to participate. Participating physicians will be required to be actively managing patients with ITP and have a minimum caseload of 3 ITP patients currently under their care;physicians must also have a primary specialty of hematology or hematology-oncology. Approval will be sought from an independent centralized Institutional Review Board. Data analysis will be primarily descriptive and correlative in nature. Breakdown by country and geographic areas will be included. A global sample is planned from 21 countries across 6 continents, with the aim of surveying more than 2000 patients and 600 physicians. I-WISh 2.0 will be the largest observational global survey ever conducted in ITP. If accepted, preliminary data are planned to be presented at the ASH meeting.

This is especially true when targeting populations that experience stigma and may be difficult to include in research, such as people with HIV. We sought to describe how pilot studies have been used to inform HIV clinical trials. METHODS We conducted a methodological study of pilot studies of interventions in people living with HIV published until November 25, 2020, using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL). We extracted data on their nomenclature, primary objective, use of progression criteria, sample size, use of qualitative methods, and other contextual information (region, income, level, type of intervention, study design). RESULTS Our search retrieved 10,597 studies, of which 248 were eligible. The number of pilot studies increased steadily over time. We found that 179 studies (72.2%) used the terms \\"pilot\\" or \\"feasibility\\" in their title, 65.3% tested feasibility as a primary objective, only 2% used progression criteria, 23.9% provided a sample size estimation and only 30.2% used qualitative methods.

Trust, important in all patient-provider relationships, is difficult to build in such communities, particularly when stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and now COVID-19, is widespread. CHWs, responsible for bringing people back into care, must repair trust. In South Africa, where a national CHW programme is being rolled out, marginalised communities have high levels of unemployment, domestic violence and injury. OBJECTIVES: In this complex social environment, we explored CHW workplace trust, interpersonal trust between the patient and CHW, and the institutional trust patients place in the health system. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Within the observation phase of a 3-year intervention study, we conducted interviews, focus groups and observations with patients, CHWs, their supervisors and, facility managers in Sedibeng. RESULTS: CHWs had low levels of workplace trust. They had recently been on strike demanding better pay, employment conditions and recognition of their work. They did not have the equipment to perform their work safely, and some colleagues did not trust, or value, their contribution. There was considerable interpersonal trust between CHWs and patients, however, CHWs' efforts were hampered by structural poverty, alcohol abuse and no identification documents among long-term migrants. Those supervisors who understood the extent of the poverty supported CHW efforts to help the community. When patients had withdrawn from care, often due to nurses' insensitive behaviour, the CHWs' attempts to repair patients' institutional trust often failed due to the vulnerabilities of the community, and lack of support from the health system. CONCLUSION: Strategies are needed to build workplace trust including supportive supervision for CHWs and better working conditions, and to build interpersonal and institutional trust by ensuring sensitivity to social inequalities and the effects of structural poverty among healthcare providers. Societies need to care for everyone.","output":"Community health workers' efforts to build health system trust in marginalised communities: a qualitative study from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Survivors of acute pancreatitis (AP) have shorter overall survival and increased incidence of new-onset cardiovascular, respiratory, liver and renal disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer compared with the general population, but the mechanisms that explain this are yet to be elucidated. Our aim is to characterise the precise nature and extent of organ dysfunction following an episode of AP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an observational prospective cohort study in a single centre comprising a University hospital with an acute and emergency receiving unit and clinical research facility. Participants will be adult patient admitted with AP. Participants will undergo assessment at recruitment, 3 months and 3 years.

COVID-19 has ultimately resulted in mortality in at least 2 million people worldwide. Millions of people globally have already been affected by this disease, and the numbers are expected to increase, perhaps until an effective cure or vaccine is identified. Although Africa was initially purported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be severely hit by the pandemic, Africa recorded the least number of cases during the first wave, with lowest rates of infections, compared to Asia, Europe, and the Americas. This statistic might be attributed to the low testing capacity, existing public health awareness and lessons learnt during Ebola epidemic. Nonetheless, the relatively low rate of infection should be an opportunity for Africa to be better prepared to overcome this and future epidemics. In this paper, the authors provide insights into the dynamics and transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) during the first wave of the pandemic; possible explanations into the relatively low rates of infection recorded in Africa; with recommendations for Africa to continue to fight Covid-19; and position itself to effectively manage future pandemics.","output":"COVID-19 in Africa: rethinking the tools to manage future pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Introduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug for the disease. Therefore, strictly practicing precautionary measures are the only option to save the life. Some studies reported health professional's practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals were involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method was employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15 and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association was declared at P<0.05. Results In this study, 35{middle dot}3% (95%CI: 30{middle dot}7%, 39{middle dot}8%) of health professionals' had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68{middle dot}9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67{middle dot}3%), and use facemask in crowds (56{middle dot}8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants.

Early identification and intervention of new cases are crucial to improve patients' outcomes. May Measurement Month (MMM) is an annual global synchronised blood pressure (BP) screening campaign. Participants can have their BP measured at the screening sites. It may be a possible way to identify undiagnosed hypertensive patients in the population. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study of BP among Hong Kong adults. Multiple screening sites were set in local community pharmacies and on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding their demographics, medical history, and social history. Then, they took at least one BP reading using an automated sphygmomanometer after sitting at for 5 minutes. Up to three BP readings were taken and recorded for each participant, with one-minute intervals between readings. RESULTS: A total of 3224 adults participated in MMM between 2017 and 2019. The average BP among the 3224 participants was 139.8/75.5 mmHg. The prevalence of hypertension was 2282 (70.8%), of which 635 (27.8%) were undiagnosed before MMM. Among the 1647 participants previously diagnosed with hypertension, 1007 (61.1%) had uncontrolled hypertension. CONCLUSION: A high number of cases can be identified with untreated, or treated but uncontrolled, hypertension from MMM. Citizens should be encouraged to check BP regularly and take follow-up actions if hypertension is suspected.","output":"May Measurement Month 2017C2019: A Community-Wide Opportunistic Blood Pressure Screening Campaign in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world today is badly affected with the deadly Corona virus.

The use of chemical transport models to quantify the impacts of various emission changes on air quality is limited by their large computational demands. Machine learning models can emulate chemical transport models to provide computationally efficient predictions of outputs based on statistical associations with inputs. We developed novel emulators relating emission changes in five key anthropogenic sectors (residential, industry, land transport, agriculture, and power generation) to winter ambient fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) concentrations across China. The emulators were optimized based on Gaussian process regressors with Matern kernels. The emulators predicted 99.9% of the variance in PM(2.5) concentrations for a given input configuration of emission changes. PM(2.5) concentrations are primarily sensitive to residential (51%C94% of first\\\\order sensitivity index), industrial (7%C31%), and agricultural emissions (0%C24%). Sensitivities of PM(2.5) concentrations to land transport and power generation emissions are all under 5%, except in South West China where land transport emissions contributed 13%. The largest reduction in winter PM(2.5) exposure for changes in the five emission sectors is by 68%C81%, down to 15.3C25.9 g m(?3), remaining above the World Health Organization annual guideline of 10 g m(?3). The greatest reductions in PM(2.5) exposure are driven by reducing residential and industrial emissions, emphasizing the importance of emission reductions in these key sectors. We show that the annual National Air Quality Target of 35 g m(?3) is unlikely to be achieved during winter without strong emission reductions from the residential and industrial sectors.","output":"Statistical Emulation of Winter Ambient Fine Particulate Matter Concentrations From Emission Changes in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Unsafe pregnancy termination is a major public health concern among reproductive-aged women in many developing countries. This study evaluated the socio-demographic characteristics, as well as residual spatial correlation in pregnancy termination among Bangladeshi women. METHODS: Secondary data was obtained from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey for the survey year 2014. Data included 17,863 samples of ever-married women between the ages of 15-49 years, which is a national representative sample in Bangladesh. Bayesian spatial logistic regression was used to assess the associations between socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy termination. We flexibly modeled the non-linear effects of the continuous covariates while accounting for residual spatial correlation at the district level. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that about 19% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported ever had a pregnancy terminated. The risk of pregnancy termination was higher among women who had been working, had a higher wealth index, were in a conjugal relationship, had no children, were older and started their cohabitation earlier. Residual spatial patterns revealed the areas at a higher risk of pregnancy termination, including Panchagarh, Habiganj, and Sylhet after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of pregnancy termination remains considerably high in Bangladesh. The study revealed significant associations of women's age at survey time, age at first cohabitation, occupational status, socio-economic status, marital status and the total number of children ever born with reporting having a history of terminated pregnancy among Bangladeshi ever-married women.

This paper focuses on how physicians should implement the results of these clinical trials: counseling patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed about vaccines with government authorization for clinical use. Determining the most effective approach to counseling patients about COVID-19 vaccination is challenging. We address the professionally responsible counseling of three groups of patients - those who are pregnant, those planning to become pregnant, and those breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. We begin with an evidence-based account of five major challenges: the limited evidence base; documented increased risk of severe disease among pregnant COVID-19-infected patients; conflicting guidance from government agencies and professional associations; false information about COVID-19 vaccines; and maternal mistrust and vaccine hesitancy. We then provide evidence-based, ethically justified, practical guidance for meeting these challenges in professionally responsible counseling of patients about COVID-19 vaccination. To guide professionally responsible counseling of patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, and breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, we explain how obstetrician-gynecologists should evaluate current clinical information and why a recommendation of COVID-19 vaccination should be made and how this assessment should be presented to patients in the informed consent process with the goal of empowering them to make informed decisions. We also present a pro-active account of how to respond when patients refuse recommended vaccination, the elements of which are the legal obligation of informed refusal and the ethical obligation to ask patients to reconsider. During this process, the physician should be alert to vaccine hesitancy, ask patients to express their hesitation and reasons for it, and respectfully address them. In contrast to the conflicting guidance from government agencies and professional associations, evidence-based professional ethics in obstetrics and gynecology provides unequivocal and clear guidance: The physician should recommend COVID-19 vaccination to patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, and breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. To prevent widening health inequities, to build trust in the health benefits of vaccination and to encourage COVID-19 vaccine and treatment uptake, in addition to recommending COVID-19 vaccinations, physicians should engage with communities to tailor strategies to overcome mistrust and deliver evidence-based information, robust educational campaigns and novel approaches to immunization.","output":"Professionally Responsible COVID-19 Vaccination Counseling of Obstetric/Gynecologic Patients: Counseling Patients about COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The wide disparity in coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related death rates based upon the ethnic origin is well established by now.

With the global spread of COVID-19 throughout the world and the need to have a real-time screening of the population, especially in crowded places, this study aimed to investigate the applicability of sniffer dogs to carry out such a task. METHODS: Firstly, three male and female dogs from German shepherd (Saray), German black (Kuzhi) and Labrador (Marco) breeds had been intensively trained throughout the classical conditioning method for 7 weeks. They were introduced to human specimens obtained from the throat and pharyngeal secretions of participants who were already reported positive or negative for SARS-COV-2 infection be RT-PCR. Each dog underwent the conditioning process for almost 1000 times. In the meantime another similar condition process was conducted on clothes and masks of COVID-19 patient using another three male and female dogs from Labrador (Lexi), Border gypsy (Sami), and Golden retriever (Zhico) breeds. In verification test for the first three dogs, 80 pharyngeal secretion samples consisting of 26 positive and 54 negative samples from different medical centers who underwent RT-PCR test were in a single-blind method. In the second verification test for the other three dogs, masks and clothes of 50 RT-PCR positive and 70 RT-PCR negative cases from different medical center were used. RESULTS: In verification test using pharyngeal secretion, the sniffer dogs detection capability was associated with a 65% of sensitivity and 89% of specificity and they amanged to identify 17 out of the 26 positive and 48 out of the 54 true negative samples. In the next verification test using patients face masks and clothes, 43 out of the 50 positive samples were correctly identified by the dogs. Moreover, out of the 70 negative samples, 65 samples were correctly found to be negative. The sensitivity of this test was as high as 86% and its specificity was 92.9%. In addition, the positive and negative predictive values were 89.6 and 90.3%, respectively.

To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins to enter human cells. Using gene expression datasets, Halwani and coworkers showed that the airways expression of these receptors is lower in children, but upregulated in smokers and COPD patients.

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","output":"Analysis of meteorological conditions and prediction of epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV infection in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Native human antibodies are defined as those that arise naturally as the result of the functioning of an intact human immune system.

A total of 283 human cases of viral encephalitis with 109 deaths were recorded in Malaysia from 29 September 1998 to December 1999. During the outbreak period, a number of surveillances under three broad groups; Surveillance in Human Health Sector, Surveillance in Animal Health Sector, and Surveillance for the Reservoir Hosts, were carried out to determine the prevalence, risk of virus infections and transmission in human and swine populations as well as the source and reservoir hosts of Nipah virus. Surveillance data showed that the virus spread rapidly among pigs within infected farms and transmission was attributed to direct contact with infective excretions and secretions. The spread of the virus among pig farms within and between states of peninsular Malaysia was due to movement of pigs. The transmission of the virus to humans was through close contact with infected pigs. Human to human transmission was considered a rare event though the Nipah virus could be isolated from saliva, urine, nasal and pharyngeal secretions of patients. Field investigations identified fruitbats of the Pteropid species as the natural reservoir hosts of the viruses.

METHODS Using retrospective data from a sample of women with early BC (Stage I-III) who had CT scan and received chemotherapy. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to compare SliceOMatic with PACS results. Associations of PACS results with chemotherapy-related adverse events were evaluated using multivariable (MV) log-binomial models adjusted for age, race, BMI, anthracycline-based therapy, and number of comorbidities. RESULTS In 338 patients, mean age was 51, 32% were non-white, and 40% had obesity (BMI  30 kg/m2).

A retrospective review of fetal telecardiology visits between March 15 and July 15, 2020, was performed. The chart was reviewed for confirmation of diagnosis postnatally. Results: With pandemic onset, there was a large increase in the number of telemedicine visits with a total of 122 mothers seen between five MFM clinics. Fourteen mothers (11.5%) had abnormal fetal echocardiograms requiring additional follow-up, and seven mothers (5.8%) had a fetal echocardiogram suspicious for a critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). All the fetal echocardiograms suspicious for CCHD were confirmed on postnatal echocardiogram. To our knowledge, none of the normal fetal echocardiograms were found to have congenital heart disease postnatally. Conclusions: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we rapidly transitioned to fetal telecardiology using a variety of formats.

We collected all the SPS during the 6 months after discharge reported by patients during follow-up from primary care records. Cluster analyses were performed to validate the measures. The main outcome measures were return to the Emergency Services, hospital readmission and post-discharge death. Surviving patients outcomes were collected through clinical histories and primary care reports. Multiple logistic regression models were applied. RESULTS: The 797 (82.2%) patients who survived constituted the sample followed, while the rest died from COVID-19. The mean age was 63.0 years, 53.7% of them were men and 509 (63.9%) reported some sequelae during the first 6 months after discharge. These sequelae were very diverse, but the most frequent were respiratory (42.0%), systemic (36.1%), neurological (20.8%), mental health (12.2%) and infectious (7.9%) SPS, with some differences by sex. Women presented higher frequencies of headache and mental health SPS, among others. A total of 160 (20.1%) patients returned to the Emergency Services, 35 (4.4%) required hospital readmission and 8 (1.0%) died during follow-up. The main factors independently associated with the return to Emergency Services were persistent fever, dermatological SPS, arrythmia or palpitations, thoracic pain and pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the first wave of the pandemic developed a significant range of mid- to long-term SPS. A detailed list of symptoms and outcomes is provided in this multicentre study. Identification of possible factors associated with these SPS could be useful to optimize preventive follow-up strategies in primary care for the coming months of the pandemic.

In this paper, Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model with simplex optimizer is proposed to forecast the electric load for an enterprise during the COVID-19 pandemic. The forecasting process consists of data processing, LSTM network construction and optimization. Firstly, some data processing steps includes information quantifying, electric load data cleaning, correlation-coefficient-based medical data filtering, clustering-based medical data and electric load data filling. Then LSTM-Based electric load forecasting model of enterprise is established during the COVID-19 pandemic. On this basis, LSTM network is trained and parameters are optimized via simplex optimizer. Finally, an example of the electric load forecasting of an enterprise during the COVID-19 pandemic is investigated. The forecasting results show that the reduced number of iterations is about 25% and the improved forecasting accuracy is about 5.6%. These results can be used as a reference for resuming production of enterprises and planning of electric grid.","output":"Electric load forecasting based on Long-Short-Term-Memory network via simplex optimizer during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals 60 years old have the highest hospitalization rates and represent >80% fatalities. Within this population, those in long-term facilities represent >50% of the total COVID-19 related deaths per country. Among those without symptoms, the rate of pre-symptomatic illness is unclear, and potential predictors of progression for symptom development are unknown. Our objective was to delineate the natural evolution of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in elders and identify determinants of progression. METHODS We established a medical surveillance team monitoring 63 geriatric institutions. When an index COVID-19 case emerged, we tested all other eligible asymptomatic elders 75 or >60 years old with at least 1 comorbidity. SARS-CoV-2 infected elders were followed for 28 days. Disease was diagnosed when any COVID-19 manifestation occurred. SARS-CoV-2 load at enrollment, shedding on day 15, and antibody responses were also studied. RESULTS After 28 days of follow-up, 74/113(65%) SARS-CoV-2-infected elders remained asymptomatic. 21/39(54%) pre-symptomatic patients developed hypoxemia and ten pre-symptomatic patients died(median day 13.5,IQR 12). Dementia was the only clinical risk factor associated with disease(OR 2.41(95%CI=1.08, 5.39). In a multivariable logistic regression model, dementia remained as a risk factor for COVID-19 severe disease. Furthermore, dementia status showed a statistically significant different trend when assessing the cumulative probability of developing COVID-19 symptoms(log-rank p=0.027). On day 15, SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in 30% of the asymptomatic group while in 61% of the pre-symptomatic(p=0.012). No differences were observed among groups in RT-PCR mean cycle threshold at enrollment(p=0.391) and in the rates of antibody seropositivity(IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein). CONCLUSIONS In summary, 2/3 of our cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected elders from vulnerable communities in Argentina remained asymptomatic after 28 days of follow-up with high mortality among those developing symptoms. Dementia and persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding were associated with progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.","output":"Asymptomatic COVID-19 in the elderly: dementia and viral clearance as risk factors for disease progression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is forcing the medical educators to innovate and embrace online education and assessment platform.

The evidence base regarding protection from respiratory pathogens in dentistry is poor. Those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody are non-infectious (>99% certainty) and can be safely treated with good universal precautions, even for aerosol generating procedures. Viral infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 lasts eight days, unlike viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests which can persist for as long as seven weeks. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody becomes detectable from 11 days after infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are usually neutralising against the virus and their direct antiviral activity was partially demonstrated in 33,000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma in the USA. So, a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is a much more accurate determination of infectiousness than a repeat PCR which is only 70% sensitive.

In addition, existing guidelines including those by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and articles from several non-academic sources (e.g. news websites etc.) were accessed. RESULTS: While the nationwide lockdown has resulted in financial losses and has affected all segments of society, the domino effect on health, healthcare and nutrition could possibly pose major setbacks to previously gained successes of National health programs.

Furthermore, rural data are rarely centralized, precluding comparability across urban and rural regions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess hospitalization rates and all-cause inpatient mortality among persons with definitive COVID-19 diagnoses residing in rural and urban areas. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) examines a cohort of 573,018 patients from 27 US hospital systems presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and March 2021, of whom 117,897 were hospitalized. A sample of 450,725 hospitalized persons without COVID-19 diagnoses was identified for comparison. EXPOSURES: ZIP Codes provided by source hospital systems were classified by urban-rural gradient through a crosswalk to the US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were hospitalization and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and mixed effects logistic regression were used to estimate 30-day survival in hospitalized patients and associations between rurality, hospitalization, and inpatient mortality while controlling for major risk factors. RESULTS: Rural patients were more likely to be older, white, have higher body mass index, and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 later in the pandemic compared with their urban counterparts. Rural compared with urban inhabitants had higher rates of hospitalization (23% vs. 19%) and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients (16% vs. 11%). After adjustment for demographic and baseline differences, rural residents (both urban adjacent and non-adjacent) with COVID-19 were more likely to be hospitalized (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.41, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.37-1.45 and AOR 1.42, CI 1.35-1.50) and to die or be transferred to hospice (AOR 1.62, CI 1.30-1.49 and 1.38, CI 1.30-1.49), respectively. Similar differences in mortality were noted for hospitalized patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization and inpatient mortality are higher among rural compared with urban persons with COVID-19, even after adjusting for several factors, including age and comorbidities.

Relative to the baseline survey conducted just before the pandemic, there was a significant decrease in households participation in wage work, agricultural production, and non-farm business which in turn increased their income losses. Consequently, we find that lockdown induced income losses significantly increased incidences of food insecurity within households. With incidences of food insecurity increasing especially in rural areas, it is likely that COVID-19 reversed some of the gains recorded in recent years in lifting millions of rural smallholder farming households out of poverty. These results suggest that to assure the food security of poorer segments of the population especially in anticipation of future shocks, the government needs to invest more in social protection i.e., income and consumption support.","output":"COVID-19 Lockdown and Exposure of Households to Food Insecurity in Uganda: Insights from a National High Frequency Phone Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is known to be associated with a hypercoagulable and prothrombotic state, especially in critically ill patients. Several observational studies have reported the incidence of thromboembolic events such as pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the weighted average incidence of PTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit. Methods: We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for relevant studies from 31 December 2019 till 15 Aug 2020 onwards using the search terms coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, thrombus, thrombo*, embolus and emboli*. We included prospective and retrospective observational studies that reported the incidence of PTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients who required treatment in the intensive care unit. We identified 14 studies after two phases of screening and extracted data related to study characteristics, patient demographics and the incidence of PTE. Risk of bias was assessed by using the ROBINS-I tool. Statistical analysis was performed with R 3.6.3. Results: We included 14 studies with a total of 1182 patients in this study. Almost 100% of patients in this meta-analysis received at least prophylactic anticoagulation. The weighted average incidence of PTE was 11.09% (95% CI 7.72% to 15.69%, I 2 = 78%, Cochrans Q test P < 0.01).

In this turbulent environment, the purpose of this study is twofold. First, this paper explores the direct effect of consumers' internal/external health locus-of-control on their hygiene consciousness, which, in turn, affects their social distancing behavior. Second, this study posits that social distancing, in turn, impacts consumers' current online grocery shopping behavior and their future online grocery shopping intentions, thus uncovering important insight. Design/methodology/approach To address these gaps, this paper develops a model that links consumers' internal/external health locus-of-control to their adoption of e-tailing-based grocery services. Data collected through a web-based survey was analyzed by using partial least squares-based structural equation modeling. Findings The results indicate that consumers' health locus-of-control indirectly affects the way they shop for their groceries during the pandemic. In particular, consumers' internal (external) health locus-of-control drives higher (lower) hygiene consciousness and greater (lower) social distancing behavior. In turn, consumers' online grocery shopping behavior was found to increase during the pandemic, with their corresponding intent to continue this behavior in the future. Moreover, this study finds the effects of consumers' social distancing on their current grocery shopping behavior and future intentions to be contingent on consumer age, with stronger effects identified for older consumers. Originality/value This study shows how consumers' internal/external health loci-of-control exert opposing effects on their social distancing behavior, as mediated by hygiene consciousness. Overall, the empirical analyzes corroborate the association of consumers' social distancing- and online grocery shopping behavior (for consumers of different age profiles), both during and after the pandemic.","output":"Consumers' health-locus-of-control and social distancing in pandemic-based e-tailing services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the rising era of globalization and digitization , remote education continues in gaining popularity and reach.

Here we describe our experience implementing an effective, expedited telemedicine curriculum for our ambulatory resident clinics. This study was started in April 2020 when we implemented a resident-led curriculum and training programme for providing ambulatory telemedicine care. The curriculum was finalised in less than 5 weeks. It entailed introducing a formal training programme for residents, creating a resource guide for different video communication tools and training preceptors to safely supervise care in this new paradigm. Residents were surveyed before the curriculum to assess prior experience with telemedicine, and then afterward to assess the curriculum's effectiveness. We also created a mini-CEX assessment for residents to solicit feedback on their performance during virtual appointments. Over 2000 virtual visits were performed by residents in a span of 10 weeks. Of 148 residents, 38% responded to the pre-participation survey. A majority had no prior telemedicine experience and expressed only slight comfort with the modality.

Appreciation of a familys values can help family members find common ground and enable them to provide crucial affirmation for gender-diverse youth. However, child and adolescent psychiatrists often receive little training in incorporating cultural differences in family therapy and may struggle to address culturally based beliefs about gender identity and sexuality that differ from their own. Changes necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic have presented additional, unforeseen treatment challenges but have also provided unexpected opportunities, including some relevant for gender-diverse youth, especially transitional-aged youth impacted by devastating losses in employment and education. Attendees will leave with an increased awareness of cultural factors that can affect family acceptance and new ideas for utilizing telehealth and other unusual approaches. Methods: The presenter will provide a review of available evidence about applicable cultural factors and telehealth modalities, with a focus on gender-diverse transitional-aged youth. The presenter will use clinical case vignettes and video clips to highlight challenges and opportunities under pandemic conditions and beyond. Results: Understanding a familys underlying cultural values can play an important role in establishing a solid therapeutic alliance and allow for more meaningful communication, which is especially important in family therapy with gender-diverse, transitional-aged youth, and their families, who may be struggling with additional pandemic-related stressors.

In pythons, nidovirus (recently reclassified as serpentovirus) infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe, often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full postmortem examinations on 30 serpentovirus reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether this not yet reported wider distribution of lesions is associated with previously unknown serpentoviruses or changes in the serpentovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against serpentovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus infects not only a broad spectrum of epithelia (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts, etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages, and endothelial cells. With next-generation sequencing we obtained a full-length genome for a novel serpentovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing serpentovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not reveal sequence association to phenotypes; however, functional studies with different strains are needed to confirm this observation. The results indicate that serpentoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated viral systemic spread.IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses (now reclassified as serpentoviruses) have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Serpentoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previous evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that comprises important zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Serpentoviruses belong to the same order as the above-mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order Nidovirales.","output":"Serpentoviruses: More than Respiratory Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging evidence shows that severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) can be complicated with coagulopathy, namely disseminated intravascular coagulation, which has a rather prothrombotic character with high risk of venous thromboembolism.

Objective: Our objective was to use a large, nationally representative data set of critically ill adults with COVID-19 to determine which factors explain mortality variability. Methods: In this multicenter cohort study, we examined adults hospitalized in ICUs with COVID-19 at 70 U.S. hospitals between March and June 2020. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We examined patient-level and hospital-level variables. Mixed-effect logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with interhospital variation. The median odds ratio was calculated to compare outcomes in higher- versus lower-mortality hospitals. A gradient-boosted machine algorithm was developed for individual-level mortality models. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 4,019 patients were included, 1,537 (38%) of whom died by 28 days. Mortality varied considerably across hospitals (0C82%). After adjustment for patient- and hospital-level domains, interhospital variation was attenuated (odds ratio decline from 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.73C2.37] to 1.22 [95% CI, 1.00C1.38]), with the greatest changes occurring with adjustment for acute physiology, socioeconomic status, and strain. For individual patients, the relative contribution of each domain to mortality risk was as follows: acute physiology (49%), demographics and comorbidities (20%), socioeconomic status (12%), strain (9%), hospital quality (8%), and treatments (3%). Conclusions: There is considerable interhospital variation in mortality for critically ill patients with COVID-19, which is mostly explained by hospital-level socioeconomic status, strain, and acute physiologic differences. Individual mortality is driven mostly by patient-level factors.","output":"Hospital-Level Variation in Death for Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 disease has progressed to the level of a global pandemic. This study aimed to investigate peoples psychological and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 epidemic and explore the predictors for social distancing and panic buying. METHODS: A 17-item questionnaire was developed and distributed randomly to people using social media. Descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA were used to assess peoples psychological and behavioural responses. Hierarchical regression was conducted to investigate the predictive effects of psychological and behavioural variables on reports of social distancing and panic buying respectively. RESULTS: Respondents reported a low degree of risk perception and risk beliefs with regard to being outside, and had moderate psychological stress and positive safeguarding behaviours for being outside. Respondents reported high concern regarding COVID-19 and tended to keep social distancing during the epidemic. They would panic-purchase food and supplies. In addition, psychological stress emerged as a very strong predictor for reporting COVID-19 concerns and panic buying. Furthermore, reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing had a significant predictive influence on panic buying of food. Safeguarding behaviours for being outside had a significant predictive effect on respondents reported social distancing of cancelling outings. Reported concerns about COVID-19 were stronger predictors for reported social distancing. CONCLUSION: It is important to relieve peoples psychological stress and manage information sharing to control panic buying. In addition, we should promote adoption of safeguarding behaviours for being outside and emphasise the concerns with regard to COVID-19 to encourage people keep social distancing. Measures should be implemented according to the characteristics of the population.","output":"Promoting social distancing and preventing panic buying during the epidemic of COVID-19: the contributions of peoples psychological and behavioural factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IL-17 is one of the key cytokines that stimulate host defense during a Candida infection. Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of Candida albicans to induce a Th17 response. Surprisingly, experiments employing live C. ablicans demonstrated a specific downregulation of host IL-17 secretion in human blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). By avoiding the direct contact of live C. albicans and PBMCs, we demonstrate that this inhibition effect is mediated by a soluble factor released by live C. albicans. However, this effect is due neither to the releasing of C. albicans pathogen-associated molecular patterns nor to the alteration of different Th cell subtypes. Rather, we found that live C. albicans shifts tryptophan metabolism by inhibiting IDO expression away from kynurenines and toward 5-hydroxytryptophan metabolites. In addition, we show that these latter 5-hydroxytryptophan metabolites inhibit IL-17 production.

Multistage sampling was then applied to designate the study locations and a KAP-based questionnaire was used to retrieve data and relevant perspectives from the respondents. Based on the responses from 476 participants living across four regions of Thailand, we found that the knowledge of the participants was positively correlated with their behaviors but negatively associated with the attitudes. Participants who are male, younger, educated at the level of middle to high school, or raising more dogs are likely to have negative attitudes but good knowledge on rabies prevention and control whereas farmers with lower income had better attitudes regardless of their knowledge. We found that people in a lower socioeconomic status with a lack of knowledge are not willing to pay at a higher vaccine price. Public education is a key to change dog owners' behaviors.

A new federal effort to strengthen and coordinate nutrition research could rapidly generate the evidence base needed to address these multiple national challenges. However, the relevant characteristics of such an effort have been uncertain. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to provide an objective, informative summary of 1) the mounting diet-related health burdens facing our nation and corresponding economic, health equity, national security, and sustainability implications; 2) the current federal nutrition research landscape and existing mechanisms for its coordination; 3) the opportunities for and potential impact of new fundamental, clinical, public health, food and agricultural, and translational scientific discoveries; and 4) the various options for further strengthening and coordinating federal nutrition research, including corresponding advantages, disadvantages, and potential executive and legislative considerations. METHODS: We reviewed government and other published documents on federal nutrition research; held various discussions with expert groups, advocacy organizations, and scientific societies; and held in-person or phone meetings with >50 federal staff in executive and legislative roles, as well as with a variety of other stakeholders in academic, industry, and nongovernment organizations. RESULTS: Stark national nutrition challenges were identified. More Americans are sick than are healthy, largely from rising diet-related illnesses. These conditions create tremendous strains on productivity, health care costs, health disparities, government budgets, US economic competitiveness, and military readiness. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has further laid bare these strains, including food insecurity, major diet-related comorbidities for poor outcomes from COVID-19 such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and insufficient surveillance on and coordination of our food system. More than 10 federal departments and agencies currently invest in critical nutrition research, yet with relatively flat investments over several decades. Coordination also remains suboptimal, documented by multiple governmental reports over 50 years. Greater harmonization and expansion of federal investment in nutrition science, not a silo-ing or rearrangement of existing investments, has tremendous potential to generate new discoveries to improve and sustain the health of all Americans. Two identified key strategies to achieve this were as follows: 1) a new authority for robust cross-governmental coordination of nutrition research and other nutrition-related policy and 2) strengthened authority, investment, and coordination for nutrition research within the NIH. These strategies were found to be complementary, together catalyzing important new science, partnerships, coordination, and returns on investment. Additional complementary actions to accelerate federal nutrition research were identified at the USDA. CONCLUSIONS: The need and opportunities for strengthened federal nutrition research are clear, with specific identified options to help create the new leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and investment the nation requires to address the multiple nutrition-related challenges and grasp the opportunities before us.","output":"Strengthening national nutrition research: rationale and options for a new coordinated federal research effort and authority"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that first occurred in humans in the People's Republic of China in November 2002 and has subsequently spread worldwide. A novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family has been identified as the cause of this pulmonary disease. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the development of fast and sensitive diagnostic assays. RESULTS: A real-time quantitative RT-PCR was designed in the nsp11 region of the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome. To evaluate this quantitative RT-PCR, cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription of SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA using T7 RNA polymerase, followed by real-time RT-PCR. The assay allowed quantitation over a range of 10(2) to 10(8) RNA copies per reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolated to clinical samples, this novel assay has a detection range of 10(4) to 10(10) copies of viral genome equivalents per millilitre. In comparison to the current de facto cRNA Artus Biotech standard, the in-house cRNA standard gives a 100-fold higher absolute quantity, suggesting a possible underestimation of the viral load when using the Artus Biotech standard.","output":"Viral load quantitation of SARS-coronavirus RNA using a one-step real-time RT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the shortage of pediatric hospital beds in general and due to the large annual burden of hospital admissions for common respiratory tract infections, such as influenza or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] in particular, it can be expected that hospitalization of children with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV?2 infections will face hospitals with an even more tense situation than usual in the winter 2020/2021. This tenuous shortage may touch various aspects but in the first place it will affect isolation and cohorting. In addition, this shortage will not only apply to acutely ill children with viral respiratory tract infections but all children with need for hospital care, either chronically ill or e.g. being premature babies or newborns. Therefore, approaches are required which on the one hand are based on pragmatic grounds but on the other hand fulfill the basics of hygiene and infection control. The recommendations proposed in this statement are intended to give assistance to hospitals for the management of testing, isolation and cohorting of pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV?2 infections. The most important factor navigating the essential measures is the cumulative incidence of newly diagnosed infections per 100,000 over the last 7 days, which is given by the RKI or the local public health authorities. In the situation of low (<25/100,000) or medium (25C50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and hospital admission can be performed under standard hygiene precautions and the children will be cohorted according to their clinical presentation until the results of SARS-CoV?2 test (or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] or influenza test) are available. In the situation of high (>50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and the admission have to be performed under SARS-CoV?2 precautions as specified by the RKI, and the children have to be isolated until the results of SARS-CoV?2 test are available. The assessment of the incidence figures and the respective measures may be adapted by the local public health authorities on an individual basis.

Available biomarkers are not associated with prognosis in older patients. This study aimed to analyze the value of eosinopenia (eosinophil count< 100/mm(3)) as a prognosis marker among older patients with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed from 1 January to 31 December 2018 among patients in a geriatrics ward suffering from a bacterial infection treated with antibiotics. Biomarker data including the eosinophil count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein (CRP) were collected within 4 days after patient diagnosis. Persistent eosinopenia was defined as a consistent eosinophil count< 100/mm(3) between Day 2 and Day 4. The association of biomarkers with 30-day hospital mortality in a multivariate analysis was assessed and their predictive ability using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was compared. RESULTS: Our study included 197 patients with a mean age of 90  6 years. A total of 36 patients (18%) died during their stay in hospital. The patients who died were more likely to have persistent eosinopenia in comparison to survivors (78% versus 34%, p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, persistent eosinopenia was associated with in-hospital mortality with an adjusted HR of 8.90 (95%CI 3.46C22.9).

This study aimed to explore the behavioral changes and personal hygiene practices in relation with background psychosocial and health characteristics of older adults during the COVID-19 emergency. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephonic survey was conducted with the participants of the Kawasaki Aging and Wellbeing Project (KAWP), an on-going longitudinal cohort study of older adults aged 85 or older. The interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire consisting of 11 closed questions regarding behavioral changes and personal hygiene practices during the state of emergency. Sociodemographic and health data were obtained from the KAWP baseline survey conducted 2.2 years before the telephonic survey. RESULTS: Overall, 487 participants from the KAWP responded to the telephonic survey (response rate: 89.2%). 94.5% of the respondents reported no changes in basic lifestyle habits, such as eating, sleeping, smoking, and drinking, whereas 28.1% reported a decrease in physical activity, and 54.6% reported going out less frequently. One-third of the respondents reported a decrease in the number of people to converse with, as well as the amount of time to converse. For personal hygiene practices, 93.8% reported wearing a mask when they went out, and 50.3% reported an increased frequency of handwashing. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that engagement in physical activity at baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23C3.08), smartphone ownership (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.33C3.47), and visual impairment (OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.10C2.91) were independently associated with decreased physical activity during the COVID-19 emergency.

Inoculation (also called variolation) involved the introduction of small amounts of infectious material from smallpox vesicles into the skin of healthy subjects, with the goal of inducing mild symptoms that would result in protection against the more severe naturally acquired disease. It began to be practised in England in 1721 thanks to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu who influenced Sloane to promote its use, including the inoculation of the royal family's children. When Edward Jenner's inoculation with the cow pox (vaccination) followed 75 years later as a safer yet equally effective procedure, the scene was set for the eventual control of smallpox epidemics culminating in the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1977, officially proclaimed by WHO in 1980. Here, we discuss the significance of variolation and vaccination with respect to scientific, public health and ethical controversies concerning these weapons of mass protection.

Whereas this longstanding viewpoint has its genesis in the discovery of the original namesake prions as causative agents of several complex diseases, the underlying assumption of a strict disease basis for prions could not be further from the truth. Prions and the spectrum of functions they comprise, likely represent one of the largest paradigm shifts concerning molecular-encoded phenotypic diversity since identification of DNA as the principle molecule of heredity. The ability of prions to recruit similar proteins to alternate conformations may engender a reservoir of diversity supplementing the genetic diversity resulting from stochastic mutations of DNA and subsequent natural selection. Here we present several currently known prions and how many of their functions as well as modes of transmission are intricately linked to adaptation from an evolutionary perspective. Further, the stability of some prion conformations across generations indicates that heritable prion-based adaptation is a reality.","output":"Prions: Roles in Development and Adaptive Evolution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High vaccination rates are needed to protect against influenza and to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities need to know if supplementing mass communications with direct correspondence to the community would increase uptake. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to determine if sending a single written message directly to individuals increases influenza vaccine uptake, and a secondary objective is to identify any identified content shown to increase influenza vaccine uptake. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched for RCTs testing a single correspondence for members of the community in OECD countries to obtain influenza vaccination. A meta-analysis with inverse-variance, random-effects modelling was used to estimate a mean, weighted risk ratio effect size measure of vaccine uptake. Studies were quality assessed and analysis was undertaken to account for potential publication bias. RESULTS: Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials were included, covering 45 interventions. Of the 45 interventions, 37 (82.2%) report an increase in influenza vaccination rates. A formal meta-analysis shows that sending a single written message increased influenza vaccine uptake by 16%, relative to the no contact comparator group (RR = 1.16, 95% CI [1.13-1.20], Z = 9.25, p < .001). Analysis shows that the intervention is effective across correspondence type, age group, time, and location, and after allowing for risk of publication bias. LIMITATIONS: The generalizability of results across the OECD may be questioned. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The implication for public health authorities organizing vaccination programs for influenza, and arguably also for COVID-19, is that sending written vaccination correspondence to members of the community is likely to increase uptake.

We performed metabolomics profiling of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to understand better the underlying pathologic processes and pathways, and to identify potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. DESIGN: Blood was collected at predetermined ICU days to measure the plasma concentrations of 162 metabolites using both direct injection-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. SETTING: Tertiary-care ICU and academic laboratory. SUBJECTS: Patients admitted to the ICU suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected until either testing was confirmed negative on ICU day 3 (coronavirus disease 2019 negative) or until ICU day 10 if the patient tested positive (coronavirus disease 2019 positive). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age- and sex-matched healthy controls and ICU patients that were either coronavirus disease 2019 positive or coronavirus disease 2019 negative were enrolled. Cohorts were well balanced with the exception that coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients suffered bilateral pneumonia more frequently than coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients. Mortality rate for coronavirus disease 2019 positive ICU patients was 40%. Feature selection identified the top-performing metabolites for identifying coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients from healthy control subjects and was dominated by increased kynurenine and decreased arginine, sarcosine, and lysophosphatidylcholines. Arginine/kynurenine ratio alone provided 100% classification accuracy between coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients and healthy control subjects (p = 0.0002). When comparing the metabolomes between coronavirus disease 2019 positive and coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients, kynurenine was the dominant metabolite and the arginine/kynurenine ratio provided 98% classification accuracy (p = 0.005). Feature selection identified creatinine as the top metabolite for predicting coronavirus disease 2019-associated mortality on both ICU days 1 and 3, and both creatinine and creatinine/arginine ratio accurately predicted coronavirus disease 2019-associated death with 100% accuracy (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomics profiling with feature classification easily distinguished both healthy control subjects and coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients from coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients. Arginine/kynurenine ratio accurately identified coronavirus disease 2019 status, whereas creatinine/arginine ratio accurately predicted coronavirus disease 2019-associated death.

These lesions are usually located to the abdominal wall on postoperative scars, perineum and chest due to direct spread from the tumor or to the lymphatic and venous dissemination. We describe a rare case of synchronous skin metastases in a patient affected by sigmoid adenocarcinoma with no sign of liver and lung repetitive lesions. CASE PRESENTATION: We admitted a 59 years old male, with no relevant medical history. He was evaluated by our tertiary center of colorectal surgery complaining diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The physical examination revealed a palpable mass in left flank of the abdomen. The colonoscopy showed a sub-stenosis of the sigmoid colon (G2 adenocarcinoma). No repetitive lesions were detected by the preoperative CT scan. The patient reported a rapid grow of a soft supralabial and chin nodules in the last 2 months, which he believed to be related to the use of the mask due to COVID-19 pandemic. A laparoscopic left hemicolectomy with complete mesocolic excision and a local excision of both facial nodules were performed. The histological examination revealed a poorly differentiated signet ring cell colorectal adenocarcinoma with metastases in seven pericolic lymphonodes. The excisional biopsy of the skin nodules revealed a subcutaneous metastases from primary colorectal tumour. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, synchronous facial metastases from colorectal cancer in the absence of any other metastases has never been described before. The onset of new skin nodules in patients affected by colorectal cancer should raise-up the clinical suspicion of metastatic lesions even when repetitive lesions are not detected in the liver or lungs.","output":"Synchronous skip facial metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma: a case report and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sleep is essential for wellbeing, yet sleep disturbance is a common problem linked to a wide range of health conditions. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide proposed to promote better sleep via potential interaction with the endocannabinoid system. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised study on 103 adults compared the efficacy and tolerability of 8 weeks of daily supplemented PEA formulation (350 mg Levagen + ?) to a placebo. Sleep quality and quantity were measured using wrist actigraphy, a sleep diary and questionnaires. RESULTS: At week 8, PEA supplementation reduced sleep onset latency, time to feel completely awake and improved cognition on waking. After 8 weeks, both groups improved their sleep quality and quantity scores similarly. There was no difference between groups at baseline or week 8 for sleep quantity or quality as measured from actigraphy or sleep diaries.

In LQTS1 and LQTS2, sympathetic stimulation increases arrhythmic risk by enhancing early afterdepolarizations and transmural dispersion of repolarization. -Blockers successfully reduce cardiac events by reducing these triggers and substrates; however, these effects are less marked in LQTS2 compared with LQTS1. In LQTS3, clinical and experimental investigations of the effects of sympathetic stimulation and -blocker use have produced contradictory findings, resulting in significant clinical uncertainty. We offer explanations for these contradicting results relating to study sample size, the dose of the -blocker administered associated with its off-target Na+ channel effects, as well as the type of -blocker used.

We previously showed that progesterone (P4) inhibited lung cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we investigated the effects of P4 on expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and target mRNAs in lung cancer cells. METHODS We performed high-throughput microarray and bioinformatics analysis to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in the untreated and the P4-treated A549 human lung cancer cells. RESULTS A total of 692 lncRNAs and 268 mRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the P4-treated A549 cells compared to the untreated A549 cells (>2-fold change, P < 0.05). Of the lncRNAs, 82 and 610 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Gene ontology, pathway, and network analyses showed that many of the mRNAs were involved in the regulation of classical pathways, including Notch signaling. Differential expression of a lncRNA signature composed of NONHSAT000264, FR075921, FR324124, linc-TRIM58, RP1-93H18.7, RP11-120K9.2, RP11-134F2.2, and NONHSAG024980 was validated by RT-qPCR analysis.

Specifically, the pore window size of the fine-tuned ZU-36-Ni (4.424.42 ?2) decorated with high density of electronegative anions matches well with the cross-section of C3H6 (4.164.65 ?2) and C2H4 (3.284.18 ?2), leading to efficient separation of C3H6/C3H8 and C2H4/C2H6.

In the present study, we administered Mutian X to 141 pet cats with effusive FIP following initial veterinarian examinations. Of these, 116 cats survived but the remaining 25 died during treatment. Pre-treatment signalment, viral gene expression, and representative laboratory parameters for routine FIP diagnosis (i.e., hematocrit, albumin-to-globulin ratio, total bilirubin, serum amyloid-A, and 1-acid glycoprotein) were statistically compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups. The majority of these parameters, including hematocrit, albumin-to-globulin ratio, serum amyloid-A, 1-acid glycoprotein, and viral gene expression, were comparable between the two groups. Interestingly, however, total bilirubin levels in the survivor group were significantly lower than those in the non-survivor group (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, in almost all surviving cats with effusive FIP (96.6%, 28/29), the pre-treatment total bilirubin levels were below 0.5 mg/dL; however, the survival rate decreased drastically (14.3%, 1/7) when the pre-treatment total bilirubin levels exceeded 4.0 mg/dL.

Earlier identification of patients at risk of severe disease may allow intervention with experimental targeted treatments, mitigating the course of their disease and reducing critical care service demand. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective observational study of patients tested or treated for SARS-CoV-2, who are under the care of the tertiary University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHSFT), captured data from admission to discharge; data collection commenced on 7 March 2020. Core demographic and clinical information, as well as results of disease-defining characteristics, was captured and recorded electronically from hospital clinical record systems at the point of testing. Manual data were collected and recorded by the clinical research team for assessments which are not part of the structured electronic healthcare record, for example, symptom onset date. Thereafter, participant records were continuously updated during hospital stay and their follow-up period. Participants aged >16 years were given the opportunity to provide consent for excess clinical sample storage with optional further biological sampling. These anonymised samples were linked to the clinical data in the Real-time Analytics for Clinical Trials platform and were stored within a biorepository at UHSFT. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the HRA Specific Review Board (REC 20/HRA/2986) for waiver of informed consent for the database-only cohort; the procedures conform with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study design, protocol and patient-facing documentation for the biobanking arm of the study have been approved by North West Research Ethics Committee (REC 17/NW/0632) as an amendment to the National Institute for Health Research Southampton Clinical Research Facility-managed Southampton Research Biorepository.

There are many challenges in the treatment of cancer and the rapidly developing area of nanotechnology has shown great potential to open a new era in cancer therapy. This article, rather than being exhaustive, focuses on the striking progress in the drug delivery nanosystems (DDNS) for cancer therapy and selects typical examples to point out the emerging mode of action of DDNS from our perspective. Among the outstanding advances in DDNS for cancer therapy is the development of \\"multicomponent delivery systems\\", \\"multifunctional nanocarriers\\" and \\"multistage delivery systems\\". However, these represent only one aspect of DDNS research. In addition, nature is the best teacher and natural evolution pressure has meant that virions conform to the \\"multitarget, multistage and multicomponent\\" (3M) mode of action. Amazingly, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), used for over 4000 years in China, also displays the same mode of action. Integrating the previous notable progress in nanoparticle technology, learned from the building mode of natural virions and the action concept of TCM, we propose an integrity-based 3M mode DDNS for cancer therapy: multitarget, multistage and multicomponent, which are not fragmented parts but an interconnected integrity. Based on the physiological multitarget and the pharmacokinetic multistage, multicomponent DDNS are rationally designed, where different components with individual specific functions act in a synergistic manner against each target at each disposition stage to maximize the targeted delivery effectiveness. In this article, we introduce each component of 3M DDNS in detail and describe some typical cases to realize the tumor-homing purposes.","output":"The holistic 3M modality of drug delivery nanosystems for cancer therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In recent times, there had been report of diverse particulate nucleic acid-related infections and diseases which have been associated with endemic, sporadic, and pandemic reports spreading within water nexus. Some of such disease cases were seldom reported in earlier years of technological advancement and research based knowledge-scape. Although the usefulness of water, wastewater treatment systems, water regulatory organizations and water re-use policy in compliant regions remains sacrosanct, it has been implicated in diverse gene distribution. MAIN BODY: A cosmopolitan bibliometric and critical assessment of cell-free DNA reservoir in water bodies was determined. This is done by analysing retrieved pentadecadal scientific publications in Scopus and Pubmed centre database, determining the twelve-monthly publication rates of related articles, and a content-review assessment of cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) in water environment. Our results revealed thirty-eight metric documents with sources as journals and books that conform to the inclusion criteria. The average reports/publication rate per year shows 16.7, while several single and collaborating authors are included with a collaboration index of 4.31. A zero average citation per document and citation per year indicate poor research interest and awareness. SHORT CONCLUSION: It is important to note that a redirected interest to studies on cfNAs in water environments would encourage advancement of water treatment strategies to include specific approaches on the removal of cfNAs, membrane vesicles or DNA reservoirs, plasmids or extra-chromosomal DNA and other exogenous nucleic acids from water bodies. It may also lead to a generational development/improvement of water treatment strategies for the removals of cfNAs and its members from water bodies.","output":"Water bodies are potential hub for spatio-allotment of cell-free nucleic acid and pandemic: a pentadecadal (1969C2021) critical review on particulate cell-free DNA reservoirs in water nexus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia, a rare and serious condition, has been described in Europe following receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca), which uses a chimpanzee adenoviral vector A mechanism similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been proposed In the US, the Ad26 COV2 S COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), which uses a human adenoviral vector, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on February 27, 2021 By April 12, 2021, approximately 7 million Ad26 COV2 S vaccine doses had been given in the US, and 6 cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia had been identified among the recipients, resulting in a temporary national pause in vaccination with this product on April 13, 2021 Objective: To describe reports of CVST with thrombocytopenia following Ad26 COV2 S vaccine receipt Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 12 US patients with CVST and thrombocytopenia following use of Ad26 COV2 S vaccine under EUA reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from March 2 to April 21, 2021 (with follow-up reported through April 21, 2021) Exposures: Receipt of Ad26 COV2 S vaccine Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical course, imaging, laboratory tests, and outcomes after CVST diagnosis obtained from VAERS reports, medical record review, and discussion with clinicians Results: Patients' ages ranged from 18 to younger than 60 years;all were White women, reported from 11 states Seven patients had at least 1 CVST risk factor, including obesity (n = 6), hypothyroidism (n = 1), and oral contraceptive use (n = 1);none had documented prior heparin exposure Time from Ad26 COV2 S vaccination to symptom onset ranged from 6 to 15 days Eleven patients initially presented with headache;1 patient initially presented with back pain and later developed headache Of the 12 patients with CVST, 7 also had intracerebral hemorrhage;8 had non-CVST thromboses After diagnosis of CVST, 6 patients initially received heparin treatment Platelet nadir ranged from 9 x103/microL to 127 x103/microL All 11 patients tested for the heparin-platelet factor 4 HIT antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening had positive results All patients were hospitalized (10 in an intensive care unit [ICU]) As of April 21, 2021, outcomes were death (n = 3), continued ICU care (n = 3), continued non-ICU hospitalization (n = 2), and discharged home (n = 4) Conclusions and Relevance: The initial 12 US cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia after Ad26 COV2 S vaccination represent serious events This case series may inform clinical guidance as Ad26 COV2 S vaccination resumes in the US as well as investigations into the potential relationship between Ad26 COV2 S vaccine and CVST with thrombocytopenia","output":"US Case Reports of Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis With Thrombocytopenia After Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination, March 2 to April 21, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possible role of interferon-gamma (IFN-) in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV3 infection was investigated.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data records of 50 patients with COVID-19 who were evaluated by the neurology services from March 1, 2020 - April 30, 2020. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on timing of developing neurological manifestations: the \\"Neuro first\\" group had neurological manifestations upon initial assessment, and the \\"COVID first\\" group developed neurological symptoms greater than 24 h after hospitalization. The demographics, comorbidities, disease severity and neurological symptoms and diagnoses of both groups were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (48% African American and 24% Latino) were included in the analysis. Most common neurological manifestations observed were encephalopathy (n = 30), cerebrovascular disease (n = 20), cognitive impairment (n = 13), seizures (n = 13), hypoxic brain injury (n = 7), dysgeusia (n = 5), and extraocular movement abnormalities (n = 5).

Due to the dual fluorescence characteristic of Zn(BQTC), selective fluorescence imaging of the nucleus and mitochondria of A549R cancer cells was conducted. Further, Zn(BQTC), obtained by the functionalization of Zn(TC) with cryptolepine derivative substituents, efficiently inhibited DNA synthesis, thus resulting in high cytotoxicity (selective for A549R lung tumor cells) accompanied by DNA impairment in nuclear and mitochondrial fractions. Additionally, Zn(BQTC) caused severe damage to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA), sequentially disrupted mitochondrial and nuclear functions, and promoted the DNA damage-induced apoptotic signaling pathway and adenosine triphosphate depletion (ATP). Thus, Zn(BQTC) can be used as an anticancer drug by targeting mtDNA and nDNA. Most importantly, Zn(BQTC) showed higher efficacy in inhibiting cancer growth (55.9%) in A549R tumor-bearing mice than Zn(TC) (31.2%) and cisplatin, along with a promising in vivo safety profile.

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/L, 300/L, or 400/L, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/L, 300/L, and 400/L, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","output":"Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case A 67-year-old woman known to have iron deficiency anemia and persistent unexplained chronic leukopenia was cared for by our medical center for about 16 years.

CD4 T cell differentiation is a key determinant of protective immunity against Mtb, but it is not fully understood how host-pathogen interactions shape individual antigen-specific T cell populations and their protective capacity. Here, we investigated the immunodominant Mtb antigen, MPT70, which is upregulated in response to gamma interferon (IFN-?3) or nutrient/oxygen deprivation of in vitro-infected macrophages. Using a murine aerosol infection model, we compared the in vivo expression kinetics of MPT70 to a constitutively expressed antigen, ESAT-6, and analyzed their corresponding CD4 T cell phenotype and vaccine protection. For wild-type Mtb, we found that in vivo expression of MPT70 was delayed compared to ESAT-6. This delayed expression was associated with induction of less differentiated MPT70-specific CD4 T cells but, compared to ESAT-6, also reduced protection after vaccination. In contrast, infection with an MPT70-overexpressing Mtb strain promoted highly differentiated KLRG1+CX3CR1+ CD4 T cells with limited lung-homing capacity. Importantly, this differentiated phenotype could be prevented by vaccination, and against the overexpressing strain, vaccination with MPT70 conferred protection similar to vaccination with ESAT-6. Together, our data indicate that high in vivo antigen expression drives T cells toward terminal differentiation and that targeted vaccination with adjuvanted protein can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining T cells in a protective less differentiated state. These observations shed new light on host-pathogen interactions and provide guidance on how future Mtb vaccines can be designed to tip the immune balance in favor of the host.IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis, caused by Mtb, constitutes a global health crisis of massive proportions and the impact of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to cause a rise in tuberculosis-related deaths. Improved vaccines are therefore needed more than ever, but a lack of knowledge on protective immunity hampers their development. The present study shows that constitutively expressed antigens with high availability drive highly differentiated CD4 T cells with diminished protective capacity, which could be a survival strategy by Mtb to evade T cell immunity against key antigens. We demonstrate that immunization with such antigens can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining antigen-specific T cells in a state of low differentiation. Future vaccine strategies should therefore explore combinations of multiple highly expressed antigens and we suggest that T cell differentiation could be used as a readily measurable parameter to identify these in both preclinical and clinical studies.","output":"In Vivo Antigen Expression Regulates CD4 T Cell Differentiation and Vaccine Efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Mental health problems are common among adolescents and greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence and correlates of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19. METHOD: Cross-sectional study (N = 1794 adolescents, mean age = 15.26) was conducted in May 2020. An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, COVID-related fear (COVID-fear), nutrition, physical activity (PA) level and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.80%, 48.20% and 36.70%, respectively, among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. Generalized linear models revealed that female, left behind children, and students with greater COVID-fear tended to report symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety concurrently. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and COVID-fear, better nutritional status and moderately active PA were both associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while highly active PA was associated with lower levels of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms.

In the range of 0.1 to &#8804;1.49  109 /L (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.05-0.66) and >3.55  109 /L of bNC (HR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.19-6.67), the trends on bNC with mortality were opposite. By recursive algorithm, the bNC at which the risk of the death was lower in the range of >1.49 to &#8804;3.55  109 /L (HR = 13.64, 95% CI = 0.25-74.71). In addition, we find that NCRs (NCR1 and NCR2) are not associated with COVID-19-related deaths. Compared with NCR, bNC has the potential to be used for early risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 infection. The relationship between bNC and mortality was U-shaped. The safe range of bNC was 1.64-4.0  109 /L. Identifying the correlation may be helpful for early risk stratification and medical decision-making.","output":"A U-shaped association between baseline neutrophil count and COVID-19-related mortality: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from China (more than 44,672 infectious as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate for a study area infection and morbidity probabilities at each age group.

A small percentage of cases persist with prolonged positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for prolonged viral shedding amongst patient's basal clinical conditions. METHODS: We have evaluated all 513 patients attended in our hospital between 1 March and 1 July. We have selected all 18 patients with prolonged viral shedding and compared them with 36 sex-matched randomly selected controls. Demographic, treatment and clinical data were systematically collected. RESULTS: Global median duration of viral clearance was 25.5 days (n = 54; IQR, 22-39.3 days), 48.5 days in cases (IQR 38.7-54.9 days) and 23 days in controls (IQR 20.2-25.7), respectively. There were not observed differences in demographic, symptoms or treatment data between groups. Chronic rhinosinusitis and atopy were more common in patients with prolonged viral shedding (67%) compared with controls (11% and 25% respectively) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003). The use of inhaled corticosteroids was also more frequent in case group (P = 0.007).

CONCLUSION: Our data confirms a higher geriatric mortality due to COVID-19. Negative residents also had higher mortality, which we suspect is secondary to preanalytical error and a low sensitivity of the swab test in poorly compliant subjects.

This paper covers the background information and research overview of digital healthcare, summarizes its applications and challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally puts forward the prospects of digital healthcare. First, main concepts, key development processes, and common application scenarios of integrating digital technologies and digital healthcare were offered in the part of background information. Second, the bibliometric techniques were used to analyze the research output, geographic distribution, discipline distribution, collaboration network, and hot topics of digital healthcare before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated research on the integration of digital technologies and healthcare. Third, application cases of China, EU and U.S using digital technologies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and analyzed.

Minimum foot clearance (MFC) is a key parameter for identifying the probability of tripping. Optical motion capture systems are commonly used to measure MFC values; however, there is a need to identify alternative modalities that are better suited to collecting data in real-world settings. Objective: This is the first of a two-part scoping review. The objective of this paper is to identify and evaluate alternative measurement modalities to optical motion capture systems for measuring level-ground MFC. A companion paper identifies conditions that impact MFC and the range of MFC values individuals that these conditions exhibit. Methods: We searched four electronic databases, where peer-reviewed journals and conference papers reporting level-ground MFC characteristics were identified. The papers were screened by two independent reviewers for inclusion. The reporting was done in keeping with the PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. Results: From an initial search of 1571 papers, 17 papers were included in this paper. The identified technologies were inertial measurement units (IMUs) (n = 10), ultrasonic sensors (n = 2), infrared sensors (IR) (n = 2), optical proximity sensors (OPS) (n = 1), laser ranging sensors (n = 1), and ultra-wideband sensors (n = 1). From the papers, we extracted the sensor type, the analysis methods, the properties of the proposed system, and its accuracy and validation methods. Conclusions: The two most commonly used alternative modalities were IMUs and OPS. There was a lack of standardization among studies utilizing the same measurement modalities, as well as discrepancies in the methods used to assess performance.

METHODS: Patients delivering at Sutter Health are tested (molecular) for COVID-19. These results were combined with antibody test results, using samples drawn at delivery. For each racial/ethnic group, we estimated prevalence of COVID-19, using logistic regression to adjust for known sociodemographic and comorbid risk factors. Testing for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M provided insight into timing of infections. RESULTS: Among 17,446 women delivering MayCDecember, 460 (2.6%) tested positive (molecular). Hispanic women were at 2.6 times the odds of being actively infected as White women (odds ratio = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 2.0C3.3). August and December were the highest risk periods for active infection (odds ratio = 3.5, 95% confidence interval = 2.1C5.7 and odds ratio = 6.1, 95% confidence interval = 3.8C9.9, compared with May, respectively).

METHODS Patients from the INFUSE-AMI trial were categorized according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification at their 30-day visit (NYHA class 2 versus 1). Independent correlates of NYHA class 2 were determined by multivariable logistic regression. A landmark analysis beyond 30 days was performed to assess the impact of 30-day NYHA class 2 on 1-year risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS Among 402 patients enrolled in the INFUSE-AMI trial with data on NYHA class at 30 days, 76 (18.9%) had NYHA class 2. Independent correlates of 30-day NYHA class 2 were age, Killip class 2 at presentation, heart rate at presentation, intraprocedural no-reflow, and 30-day infarct size (% total ventricular mass).

Of these deaths, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) account for a substantial percentage of deaths. Improvement in ACS outcomes, are achieved by reducing the time from symptom onset until reperfusion or total ischemic time (TIT). Nevertheless, due to the overwhelming reality at the beginning of the pandemic, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) care may have been compromised. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated delays in TIT based on the date and timing of admissions in patients with STEMI, by a timeline follow-up form, before and during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between July 2018 and June 2020, two hundred and twelve patients diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were admitted to our medical center. Upon presentation, cases were assigned a timeline report sheet and each time interval, from onset of symptoms to the catheterization lab, was documented. The information was later evaluated to study potential excessive delays throughout ACS management. RESULTS: Our data evidenced that during the COVID-19 pandemic ACS admissions were reduced by 34.54%, in addition to several in-hospital delays in patient's ACS management including delays in door-to-ECG time (9.43  18.21 vs. 18.41  28.34, p = 0.029), ECG-to-balloon (58.25  22.59 vs. 74.39  50.30, p = 0.004) and door-to-balloon time (57.41  27.52 vs. 69.31  54.14, p = 0.04).

We identified characteristics and 1,809 ICD code-based phenotypes from the electronic health record. We used logistic regression to examine the association of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, and prevalent phenotypes to the stages of COVID-19 disease progression: infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality (separate models for each). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of visit months and ICD codes, state infection rate and controlled for multiple testing using false discovery rate (0.1).

OBJECTIVE: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. SETTING: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. METHODS: Regression was used to find the relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. RESULTS: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2 = 0.610, p = 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature is on SARS-CoV-2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase is associated with a 1% decrease-and a one degree decrease could be associated with a 3.7% increase-in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. This model of the effect of decreasing temperatures can only be verified over time as the pandemic proceeds through colder months. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","output":"Evidence and magnitude of the effects of meteorological changes on SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One quarter of all deaths worldwide each year result from infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens.

METHODS We enrolled 303 consecutive patients of a single na?ve HCC that had been treated by RFA at The University of Tokyo Hospital from 1999 to 2004. Recurrence was categorized as either intra- or extra-subsegmental as according to the Couinaud's segment of the original nodule. To assess the relationship between the subsegments of the original and recurrent nodules, we calculated the kappa coefficient. We assessed the risk factors for intra- and extra-subsegmental recurrence independently using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. We also assessed the impact of the mode of recurrence on the survival outcome. RESULTS During the follow-up period, 201 patients in our cohort showed tumor recurrence distributed in a total of 340 subsegments. Recurrence was categorized as exclusively intra-subsegmental, exclusively extra-subsegmental, and simultaneously intra- and extra-subsegmental in 40 (20%), 110 (55%), and 51 (25%) patients, respectively. The kappa coefficient was measured at 0.135 (95% CI, 0.079-0.190; P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that of the tumor size, AFP value and platelet count were all risk factors for both intra- and extra-subsegmental recurrence. Of the patients in whom recurrent HCC was found to be exclusively intra-subsegmental, extra-subsegmental, and simultaneously intra- and extra-subsegmental, 37 (92.5%), 99 (90.8%) and 42 (82.3%), respectively, were treated using RFA. The survival outcomes after recurrence were similar between patients with an exclusively intra- or extra-subsegmental recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness of systematic subsegmentectomy may be limited in the patients with both HCC and chronic liver disease who frequently undergo multi-focal tumor recurrence.","output":"Frequency, risk factors and survival associated with an intrasubsegmental recurrence after radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Persistent digestive disorders account for considerable disease burden in the tropics. Despite advances in understanding acute gastrointestinal infections, important issues concerning epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and control of most persistent digestive symptomatologies remain to be elucidated. Helminths and intestinal protozoa are considered to play major roles, but the full extent of the aetiologic spectrum is still unclear. We provide an overview of pathogens causing digestive disorders in the tropics and evaluate available reference tests. METHODS: We searched the literature to identify pathogens that might give rise to persistent diarrhoea, chronic abdominal pain and/or blood in the stool. We reviewed existing laboratory diagnostic methods for each pathogen and stratified them by (i) microscopy; (ii) culture techniques; (iii) immunological tests; and (iv) molecular methods. Pathogen-specific reference tests providing highest diagnostic accuracy are described in greater detail. RESULTS: Over 30 pathogens may cause persistent digestive disorders. Bacteria, viruses and parasites are important aetiologic agents of acute and long-lasting symptomatologies. An integrated approach, consisting of stool culture, microscopy and/or specific immunological techniques for toxin, antigen and antibody detection, is required for accurate diagnosis of bacteria and parasites. Molecular techniques are essential for sensitive diagnosis of many viruses, bacteria and intestinal protozoa, and are increasingly utilised as adjuncts for helminth identification. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of the broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens is often cumbersome. There is a need for rapid diagnostic tests that are simple and affordable for resource-constrained settings, so that the management of patients suffering from persistent digestive disorders can be improved.","output":"Persistent digestive disorders in the tropics: causative infectious pathogens and reference diagnostic tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The main points to consider in secondary alveolar bone grafting (ABG) of cleft patients are age at the time of surgery, the type of bone graft, and pre/postorthodontic expansion of the upper jaw. PURPOSE The aim of this study is to evaluate the reverse quad-helix (RQH) expander device. Does RQH improve the surgical procedure before ABG? We will evaluate the outcome of the procedure, duration of the operation, hospitalization time, satisfaction of the surgeon with this procedure and the success of the bone graft in the long-term. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 103 cleft patients who underwent secondary bone grafting at our institution between 2001 and 2012. All patients were treated presurgically with a RQH appliance to expand the cleft area. The following data were recorded for each of the patients: Unilateral/bilateral cleft, surgery time, hospital stay, success/failure, and follow-up. CONCLUSION Presurgical orthodontic application of the RQH expander in the cleft area enabled improved anterior expansion rather than posterior expansion. This technique improves access for surgery and bone grafting, the use of RQH facilitates the improved manipulation of the nasal mucosa via direct view due to the wide separation of the alveolar segments in the cleft area. Furthermore, this gap enables improved access for the bone grafting procedure, shortens the surgery time and provides stable maxillary transverse correction.","output":"Secondary bone grafting of the cleft maxilla following reverse quad-helix expansion in 103 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic surgery has gained prominence in recent decades and employed in minimally invasive surgeries to avoid massive cuts resulting in a reduction in pain, the chance of infection, and duration of stay in the hospital. Maryland forceps, which belongs to the category of grasper instruments, are often used in minimally invasive surgeries to hold, pull, push, manipulate, and perform dissection operations. During laparoscopic surgeries, often blood and other body fluids ooze from the site of surgery. Typically, suction-irrigation (SI) devices are used to periodically clear these fluids to get a better view of the site of surgery. To achieve this, the removal and insertion of multiple instruments are required. This process has to be repeated numerous times, which significantly increases the time needed for surgery. Literature survey and feedback from practicing surgeons suggest that this can be avoided by improving the current design of forceps. In this article, a modified design is proposed by combining the SI feature with the existing form of Maryland forceps. The modified design is first modeled in SolidWorks and then analyzed for fluid flow using ANSYS Fluent. Parametric analysis is performed to obtain the optimal design for the proposed multi-functional instrument, which can potentially improve the overall efficiency of the laparoscopic surgical process.","output":"Design and fluid flow simulation of modified laparoscopic forceps."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper addresses the many complex and traumatic losses brought by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

The proposed approach is based on a Gaussian process regression model. The main advantage of this model is that it assumes that a nonlinear function f used for modeling the observed data is an unknown random parameter in opposite to usual approaches that set up f as being a known mathematical function. This assumption allows the development of a Bayesian approach with a Gaussian process prior over f. In order to estimate the parameters of interest, we develop an MCMC algorithm based on the Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also present a procedure for making predictions. The proposed method is illustrated in a case study, in which, we model the 7-day moving average for the number of deaths recorded in the state of S?o Paulo, Brazil. Results obtained show that the proposed method is very effective in modeling and predicting the values of the 7-day moving average.

During the early days of the pandemic, it was a major challenge to care for pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants. In this article, we share our experience in the management of newborn infants delivered to mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods A prospective single-center observational study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, National Guard Health Affairs, Saudi Arabia. Data collection started in March 2020 and was completed in October 2020. The inclusion criteria included mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants. Results A total of 45 pregnant women with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study. Their mean age was 30.235.92 years. The mode of delivery was spontaneous vaginal delivery in 27 women (60%), cesarean section in 15 women (33.3%), and assisted vaginal delivery in three women (6.7%). Three mothers (6.7%) required intensive care unit admission. A total of 45 babies were born and 25 were females (55.6%), 20 males (44.4%). None of the babies had specific symptoms related to COVID-19. All babies were tested negative on the two COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs. Babies were initially admitted to the NICU and one baby required prolonged NICU stay due to extreme prematurity (23 weeks), one baby died due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and respiratory distress syndrome, and the remaining babies were discharged home in a stable condition. Conclusion Our experience suggests that maternal outcomes are generally favorable and no difference between vaginal and cesarean delivery in the risk of virus transmission. With strict implementation of infection prevention measures, mother-to-infant transmission is very unlikely. Early bathing of the newborn infant is preferred to reduce the risk of transmission of infection to newborn infants and the hospital staff. Breastfeeding is safe if performed under strict infection prevention measures.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of Newborn Infants Delivered to Pregnant Women With Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19: A Single-Center Experience From Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to their inherently high surface energy, polar end-functionalised polymers do not normally adsorb to the external surfaces of blends. However, adsorption of polar functionalities can be induced rapidly by annealing in a polar environment such as glycerol prior to quenching to a glassy state. Blended films of carboxy end-functionalised deuteriopolystyrene (dPS-COOH) with hydrogenous polystyrene (hPS) were annealed at 150 C under glycerol. Nuclear reaction analysis was used to quantify the surface excess of dPS-COOH retained at the surface after quenching the films to below the glass transition temperature. Incorporation of multiple COOH groups onto a single chain end greatly increases the affinity of these chains to the interface with glycerol. Here we have shown that even a difunctional material, dPS-2COOH, is much more surface active than either the singly functionalised dPS-COOH or the difunctional ester from which it was prepared.

Methods PPE samples were collected from physicians exiting a room after the management of a patient with severe to critical COVID-19 who was within 14 days after symptom onset. The PPE sites were categorized into coverall-only parts (the frontal surface of the head, anterior neck, dorsal surface of the foot cover, and back and hip) and gown-covered parts (the anterior side of the forearm and the abdomen). Environmental sampling was performed in patient rooms. We tried to identify significant differences in contamination with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between the coverall-only and gown-covered parts. Results A total of 105 swabs from PPE and 28 swabs from patient rooms were collected. Of the PPE swabs, only three (2.8 %) swabs from gown-covered parts were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. However, 23 of the total 28 sites (82.1%) from patient rooms were contaminated. There was significant difference in the contamination of PPE between coverall-only and gown-covered parts (0.0 vs 6.7%, p = 0.022).

Its incidence has been increasing in recent years. This infection can affect the prognosis of patients, prolong hospital stays and raise costs for patients and their families. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the current situation of deep fungal infections in the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University and to provide a basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of deep fungal infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 528,743 cases in the hospital from 2015 to 2019, including the epidemiological characteristics, treatment and prognosis of deep fungal infections. RESULTS: A total of 274 cases (0.05%) with deep fungal infections were identified, accounting for 0.05% of the total number of hospitalizations. The incidence of deep fungal infections in the hospital showed an increasing trend from 2015 to 2019. The most commonly infected site was the respiratory tract (93.07%). Among patients with deep fungal infections, 266 specimens were positive for fungal culture, by which 161 cultured Candida albicans (C. albicans), accounting for 60.53%, the main pathogen causing deep fungal infection. From 2015 to 2019, the percentage of C. albicans cases showed a downward trend, while that of non-C. albicans showed an opposite trend. Antibiotics were the most common predisposing factor for deep fungal infections (97.45%). Among the underlying diseases of patients with deep fungal infections, infectious diseases (59.49%) were the most common. Those with underlying diseases such as renal insufficiency and neurological diseases had a worse prognosis. Indwelling catheters, nervous system disease and tumors were risk factors for a poor prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: For patients with PAH/CTEPH followed at accredited pulmonary hypertension centers, assess the cumulative incidence and outcomes of recognized COVID-19. Evaluate the pandemic's impact on clinic operations at these centers. METHODS: A survey was emailed to program directors of centers accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. Descriptive analyses and linear regression were used to analyze results. RESULTS: Seventy-seven center directors were successfully emailed a survey, 58 responded (75%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in individuals with PAH/CTEPH was 2.1 cases per 1,000 patients, similar to the general United States population. In patients with PAH/CTEPH and recognized COVID-19 30% were hospitalized and 12% died. These outcomes appear worse than the general population.

There was no association between the demographic factors of age, sex, or the reason for being monitored with the level of engagement (P > .05). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, patients with cancer were readily enrolled in a remote home monitoring program. Monitoring was feasible, and there was a high rate of engagement with the program.

The indispensable role of the main protease (Mpro) in viral replication and gene expression makes this enzyme an attractive drug target. Therefore, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a proposition to halt virus ingression is being pursued by scientists globally. Here we carried out a study with two objectives: the first being to perform comparative protein sequence and 3D structural analysis to understand the effect of 12 point mutations on the active site. Among these, two mutations, viz., Ser46 and Phe134, were found to cause a significant change at the active sites of SARS-CoV-2. The Ser46 mutation present at the entrance of the S5 subpocket of SARS-CoV-2 increases the contribution of other two hydrophilic residues, while the Phe134 mutation, present in the catalytic cysteine loop, can cause an increase in catalytic efficiency of Mpro by facilitating fast proton transfer from the Cys145 to His41 residue. It was observed that active site remained conserved among Mpro of both SARS-CoVs, except at the entrance of the S5 subpocket, suggesting sustenance of substrate specificity. The second objective was to screen the inhibitory effects of three different data sets (natural products, coronaviruses main protease inhibitors, and FDA-approved drugs) using a structure-based virtual screening approach. A total of 73 hits had a combo score >2.0. Eight different structural scaffold classes were identified, such as one/two tetrahydropyran ring(s), dipeptide/tripeptide/oligopeptide, large (approximately 20 atoms) cyclic peptide, and miscellaneous. The screened hits showed key interactions with subpockets of the active site. Further, molecular dynamics studies of selected screened compounds confirmed their perfect fitting into the subpockets of the active site. This study suggests promising structures that can fit into the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site and also offers direction for further lead optimization and rational drug design.","output":"Structure-Based Virtual Screening to Discover Potential Lead Molecules for the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The orf8b protein of the coronavirus SARS-CoV, analogous to SARS-CoV-2, triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages in vitro. Deregulated inflammasome-mediated release of interleukin-1 family cytokines is important in hyper-inflammatory syndromes, like happens in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome. We propose that an intense inflammasome formation characterizes the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 disease due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Samples from four patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who had been hospitalized at the Hospital of the University of Trieste (Italy) and died of ARDS and four lung samples from a historical repository from subjects who had died of cardiopulmonary arrest and had not been placed on mechanical ventilation and without evidence of pulmonary infection at postmortem examination were collected. Pathology samples had been fixed in formalin 10% at time of collection and subsequently embedded in paraffin. We conducted staining for ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a Caspase recruitment domain), NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3), and cleaved caspase-1. RESULTS: Intense expression of the inflammasome was detected, mainly in leukocytes, within the lungs of all patients with fatal COVID-19 in the areas of lung injury. The number of ASC inflammasome specks per high power fields was significantly higher in the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 as compared with the lungs of control subjects (52  22 vs 6  3, P = 0.0064).

We review factors that could affect the susceptibility of children to the novel coronavirus. METHODS: We search publications indexed on PUBMED. RESULTS: Descriptions of the pathophysiology of current and previous coronavirus infections suggest several viral targets and immunomodulatory pathways affecting the severity of illness. There is limited evidence to suggest age-variability of viral cell receptors and transmembrane co-factors required for coronavirus entry and replication. However, the ensuing cytokine storm and the effect of higher melatonin in children are age-dependent and could explain decreased disease variability in children.

The aim is to investigate the correlates of different dimensions of subjective well-being in 10- to 16-year-olds from different cultural contexts. METHODS: An online, self-report questionnaire was completed by 1,613 adolescents in Luxembourg, Germany, and Brazil between May and July 2020. The outcome variables were measures of life satisfaction and emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included a range of sociodemographic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal covariates. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and latent variable structural equational modeling. RESULTS: A two-factor model of subjective well-being, consisting of life satisfaction and emotional well-being latent constructs, fitted well with this sample data for Luxembourg, Germany, and Brazil. Results showed that gender, socioeconomic status, intrapersonal factors, quantity and type of schoolwork, and relationships with adults were important common predictors of individual differences in subjective well-being during COVID-19. Fear of illness emerged as the strongest correlate of emotional well-being across the three countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that girls and adolescents from low-income homes may be especially vulnerable to negative secondary impacts of COVID-19 that can affect mental health. It identified several common correlates of subjective well-being in adolescents from different cultural settings, including factors that may be changeable, such as the following: the way adults listen to adolescents, schoolwork during distant learning, and fear of illness.

One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive. However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance. This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies. Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance). Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination. However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water.

We aimed to assess the uptake of virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic using comprehensive population-based data from Ontario. METHODS: This was a repeated cross-sectional study design. We used administrative data to evaluate changes in in-person and virtual visits among all residents of Ontario before (2012C2019) and during (JanuaryCAugust 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. We included all patients who had an ambulatory care visit in Ontario. We excluded claims for patients who were not Ontario residents or had an invalid or missing health card number. We compared monthly or quarterly virtual care use across age groups, neighbourhood income quintiles and chronic disease subgroups. We also examined physician characteristics that may have been associated with virtual care use. RESULTS: Among all residents of Ontario (population 14.6 million), virtual care increased from 1.6% of total ambulatory visits in the second quarter of 2019 to 70.6% in the second quarter of 2020. The proportion of physicians who provided 1 or more virtual visits per year increased from 7.0% in the second quarter of 2019 to 85.9% in the second quarter of 2020. The proportion of Ontarians who had a virtual visit increased from 1.3% in 2019 to 29.2% in 2020. Older patients were the highest users of virtual care. The proportion of total virtual visits that were provided to patients residing in rural areas (v. urban areas) declined significantly between 2012 and 2020, reflecting a shift in virtual care to a service increasingly used in urban centres. The rates of virtual care use increased similarly across all conditions and across all income quintiles. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that Ontarios approach to virtual care led to broad adoption across all provider groups, patient age, types of chronic diseases and neighborhood income. These findings have policy implications, including use of virtual care billing codes, for the ongoing use of virtual care during the second wave of the pandemic and beyond.","output":"Virtual care use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a repeated cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the culprit causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Comparison of SARS2pp different production conditions revealed that the pseudovirus titer could be greatly improved by: 1) removing the last 19 amino acids of the spike protein and replacing the signal peptide with the mouse Igk signal sequence; 2) expressing the spike protein using CMV promoter other than CAG (a hybrid promoter consisting of a CMV enhancer, beta-actin promoter, splice donor, and a beta-globin splice acceptor); 3) screening better optimized spike protein sequences for SARS2pp production; and 4) adding 1 % BSA in the SARS2pp production medium. For infection, this SARS2pp system showed a good linear relationship between MOI 2-0.0002 and then was successfully used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibitors including recombinant human ACE2 proteins and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. The kidney, liver and small intestine-derived cell lines were also found to show different susceptibility to SARSpp and SARS2pp. Given its robustness and good performance, it is believed that this pseudovirus particle production and infection system will greatly promote future research for SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms and inhibitors and can be easily applied to study new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"An optimized and robust SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system for viral entry research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are among the most promising approaches against COVID-191,2.

In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2  40.9 (BR) to 41.1  25.3 g m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45  2.37 (BR) and 5.42  1.75 gC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 g m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 g m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3  6.6 (BR) to 14.8  9.3 g m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6  1.4 (BR) to 3.2  2.0 gC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources.

METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study performed in the Sant'Andrea University Hospital of Rome. We included patients older than 65 years of age with a diagnosis of COVID-19, from March 2020 to May 2020, divided in two groups according to their age (Elderly: 65-80 years old; Very Elderly > 80 years old). Data extracted from the each patient record included age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms at onset, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) to the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) (P/F) on admission, laboratory tests, radiological findings on computer tomography (CT), length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality rate and the viral shedding. The differences between the two groups were analyzed by the Fisher's exact test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. To assess significance among multiple groups of factors, we used the Bonferroni correction. The survival time was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and Log Rank Test. Univariate and Multivariate logistic regression were performed to estimate associations between age, comorbidities, provenance from long-stay residential care homes (LSRCH) s and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found that Very Elderly patients had an increased mortality rate, also due to the frequent occurrence of multiple comorbidities. Moreover, we found that patients coming from LSRCHs appeared to be highly susceptible and vulnerable to develop severe manifestations of the disease. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that there were considerable differences between Elderly and Very Elderly patients in terms of inflammatory activity, severity of disease, adverse clinical outcomes. To establish a correct risk stratification, comorbidities and information about provenience from LSRCHs should be considered.","output":"Age is not the only risk factor in COVID-19: the role of comorbidities and of long staying in residential care homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is essential for controlling the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. An effective time-course strategy for the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial given that the global vaccine supply will still be limited in some countries/regions in the near future and that mutant strains have emerged and will continue to spread worldwide. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission have played major roles in the COVID-19 pandemic, which can only be properly described as a typical non-Markovian process. However, the prioritization of vaccines in the non-Markovian framework still lacks sufficient research, and the underlying mechanism of the time-course vaccine allocation optimization has not yet been uncovered. In this paper, based on an age-stratified compartmental model calibrated through clinical and epidemiological data, we propose optimal vaccination strategies (OVS) through steady-state prediction in the non-Markovian framework. This OVS outperforms other empirical vaccine prioritization approaches in minimizing cumulative infections, cumulative deaths, or years of life lost caused by the pandemic. We found that there exists a fast decline in the prevention efficiency of vaccination if vaccines are solely administered to a selected age group, which indicates that the widely adopted strategy to continuously vaccinate high-risk group is not optimal. Through mathematical analysis of the model, we reveal that dynamic vaccine allocations to combinations of different age groups is necessary to achieve optimal vaccine prioritization. Our work not only provides meaningful references for vaccination in countries currently lacking vaccines and for vaccine allocation strategies to prevent mutant strains in the future, but also reveals the mechanism of dynamic vaccine allocation optimization, forming a theoretical and modelling framework empirically applicable to the optimal time-course prioritization.","output":"Mechanism of optimal time-course COVID-19 vaccine prioritization based on non-Markovian steady-state prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The knowledge of the replicative cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with cellular proteins has opened a new therapeutic possibility based on blocking those essential for the virus.

Methods: The intervention consists of a pedometer and smartphone app, allowing transmission of activity data to a platform (Linkcare v2.7) that provides feedback, activity goals, education and contact with the researcher as required. Remote assessment pre- and post-intervention included patient acceptability using a project specific questionnaire, physical activity using accelerometry (Actigraph GT3X), HADS and the SF-36 questionnaire. Results: So far, all eligible patients approached were willing to be randomised to the intervention or usual care (n=14;COPD=4, ILD=7;CF=1;PH=2). For the intervention, usage of the pedometer was excellent, with patients wearing it for 6.90.1 days/week and rating the pedometer and telephone contact (92 out of 10) as the most vital aspects. Patient feedback has been positive, with 80% of patients responding that they liked taking part and that it helped them a lot to increase their activity levels. Daily steps and VMU are presented in Figure 1 and SF-36 scores in Figure 2. There were no changes in HADS scores between groups.

Its impact is currently growing, particularly in low-income countries. Even in high-income countries, hypertension remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, with consequent low rates of blood pressure (BP) control. Notwithstanding the large number of clinical observational studies and randomized trials over the past four decades, it is sad to note that in the last few years there has been an impressive paucity of innovative studies. Research focused on BP mechanisms and novel antihypertensive drugs is slowing dramatically. The present review discusses some advances in the management of hypertensive patients, and could play a clinical role in the years to come. First, digital/health technology is expected to be increasingly used, although some crucial points remain (development of non-intrusive and clinically validated devices for ambulatory BP measurement, robust storing systems enabling rapid analysis of accrued data, physician-patient interactions, etc.). Second, several areas should be better outlined with regard to BP diagnosis and treatment targets. Third, from a therapeutic standpoint, existing antihypertensive drugs, which are generally effective and well tolerated, should be better used by exploiting available and novel free and fixed combinations. In particular, spironolactone and other mineral-corticoid receptor antagonists should be used more frequently to improve BP control. In particular, some drugs initially developed for conditions different from hypertension including heart failure and diabetes have demonstrated to lower BP significantly and should therefore be considered.

Although the composition of the BM is usually tissue specific, the lung and the kidney preferentially use similar BM components. Unsurprisingly, diseases with BM defects often have severe pulmonary or renal manifestations, sometimes both. Excessive remodeling of the BM, which is a hallmark of both inflammatory and fibrosing diseases in the lung and the kidney, can lead to the release of BM-derived matrikines, proteolytic fragments with distinct biological functions. These matrikines can then influence disease activity at the site of liberation. However, they are also released to the circulation, where they can directly affect the vascular endothelium or target other organs, leading to extrapulmonary or extrarenal manifestations. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the composition and function of the BM and its matrikines in health and disease, both in the lung and in the kidney.

However, important questions remain regarding the extent to which unstructured social media data can be harnessed for clinically meaningful decision-making. OBJECTIVE: This comprehensive scoping review synthesizes interdisciplinary literature with a particular focus on research methods and applications. METHODS: A total of 6 health and computer science databases were searched for studies published before April 20, 2021, resulting in the identification of 47 studies. Included studies were published in peer-reviewed outlets and examined mental health during disasters or crises by using social media data. RESULTS: Applications across 31 mental health issues were identified, which were grouped into the following three broader themes: estimating mental health burden, planning or evaluating interventions and policies, and knowledge discovery. Mental health assessments were completed by primarily using lexical dictionaries and human annotations. The analyses included a range of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, statistical modeling, and qualitative techniques. The overall reporting quality was poor, with key details such as the total number of users and data features often not being reported. Further, biases in sample selection and related limitations in generalizability were often overlooked. CONCLUSIONS: The application of social media monitoring has considerable potential for measuring mental health impacts on populations during disasters. Studies have primarily conceptualized mental health in broad terms, such as distress or negative affect, but greater focus is required on validating mental health assessments. There was little evidence for the clinical integration of social mediaCbased disaster mental health monitoring, such as combining surveillance with social mediaCbased interventions or developing and testing real-world disaster management tools. To address issues with study quality, a structured set of reporting guidelines is recommended to improve the methodological quality, replicability, and clinical relevance of future research on the social media monitoring of mental health during disasters.","output":"Methods and Applications of Social Media Monitoring of Mental Health During Disasters: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are appearing as an important class of regulatory RNAs with a variety of biological functions. The aim of this study was to identify the lincRNA profile in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and evaluate their potential role in host-pathogen interaction. The majority of previous RNA-Seq transcriptome studies in Ae. aegypti have focused on the expression pattern of annotated protein coding genes under different biological conditions. Here, we used 35 publically available RNA-Seq datasets with relatively high depth to screen the Ae. aegypti genome for lincRNA discovery. This led to the identification of 3,482 putative lincRNAs. These lincRNA genes displayed a slightly lower GC content and shorter transcript lengths compared to protein-encoding genes. Ae. aegypti lincRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species such as Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae. We examined their expression in dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Wolbachia infected and non-infected adult mosquitoes and Aa20 cells. The results revealed that DENV-2 infection increased the abundance of a number of host lincRNAs, from which some suppress viral replication in mosquito cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of lincRNA_1317 led to enhancement in viral replication, which possibly indicates its potential involvement in the host anti-viral defense. A number of lincRNAs were also differentially expressed in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The results will facilitate future studies to unravel the function of lncRNAs in insects and may prove to be beneficial in developing new ways to control vectors or inhibit replication of viruses in them.","output":"Identification of Aedes aegypti Long Intergenic Non-coding RNAs and Their Association with Wolbachia and Dengue Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article focuses on the role of artificial intelligence in healthcare management and in particular, the support it can provide to efficiently improve medical imaging and radiology procedures.

Permanent residents receive first-dollar coverage for all medically necessary services provided by licensed physicians or in hospitals, including ED services. POPULATION: All people age >15 with MSUD ED visits during the study period. MEASURES: All claims with a service location in the ED or corresponding to fee items billed only in the ED were examined alongside ED visits reported through a national reporting system. Patient characteristics (sex/gender, age, location of residence, income, treated disorders and comorbidities) and previous outpatient service use for all ED visits by visit diagnosis are also described.

METHODS: To explain this phenomenon, we analyzed the growth of seven wild-type ATCC 33277 strains and two wild-type W83 strains in 10 minimal media and three complex media. RESULTS: All nine strains grew in LF (Lactalbumin-Ferric chloride), GC (bovine ?3-immunoglobulin G-Calcium chloride), and newly developed mC (milk-Casein) minimal media. Therefore, LF, GC, and mC could be used as minimal media for P. gingivalis.

There is an urgent need for developing therapeutic drugs and (or) biologics to prevent the spread of the virus. The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 shows that the virus enters host cells by first binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Therefore, blocking the binding between of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD can inhibit the virus infection in the host cells. In this study, by grafting the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of developed SARS-CoV, MERS-CoVs specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as SARS-CoV-2 mAbs onto a known stable nanobody (Nb) scaffold, and a total of 16 Nbs sequences were designed. Five Nbs, namely CS01, CS02, CS03, CS10, and CS16, were selected based on the free energy landscape of protein docking verified by the recently reported Nb-RBD cocrystal structures. CS01, CS02, and CS03 occupied the ACE2 binding site of RBD, while CS10 and CS16 were proposed to inhibit the interaction between RBD and ACE2 through an allosteric mechanism. Based on the structures of the five Nbs in complex with RBD, seven brand-new Nbs with enhanced binding affinities (CS02_RD01, CS03_RD01, CS03_RD02, CS03_RD03, CS03_RD04, CS16_RD01, and CS16_RD02) were generated by redesign of residues on the interface of the five Nbs contact with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Results revealed 0.2 mg/ml as the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against MCF-7. The extract exerted anticancer effect against MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cell cycle assay showed that the extract arrested MCF-7 cells in the G0/G1 phase, and apoptosis was observed after 72 h by the Annexin-V assay. The gene expression assay revealed that the cell cycle arrest was associated with the downregulation of CDK2 and subsequent upregulation of p21 and cyclin E. The extract induced apoptosis via the mediation of the mitochondrial cell death pathways. A chromatography analysis revealed the contribution of D-pinitol and myo-inositol as the two major bioactive compounds to the activity observed. Overall, the study demonstrated that NC leaves' ethanol extract exerts anticancer effect against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, thereby justifying its traditional use for the treatment of breast cancer in Malaysia.","output":"An In Vitro Anticancer Activity Evaluation of Neolamarckia cadamba (Roxb.)

Setting: Palliative care clinicians consulted for patients either positive for COVID-19, under investigation for COVID-19, or recovered from COVID-19. Design: The PCQC created a 13-item COVID-19 case report form (CRF), modeled after the PCQC core dataset for specialty palliative care quality measurement. Twelve items offered discrete answer choices and one was open-ended. The CRF was publicized widely (e.g., social media, e-mail list serves) and completed through a link on the PCQC website. Results: Three hundred six reports (298 adult, 8 pediatric) were submitted between April 6, 2020 and October 7, 2020. The majority of patients (83%) were 50 years or older; 25% were 80 or older, and 78% were COVID-19 positive. Male gender identity was significantly more prevalent than female (58% vs. 40%, p < 0.002). The most common comorbidity was cardiovascular disease (23%).

Among the changes that the adolescent must face are: accepting their own body, acquiring a social role, establishing new relationships with peers,achieving emotional independence from parents. All of this is not always easy and many times they face a so difficult path that can produce the onset of some mental pathologies. Typical disorders that adolescents can face are the ones related to food. In these pathologies there is an isolation of the soul which corresponds to an alienation from the body: what remains in this loneliness is the gap between the idealized body and the objectified body. In this process of identity determination the idealized body is not able to relate to the real body (Cuzzolaro 2017). The dimension of their own body and the ability to meet the other bodies in the world are compromised; the only possible knowledge is represented by the impoverishment of their own subjectivity and by the attempt to recover it at an abstract level.

Several earlier studies cite a VTE incidence of up to 30-40% in hospitalized or intensive care unit (ICU) patients, which is higher compared to historical rates in non-COVID hospitalized patients. These reports spurred a transition to intensified thromboprophylaxis across many institutions, absent rigorous evidence regarding the risks and benefits of such measures. To estimate the actual incidences of VTE (including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) during hospitalization for COVID-19, we performed a rigorous systematic review of published literature. Methods We searched the MEDLINE database using the terms [(SARS-CoV2 OR COVID-19 OR Covid19) AND (trial OR series OR cohort OR incidence)] from December 1, 2019 to July 13, 2020. Two authors (JYZ and NGC) screened all study titles and abstracts and excluded those that did not include clinical data on adult patients with COVID-19. The bibliography lists from review articles were screened in the same fashion. The same two authors reviewed the full text of the remaining articles and excluded those that met the following exclusion criteria: 1) not peer-reviewed; 2) not written in English; 3) did not include unique primary data; 4) no defined study time interval; 5) did not describe and quantify hospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19; 6) did not describe a consecutive case series or consecutive cohort studies or controlled trials with consecutive enrollment of subjects that met specific inclusion criteria; 7) study inclusion criteria were related to the clinical suspicion for VTE; 8) did not describe a method whereby clinically detected VTE was tabulated; 9) did not report the VTE incidence (PE, DVT, or both) among the specified study population. Adjudication of publications with uncertainty in meeting criteria was done by all authors. Data extraction from the selected studies comprised study type and population, VTE incidence and method of diagnosis, as well as thromboprophylaxis regimen and use. We calculated the proportions with 95% confidence intervals of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in whom VTE, PE, and DVT were diagnosed. These proportions were summarized from the entire group and from three pre-specified subsets of studies: those that enrolled fewer than 100 subjects, between 100-1000 subjects, and more than 1000 subjects. Results The search of MEDLINE generated 11,983 articles, 11,266 of which were excluded for irrelevance. Of the remaining 717 articles, 664 met our specific exclusion criteria, leaving 52 articles included in the final analysis. The study populations were heterogeneous and included all hospitalized patients, non-ICU hospitalized patients and ICU patients. Screening and diagnostic methods for VTE among the studies varied. Some systematically used Doppler ultrasound screening on all subjects while others used specific diagnostic tests only if DVT or PE were suspected. Thromboprophylaxis regimens varied, whereby most studies employed some form of prophylaxis, a few studies used intensified dosing based on risk stratification. The overall incidences of PE, DVT and VTE among all hospitalized COVID-19 patients were 4.1%, 5.0% and 6.1%, respectively (Table). PE, DVT and VTE proportions reported in the smaller studies (with much wider confidence intervals) were typically three or more times as high as those reported in the larger studies as reflected in a funnel plot (Figure) and Table. Conclusion Our comprehensive review revealed incidences of PE, DVT and VTE among hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are comparable to hospitalized patients without COVID-19. Variability among the reported incidences demonstrated a trend toward higher incidences among the smaller studies, suggesting a publication bias towards overestimation in smaller reports. Thus we believe that intensification of thromboprophylaxis on the basis of COVID-19 infection, beyond usual hospital or ICU management protocols, should be done cautiously based on the individualized patient situation. Randomized controlled trials may help provide definitive evidence of VTE incidence and inform the formulation of appropriate thromboprophylaxis algorithms in these patients.

Among them, cardiovascular diseases represent the main cause of death. At the origin of these diseases, exposure to challenges during developmental windows of vulnerability (peri-conception, in utero, and early infancy periods) have been incriminated. Among the challenges that have been described, endocrine disruptors are of high concern because of their omnipresence in the environment. Worrisomely, since birth, children are exposed to a significant number of endocrine disruptors. However, the role of such early exposure on long-term cardiac health is poorly described. In this context, based on a model of rats exposed postnatally and transiently to an estrogenic compound prototype (estradiol benzoate, EB), we aimed to delineate the effects on the adult heart of such transient early exposure to endocrine disruptors and identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the potential pathogenesis. We found that this transient post-natal exposure to EB induced cardiac hypertrophy in adulthood, with increased cardiomyocyte size. The evaluation of cardiac calcium signaling, through immunoblot approaches, highlighted decreased expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and decreased Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells (NFAT3) phosphorylation as a potential underlying mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the treatment of cardiomyocytes with EB in vitro induced a decrease in SERCA2 protein levels. Overall, our study demonstrates that early transient exposure to EB induces permanent cardiac alterations. Together, our data highlight SERCA2 down-regulation as a potential mechanism involved in the cardiac pathogenesis induced by EB.

Objective: To determine whether public health interventions that culminated in a stay-at-home lockdown instituted during the first wave of the pandemic in March/April 2020 were effective at mitigating the association of any of these factors with the risk of infection. Design: Population-based cohort study Setting: Ontario, Canada Patients: All adults that underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 between January 1 and June 12, 2020. Measurements: The outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were determined for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors before and after the peak of the pandemic to assess for changes in effect sizes. Results: Among 578,263 community-dwelling individuals, 20,524 (3.5%) people tested positive. The association between age and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among tested community-dwelling individuals varied over time (P-interaction <0.0001). Prior to the first-wave peak of the pandemic, the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased progressively with age compared with individuals aged 18-45 years (P<0.0001). This association subsequently reversed, with all age groups younger than 85 years at progressively higher risk of infection (P<0.0001) after the peak. Otherwise, risk factors that persisted throughout included male sex, residing in lower income neighborhoods, residing in more racially/ethnically diverse communities, immigration to Canada, and history of hypertension and diabetes. While there was a reduction in infection rates across Ontario after mid-April, there was less impact in regions with higher degrees of racial/ethnic diversity. When considered in an additive risk model, following the initial peak of the pandemic, individuals living in the most racially/ethnically diverse communities with 2, 3, or []4 risk factors had ORs of 1.89, 3.07, and 4.73-fold higher for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to lower risk individuals in their community (all P<0.0001). In contrast, in the least racially/ethnically diverse communities, there was little to no gradient in infection rates across risk strata. Conclusion: After public health interventions in March/April 2020, people with multiple risk factors residing in the most racially diverse communities of Ontario continued to have the highest likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection while risk was mitigated for people with multiple risk factors residing in less racially/ethnically diverse communities. Further efforts are necessary to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the highest risk individuals residing in these communities.","output":"Clinical Risk, Sociodemographic Factors, and SARS-CoV-2 Infection Over Time in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bangladesh is an example of a highly populous, agricultural country where melioidosis may be a significantly under diagnosed cause of infection and death. A recent regression model predicted 16,931 cases annually in Bangladesh with a mortality rate of 56%. However, we only manage to confirm (culture) around 80 cases in last 60 years. A lack of awareness among microbiologists and clinicians and a lack of diagnostic microbiology infrastructure are factors that are likely to lead to the underreporting of melioidosis. Melioidosis transmits through inoculation, inhalation and ingestion. Diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor (12 times higher chance of getting the infection) predisposing individuals to melioidosis and is present in >50% of all patients. The clinical presentation is widely varied and can be mistaken for other diseases such as tuberculosis or more common forms of pneumonia giving rise to its nickname as the great mimicker. Disease manifestations vary from pneumonia or localized abscess to acute septicemias, or may present as a chronic infection. Culture is considered the current gold-standard for diagnosis and culture-confirmation should always be sought in patients where disease is suspected. It is strongly recommended that any nonCPseudomonas aeruginosa, oxidase-positive, Gram-negative bacillus isolated from any clinical specimen from a patient in an endemic area should be suspected to be Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP). In addition, based on antibiogram, any Gramnegative bacilli that are oxidase-positive, typically resistant to aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), colistin, and polymyxin but sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should be considered as BP. This bacteria is inherently resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, first generation and second-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, tobramycin, streptomycin, and polymyxin. For intensive phase (10 to 14 days), ceftazidime or carbapenem is the drug of choice. For eradication phase (3 to 6 months), oral trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice. Surgery (drainage of abscess) has an important role in the management of melioidosis.

It is established that chemical modification can facilitate the crystallization of otherwise intractable proteins. Here we describe a method for the reductive methylation of lysine residues which is simple, inexpensive, and efficient, and report on its application to ten proteins.

Created in the context of a global call for extractive industry accountability, as well as increasing scrutiny of Canadian mining activities for alleged human rights and environmental abuses, the ESTMA aims to deter corruption via financial reporting requirements for Canadian extractive firms operating in Canada and abroad. By mandating that firms publicly disclose payments to various levels of government, however, the ESTMA is constructed atop global corruption discourse that identifies host states in the Global South as the source of social pathologies that facilitate corruption, largely excluding a critical analysis of extractive firms in the Global North.

Recent studies indicated critical roles of macrophages and monocytes in CAR-T induced CRS. Here, we report rapid dissipation of CAR-T induced CRS in two patients after receiving Tripterygium glycosides (TG). Effects of triptolide, the major active component of TG, on macrophages and monocytes were examined in animal models. Methods Two patients with CRS after CAR-T cell therapy (for hematological malignancy) received TG (50 mg, p.o.). Flow cytometry analysis and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) were conducted to examine the effects of TG on immune cells. Potential effects of triptolide were also examined ex vivo using patient-derived monocytes, as well as in mice. Findings Rapid alleviation of fever and cytokine storm was observed within 72 hours after TG treatment. Blood concentration of triptolide ranged from 21 to 154 ng/mL during treatment. Flow cytometry and scRNAseq showed selective depletion of monocytes with minimal impact on CAR-T cells in both patients. In ex vivo experiments with patient-derived monocytes, triptolide dramatically inhibited the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10). Triptolide also rapidly and selectively depleted peritoneal concanavalin A activated macrophages and monocytes in mice.

It is an infectious disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread.

However, whether patients develop dyslipidemia is unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the pathological alterations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and total cholesterol (TC) in COVID-19 patients and their relationships with the disease severity. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to examine serum levels of LDL-c, HDL-c, and TC on 597 COVID-19 patients (mild: 394; severe, 171; critical: 32) who were hospitalized in our center between February 1 and March 3, 2020. Age- and gender-matched normal subjects (n = 50) who had routine laboratory lipid tests between October 1 and November 1, 2019 in our center were included as the control group. RESULTS: LDL-c and TC levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared with normal subjects (P < .001). There were significant and gradual decreases in levels of LDL-c (median (IQR) in mg/dL, mild: 91 (76, 104); severe: 86 (69, 102); critical: 69 (48, 81); P < .02) and TC (mild: 173 (148, 203); severe: 167 (138, 197); critical: 125 (95, 162); P < .05) across all three groups.

However, there is wide variation in transport education among fellowship programs. Using the flipped classroom methodology, we developed a video and case-based transport education curriculum. METHODS: A national needs assessment identified safety, communication skills, and physiology as the most important aspects of transport management. Three 10-minute video modules and two 20-minute case-based discussions were developed to address this content. Using the flipped classroom format, seven NPM fellows from all three postgraduate years of training took part in the curriculum by individually viewing each video followed by participation in group case-based discussions. Cognitive and affective outcomes were assessed using a knowledge and attitude pretest, individual video module posttests, and a postcurriculum follow-up survey. RESULTS: NPM fellows showed significant improvements in transport knowledge and reported increased confidence in their ability to perform important transport roles. Case discussions were adaptable to learners who had different levels of training and had variable transport experience. Case discussions were successfully executed both in person and by video telecommunications during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: This transport curriculum addressed a national education gap in NPM fellowship training.

However, the mechanism that regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that tripartite-motif protein 30 (TRIM30) negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. After stimulation with ATP, an agonist of the NLRP3 inflammasome, knockdown of TRIM30 enhanced caspase-1 activation and increased production of IL-1 in both J774 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Similarly with ATP, knockdown of TRIM30 increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1 production triggered by other NLRP3 inflammasome agonists, including nigericin, monosodium urate, and silica. Production of reactive oxygen species was increased in TRIM30 knockdown cells, and its increase was required for enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, because antioxidant treatment blocked excess IL-1 production. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM30 attenuated reactive oxygen species production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, in a crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis model, monosodium urate-induced neutrophil flux and IL-1 production was reduced significantly in TRIM30 transgenic mice as compared with that in their nontransgenic littermates. Taken together, our results indicate that TRIM30 is a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and provide insights into the role of TRIM30 in maintaining inflammatory responses.","output":"Tripartite-motif protein 30 negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by modulating reactive oxygen species production."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The phenylalanineCtyrosineCdopaCdopamine pathway provides dopamine to the brain. In this process, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme that hydroxylates tyrosine and generates levodopa (l-dopa) with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) as a coenzyme. Here, we show that oral berberine (BBR) might supply H(?) through dihydroberberine (reduced BBR produced by bacterial nitroreductase) and promote the production of BH(4) from dihydrobiopterin; the increased BH(4) enhances TH activity, which accelerates the production of l-dopa by the gut bacteria. Oral BBR acts in a way similar to vitamins. The l-dopa produced by the intestinal bacteria enters the brain through the circulation and is transformed to dopamine. To verify the gutCbrain dialog activated by BBRs effect, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium was transplanted into Parkinsons disease (PD) mice. The bacteria significantly increased brain dopamine and ameliorated PD manifestation in mice; additionally, combination of BBR with bacteria showed better therapeutic effect than that with bacteria alone. Moreover, 2,4,6-trimethyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (TMP-TFB)-derivatized matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging of dopamine identified elevated striatal dopamine levels in mouse brains with oral Enterococcus, and BBR strengthened the imaging intensity of brain dopamine. These results demonstrated that BBR was an agonist of TH in Enterococcus and could lead to the production of l-dopa in the gut. Furthermore, a study of 28 patients with hyperlipidemia confirmed that oral BBR increased blood/fecal l-dopa by the intestinal bacteria.

METHODS: We trained furloughed staff to perform the role of dofficer. They offered support and corrective feedback on proper PPE use and completed 21-point audits during a 4-week intervention period. Audits tracked appropriate signage, placement and availability of supplies (equipment), correct PPE use, enhanced environmental cleaning, along with cohorting and social distancing rates. Audit data was used to provide weekly quality improvement reports to units. RESULTS: Nine hundred and sixty two separate audits recorded 36,948 observations, over 7,696 observer-hours. The most common errors were with environmental cleaning and PPE use; the least common were with regards to equipment availability and cohorting and social distancing. Mean error rates decreased from 9.81% to 2.88% (P < .001). The largest reduction, 22.57%, occurred in the category of PPE doffing errors.

INTRODUCTION: Bradykinin was implicated in a new complex model of pathomechanism leading to the symptoms of COVID-19 created by a computer-assisted association analysis. According to this model, the decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme expression leads to impaired bradykinin elimination and subsequent enrichment in the lungs. However, there is no mentioning of the importance of blood coagulation factor XII in increased bradykinin production, in spite of its age-dependent activation and the lower level of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1INH). Activated factor XII may be an important contributor to the \\"bradykinin storm\\" in elder cardiovascular patients. METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: 1) Activation of the coagulation factor XII on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 infected endothelial cells may trigger the prekallikrein/kallikrein/kinin system producing bradykinin. Such process is taking place in hantavirus infections causing severe lung and kidney damages. 2) The endothelial system is dysregulated in elderly patients, resulting in potentially higher factor XII activities on the surface of damaged endothelial cells in the stiffened arteries. This can contribute to the higher mortality rates in the elderly. CONCLUSION: The targeted inhibition of activated blood coagulation factor XII may represent a new therapeutic target for COVID-19, especially for elder patients. Recently, beneficial results have already been observed by the clinical applications of recombinant C1INH and bradykinin receptor antagonists.

We first review the question of the route of contamination and of the dose following exposure, and the importance of the counting unit for pathogens, itself linked to the dose-response law. Using the counting unit of Wells, i.e. the quantum of contagium, we develop the conservation equation of quanta which allows deriving the value of the quantum concentration at steady state for a well-mixed room. With the choice of an exponential response function, this leads to the famous Wells-Riley equation. The analysis points out the importance of a number of parameters such as the time of exposure, the quantum production rate, mask wearing and the incidence rate in the population in order to evaluate the risk. The link with the monitoring concentration of carbon dioxide is made and used for a risk analysis of a variety of situations for which we have made concrete CO2 time monitoring. The main conclusion of these observations is that the present norms of ventilation, already insufficient, are not respected, especially in a variety of public premises, leading to high risk of contamination. Finally, we insist that public health policy in the field of airborne transmission should be based on a multi parameter analysis, considering the whole complexity of dose evaluation.","output":"Increased airborne transmission of COVID-19 with new variants.

The objective of this study is to assess patient experience with HI compared to infusions in the infusion center. Methods A 31-question survey was developed to assess patient experience with the transition to home infusions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. All patients with IBD over the age of 18 years who received at least one dose of infliximab (or biosimilar) or vedolizumab infusion at our infusion center followed by at least one HI between 03/01/ 2020 to 10/30/2020 were included in the study. Consent was obtained over the phone and survey links were emailed to patients via REDCap. Binomial test was used to test if the percentage of patients choosing an option for a survey question was significantly different than 50% of the study population. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results Of the 112 patients who met inclusion criteria, 48 patients completed the survey. Forty-one patients (85.4%) aged 60 or younger and 27 patients (56.3%) were female. Twenty-eight patients (58.3%) had Crohns disease, and the majority (37/48) were receiving infliximab or biosimilar. Twenty-seven patients (56.3%) were receiving their current biologic medication for more than 12 months prior to the transition to HI. The majority of patients perceived that HI was equally or more safe than receiving infusions at the infusion center (81.2%, p-value < 0.0001) and preferred HI during the COVID-19 pandemic (70.1%, pvalue = 0.004). Nurses from the HI companies were found to be equally or more competent than the nurses at the infusion centers. The percentage of patients who perceived that comfort and ease of scheduling were better with HI was not significantly different from 50%. Thirty-eight patients (79.2%, p-value < 0.0001) wanted to continue/are considering continuing HI in the future. The median score for satisfaction with HI was 7 (Interquartile range: 2) on a scale of 0-10.

Objective: This study aimed to describe the feasibility and clinical and process outcomes associated with a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model to triage and manage obstetrical patients with known exposures and symptoms of COVID-19. Study Design: We implemented a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model with obstetrical physicians and nurses to standardize ambulatory care for obstetrical patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 based on the symptoms or exposures at an urban academic tertiary care center with multiple hospital-affiliated and community-based practices. All pregnant or postpartum patients with COVID-19 symptoms, exposures, or hospitalization were eligible for inclusion in the program. Patients were assessed by means of regular nursing phone calls and were managed according to illness severity. Patient characteristics and clinical and process outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Results: A total of 135 patients were enrolled in the multidisciplinary telemedicine model from March 17 to April 19, 2020, of whom 130 were pregnant and 5 were recently postpartum. In this study, 116 of 135 patients (86%) were managed solely in the outpatient setting and did not require an in-person evaluation; 9 patients were ultimately admitted after ambulatory or urgent evaluations, and 10 patients were observed after hospital discharge. Although only 50% of the patients were tested secondary to limitations in ambulatory testing, 1 in 3 of those patients received positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (N=22, 16% of entire cohort). Patients were enrolled in the telemedicine model for a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 4-8) and averaged 1 phone call daily, resulting in 891 nursing calls and 20 physician calls over 1 month. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model for outpatient management of obstetrical patients with COVID-19 symptoms and exposures is feasible and resulted in rates of ambulatory management similar to those seen in nonpregnant patients. A centralized model for telemedicine surveillance of obstetrical patients with COVID-19 symptoms may preserve inpatient resources and prevent avoidable staff and patient exposures, particularly in centers with multiple ambulatory practice settings.","output":"A multidisciplinary telemedicine model for management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in obstetrical patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus causing serious human disease to spread across the world in the past 20 years, after SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome.

The cooperation of many countries is required to establish international guidelines regarding the use of TCM in patients with severe COVID-19 from other regions and of different ethnicities. Studies on the psychological abnormalities in patients with COVID-19, and medical staff, is lacking; it is necessary to provide a complete chain of evidence to determine the efficacy of TCM in the related prevention, treatment, and recovery. This study aims to provide a reference for the rational use of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"The direct evidence and mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine storm and hyperinflammation are associated with increased mortality in COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: To determine whether the WFSM Mentor Academy (MA), an effective long-standing mentoring program for research faculty, is compromised after moving from an in-person to an online format as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A vetted National Research Mentoring Network (NMRN) implemented at WFSM addresses 6 major competencies (Effective Communication, Aligning Expectations, Assessing Understanding, Addressing Equity/Inclusion, Fostering Independence, Promoting Professional Development) over 6 months with 10 sessions (20 contact hrs). COVID-19 required that the MA (13 participants) move to an online format after 3 (out of 10) in-person sessions. We survey 26 self-rated mentoring competencies pre- and post MA, based on a numerical 7-point scale (abstract published for ACTS 2020) and, in 2020, included additional assessments of online versus in-person MA satisfaction/effectiveness and perceived impact on abilities of MA participants to mentor in an exclusively virtual format. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: All 13 participants responded to the survey and rated the online format as effective (9) or somewhat effective (4) for learning content. However, for participant interactions, only 4 found it effective and 9 somewhat effective. When assessing ability to mentor in a virtual format, most negatively affected competencies were helping your mentee network effectively (7 of 13), motivating your mentee (7), and identifying and accommodating different communication styles (6). Goal setting (research goals, career goals) was rated easier under COVID-19 restrictions by 3 mentors. Increases in Pre-Post self-expressed mentoring effectiveness (+1 pt quality; +1 pt meeting mentee expectations) are similar to historical values, and 12 of the 13 mentors changed mentoring practices based on MA experiences. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: While 2020 ratings for increased effectiveness are similar to prior years, since the 2021 MA will remain online, we will adjust content to address challenges identified in training mentors and in mentoring trainees in virtual settings by strategies to keep MA participants engaged online and sharing new resources for virtual/hybrid format mentoring.","output":"23688 Impact of moving to a virtual format with the Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) Mentor Academy (MA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Personality traits are important factors with regard to the tendency to experience and response to stress.

Methods: We collected data on NPIs, using government notifications and news reports, in six major Indian states from March to August 2020, and we matched these with district-level data on COVID related deaths and Google Mobility reports. We used a district fixed effect regression approach to measure the extent to which district-level lockdowns and mobility restrictions helped reduce deaths in 2020. Results: In most states, COVID deaths grew most rapidly only after the initial lockdown was lifted. District-level NPIs were associated with a statistically significantly lower COVID death count in three out of five sample states (district analysis was not possible in Delhi) and in the aggregate. Interventions that were most associated with slowing fatalities were temple closures, retail closures, and curfews. Discussion: Outside of Maharashtra (the first state struck) the first fatality wave appears to have been delayed by the national lockdown.

Previous DBS-fMRI studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral (VL) thalamus can modulate sensorimotor cortices in a frequency and amplitude dependent manner. Here, we investigated, using a swine animal model, how the direction and orientation of the electric field, induced by VL-thalamus DBS, affects activity in the sensorimotor cortex. Adult swine underwent implantation of a novel 16-electrode (4 rows x 4 columns) directional DBS lead in the VL thalamus. A within-subject design was used to compare fMRI responses for (1) directional stimulation consisting of monopolar stimulation in four radial directions around the DBS lead, and (2) orientation-selective stimulation where an electric field dipole was rotated 0-360 around a quadrangle of electrodes. Functional responses were quantified in the premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices. High frequency electrical stimulation through leads implanted in the VL thalamus induced directional tuning in cortical response patterns to varying degrees depending on DBS lead position. Orientation-selective stimulation showed maximal Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast when the electric field was oriented approximately parallel to the DBS lead, which is consistent with known axonal orientations of the cortico-thalamocortical pathway. These results demonstrate that directional and orientation-selective stimulation paradigms in the VL thalamus can tune network-level modulation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, which may have translational utility in improving functional outcomes of DBS therapy.","output":"Orientation-selective and directional deep brain stimulation in swine assessed by functional MRI at 3T"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The clinical presentation of COVID-19, ranges from a mild, self-limiting disease, to multiple organ failure, and death. Most severe COVID-19 cases present low lymphocytes counts, high leukocytes counts and, accumulated evidence suggests that in a subgroup of patients presenting severe COVID-19, there may be a hyperinflammatory response driving a severe hypercytokinaemia which may be, at least in part, signaling the presence of an underlying endothelial dysfunction. In this context, available data suggest a prognostic role of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in various inflammatory diseases and oncological processes. Following this rationale, we hypothesized that NLR, as a marker of endothelial dysfunction, may be useful in identifying patients with a poor prognosis in hospitalized COVID-19 cases. DESIGN A retrospective observational study performed at Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, Madrid, Spain, which included 119 patients with COVID-19 from March 1 to March 31, 2020. Patients were categorized according to WHO R&D Expert Group. RESULTS Forty five (12.1%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure requiring respiratory support. Forty seven (12.6%) patients died. Those with worse outcomes were older (p=0.002) and presented significantly higher NLR at admission (p=0.001), greater increase in Peak NLR (p<0.001) and higher increasing speed of NLR (p=0.003) compared to follow up patients. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, cardiovascular disease, C-Reactive-Protein at admission and Peak NLR were significantly associated with death.

We used the National Opinion Research Center's COVID-19 Household Impact Survey conducted between April and June 2020 to evaluate sociodemographic disparities in adherence to COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in a sample of respondents with underlying CVD representing 18 geographic areas of the United States (US). Methods: CVD status was ascertained by self-reported history of receiving heart disease, heart attack, or stroke diagnosis. We built de novo, a cumulative index of SDOH burden using education, insurance, economic stability, 30-day food security, urbanicity, neighborhood quality, and integration. We described the practice of measures under the broad strategies of personal protection (mask, hand hygiene, physical distancing), social distancing (avoiding crowds, restaurants, social activities, and high-risk contact), and work flexibility (work-from-home, canceling/postponing work). We reported prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SDOH burden (quartiles of cumulative indices) and practicing these measures adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, and interview wave. Results: 2036/25269 (7.0%) adults, representing 8.69 million in 18 geographic areas of the US, reported underlying CVD. Compared to the least SDOH burden, fewer individuals with the greatest SDOH burden practiced all personal protection (75.6% vs 89.0%) and social distancing measures (41.9% vs 58.9%) and had any flexible work schedule (26.2% vs 41.4%). These associations remained statistically significant after full adjustment: personal protection, (PR = 0.83; 95% CI [0.73-0.96]; P = 0.009); social distancing (PR = 0.69; 95% CI [0.51-0.94]; P = 0.018); and work flexibility (PR = 0.53; 95% CI [0.36-0.79]; P = 0.002).

In addition, the Internet usage during the pandemic has taken on a new dimension. On one hand, maintaining social contacts with friends/families to reduce psychological impacts of isolation, providing access to entertainment and even materials guiding physical exercises are all realized through information and communication technologies. All these are also the strategies recommended by the WHO. On the other hand, longer Internet hours coupled with the specifics of the Internet usage during a pandemic, could lead to exploring particular contents (pornography) as well activities (social networks, games). The aforementioned could negatively reflect on important mental health factors in daily living such as quality of life or insomnia.Aim: The aim of our study was to investigate if quality of life and sleep during the pandemic are predicted by Internet-related variables such as the general use of Internet. Methods and methods: This cross-sectional study is a part of a wider international multicenter research. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of the Clinical Centre of Serbia and the Board of Clinic of Psychiatry, Clinical Centre of Serbia. The study included 3330 participants (71.1% females, average age was 40.78 12.21 years). The participants filled in an anonymous online self-report questionnaire, comprising the following: 1) socio-demographic questionnaire;2) questionnaire on Internet use during the pandemic (designed for the purpose of this study), assessing whether participants had more frequent use of Internet, and performed any of the online activities more (e.g. playing online games, using Instagram, Facebook (FB)), or browsed any of the Internet contents more (e.g. sexual contents) during the pandemic;3) the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI);4) the COVID-19 - Impact on Quality of Life (COV19-QoL) scale. Multivariate liner regression was used to produce two models, with COV19-QoL during the pandemic and the ISI score as outcomes, and Internet-related variables as predictors, controlling for gender, age, and the number of persons living in the household. Results: Both linear regression models were significant, explaining about 6% of variance each. Worse QoL during the pandemic was predicted by more time on Internet during the pandemic, more frequent gaming, FB use, and searching for sexual content, whereas the more frequent use of Instagram had no predictive effect. Higher insomnia severity was predicted by more time spent on Internet during the pandemic, and more frequent search for sexual content, while other Internet-related variables had no predictive effects. Conclusions: The findings of this study speak in favor of the negative association between the general and specific use of Internet on side, and the quality of life and sleep during the pandemic, on the other.

Participants 2,861,809 individuals, aged 12-39 years, vaccinated with the first doses of mRNA vaccines (2,405,759 BNT162b2 and 456,050 mRNA-1273) between 27 December 2020 and 30 September 2021. Main outcome measures First diagnosis of myocarditis/pericarditis within the study period. The incidence of events in the exposure risk periods (0-21 days from the vaccination day, subdivided in three equal intervals) for first and second dose was compared with baseline period.

We tested long-read sequencing using the portable Nanopore MinION for surveying pathogens, ARGs, and antibiotic- resistant pathogens in municipal wastewater, hospital wastewater, and surface water collected from Boston, USA and Vellore, India. We compared detection of enteric pathogens by assembly of long reads, with and without short-read polishing, and unassembled raw long reads for ARGs to multiplex real-time PCR. Using real-time PCR as a benchmark, long-read metagenomics was 49% sensitive and 75% specific at pathogen detection in assembled contigs, and 16% sensitive and 100% specific at detecting 28 clinically relevant resistance genes in raw long reads. Short- read polishing did not substantially improve pathogen identification or impact ARG identification in the assembled contigs, demonstrating that short-read polishing is not required, which greatly reduces costs.

We have previously developed an amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticle (NP)-based vaccine (i.e., nanovaccine) encapsulating the fusion and attachment proteins from BRSV (BRSV-NP). Calves receiving a single, intranasal dose of the BRSV-NP vaccine are partially protected from BRSV challenge. Here, we evaluated the impact of VAD on the immune response to the BRSV-NP vaccine and subsequent challenge with BRSV. Our results show that VAD calves are unable to respond to the mucosal BRSV-NP vaccine, are afforded no protection from BRSV challenge and have significant abnormalities in the inflammatory response in the infected lung. We further show that acute BRSV infection negatively impacts serum and liver retinol, rendering even well-nourished individuals susceptible to VAD. Our results support the use of the calf model for elucidating the impact of nutritional status on mucosal immunity and respiratory viral infection in infants and underline the importance of VA in regulating immunity in the respiratory mucosa.","output":"Vitamin A deficiency impairs the immune response to intranasal vaccination and RSV infection in neonatal calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canada's provinces are without a publicly funded psychotherapy program for common mental disorders despite evidence that psychological services help reduce the length and number of depressive episodes, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and associated negative outcomes (hospitalizations and suicide attempts).

Methods: : This web-based cross-sectional study was distributed randomly in March 2020, nearly 11 years into the Syrian war crisis. The survey consists of 3 sections: socio-demographic characteristics, attitude, and practice. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with good practice, and negative attitude.

Most studies have focused on anterior circulation strokes; therefore, little is known regarding the optimal anesthesia type for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes. Objective To compare clinical and angiographic outcomes between monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and general anesthesia (GA) in patients presenting with vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, matched, case-control study of consecutive vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes treated with endovascular therapy at 2 academic institutions. The study took place between September 2005 and September 2015 at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and between September 2010 and September 2015 at the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. Patients requiring emergent intubation prior to endovascular therapy were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into (1) MAC and (2) elective intubation for the procedure (elective GA). Patients who converted from MAC to GA during the procedure were included in the MAC group. The 2 groups were matched for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and glucose levels. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measure was the shift in the degree of disability among the 2 groups as measured by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days. Results A total of 215 patients underwent endovascular therapy for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes during the study period. Thirty-nine patients were excluded owing to emergent pre-endovascular therapy intubation. Sixty-three patients had MAC (36%) and 113 patients had GA (64%). The conversion rate from MAC to GA was 13% (n = 8). After matching, 61 pairs of patients (n = 122) underwent primary analysis. The 2 groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 60-75 years) in the MAC group vs 67 years (interquartile range, 55.5-78.5 years) in the GA group (P = .83). Fifty-four percent of the patients in the MAC group were men vs 41% in the GA group (P = .44). When compared with the elective GA group, patients who underwent the procedure with MAC had similar rates of successful reperfusion, good clinical outcomes, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality. The modality of anesthesia was not associated with any significant changes in the modified Rankin scale score distribution (MAC: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.80-2.90; P = .19).

Aim of this study was to compare the radiological outcomes and time metrics of the various thrombectomy techniques. METHODS In this retrospective, multicenter study we analysed the data of 450 patients with occlusion of the anterior circulation, treated in five high-volume center from 2013 to 2016. The treatment techniques were divided in three categories: first-pass use of a large-bore aspiration-catheter; first-pass use of a stent-retriever; and primary combined approach (PCA) of an aspiration-catheter and stent-retriever. Primary endpoints were successful reperfusion and groin to reperfusion time. Secondary endpoints were the number of attempts and occurrence of emboli in new territory (ENT). The primary analysis was based on the intention to treat groups (ITT). RESULTS The ITT-analysis showed significantly higher reperfusion rates, with 86% of successful reperfusion in the PCA-group compared with 73% in the aspiration group and 65% in the stent-retriever group. There was no significant difference in groin to reperfusion time regarding the used technique. The secondary analysis showed an impact of the technique on the number of attempts and the occurrence of ENTs. Lowest ENT rates and attempts were reported with the combined approach. CONCLUSIONS The combined first-pass deployment of a stent-retriever and an aspiration-catheter was the most effective technique for reperfusion of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion.

The purpose of these discharge instructions is to assist and provide guidance for physicians, nurses, and other health care personnel involved in discharging COVID-19 patients to home after encounters at hospitals, emergency departments, urgent care settings, and medical offices. METHODS: A systematic literature-search of studies evaluating both symptoms and signs of COVID-19 was performed in order to establish specific optimal performance criteria in monitoring a patient's status with regard to disease safety. These optimal performance criteria parameters were considered with regard to the severity of morbidity and mortality. Strategies used to develop the discharge instructions included review of a broad spectrum of literature to develop the discharge criteria. RESULTS: These guidelines are presented for patient education and should achieve the essential goals including: enabling patients to understand their medical situation, preventing complications, supporting patients by providing instructions, helping patients make more effective use of available health services, and managing patient stress by giving patients comfort through the knowledge of specific recommendations including how to respond to situations. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians to efficiently teach their patients self-management strategies and to provide a safe educated response to the patient and the surrounding community environment.

Although pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19-associated myocardial injury have been studied throughout the pandemic course in 2019, its morphological characterisation is still unclear. With this study, we aimed to characterise echocardiographic patterns of ventricular function in patients with COVID-19-associated myocardial injury. METHODS: We prospectively assessed 32 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and presence or absence of elevated high sensitive troponin T (hsTNT+ vs. hsTNT-) by comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) and strain echocardiography. RESULTS: A minority (34.3%) of patients had normal ventricular function, whereas 65.7% had left and/or right ventricular dysfunction defined by impaired left and/or right ventricular ejection fraction and strain measurements. Concomitant biventricular dysfunction was common in hsTNT+ patients. We observed impaired left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in patients with myocardial injury (-13.9% vs. -17.7% for hsTNT+ vs. hsTNT-, p = 0.005) but preserved LV ejection fraction (52% vs. 59%, p = 0.074). Further, in these patients, right ventricular (RV) systolic function was impaired with lower RV ejection fraction (40% vs. 49%, p = 0.001) and reduced RV free wall strain (-18.5% vs. -28.3%, p = 0.003). Myocardial dysfunction partially recovered in hsTNT + patients after 52 days of follow-up. In particular, LV-GLS and RV-FWS significantly improved from baseline to follow-up (LV-GLS: -13.9% to -16.5%, p = 0.013; RV-FWS: -18.5% to -22.3%, p = 0.037).

The gazette empowers the government to monitor the spread of infection. Despite there being an infrastructure of research ethics committees in almost all hospitals in Bangladesh, a lack of such committees in the clinical setting often forces healthcare professionals to allocate scarce healthcare resources to the task. These personnel are often either influenced by materialistic matters or guided by the emergency policies, without reaching a consensus on how to allocate scarce resources in times of need, especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ethical dilemmas often arise when a number of patients with COVID-19, especially in poor and middle-class areas, are denied care while elites are prioritized to receive such scarce resources.

The aim of this study was to estimate the association between RWMA after exercise and in the presence of significant AR in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or volume overload and to predict the eventual need for aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed 182 patients with significant AR who underwent exercise echocardiography. In addition, we investigated patients with AR who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and were diagnosed with CAD. The presence of RWMA after exercise was defined as newly developed RWMA after exercise and included all changes in wall motion. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of RWMA after exercise: the RWMA group (n = 42) and non-RWMA group (n = 140). In the RWMA group, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent coronary artery evaluation by CAG or CCTA. Only two patients in the RWMA group were diagnosed with current CAD and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with RWMA were older (61.6  10.8 vs 52.0  13.7 years, P < .001), had more severe AR (54.8% vs 32.9%), and underwent AVR more frequently (40.5% vs 14.3%, P = .001) than patients without RWMA. METs (odds ratio [OR], 0.796; P = .019), difference between rest and postexercise left ventricular end-diastolic volume (OR, 0.967; P = .001), and the difference between pre- and postexercise left ventricular end-systolic volume (OR, 1.113; P < .001) were identified as independent factors associated with RWMA after exercise according to multivariable logistic regression analysis. The majority of wall motion changes were seen in the lateral and inferior segments, and the locations of wall motion changes were relatively consistent with the direction of the AR jet. The relationship between RWMA after exercise and time to AVR was investigated by simple linear regression (hazard ratio [HR], 3.402; P < .001). After adjusting for baseline parameters of diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), aorta size, deceleration time, and METs, the presence of RWMA after exercise was not predictive of time to AVR (HR, 1.106; P = .81). On the other hand, without forcible entry of RWMA after exercise, LVESD (HR, 1.119; P < .001) and METs (HR, 0.828; P = .006) independently predicted the eventual need for AVR as an outcome. CONCLUSION: The degree of change in wall motion from rest to exercise in those with significant AR was not correlated with CAD, but was correlated with the severity of volume overload and exercise-induced preload changes, as well as the direction of the AR jet.

Commercially available FDA- and CE-approved decellularized nerve conduits offer considerable benefits to patients suffering from a completely transected nerve but they fail to support neural regeneration in gaps > 30 mm. To address this unmet clinical need, current research is focused on biomaterial-based therapies to regenerate dysfunctional neural tissues, specifically damaged peripheral nerve, and spinal cord. Recently, attention has been paid to the capability of graphene-based materials (GBMs) to develop bifunctional scaffolds for promoting nerve regeneration, often via supporting enhanced neural differentiation. The unique features of GBMs have been applied to fabricate an electroactive conductive surface in order to direct stem cells and improve neural proliferation and differentiation. The use of GBMs for nerve tissue engineering (NTE) is considered an emerging technology bringing hope to peripheral nerve injury repair, with some products already in preclinical stages. This review assesses the last six years of research in the field of GBMs application in NTE, focusing on the fabrication and effects of GBMs for neurogenesis in various scaffold forms, including electrospun fibres, films, hydrogels, foams, 3D printing, and bioprinting.","output":"Graphene-Based Materials Prove to Be a Promising Candidate for Nerve Regeneration Following Peripheral Nerve Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early stages of an outbreak, the term pandemic can be used to communicate about infectious disease risk, particularly by those who wish to encourage a large-scale public health response.

METHODS This prospective study compared a 1500-bed adult and 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From 24 February until 10 April 2020, all symptomatic HCWs were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCWs screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, and occupational and nonoccupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Among 1344 HCWs tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Most HCWs (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on 23 March, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment [PPE] for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric settings, respectively (P = .0022). In the adult setting, HCWs more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% vs 15%, P = .046).

Specifically, inflammatory cytokines prolong, while testosterone shortens the heart rateCcorrected QT interval (QTc) via direct electrophysiological effects on cardiomyocytes. Moreover, several studies demonstrated important interplays between inflammation and reduced gonad function in men. We hypothesized that, during inflammatory activation in men, testosterone levels decrease and that this enhances TdP risk by contributing to the overall prolonging effect of inflammation on QTc. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated (1) the levels of sex hormones and their relationship with inflammatory markers and QTc in male patients with different types of inflammatory diseases, during active phase and recovery; and (2) the association between inflammatory markers and sex hormones in a cohort of male patients who developed extreme QTc prolongation and TdP, consecutively collected over 10 years. In men with active inflammatory diseases, testosterone levels were significantly reduced, but promptly normalized in association with the decrease in C\\\\reactive protein and interleukin\\\\6 levels. Reduction of testosterone levels, which also inversely correlated with 17\\\\ estradiol over time, significantly contributed to inflammation\\\\induced QTc prolongation.

In this observational study, we compared two different activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays and a chromogenic anti-Xa assay in COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO in relation to their UFH dosages and acute phase reactants. Materials and Methods The aPTT (optical [aPTT-CS] and/or mechanical [aPTT-STA] clot detection methods were used), anti-Xa, factor VIII (FVIII), antithrombin III (ATIII), and fibrinogen were measured in 342 samples from 7 COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO during their UFH treatment. Dosage of UFH was primarily based on the aPTT-CS with a heparin therapeutic range (HTR) of 50-80s. Associations between different variables were made using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Dosage of UFH was above 35,000IU/24 hours in all patients. aPTT-CS and aPTT-STA were predominantly within the HTR. Anti-Xa was predominantly above the HTR (0.3-0.7 IU/mL) and ATIII concentration was >70% for all patients; mean FVIII and fibrinogen were 606% and 7.5 g/L, respectively. aPTT-CS correlated with aPTT-STA ( r 2 = 0.68) with a bias of 39.3%.

BACKGROUND Regulatory resources help employees manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours on a daily basis. On days when these resources are low, employees may engage in maladaptive self-regulation: more self-undermining (i.e. creating additional obstacles) and less job crafting (i.e. optimizing job demands and resources), which debilitates their work performance. We expected that self-regulation is impaired especially when individuals exhibit low motivation and low ability to regulate their behaviour, that is, when they experience elevated burnout. DESIGN This research used a daily diary design. Nurses responded to a general survey and then completed daily diary surveys in three different moments: before, during and after work for 10 consecutive workdays (total reports N = 732). METHOD A sample of 81 nurses from Polish hospitals and primary healthcare centres completed self-reported questionnaires between January and March 2018. Hypotheses were tested using multilevel modelling in Mplus. RESULTS Momentary self-regulatory capacity before work was negatively related to self-undermining and positively related to job crafting, and it indirectly predicted daily job performance. As hypothesized, these indirect relationships were moderated by general, chronic burnout. We found that only for employees with low levels of burnout, daily self-regulation was linked with better functioning via increased job crafting and decreased self-undermining. CONCLUSION Chronic burnout disturbs day-to-day behaviour regulation. Individuals with elevated burnout symptoms have difficulty to translate momentary boosts in regulatory resources into adaptive strategies that are linked with higher performance. IMPACT Our findings call for better recovery programmes, strategic Human Resource Management practices aimed at reducing factors that deplete daily self-regulatory resources, and finally top-down interventions preventing burnout among employees in the healthcare system.","output":"Burnout and self-regulation failure: A diary study of self-undermining and job crafting among nurses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Serum D-dimer is frequently used to rule out a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a recognised complication following total knee replacement (TKR). TKR is known to cause a rise in D-dimer levels, reducing its specificity. Previous studies have demonstrated that D-dimer remains elevated within 10 days of TKR and therefore should be avoided. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum D-dimer tests are clinically appropriate in identifying VTE when performed within 28 days of TKR. METHODS Case notes for patients who had a serum D-dimer test performed for clinically suspected VTE at  28 days following TKR were retrospectively reviewed for a 6-year period. Demographics, D-dimer result, time after surgery and further radiological investigations were recorded. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent D-dimer tests at  28 days following surgery (median 60 days, range 29-266); 48 of these patients had a positive result. Of these, five had confirmed VTE on radiological investigations. Serum D-dimer was raised in 96% of the patients. Only 10.42% of these patients had confirmed VTE. No patients with negative D-dimers had confirmed VTE. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that serum D-dimer remains raised for at least 28 days and possibly considerably longer following TKR. Serum D-dimer should not be used in patients with clinically suspected VTE within this period because of its unacceptably low specificity of 4.44% and positive predictive value of 10.42%, which can lead to a delay in necessary further radiological investigations, waste of resources and unnecessary exposure to harm.","output":"Serum D-dimer should not be used in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism within 28 days of total knee replacement surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for news media around the globe.

The topical structure of the near-time Facebook coverage changed during various stages of the crisis, with just partial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat lacking in topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage on Corona-related issues and societal concerns. Further, journalistic media covered fake news and conspiracy theories during the crisis, but they consistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false claims circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of journalism during the crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did not find overwhelming signs of systemic dysfunctionalities.

This study aimed to analyze the burden of NCDs attributable to dietary risks in Brazil between 1990-2019. METHODS: Secondary data from the Global Burden of Disease Study were used to estimate the burden attributable to fifteen dietary risks in Brazil. The main sources of data for Brazil were national surveys and international databases. A comparative risk assessment was used to obtain the population attributable fraction. We described the intake of each dietary risk and the distribution of number and rates of deaths and Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to diet by sex, age, state, and year from 1990-2019. RESULTS: Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and neoplasms were the main NCDs attributable to an unhealthy diet. Age-standardized mortality and DALYs rates attributable to unhealthy diet decreased between 1990-2019 (-51.5% and -48.8, respectively). Diet high in red meat and sodium, and low in whole grains were the three main risk factors contributing to the burden of NCDs both in 1990 and 2019.

Many pieces of evidence show that miRNAs affect the viral RNA replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus to mediate changes in the host transcriptome. Many previous studies have been studying the interaction between human cells' miRNA and viral RNA to predict many targets along the viral genome. In this work, via the miRDB database, we determined the target scores of predicted human miRNA to bind with the ss-RNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in general and its spike gene in specific.

METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations were used to describe the data. Standard goodness-of-fit diagnostics and prediction-corrected visual predictive checks were used for model performance assessment. Covariates were included from previously reported models. ER analysis was conducted using logistic regression. RESULTS: SC pertuzumab PK was described adequately by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption; significant covariates included in the final model were albumin, lean body weight, and Asian region; however, these appeared not to be clinically relevant. Trastuzumab concentrations were described adequately by the previous model; there was no evidence of a pertuzumab effect on trastuzumab PK as part of PH FDC SC and higher model-predicted pertuzumab exposure was not associated with differences in pathologic complete response rate or an increased probability of selected grade  3 adverse events of interest.

RECENT FINDINGS Evidence to date does not suggest that people living with HIV (PLWH) have a markedly higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with disparities in the social determinants of health and comorbidities likely having a greater influence. The majority of literature has not supported a higher risk for severe disease among PLWH in Europe and the United States, although a large, population-based study in South Africa reported a higher rate of death due to COVID-19. Higher rates of comorbidities associated with COVID-19 disease severity among PLWH is an urgent concern. COVID-19 is leading to decreased access to HIV prevention services and HIV testing, and worsening HIV treatment access and virologic suppression, which could lead to worsening HIV epidemic control. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is threatening gains against the HIV epidemic, including the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic goals.

METHODS This review is based on guidelines, reviews, meta-analyses, selected publications, and the authors' own experiences from everyday clinical practice. RESULTS Most patients want frank information from their physicians about their condition at all times over the course of their treatment, from the moment of diagnosis to the end of their life. This has no lasting adverse effects, but rather enables patients to take decisions that are appropriate to their stage of disease. Early integration in palliative care can improve patients' quality of life, symptom control, and mood. In helping to manage the last phase of life, the physician often serves as a provider of impulses, or else determines which other types of professional should counsel or support the patient. Patients should be enabled to issue directives that reflect their wishes, as well as to choose representatives who are allowed to speak for them. Consideration should also be given to the patient's emotional legacy, e.g., letters or video messages with personal content. CONCLUSION In the care of patients with life-limiting diseases, more attention should be paid to the management of the last phase of life.

However, significant variations are observed in adherence to social distancing across individuals and countries. Due to the lack of treatment, rapid spread, and prevalence of COVID-19, panic and fear associated with the disease causes great stress. Subsequent effects will be a variation around the coping and mitigation strategies for different individuals following different paths to manage the situation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore how threat and coping appraisal processes work as mechanisms between information and citizens' adherence to COVID-19-related recommendations (ie, how the information sources and social media influence threat and coping appraisal processes with COVID-19 and how the threat and coping appraisal processes influence adherence to policy guidelines). In addition, this study aims to explore how citizens in three different countries (the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea), randomly sampled, are effectively using the mechanisms. METHODS: Randomly sampled online survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from 162 citizens of the United States, 185 of Kuwait, and 71 of South Korea were analyzed, resulting in a total sample size of 418. A seemingly unrelated regression model, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The study's focal estimated effects were compared across the three countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates. RESULTS: The seemingly unrelated regression model estimation results suggested that, overall, the intensity of information source use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the threat appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Furthermore, the intensity of social media use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the coping appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 threat appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 coping appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher intensity of COVID-19 knowledge positively influenced social distancing adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations. Broadly, we found that the United States had better results than South Korea and Kuwait in leveraging the information to threat and coping appraisal to the adherence process, indicating that individuals in countries like the United States and South Korea may be more pragmatic to appraise the situation before making any decisions. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings suggest that the mediation of threat and coping strategies are essential, in varying effects, to shape the information and social media strategies for adherence outcomes. Accordingly, coordinating public service announcements along with information source outlets such as mainstream media (eg, TV and newspaper) as well as social media (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform citizens and, at the same time, deliver balanced messages about the threat and coping appraisal is critical in implementing a staggered social distancing and sheltering strategy.","output":"Threat, Coping, and Social Distance Adherence During COVID-19: Cross-Continental Comparison Using an Online Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunizing hundreds of millions against COVID- 19 through the most extensive national vaccine campaign ever undertaken in the United States has generated significant law and policy challenges.","output":"Legal Challenges Underlying COVID-19 Vaccinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To combat the fast-moving spread of the pandemic we need an equally speedy and powerful tool. On the forefront against COVID-19, for example, AI technology has become a digital armament in the development of new drugs, vaccines, diagnostic methods, and forecasting programs. Patenting these new, nonobvious, and efficient technological solutions is a critical step in fostering the research and development, the huge investments as well as the commercial processes. This article considers the challenges of the current patent law as they apply to AI inventions in general and especially in the age of a global pandemic. The article proposes a novel solution to the hurdles of patenting AI technology by establishing a new patent track model for AI inventions (including the inventions that are made by AI systems and creative AI systems themselves). Unlike other publications promoting either complete abandonment of AI related patents, or advocating to maintain current patent laws, or recommending minor adjustment to patent laws, this article suggests a novel model of separate patent venue solely targeting AI inventions. The argument of this article is based on four pillars: the difficulty of having a patent-eligible subject matter, the hurdle of the \\"blackbox\\" conundrum, the confusion of who is \\"a person of ordinary skills in the art\\" (\\"POSITA\\"), and the criticality of establishing a new AI patent track model, a crucial step, especially during a global epidemic. The first pillar of the argument is the difficulty of having a patent-eligible subject matter in AI inventions. We therefore propose the new AI patent track model that would extend the scope of patent protection to cover creative AI systems, including both the algorithms and trained models, and AI-made inventions in order to, inter alia, incentivize investments of the \\"Multi-Players\\". The second pillar of the argument of the argument is the hurdle posed by the \\"blackbox\\" conundrum of AI systems that undermines the explainability and transparency of the inventions. In analogy to already existing rules applied to microorganism patents that are hard to describe, we advise a depository rule for AI working models to sufficiently describe the otherwise inexplicable inventions. The third pillar arises from the confusion of who is a person of ordinary skills in regard to the nonobviousness assessment of AI inventions. We submit an alternative standard of \\"a skilled person using an ordinary AI tool in the art\\" under the new track model to enable the evaluation of the patentability of complex AI inventions. The fourth pillar of the argument is the criticality of establishing a new AI patent track model on the grounds that the current patent law regime has posed substantial hurdles and uncertainties for patenting AI inventions with regard to almost all patentability requirements. We analyzed each of the requirements to demonstrate that most, if not all, aspects of patent law are not suitable in the AI era;only a revolutionary new patent model specific for AI inventions could solve all the concerns while maintaining the patent incentive for innovations. Our model also suggests an expedited examination with the aid of AI tools and a shortened patent lifetime in light of the fast AI development and technology elimination speed. The article concludes with the hope to harness AI technology for the wellbeing of humanity, in general and especially during tough times in the current COVID-19 era and in general.","output":"Summoning a New Artificial Intelligence Patent Model: In the Age of Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The dentists are the high-risk group of infectious respiratory diseases during dental treatment.

RESULTS: After the COVID-19 outbreak, the total increased numbers of practicing dentists, dental clinics, and hospital dentists in Taiwan were 408, 14, and ?16 from October 2019 to October 2020, respectively. In addition, their increased rates of the corresponding items were 2.76%, 0.21%, and ?0.72%, respectively.

Whilst most children and young people develop mild symptoms, recent reports suggest a novel paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). Case definition and classification are preliminary, treatment is empiric and disease-associated outcomes are unclear. Here, we report 29 patients with PIMS-TS who were diagnosed, admitted and treated in the English North West between March and June 2020.

Here, we utilised a novel proteomic workflow to analyse the immunoglobulin variable (IgV) region composition of anti-PF4 antibodies at the level of the secreted proteome. Serum anti-PF4 IgG antibodies from five patients with VITT triggered by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination were affinity purified by PF4-coupled magnetic beads and sequenced by mass spectrometry.

Moreover, striking stereotypic features were also identified in heavy-chains anti-PF4 antibodies characterised by identical HCDR3 length and homologous sequences. In summary, we unravelled the molecular signature of highly stereotyped clonotypic anti-PF4 antibodies, indicating shared pathways of antibody production in VITT patients.

One of the interesting aspects of the clinical manifestation of the infection is an accompanying ocular surface viral infection, viral conjunctivitis. Although occasional reports of viral conjunctivitis caused by this and the related SARS-CoV virus (causing the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s) are available, the prevalence of this complication among infected people appears low (~1%). This is surprising, considering the recent discovery of the presence of viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in ocular surface tissue. The discrepancy between the theoretically expected high rate of concurrence of viral ocular surface inflammation and the observed relatively low occurrence can be explained by several factors. In this work, we discuss the significance of natural protective factors related to anatomical and physiological properties of the eyes and preventing the deposition of large number of virus-loaded particles on the ocular surface. Specifically, we advance the hypothesis that the standing potential of the eye plays an important role in repelling aerosol particles (microdroplets) from the surface of the eye and discuss factors associated with this hypothesis, possible ways to test it and its implications in terms of prevention of ocular infections.","output":"Natural protection of ocular surface from viral infections - A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

However, the final outcomes of CKD are mainly glomerular sclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and injury, and chronic inflammation. Thus, targeted delivery of drugs to the glomeruli in order to ameliorate glomerular endothelial damage may help alleviate CKD and help enrich our knowledge. The herb tripterygium wilfordii shows therapeutic effect on kidney disease, and celastrol (CLT) is one of its active ingredients but with strong toxicity. Therefore, based on the unique structure and pathological characteristics of the glomerulus, we designed a targeted delivery system named peptides coupled CLT-phospholipid lipid nanoparticles (PC-PLNs) to efficiently deliver CLT to damaged endothelial cells and podocytes in the glomerulus for CKD treatment and research. PC-PLNs could effectively inhibit inflammation, reduce endothelial damage, alleviate CKD severity, and reduce the toxicity of CLT. We also studied the mechanism of CLT in the treatment of nephropathy and found that CLT can increase the level of NO by increasing eNOS while inhibiting the expression of VCAM-1, thus provides an anti-inflammatory effect.

To define a minimum data set for urogynaecological surgical registries. METHODS: Existing registries provide an inventory of items. A modified Delphi approach was used to identify a MDS. At each stage reviewers ranked data points and used free text to comment. The rating used a scale of 0C10 at each review and a traffic light system rated the scores as desirable, highly desirable and mandatory. The scores were collated and reported back to clinicians prior to the further rounds. Outliers were highlighted and reviewers re-assessed prior to repeating the process. A comparison of the MDS was made with published outcomes. RESULTS: Reviewers were from the outcome SIG with emphasis on widespread representation. Fifteen clinicians from eight countries were involved. Four reviewers dissected the existing databases. Eighty data points were considered in four categories, background, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative. Consensus was reached by the third round. Two points were added on review (date of surgery and urodynamics). Three background points, five preoperative points, seven intraoperative points and nine postoperative points were identified giving 24 minimum data points in the final recommendation.

Like many animals, ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, and these variations complicate the use weight as an indicator of health status. To overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female ferrets (n = 39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were weighed daily, while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long-term average. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5-day water regulation period being greater in summer than winter.

DESIGN Retrospective analysis of several outcome measures. SETTING Pulmonary ward at a 358-bed community teaching hospital. METHODS 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme assessed by pulmonary function tests, 6 min walk test and health-related quality of life (HRQL) using the Short Form-36 (SF-36). RESULTS 17 patients with CPFE and 49 patients with COPD were referred to and completed the programme between March 2007 and February 2015. Age, sex, smoking status, body mass index and the Medical Research Council dyspnoea grade were comparable between groups. In the CPFE group, improvement from the start of the programme to the programme end was observed in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (from 1.70.4 to 1.80.4, p=0.034); however, there was no significant improvement in the 6 min walk test (distance, SpO2 nadir and Borg scale on exercise). With regard to HRQL, improvement was observed in physical function (p=0.015) whereas deterioration was observed in social functioning (p=0.044). In the COPD group, significant improvement was observed after the programme in the FEV1, 6 min walk test and 4 of the 8 SF-36 subscales. There was a significant difference in changes in the 6 min walk distance: -16.658.4 in CPFE versus 30.255.6 in COPD (p=0.009). In 2 domains, there was a significant difference in SF-36 scores between groups: vitality, -6.322.4 in CPFE versus 11.321.1 in COPD, p=0.009; and social functioning, -18.834.2 in CPFE versus 5.335.9 in COPD, p=0.027.

Based on a large cross-sectional study (N = 60,799), we compute reference intervals for subpopulations (e.g. males and females) which illustrate that subpopulations may have their own specific and more narrow reference intervals. We further argue that each healthy subject may actually have its own reference interval (subject-specific reference intervals or SSRIs). However, for estimating such SSRIs longitudinal data are required, for which the traditional reference interval estimating methods cannot be used. In this study, a linear quantile mixed model (LQMM) is proposed for estimating SSRIs from longitudinal data. The SSRIs can help clinicians to give a more accurate diagnosis as they provide an interval for each individual patient.

Suicide risk factors include a previous suicide attempt and psychiatric disorders. The highest mortality rate in suicide worldwide is due to depression. Current evidence suggests that suicide etiopathogenesis is associated with neuroinflammation that activates the kynurenine pathway and causes subsequent serotonin depletion and stimulation of glutamate neurotransmission. These changes are accompanied by decreased BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) levels in the brain, which is often linked to impaired neuroplasticity and cognitive deficits. Most suicidal patients have a hyperactive hypothalamusCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA) axis. Epigenetic mechanisms control the above-mentioned neurobiological changes associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide risk could be attenuated by appropriate psychological treatment, electroconvulsive treatment, and drugs: lithium, ketamine, esketamine, clozapine.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 462 patients (479 hips) treated with bipolar HA from January 2010 to January 2020. All patients received posterolateral approaches and a minimum follow-up of at least 2 years regularly. A case-control study was performed to analyze the risk factors of dislocation regarding patient demographics, coexisting diseases, surgical and morphologic features. Multivariable logistic regression analysis for independent risk factors affecting dislocation and dissociation was also performed. Results: The dislocation rate was 5.01%, and the mean time from HA to the first incident of dislocation was 38.75 days. Patient-related factors, including operation side, prosthesis type, and neuromuscular disease, did not differ significantly. Regarding the morphological factors, a significant difference was observed in center-edge (CE) angle, abduction angle, acetabular depth, depth/width ratio, rotation center (RC) to greater trochanter tip (GTT) vertical distance, RC to GTT vertical distance difference, RC to GTT horizontal distance, RC to GTT horizontal distance difference, offset difference, and offset discrepancy. Further, decreased CE angle, increased abduction angle, decreased RC to GTT vertical distance, decreased offset difference and increased offset discrepancy were determined to be independent risk factors of dislocation. The proportion of patients experiencing dissociation was 1.04%. All the implanted femoral heads were smaller than 43 mm, which was determined to be the risk factor of dissociation. Conclusion: Decreased CE angle, RC to GTT vertical distance, offset difference, and increased abduction angle, offset discrepancy were determined to be independent risk factors of HA dislocation.

Challenging this notion, we provide evidence that pre-existing, anti-nucleocapsid antibodies against endemic -coronaviruses and S2 domain-specific anti-spike antibodies against -coronavirus HCoV-OC43 are elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic donors. This finding is particularly pronounced in males and in critically ill patients.

There is also evidence that the association differs between subgroups of children according to age and body weight. Our objective is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental and observational studies on the association between sodium intake and blood pressure in children and adolescents and to assess whether the association differs according to age and body weight. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL databases will be conducted and supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies and unpublished studies. Experimental and observational studies involving children or adolescents between 0 and 18 years of age will be included. The exposure will be dietary sodium intake, estimated using different methods including urinary sodium excretion.

We previously conducted two phase II studies of nivolumab in Japanese patients with SQ (ONO-4538-05) and non-SQ (ONO-4538-06) NSCLC, showing overall response rates (ORRs) (95% CI) of 25.7% (14.2-42.1) and 22.4% (14.5-32.9), respectively, with acceptable toxicity. In this analysis, we more precisely estimated the long-term safety and efficacy in patients with SQ and non-SQ NSCLC by pooling data from these two trials. METHODS SQ (N = 35) and non-SQ (N = 76) NSCLC patients received nivolumab (3 mg/kg, every 2 weeks) until progression or discontinuation. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A pooled analysis of SQ and non-SQ patients was also performed. RESULTS In SQ NSCLC patients, the median OS (95% CI) was 16.3 months (12.4-25.2), and the estimated 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were 71.4% (53.4-83.5), 37.1% (21.6-52.7), and 20.0% (8.8-34.4), respectively.

The current review study seeks to fill these lacunas by illustrating English as a foreign language (EFL) or English as a second language (ESL) teachers' emotion regulation and its' capability to enhance students' academic engagement. Using the existing evidence, the power of ESL/EFL teachers' emotion regulation in predicting their pupils' academic engagement was proved.

The impact of the pandemic and related public health interventions on specialized psychiatric emergency services has not been described. These services provide high intensity care for severely ill patients who are likely to be homeless and underserved. OBJECTIVE: We describe the change in total volume and psychiatric hospitalization rates among three psychiatric emergency services across the United States. METHODS: Change in volumes and hospitalization were assessed for statistical significance using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors model from January 2018 to December 2020. RESULTS: The pandemics impact on volumes and hospitalization varied by site. In Denver (CO), there was a statistically significant 9% decrease in overall volumes, although an 18% increase in hospitalizations was not significant. In New York City (NY), there was a significant 7% decrease in volumes as well as a significant 6% decrease in hospitalizations. In Portland (OR), volumes decreased by 4% and hospitalizations increased by 6% although differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: There has been a decrease in volume at these service after the pandemic, but there are substantial variations in the magnitude of change and demand for hospitalization by region. These findings suggest a need to understand where patients in crisis are seeking care and how systems of care must adapt to changing utilization in the pandemic era.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychiatric Emergency Service Volume and Hospital Admissions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The essential oil (EO) composition of Satureja plants is highly variable. Recent studies suggest that there is an even difference in the EO composition from different plant organs within the same plant. This study aims to examine the chemical profile of EOs and the micromorphological characteristics of different organs of three Satureja species. The relationship between the number of glandular trichomes and EOs profile and relative yield is also investigated. Individuals from five populations were visualized using a scanning electron microscope, while EOs of leaves, calyces, corollas, and whole aerial parts were isolated using simultaneous distillation and extraction and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Three types of glandular trichomes were detected. Peltate trichomes were present on all plant organs of studied species, while two types of capitate trichomes show different organ and species preferences. The EOs profiles differed across the plant parts, but showed a species specific composition. Univariate and multivariate statistics were used to show a correlation between the peltate trichomes and EO yield, and chemophenetic significance of EO profiles.","output":"Essential Oil Composition and Micromorphological Traits of Satureja montana L., S. subspicata Bartel ex Vis., and S. kitaibelii Wierzb.

Of major public health concern is the perinatal mental health impacts that may occur during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is essential to explore the symptom experience and predictors of mental health status, including the relationship between media use and mental health. Materials and Methods: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the experiences of pregnant and postpartum women (n = 524) in the United States in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online observational study collected psychosocial quantitative and qualitative survey data in adult pregnant and postpartum (up to 6 months postdelivery) women in April-June 2020. Results: Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate predictors of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The most common predictors were job insecurity, family concerns, eating comfort foods, resilience/adaptability score, sleep, and use of social and news media. Qualitative themes centered on pervasive uncertainty and anxiety; grief about losses; gratitude for shifting priorities; and use of self-care methods including changing media use. Conclusions: This study provides information to identify risk for anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms in perinatal women during acute public health situations. Women with family and job concerns and low resilience/adaptability scores seem to be at high risk of psychological sequelae. Although use of social media is thought to improve social connectedness, our results indicate that increased media consumption is related to increased anxiety symptoms.","output":"Depression, Anxiety, Resilience, and Coping: The Experience of Pregnant and New Mothers During the First Few Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modification of host-cell ionic content is a significant issue for viruses, as several viral proteins displaying ion channel activity, named viroporins, have been identified. Viroporins interact with different cellular membranes and self-assemble forming ion conductive pores. In general, these channels display mild ion selectivity, and, eventually, membrane lipids play key structural and functional roles in the pore. Viroporins stimulate virus production through different mechanisms, and ion channel conductivity has been proved particularly relevant in several cases. Key stages of the viral cycle such as virus uncoating, transport and maturation are ion-influenced processes in many viral species. Besides boosting virus propagation, viroporins have also been associated with pathogenesis. Linking pathogenesis either to the ion conductivity or to other functions of viroporins has been elusive for a long time.

Making visible how ideology operates is necessary for solving health inequities grounded in inequities of resources and power. However, discerning ideology is difficult because it operates implicitly. It is not necessarily explicit in ones stated aims or beliefs. Philosopher Slavoj ?i?ek conceptualizes ideology as a belief in overarching unity or harmony that obfuscates immanent tension within a system. Drawing from ?i?eks conceptualization of ideology, we identify what may be considered as symptoms of ideological practice: (1) the recurrent nature of a problem, and (2) the implicit externalization of the cause. Our aim is to illustrate a method to identify ideological operation in health programs on the basis of its symptoms, using three case studies of persistent global health problems: inequitable access to vaccines, antimicrobial resistance, and health inequities across racialized communities. Our proposed approach for identifying ideology allows one to identify ideological practices that could not be identified by particular ideological contents. It also safeguards us from an illusory search for an emancipatory content. Critiquing ideology in general reveals possibilities that are otherwise kept invisible and unimaginable, and may help us solve recalcitrant problems such as health inequities.","output":"Towards Solving Health Inequities: A Method to Identify Ideological Operation in Global Health Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new 2021 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure include a new terminology for heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 41-49%.

For this form of HF there are now for the first time recommendations for treatment with the standard medications, which are also used for HFrEF. Also new is a class I recommendation for the treatment of HFrEF patients with or without diabetes mellitus with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i).

Controls can have well-known counterintuitive effects on endemic infections, including the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected, but also large outbreaks during control resulting from accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are poorly understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without control, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, counting from the time that control started, than without any controlCthe divorce effect. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in a variety of models when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches, and in the context of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at COVID-19.","output":"After the honeymoon, the divorce: Unexpected outcomes of disease control measures against endemic infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New facilities of the 2020s, such as the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), will be relevant through at least the 2030s.

However, despite the immense cell therapy potential, relatively few clinical trials evaluating iPSC-technology have actually translated into interventional, clinically applied treatment regimens. Herein, our aim was to determine trends in globally conducted clinical trials involving iPSCs. Data were derived both from well-known registries recording clinical trials from across the globe, and databases from individual countries. Comparisons were firstly drawn between observational and interventional studies before the latter was further analyzed in terms of therapeutic and nontherapeutic trials. Our main observations included global distribution, purpose, target size, and types of disorder relevant to evaluated trials. In terms of nontherapeutic trials, the USA conducted the majority, a large average number of participants187was included in the trials, and studies on circulatory system disorders comprised a slightly higher proportion of total studies. Conversely, Japan was the frontrunner in terms of conducting therapeutic trials, and the average number of participants was much lower, at roughly 29.

We aimed to develop a risk score model for in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that was robust across hospitals and used clinical factors that are readily available and measured standardly across hospitals. In this retrospective observational study, we developed a risk score model using data collected by trained abstractors for patients in 20 diverse hospitals across the state of Michigan (Mi-COVID19) who were discharged between March 5, 2020 and August 14, 2020. Patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during hospitalization or were discharged with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) were included. We employed an iterative forward selection approach to consider the inclusion of 145 potential risk factors available at hospital presentation. Model performance was externally validated with patients from 19 hospitals in the Mi-COVID19 registry not used in model development. We shared the model in an easy-to-use online application that allows the user to predict in-hospital mortality risk for a patient if they have any subset of the variables in the final model. Two thousand one hundred and ninety-three patients in the Mi-COVID19 registry met our inclusion criteria. The derivation and validation sets ultimately included 1690 and 398 patients, respectively, with mortality rates of 19.6% and 18.6%, respectively. The average age of participants in the study after exclusions was 64 years old, and the participants were 48% female, 49% Black, and 87% non-Hispanic. Our final model includes the patient's age, first recorded respiratory rate, first recorded pulse oximetry, highest creatinine level on day of presentation, and hospital's COVID-19 mortality rate. No other factors showed sufficient incremental model improvement to warrant inclusion. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the derivation and validation sets were .796 (95% confidence interval, .767C.826) and .829 (95% confidence interval, .782C.876) respectively.

Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and spatial statistics, we observed that lysosomal exocytosis is not random at the adhesive part of the plasma membrane of RPE1 cells but clustered at different scales. Although the rate of exocytosis is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton, neither interfering with actin or microtubule dynamics by drug treatments alters its spatial organization. Exocytosis events partially co-appear at focal adhesions (FAs) and their clustering is reduced upon removal of FAs. Changes in membrane tension following a hypo-osmotic shock or treatment with methyl--cyclodextrin was found to increase clustering. To investigate the link between FAs and membrane tension, cells were cultured on adhesive ring-shaped micropatterns, which allows to control the spatial organization of FAs. By using a combination of TIRFM and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) microscopy, we revealed the existence of a radial gradient in membrane tension. By changing the diameter of micropatterned substrates, we further showed that this gradient as well as the extent of exocytosis clustering can be controlled.

The primary outcome was clinical improvement within 28 days, and the secondary outcome measures were time to hospital discharge, all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, the temporal trend in 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positivity and the frequency of adverse drug events within 28 days from the start of medication. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial and data from 100 patients (48 patients in the treatment arm and 52 patients in the control arm) were analyzed.

Firstly, we performed all-atom microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, which highlight the stability of the ligands in the M(pro) active site over the duration of the trajectories. We also invoked PELE Monte Carlo simulations which indicate that both hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside preferentially interact with the M(pro) active site and known allosteric sites. For further validation, we performed an in vitro enzymatic activity assay that demonstrated that hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside inhibit M(pro) activity in a dose-dependent manner at biologically relevant (M) concentrations. However, both ligands are much less potent than the well-known covalent antiviral GC376, which was used as a positive control in our experiments.

We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy. FINDINGS: Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 094, 95% UI 062-124) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 088, 066-111) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 088, 060-143) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster. INTERPRETATION: Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

Evidence so far has documented a heightened risk of mortality to people with chronic conditions. There is a dearth of evidence regarding chronic disease patients intention and practice on the preventive measures. This study tried to fill this gap by assessing the intention to practice and practice on personal preventive measures (PPMs) among adults with chronic conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Ethiopia among 806 adults with chronic conditions by employing a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS software version 25. Binary logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with intention and practice. Level of statistical significance was declared at a P-value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: The study showed that 52% (95% CI=47.61C54.80) and 76.3% (95% CI=73.36C79.24) of adults with chronic conditions were intending to practice and had ever practiced the personal preventive measures. Participants subjective norm (SN) (AOR=4.94; 95% CI=3.49C6.96) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) (AOR=4.13; 95% CI=2.69C6.34) were the factors associated with their intention. Good knowledge and a positive attitude were found to be significant factors associated with the participants actual practice of the PPMs among other independent factors. CONCLUSION: Around half of the participants were intending to practice PPMs, and three-quarters had good practice on the PPMs against COVID-19. Interventions targeted to improve intention and practice on the PPMs need to take into account improving knowledge and attitude, and build positive subjective norms and heighten the confidence to control the preventive behaviors.","output":"Intention and Practice on Personal Preventive Measures Against the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Adults with Chronic Conditions in Southern Ethiopia: A Survey Using the Theory of Planned Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The present study was performed to get a better insight in the incidence of anastomotic leakage leading to reintervention when using the C-seal: a biodegradable sheath that protects the stapled colorectal anastomosis from leakage.

Therefore, it is beneficial to identify and implement interventions to help manage ED as early as possible. Intracavernosal injection therapy (ICI) is an option to treat ED but requires training patients to self-inject medication into the corpus of the penis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sexual Rehabilitation Clinic (SRC) was closed resulting in delays in ICI training. In order to address this problem, we transitioned the training strategy from in-person visits to virtual care. Objective This study describes our experience delivering ICI training virtually during the pandemic. Methods Patients agreed to participate in the virtual training via web-based teleconference software and were assigned to read educational material and view an instructional video prior to the appointment, as per our in-patient clinic process. The virtual training sessions included review of anatomy, mechanisms of action of the medication(s), side effects, and management thereof. Preparation of the syringe and the process of injecting a prosthetic penis were demonstrated. Principles of medication titration were reviewed. Remaining questions were answered and virtual or telephone follow-up was scheduled. Results Within 7 weeks of closure, we pivoted to offer our Sexual Health Clinic virtually. From July 2020 to May 2021, 50 patients had virtual appointments booked for ICI training, 49 of whom completed virtual ICI training (1 pt could not fill his prescription and didn't rebook). We learned early on that having proper visual props (medication vial, syringe, penis model and instruction booklet) and good camera positioning to clearly see the medication preparation and injection technique were instrumental for successful training. Virtual health appointments lasted 35 to 45 minutes compared to 60 minutes in-person, reducing training times by 15 to 25 minutes per patient. At the end of each session, participants verbally affirmed that the sessions were clear and easy to follow and that learning ICI from the comfort of home, without the stress of travel, and the cost of parking were beneficial aspects of virtual health. Another benefit from the clinic perspective was the elimination of clinic preparation pre-visit and post-visit cleaning. A post-session survey answered by 21 patients demonstrated that 80.9% were satisfied with the virtual teaching and that 52.3% were very confident or extremely confident about using ICI injections. 76% of respondents had used ICI within the last month at the time of the survey. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was an impetus for us to change our standard of practice for ICI training. Despite our concern that patients would not gain enough confidence if not seen in person, this was not the case. Benefits of virtual health included shorter clinic times, removal of geographic and financial barriers, and ability to provide timely training for ICI injections. Based on our positive experience delivering ICI training virtually, we plan to offer the option of in-person or virtual appointments when COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.

As such, RBD has become the major target for vaccine development, whereas RBD-specific antibodies are pursued as therapeutics. Here, we report the development and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific V(H)H/nanobody (Nb) from immunized alpacas. Seven RBD-specific Nbs with high stability were identified using phage display. They bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with affinity K(D) ranging from 2.6 to 113 nM, and six of them can block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The fusion of the Nbs with IgG1 Fc resulted in homodimers with greatly improved RBD-binding affinities (K(D) ranging from 72.7 pM to 4.5 nM) and nanomolar RBD-ACE2 blocking abilities. Furthermore, the fusion of two Nbs with nonoverlapping epitopes resulted in hetero-bivalent Nbs, namely, aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with significantly higher RBD binding affinities (K(D) of 59.2 pM and 0.25 nM) and greatly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The 50% neutralization doses of aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7 were 1.22 ng/ml (0.043 nM) and 3.18 ng/ml (0.111 nM), respectively. These high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 blocking Nbs could be further developed into therapeutics, as well as diagnostic reagents for COVID-19. IMPORTANCE To date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous loss of human life and economic output worldwide. Although a few COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in several countries, the development of effective therapeutics, including SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies, remains critical. Due to their small size (13 to 15 kDa), high solubility, and stability, Nbs are particularly well suited for pulmonary delivery and more amenable to engineer into multivalent formats than the conventional antibody. Here, we report a series of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nbs isolated from immunized alpaca and two engineered hetero-bivalent Nbs.

Managing long-term therapy conditions, like hypertension, became increasingly difficult due to limited access to care. During these unprecedented times, two community pharmacies collaborated with a school of pharmacy to develop a new remote program to encourage patient centered disease state management. Objectives: The primary objective was to describe patient perceptions of participating in a student-led, remote hypertension education program. The secondary objective was to gain insight on perceptions of the program's impact on current lifestyle. Methods: Second- and third-year pharmacy students worked with faculty preceptors to develop and remotely deliver an 8-week curriculum. During each call, students educated on a topic and set S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) goals. After completing the program, participants were interviewed regarding their experience. This study was a qualitative design using semi-structured interviews. Participants in the program were interviewed by trained investigators. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded to address study outcomes. Results: A total of 12 participant interviews were conducted with all participants 50 years of age or older and a majority having a diagnosis of hypertension for greater than 20 years. From the interviews, six dominant themes were identified. Themes were: (a) students were knowledgeable, professional, and engaged;(b) participants felt comfortable communicating with the students and developed a positive relationship;(c) participants expressed having a positive impact on the students' education;(d) the program was organized;(e) participants reported positive lifestyle changes or reinforced habits that they plan to continue, and (f) the remote nature of the program was convenient, but face-to-face interaction was missed.

PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, since 2013C2014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets. At present, differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is essential to control viral diarrheas in US swine. Cell culture-adapted US PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) strains have been isolated and propagated by us and in several other laboratories. TC-PDCoV strains will be useful to develop serologic assays and to evaluate if serial cell-culture passage attenuates TC-PDCoV as a potential vaccine candidate strain.

Daily sampling was carried out during 3 days of storage. RESULTS The quality of RBCS from both groups was largely the same, except for haemolysis and red blood cell fragility, which were more pronounced in the pathogen-reduced group. This finding limited the shelf life of pathogen-reduced RBCS to 14 days. Lymphocyte viability was significantly reduced after both treatments. Proliferation of lymphocytes after pathogen reduction was reduced to the detection limit, while low-level proliferation was observed in gamma-irradiated samples.

Microplastic inhalation caused by reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes was also tested. Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h). N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint.

DISCUSSION: DUDE is tailored to diminish the incidence of NSSI and to prevent its possible long-term consequences (e.g., suicidality) in adolescents. It is easy to access in the school environment. Furthermore, DUDE is a comprehensive approach to improve mental health via improved emotion regulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) DRKS00018945.

However, PDPs are 23mer peptides, which is not optimal for their use in therapy due to potential stability and immunogenicity issues. Therefore, we present here the sequence optimization of the 23mer PDP to a 5mer peptide, involving several attempts considering structure-based virtual screening, high throughput screening and peptide sequence optimization.

As neoadjuvant therapy has become a standard for triple negative and HER2+ EBC, it focusses on luminal EBC. RECENT FINDINGS Gene expression assays have become standard of care in luminal EBC, at least for patients with node negative disease. Two prospective randomized clinical trials, TAILORx (Oncotype DX) and MINDACT (MammaPrint) have presented additional analyses underlining the clinical utility of the tests. In times of COVID-19, immunohistochemically determined ER, PR, and Ki67 and early Ki67 response to endocrine therapy can be used to safely allocate patients for preoperative endocrine therapy and delay surgeries if resources are scarce. In patients with luminal high-risk disease, adding a CDK 4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib) improves patient outcome already after short-term follow-up. SUMMARY Determination of recurrence risk will remain important in luminal EBC for optimal therapy decisions.

According to this view, the pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and heterogeneous with different patterns of antenatal stress (endotypes) that combine with varying postnatal insults and might distinctively damage the development of airways, lung parenchyma, interstitium, lymphatic system, and pulmonary vasculature. This results in different clinical phenotypes of BPD. There is no clear consensus on which are the endotypes of prematurity but the combination of clinical information with placental and bacteriological data enables the identification of two main pathways leading to birth before 32 weeks of gestation: (1) infection/inflammation and (2) dysfunctional placentation. Regarding BPD phenotypes, the following have been proposed: parenchymal, peripheral airway, central airway, interstitial, congestive, vascular, and mixed phenotype.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted in China and abroad from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Socio-demographic information was collected and knowledge scores, practice scores, anxiety scores and perceived risk were calculated. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used to identify possible associations. RESULTS: We included 9,764 individuals in this study, and 156 (1.6%) were from Hubei Province. The average knowledge score was 4.7 (standard deviation, 1.0) (scored on a 6-point scale); 96.1% maintained hand hygiene, and 90.3% of participants had varying levels of anxiety. People in Hubei Province were the most anxious, followed by those in Beijing and Shanghai. People who had experienced risk behaviors did not pay more attention to wearing masks and hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The public had high awareness on knowledge of COVID-19 outbreak, and a high proportion of people practiced good hand hygiene behavior. Many people claimed anxiety, especially in heavily affected areas during pandemic, suggesting the importance of closing the gap between risk awareness and good practice and conduct psychological counseling to public and patients.","output":"Public Awareness, Individual Prevention Practice, and Psychological Effect at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracerebral infection of Lewis (LEW) inbred rats with the neurotropic strain of the murine coronavirus JHM (JHMV) frequently results in a monophasic paralytic disease.

Here, we phenotypically as well as functionally characterised this T cell subset after isolation from the central nervous system (CNS). Using JHMV-infected target cells, MHC class I restricted, cytotoxic T lymphocytes were demonstrated to be present in the leukocyte fraction from the CNS of both, susceptible LEW and disease-resistant BN rats. However, compared to infected, but healthy BN rats, diseased LEW rats generated an enhanced cytotoxic immune response which became most prominent at the maximum of neurological disease. Recently published observations from our laboratory demonstrated a strong virus-specific antibody response in the CNS of BN rats. In LEW rats, however, the response was delayed and of low magnitude. This suggests, that consequences of cytotoxic T lymphocyte action in JHMV-infected CNS tissue largely depend on the efficacy of an accompanying virus-specific humoral immune response.","output":"Phenotypic and functional characterization of CD8+ T lymphocytes from the central nervous system of rats with coronavirus JHM induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to quantify the financial impact of COVID-19 on radiology departments, and to describe the structure of both volume and revenue recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiology studies from a large academic health system were retrospectively studied from the first 33 weeks of 2020. Volume and work relative value unit (wRVU) data were aggregated on a weekly basis for three periods: pre-surge (weeks 1-9), surge (10-19) and recovery (20-33), and analyzed compared to the pre-COVID baseline stratified by modality, specialty, patient service location, and facility type. Mean and median wRVU per study were used as a surrogate for case complexity. RESULTS: During the pandemic surge, case volumes fell 57%, while wRVUs fell by 69% relative to the pre-COVID-19 baseline. Mean wRVU per study was 1.13 in the pre-surge period, 1.03 during the surge, and 1.19 in the recovery. Categories with the greatest mean complexity declines were radiography (-14.7%), cardiothoracic imaging (-16.2%), and community hospitals overall (-15.9%). Breast imaging (+6.5%), interventional (+5.5%), and outpatient (+12.1%) complexity increased. During the recovery, significant increases in complexity were seen in cardiothoracic (0.46 to 0.49), abdominal (1.80 to 1.91), and neuroradiology (2.46 to 2.56) at stand-alone outpatient centers with similar changes at community hospitals. At academic hospitals, only breast imaging complexity remained elevated (1.32 from 1.17) during the recovery. CONCLUSION: Reliance on volume alone underestimates the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as there was a disproportionate loss in high-RVU studies. However, increased complexity of outpatient cases has stabilized overall losses during the recovery.","output":"Sources of Revenue Loss and Recovery in Radiology Practices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global threat with an increasing number of infections.

The present study explores the antiparasitic potential of three anthelmintic plants (Butea monosperma, Vitex negundo and Catharanthus roseus (L.) G.Don) against H. contortus taking albendazole as the standard. In silico molecular docking and pharmacokinetic prediction studies were conducted with known bioactive molecules of these plants (palasonin, vinblastine, vincristine, betulinic acid and ursolic acid) against Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH) and tubulin molecules of the parasite. Methanolic extracts of these herbs were fractionated (hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and methanol) and used in in vitro larvicidal studies. Based on the in vitro data, two herbal prototypes were developed and clinically tested. All the 5 ligand molecules showed better binding affnity for GDH and tubulin protein as compared with albendazole and shared similar binding site in the core of the GDH hexamer with slight variations. Albendazole approximately stacked against GLY190A residue, showing hydrophobic interactions with PRO157A and a Pi-cation electrostatic interaction with ARG390 along with four hydrogen bonds. Vincristine formed 2 pi-anionic electrostatic bonds with ASP158 of B and C subunits alongwith hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction and an additional pi-anion electrostatic interaction at ASP158A for vinblastine. Albendazole bound to -tubulin next to colchicine site whereas vinblastine is bound at the nearby laulimalide/peloruside site of the dimer. Betulinic acid showed lateral interaction between the H2CH3 loop of one alpha subunit and H10 of the adjacent alpha subunit of two tubulin dimers. Ursolic acid and palasonin bound at the intradimer N site of microtubulin involving the H1CH7 and H1CH2 zone, respectively. The in vitro studies demonstrated good dose dependent anthelmintic potential. Both the prototypes were quite efficacious in clearing the infection, keeping it to a minimal for more than 5 months, probably, through direct anthelmintic effect through GDH, tubulin depolymerization and uncoupling as well as indirectly through immunomodulation along with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.","output":"In silico to In vivo development of a polyherbal against Haemonchus contortus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification that regulates important cellular functions.

METHODS Parents of 348 French children under 6 years of age completed an online survey launched during the first days of the initial COVID-19-related confinement. They were asked to indicate whether their kids increased, decreased or maintained their physical activity level, time spent in sedentary behaviors, and sleep time. Information regarding the configuration of their home environment (access to outdoor facilities, implantation area) and lifestyle habits (solitary activity, parents' solicitation; nap time; night waking episodes and night duration) were also collected. RESULTS A total of 25.0% of the children were reported to decrease, 24.7% maintained and 50.3% increase their physical activity during the confinement. Greater proportions of kids who had access to a collective (51.4%) or individual (53.7%) outdoor area increased their physical activity. Regardless of the housing situation (urban, suburban or rural) or access to outdoor facilities, the majority of children increased their screen time (60.4%). Two-thirds (66.7%) of parents reported nap time remained unchanged for their kids. Fifty-one percent of parents admitted a link between teleworking and their kids' screen time. CONCLUSIONS Health behaviors were differentially impacted in very young kids during a confinement period.

METHODS To determine whether depth of anesthesia as measured by bispectral index (BIS) affects EA, 40 ASA physical status I to II children aged 2 to 8 years undergoing ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in a blinded randomized controlled trial of low-normal (40-45, deep) versus high-normal (55-60, light) anesthesia. To distinguish transient irritability from severe EA, the primary outcome was first-stage postanesthesia care unit (PACU I) peak Pediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, with secondary outcomes of PAED and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores at emergence, postoperative fentanyl dose, emergence time, and discharge time. Subjects received a standard anesthesia protocol with oral midazolam followed by mask induction with sevoflurane 8%, fentanyl 1 to 1.5 g/kg IV (then as needed), neuromuscular blockade, and endotracheal intubation.

However, it is unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies across different surfaces. To address these questions, we conduct systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human-exhaled gas on surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions. The characteristics of these residues change significantly across surface types. Specifically, surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues, while stainless steel, plastic, and glass surfaces form residues from a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at 40% relative humidity. Lowering humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity level enhances it. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition. Our findings can also be extended to other viruses transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV, flu viruses, etc.), and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting viral transmission.","output":"Droplet evaporation residue indicating SARS-COV-2 survivability on surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Studies evaluating BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine safety excluded subjects with a previous history of COVID-19 infection.

The UK mass vaccination program commenced on December 8, 2020, vaccinating groups of the population deemed to be most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the early vaccine administration coverage and outcome data across an integrated care system in North West London, leveraging a unique population-level care data set. Vaccine effectiveness of a single dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were compared. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study identified 2,183,939 individuals eligible for COVID-19 vaccination between December 8, 2020, and February 24, 2021, within a primary, secondary, and community care integrated care data set. These data were used to assess vaccination hesitancy across ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic deprivation measures (Pearson product-moment correlations); investigate COVID-19 transmission related to vaccination hubs; and assess the early effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination (after a single dose) using time-to-event analyses with multivariable Cox regression analysis to investigate if vaccination independently predicted positive SARS-CoV-2 in those vaccinated compared to those unvaccinated. RESULTS: In this study, 5.88% (24,332/413,919) of individuals declined and did not receive a vaccination. Black or Black British individuals had the highest rate of declining a vaccine at 16.14% (4337/26,870). There was a strong negative association between socioeconomic deprivation and rate of declining vaccination (r=C0.94; P=.002) with 13.5% (1980/14,571) of individuals declining vaccination in the most deprived areas compared to 0.98% (869/9609) in the least. In the first 6 days after vaccination, 344 of 389,587 (0.09%) individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate increased to 0.13% (525/389,243) between days 7 and 13, before then gradually falling week on week. At 28 days post vaccination, there was a 74% (hazard ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.35) and 78% (hazard ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.18-0.27) reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for individuals that received the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, respectively, when compared with unvaccinated individuals. A very low proportion of hospital admissions were seen in vaccinated individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (288/389,587, 0.07% of all patients vaccinated) providing evidence for vaccination effectiveness after a single dose. CONCLUSIONS: There was no definitive evidence to suggest COVID-19 was transmitted as a result of vaccination hubs during the vaccine administration rollout in North West London, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 or becoming hospitalized after vaccination has been demonstrated to be low in the vaccinated population. This study provides further evidence that a single dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is effective at reducing the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 up to 60 days across all age groups, ethnic groups, and risk categories in an urban UK population.","output":"Assessing COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Effectiveness Through the North West London Vaccination Program: Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an acute infectious disease caused by SFTS virus and characterized by a high case fatality rate. Currently, there is no effective therapy for the disease.

METHODS: Vero cells were pre-treated with interferons (IFNs) , , and  alone and in combination with ribavirin drugs and inoculated with SFTS virus. Three days later, supernatants were harvested and subjected to virus titration. An unpaired t-test was used for statistical analysis of the drugs effects. RESULTS: While the effects of IFN at high concentrations were slightly weaker than those of the other IFNs, all IFNs showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects. The combined usage of IFNs with ribavirin at 90 % effective concentrations showed large inhibitory effects, with over a 3 log(10) reduction in viral titers. CONCLUSIONS: The combined usage of one of type-I/II IFNs with ribavirin drastically reduced SFTS virus infection and therefore may be useful in the treatment of SFTS.","output":"Combination effects of ribavirin and interferons on severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhoea among growing pigs (8C13 weeks old) is a significant problem in many herds.

We also tested propositions regarding the potential differential predictors of compliance behavior, differentiating between cognitive (i.e., attitudes toward the CDC guidelines) and affective (i.e., COVID-specific worry) predictors. Using a longitudinal dataset of 419 U.S. workers, we did not find significant differences among the levels of CDC guidelines enactment across three latent classes, representing a range of economic vulnerability. We found that cognitive attitudes were a significantly stronger predictor of compliance with CDC guidelines for workers in the most economically secure class, whereas worry was a significantly stronger predictor of compliance for the most vulnerable counterpart.

An important unanswered question is what levels of T cell and antibody responses are sufficient to protect from the infection. METHODS: In 5340 Moscow residents, we evaluated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG titers and frequencies of the T cells specific to the membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, using IFN ELISpot assay. Additionally, we evaluated the fractions of virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells using intracellular staining of IFN and IL2 followed by flow cytometry. We analyzed the COVID-19 rates as a function of the assessed antibody and T cell responses, using the Kaplan-Meyer estimator method, for up to 300 days post-inclusion. RESULTS: We showed that T cell and antibody responses are closely interconnected and are commonly induced concurrently. Magnitudes of both responses inversely correlated with infection probability. Individuals positive for both responses demonstrated the highest levels of protectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A comparable level of protection was found in individuals with antibody response only, while the T cell response by itself granted only intermediate protection. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the contribution of the virus-specific antibodies to protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infection is more pronounced than that of the T cells.

The current COVID-19 pandemic makes no exception, and temperature has been suggested to play a role on the viability and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate viral fusion. Studying the effect of temperature on the receptor-Spike interaction, we observed a significant and stepwise increase in RBD-ACE2 affinity at low temperatures, resulting in slower dissociation kinetics. This translated into enhanced interaction of the full Spike to ACE2 receptor and higher viral attachment at low temperatures. Interestingly, the RBD N501Y mutation, present in emerging variants of concern (VOCs) that are fueling the pandemic worldwide, bypassed this requirement. This data suggests that the acquisition of N501Y reflects an adaptation to warmer climates, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.","output":"Impact of temperature on the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 Spike for ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social isolation affects one in five older adults, significantly increases the risk of premature death from all causes and is associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicide.

The mobility rate is estimated using the proposed Dawson-like function, which requires the Origin-Destination Matrix data. Assuming only susceptible, unapparent infected, and recovered individuals travel near Eid Al-Fitr, the rendered model is well-depicting the actual data at that time, giving either a significant spike or decline in the number of active cases due to the mass exodus.

Data regarding clinical profile of hospitalised elderly with COVID-19 in Indonesia were still lacking. Older people are at-risk population in the pandemic, whom we should pay attention to.MethodsThis single centre descriptive study utilised complete data of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in Indonesia's national general hospital from April to late August 2020. The data consisted of clinical characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, multimorbidity, and mortality outcome.ResultsAmong elderly patients (n=44), a majority of patients were aged 60-69 years (68%), were male (66%), and had no history of close contact with COVID-19 patient (86%). The most common symptoms were fever, cough and shortness of breath (classic symptoms of COVID-19), whereas the most common chronic diseases were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malignancy. Multimorbidity was only found in 14% of patients, all of whom remained alive following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death rate among elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in this study was 23%, and male older adults contributed to 90% of death cases.ConclusionMale patients dominated both confirmed cases and death cases among elderly with COVID-19. Classic symptoms of COVID-19 were only found in about half of the study patients. Non-survivors had higher percentage of the classic symptoms of COVID-19 than survivors. Atypical COVID-19 presentations are possible in older adults.

Since no specific medication is available to treat COVID-19, designing of new drug is important and essential. In this regard, in silico method plays an important role, as it is rapid and cost effective compared to the trial and error methods using experimental studies. Natural products are safe and easily available to treat coronavirus affected patients, in the present alarming situation. In this paper five phytochemicals, which belong to flavonoid and anthraquinone subclass, have been selected as small molecules in molecular docking study of spike protein of SARS-CoV2 with its human receptor ACE2 molecule. Their molecular binding sites on spike protein bound structure with its receptor have been analyzed. From this analysis, hesperidin, emodin and chrysin are selected as competent natural products from both Indian and Chinese medicinal plants, to treat COVID-19. Among them, the phytochemical hesperidin can bind with ACE2 protein and bound structure of ACE2 protein and spike protein of SARS-CoV2 noncompetitively. The binding sites of ACE2 protein for spike protein and hesperidin, are located in different parts of ACE2 protein. Ligand spike protein causes conformational change in three-dimensional structure of protein ACE2, which is confirmed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. This compound modulates the binding energy of bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein. This result indicates that due to presence of hesperidin, the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment becomes unstable. As a result, this natural product can impart antiviral activity in SARS CoV2 infection. The antiviral activity of these five natural compounds are further experimentally validated with QSAR study.","output":"Molecular docking study of potential phytochemicals and their effects on the complex of SARS-CoV2 spike protein and human ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main goal of this targeted agenda program (TAP) was the establishment of an international network that would be able to advise on how to improve education and training for chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN)) responders.

Workers' personal resilience can be an important factor in preserving psychological health, but how this exactly works in high stakes situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires further exploration. Similarly, the role of team social climate as contributor to individual psychological health seems obvious, but how it exactly prevents workers from developing depressive complaints in prolonged crises remains under investigated. The present paper therefore applies conservation of resources theory to study the relationships between resilience, team social climate, and depressive complaints, specifically focusing on worries about infections as an important explanatory mechanism. Based on questionnaire data of 1126 workers from five hospitals in the Netherlands during the second peak of the pandemic, this paper estimates a moderated-mediation model. This model shows that personal resilience negatively relates to depressive complaints (beta = -0.99, p &lt; 0.001, 95%CI = -1.45--0.53), partially as personal resilience is negatively associated with worries about infections (beta = -0.42, p &lt; 0.001, 95%CI = -0.50--0.33) which in turn are positively related to depressive complaints (beta = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 0.31-1.19). Additionally, team social climate is associated with a lower effect of worries about being infected and infecting others on depressive complaints (beta = -0.88, p = 0.03, 95% CI = -1.68--0.09). These findings suggest that resilience can be an important individual level resource in preventing depressive complaints. Moreover, the findings imply that hospitals have an important responsibility to maintain a good team social climate to shield workers from infection related worries building up to depressive complaints.","output":"We're Not Gonna Fall: Depressive Complaints, Personal Resilience, Team Social Climate, and Worries about Infections among Hospital Workers during a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) has become a global crisis.

Social distancing may generate stress, anxiety, and depression. Understanding the psychosocial consequences of COVID19 during social distancing may help decision-makers to take suitable decisions that help in increasing awareness. Evaluate the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 pandemic during the social distancing period and explore the relationship between social media use and psychological stress during COVID-19 outbreak among Najran city population. Research design is descriptive correlational research design. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A snowball sampling technique, was used to recruit participants live in Najran city during the COVID-19 pandemic (1508 participant). RESULTS A statistically significant differences (P<0.05) are observed between Saudi and non-Saudi participants in all social aspects assessed except for time spent on social media. In addition, a high mean of depression, stress, and anxiety subscale scores are observed in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants with statistically significant differences (p=0.000). As well as high DASS-21 total scores in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants. Also, there are positive statistically significant correlations (0.05) between participants' time spent in social media and their depression, stress, anxiety, and total DASS scores during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION The findings of the present study indicate that COVID-19 pandemic generates stress, anxiety and depression among Najran population especially, non-Saudi.

The questionnaire topics are demographics, historical issues, participants attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccines, concerns, and vaccine hesitancy. Results: Attitudes and beliefs relating to vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccine, were ascertained. Overall, 66.81% of the contributors would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while %33.19 did not intend to be vaccinated. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding vaccine side effects, fear of getting sick from the uptake of the vaccine, and the absence of accurate vaccine promotion news. Individuals with higher education believe that India (68.6%) produces the best vaccine (P <0.001), while healthcare workers think the Chinese vaccine (44.2%) is the best (P =0.020). Individuals with higher education have not been vaccinated, not be healthcare workers, and females were the most contributors to effective of the vaccine in reducing mortality from COVID-19 disease.

Carbohydrates are prominently displayed on the surface of cell membranes and expressed by virtually all secretory proteins in bodily fluids. This is achieved by the events of posttranslational protein modification called glycosylation. Importantly, expression of cellular glycans, in the form of either glycoproteins or glycolipids, is differentially regulated. Cell display of precise complex carbohydrates is characteristically associated with the stages or steps of embryonic development, cell differentiation, as well as transformation of normal cells to abnormally differentiated tumor or cancer cells. Sugar moieties are also abundantly expressed on the outer surfaces of the majority of viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens. Many sugar structures are pathogen specific, which makes them important molecular targets for pathogen recognition, diagnosis of infectious diseases, and vaccine development. Exploring the biological information content in carbohydrates is one of the current focuses of postgenomic research and technology development. Biophysical, biochemical, and immunological methods have proven very valuable in studying carbohydrateCcarbohydrate and carbohydrateCprotein interactions. Many well established immunochemical methods have been applied to determine the specificity and cross-reactivity of carbohydrateCantibody and carbohydrateClectin interactions. A pressing need is, thus, the establishment of high-throughput technologies to enable the large-scale, multiplex analysis of carbohydrates and their cellular receptors. These include especially the characterization of immunological properties of carbohydrates that are important for medical applications of carbohydrate antigens and interactions of carbohydrates with other biomolecules or intact cells that play key roles in establishing comprehensive biological functions of essentially all existing living organisms.","output":"Chapter 16 Carbohydrate Microarrays as Essential Tools of Postgenomic Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Previous pandemics have resulted in high levels of psychological morbidity among frontline workers.

The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of physicians and nurses depending on their degree of contact with COVID-19 patients. In addition, we explored which supportive resources they used and which supportive needs they experienced during the crisis. Methods: Data were collected between March and April 2020 at the University Hospital Augsburg. A total of 75 nurses and 35 physicians, working either in a special COVID-19 ward or in a regular ward, took part in the survey. The participants filled in two standardized questionnaires (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), and reported their fear of a COVID-19 infection and stress at work on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, they answered three open-ended questions about causes of burden, supportive resources and needs during the crisis. Results: Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards reported higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood, as well as lower levels of work-related fulfilment compared to their colleagues in the regular wards. Physicians reported similar scores independent of their contact with COVID-19 patients. The most common causes for burden were job strain and uncertainty about the future. Psychosocial support as well as leisure time were listed as important resources, and a better infrastructure adjustment to COVID-19 at the hospital (e.g. sufficient staff, keeping teams and working schedules stable) as suggestion for improvement.

METHODS One non-absorbable barrier mesh (Composix?) and three absorbable barrier meshes (Sepramesh?, Proceed?, and Parietex? Composite) were used for the study, with uncoated macroporous polypropylene mesh (ProLite Ultra?) as the control. Three methods of fixation were used: #0-polypropylene suture + FS (ARTISS?, Baxter Healthcare Corp.), FS alone (ARTISS?), or tacks alone (n = 10 for each group). Two pieces of mesh (of dimensions 4  4-cm) were secured intraperitoneally in 75 New Zealand white rabbits. After 8 weeks, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained specimens were evaluated for host tissue response. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) post hoc test. RESULTS Composix? with FS only showed significantly greater cellular infiltration than with suture + FS (P = 0.0007), Proceed? with FS only had significantly greater neovascularization than with suture + FS (P = 0.0172), and ProLite Ultra? with suture + FS had significantly greater neovascularization than with tacks only (P = 0.046). Differences due to mesh type showed that Composix? exhibited less extensive cellular infiltration (P  0.0032), extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and neovascularization, and demonstrated less inflammatory cells and more fibroblasts compared to the other meshes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS FS did not have a significant histologic effect compared to tacks when utilized for the fixation of mesh to the peritoneum of New Zealand White rabbits. However, the mesh type did have a significant histologic effect. The permanent barrier mesh (Composix?) was associated with less histologic incorporation than absorbable barrier and macroporous meshes, as evidenced by lower levels of cellular infiltration, ECM deposition, and neovascularization, independent of the fixation method used.","output":"Histologic evaluation of absorbable and non-absorbable barrier coated mesh secured to the peritoneum with fibrin sealant in a New Zealand white rabbit model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The disease burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) continues to increase. This study aimed to assess the age, period, and cohort effects on the long-term trends of IHD incidence and mortality in China from 1990 to 2019.Methodsa??anda??Results: The data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019, and the age-standardized incidence/mortality rate (ASIR/ASMR) was calculated. The age-period-cohort (APC) model, which is a generalized linear model revealing the correlation of disease rate and attained age, period, and cohort, was applied to estimate the net drift (estimated annual percentage change [EAPC]s), the local drifts (age-specific EAPCs), the age, period, and cohort effects. The analyses elucidated that the ASIR and ASMR of IHD declined after 2013. The net drift of incidence was 0.212% in females, and the net drift of mortality was 0.371% in males. The local drifts of mortality were above 0 in males aged 20-84 years and in females aged 65-84 years. The age effects showed elevated trends during the study period. The period effects declined after 2013. The cohort effects of mortality in males were higher than that in females. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of ASIR and ASMR indicated that measures to prevent IHD have been effective in China.

Particularly in developing countries, which contain 80% of the entire population with disabilities, these individuals experience major barriers in accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. Education is an important factor that greatly affects individuals SRH service utilization. Hence, we sought to investigate the relationship between education and SRH service utilization for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh. METHODS: Using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, a total of 5000 persons with disabilities were surveyed for the quantitative component and 15 mini-ethnographic case studies were conducted with persons with disabilities for the qualitative component. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analyses were performed on the survey data, while the qualitative interviews were coded and their SRH themes synthesized accordingly. RESULTS: Our quantitative findings show that education statistically significantly increases persons with disabilities SRH service utilization of antenatal care, delivery care, postnatal care, and family planning (P < 0.05). Interestingly, for persons with disabilities, primary education shows increased adjusted odds of family planning use but is likely not enough to increase antenatal care, delivery care, or postnatal care use; secondary or post-secondary education may be required to improve utilization of these latter services. Qualitative findings support the association between higher education levels and greater SRH service use. Persons with disabilities of lower educational attainment held misinformation and distrust in SRH services and experienced mistreatment by SRH healthcare providers, discouraging them from seeking future SRH services. CONCLUSIONS: We report that higher formal education level is associated with greater SRH service use for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh. Formally educating persons with disabilities expands their SRH knowledge and familiarity with SRH services, as well as leads to more economic opportunities so they can afford SRH services. Increasing formal education levels for persons with disabilities, paired with integrating comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) in their schools, will likely help close the gap in SRH health disparities for this vulnerable population.","output":"Influence of education on sexual and reproductive health service utilization for persons with disabilities in nationwide Bangladesh: an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gas-phase nitrous acid (HONO) is a major precursor of hydroxyl radicals that dominate atmospheric oxidizing capacity.

Submodels need to be linked to this library, but this is minimally invasive and restructuring simulation codes is usually not needed.

We experimentally compared three clinically approved intravenous -blockers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice undergoing 45 min/24 h ischaemiaCreperfusion (I/R) received vehicle, metoprolol, atenolol, or propranolol at min 35. The effect on neutrophil infiltration was tested in three models of exacerbated inflammation. Neutrophil migration was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by intravital microscopy. The effect of -blockers on the conformation of the 1 adrenergic receptor was studied in silico. Of the tested -blockers, only metoprolol ameliorated I/R injury [infarct size (IS) = 18.0%  0.03% for metoprolol vs. 35.9%  0.03% for vehicle; P < 0.01]. Atenolol and propranolol had no effect on IS. In the three exacerbated inflammation models, neutrophil infiltration was significantly attenuated only in the presence of metoprolol (60%, 50%, and 70% reductions vs. vehicle in myocardial I/R injury, thioglycolate-induced peritonitis, and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury, respectively). Migration studies confirmed the particular ability of metoprolol to disrupt neutrophil dynamics. In silico analysis indicated different intracellular 1 adrenergic receptor conformational changes when bound to metoprolol than to the other two -blockers. CONCLUSIONS: Metoprolol exerts a disruptive action on neutrophil dynamics during exacerbated inflammation, resulting in an infarct-limiting effect not observed with atenolol or propranolol. The differential effect of -blockers may be related to distinct conformational changes in the 1 adrenergic receptor upon metoprolol binding.

The COVID-19 pandemic was declared in January 2020 and surges of the outbreak continue to reoccur. It is clear that early identification of infected individuals, especially asymptomatic carriers, plays a huge role in preventing the spread of the disease. The current gold standard diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 is quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test based on the detection of the viral RNA. While RT-PCR is reliable and sensitive, it requires expensive centralized equipment and is time consuming (2 h or more); limiting its applicability in low resource areas. The FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID-19 diagnostics with an emphasis on point-of care (PoC) testing. Numerous RT-PCR and serological tests were approved for use at the point of care. Abbott's ID NOW, and Cue Health's COVID-19 test are of particular interest, which use isothermal amplification methods for rapid detection in under 20 min. We look to expand on the range of current PoC testing platforms with a new rapid and portable isothermal nucleic acid detection device. We pair reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with a particle imaging technique, particle diffusometry (PD), to successfully detect SARS-CoV-2 in only 35 min on a portable chip with integrated heating. A smartphone device is used to image the samples containing fluorescent beads post-RT-LAMP and correlates decreased diffusivity to positive samples. We detect as little as 30 virus particles per L from a RT-LAMP reaction in a microfluidic chip using a portable heating unit. Further, we can perform RT-LAMP from a diluted unprocessed saliva sample without RNA extraction. Additionally, we lyophilize SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-LAMP reactions that target both the N gene and the ORF1ab gene in the microfluidic chip, eliminating the need for cold storage. Our assay meets specific target product profiles outlined by the World Health Organization: it is specific to SARS-CoV-2, does not require cold storage, is compatible with digital connectivity, and has a detection limit of less than 35  10(4) viral particles per mL in saliva. PD-LAMP is rapid, simple, and attractive for screening and use at the point of care.","output":"PD-LAMP smartphone detection of SARS-CoV-2 on chip"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As people with cystic fibrosis (CF) live longer and healthier lives, increasing numbers are considering the full range of reproductive options for their futures, including parenthood, pregnancy, or pregnancy prevention.

Online lectures have been practiced in different academic institutions around the world. The objective was to know the perception towards online lectures by the undergraduate students of a medical college. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of dentistry, medicine, and nursing at Kathmandu Medical College via self-administered online questionnaire. Data were collected from November to December 2020 after ethical clearance from institutional review committee (Ref. no. 0311202002). Students who had not attended even one hour of online learning per week were excluded. Responses were collected using Google Forms which were analysed in Microsoft Excel. Descriptive statistics are presented as means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages. RESULTS: Out of 318 valid questionnaires, 143 (44.97%) students agreed that online lectures were effective but 138 (43.4%) disagreed that online lectures were more useful than traditional lectures. One hundred and forty five (45.60%) found online classes difficult to concentrate and 175 (55.03%) agreed that they preferred a combination of traditional teaching and online tutorials. Only two (0.63%) students strongly agreed on excellent internet during classes and 104 (32.70%) agreed it caused economic burden. Mean age of participants was 20.751.538 years; 202 (63.52%) were females; online learning per week was 18.759.157 hours; and duration of online learning was 20.289.997 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the students had a positive attitude towards e-learning when compared to similar studies.

BMD generally increases following parathyroidectomy, however longitudinal changes to other DXA-derived parameters, the trabecular bone score (TBS) and hip structural analysis (HSA), have not been described. Postoperative calcium requirements and positive calcium balance raise concerns for an increased risk of vascular calcification. This case illustrates the dramatic increase in BMD that can follow parathyroidectomy in a patient on dialysis, and for the first time demonstrates improvements to HSA parameters and to the TBS. CASE PRESENTATION A 30-year old woman on haemodialysis underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. She developed a post-operative 'hungry bone syndrome' requiring substantial calcium and calcitriol supplementation. Six months post-parathyroidectomy, BMD increased by 42% at the lumbar spine, 30% at the femoral neck and 25% at the total proximal femur, with increases sustained over the following 18 months. The TBS increased by 8%. HSA showed a 63% increase in femoral neck cortical thickness and 38% reduction in the buckling ratio, consistent with increased femoral neck stability. The abdominal aortic vascular calcification score (0-24) increased from zero 8-years pre-parathyroidectomy to 2/24 at 18-months post-parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSION BMD losses incurred by secondary hyperparathyroidism recover rapidly after parathyroidectomy, particularly at sites of trabecular bone. Bone architectural parameters, measured as the TBS and by HSA, also improve. Greater BMD gains may be associated with higher post-operative calcium requirements. While bone is the major reservoir for post-parathyroidectomy calcium supplementation, positive calcium balance may contribute to vascular calcification risk.","output":"Changes to bone mineral density, the trabecular bone score and hip structural analysis following parathyroidectomy: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) profoundly impact neurocognitive development. Specifically, when these events occur during critical periods of brain plasticity, a time of significant synaptogenesis, neural pruning, and myelination, typical neurodevelopment can become derailed. Adverse childhood experiences promote morphological changes in neuronal microcircuitry which may lead to diminished cognitive flexibility, inattention, increased impulsivity, decreased school readiness, and disruptive behaviors. In this regard, the current COVID-19 pandemic represents an especially complex adverse experience that disturbs a child's social milieu and support network, likely interfering with brain maturation and executive function. Here, we take a neurodevelopmental approach to argue for the critical role that pediatricians must fulfill in mitigating the potentially detrimental consequences of COVID-19. We call for ACE screening and anticipatory guidance in the primary care setting, and the use of validated interventions and skills to bolster resilience, when ACEs are identified. We present a clinical workflow for the physician to proactively assess, identify, stratify, and address the severity of ACEs worsened by COVID-19. We discuss home-based activities and resources for children and adolescents to promote stress reduction, connectiveness, and self-awareness and create a more positive environment to maximize neurodevelopmental potential in the face of the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Guardians at the Gate: Early Adversity, Neurocognitive Development, and the Role of the Pediatrician in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Iatrogenic pneumothoracis, barotraumas, and tracheoesophageal fistulae, especially after prolonged intubation, and tracheal stenosis are all entities involving thoracic surgeons' consultation and management. With the surge of COVID-19 cases particularly in the critical care settings, various types of complications have been observed that require intervention from thoracic surgeons. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was conducted in an academic healthcare institute in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. We included all COVID-19 cases admitted to ICU in the period between March 15, 2020, and August 15, 2020, requiring thoracic surgery consultation and management. Non-COVID-19 critical cases and iatrogenic pneumothorax were excluded. RESULTS: Of 122 patients who were admitted to ICU with COVID-19, 18 patients (14.75%) required thoracic surgery consultation and management. We discovered a significant association between the outcomes and reintubation rates and the rate of pneumothorax occurrence. The survival analysis showed improvement in patients who had thoracostomy tube insertion as a management than the group who were treated conservatively. On the other hand, there was a significant difference between the COVID ICU group who had thoracic complication and those who did not regarding the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Noniatrogenic pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and mediastinal emphysema are well-known thoracic entities, but their presence in the context of COVID-19 disease is a harbinger for worse prognosis and outcomes.

In this context, companies with concerns in internationalization (those that are already internationalized and those in an internationalization process) have had to resort to technologies to support the change in their modus operandi.

This major role is mediated via the cytoskeleton, the organization of which dictates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of a set of transcription factors. Central among these is myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), which upon actin polymerization translocates to the nucleus and binds to its cognate partner, serum response factor (SRF). The MRTF/SRF complex then drives a large cohort of genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, contractility, extracellular matrix organization and many other processes. Accordingly, MRTF, activated by a variety of mechanical and chemical stimuli, affects a plethora of functions with physiological and pathological relevance. These include cell motility, development, metabolism and thus metastasis formation, inflammatory responses andpredominantly-organ fibrosis. The aim of this review is twofold: to provide an up-to-date summary about the basic biology and regulation of this versatile transcriptional coactivator; and to highlight its principal involvement in the pathobiology of kidney disease. Acting through both direct transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, MRTF plays a key (yet not fully appreciated) role in the induction of a profibrotic epithelial phenotype (PEP) as well as in fibroblast-myofibroblast transition, prime pathomechanisms in chronic kidney disease and renal fibrosis.","output":"MRTF: Basic Biology and Role in Kidney Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), once considered to be very rare, are now increasingly recognized because of growing knowledge in the immunological field and the availability of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques and therapeutic modalities [161].

After ex vivo exposure to remdesivir to human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cultures and dexamethasone synchronization, the rhythmicity of circadian gene expression (Clock, Bmal1, Per1-3, Cry1) was analysed via qRT-PCR. In this study, D-MEQ scores indicated that participants without a neuropsychiatric diagnosis had no evening preference. Remdesivir leads to a slight phase-shift in Clock, Per1 and Per2. Significant different expressions of Bmal1 and Per3 were detected after remdesivir exposure: Bmal1 at ZT8 (t(22) = 3.26, p = 0.004), ZT24 (t(22) = ? 2.66, p = 0.015), ZT28 (t(20) = ? 2.14, p = 0.045) and Per3 at ZT8 (t(22) = ? 4.27, p < 0.001) and ZT12 (t(22) = ? 2.61, p = 0.016).

However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance.

The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections.

However, the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to the manifestation of bacterial infections in these patients has yet to be elucidated. METHODS: We collected 70 Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients in Zurich, Switzerland between March and May 2020. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF; antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by EUCAST disk diffusion and CLSI broth microdilution assays. Selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%) comprised the two largest etiologic groups. Drug resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates was high for piperacillin/tazobactam (65.6%), cefepime (56.3%), ceftazidime (46.9%) and meropenem (50.0%). Enterobacterales isolates showed slightly lower levels of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (32%), ceftriaxone (32%), and ceftazidime (36%). All P. aeruginosa isolates and 96% of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, with apramycin found to provide best-in-class coverage. Genotypic analysis of consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates in one patient revealed a frameshift mutation in the transcriptional regulator nalC that coincided with a phenotypic shift in susceptibility to -lactams and quinolones. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable levels of antimicrobial resistance may have contributed to the manifestation of bacterial superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients, and may in some cases mandate consecutive adaptation of antibiotic therapy. High susceptibility to amikacin and apramycin suggests that aminoglycosides may remain an effective second-line treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, provided efficacious drug exposure in lungs can be achieved.

Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly. Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it. Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations) but achieving this early in the epidemic through social distancing interventions also implies that the community will not reach herd immunity. Conclusions: Australia needs not just to shift and flatten the curve but to squash it by getting the reproduction number below one. This will require Australia to achieve for transmission rates at least two thirds lower than those seen in the most severely affected countries.","output":"Flattening the curve is not enough, we need to squash it.

Methods A multicentre collaboration among 112 centres in 14 countries collected data on all patients presenting with a hip fracture between 1st March-31st May 2020. Demographics, residence, place of injury, presentation blood tests, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, management, ASA grade, length of stay, COVID-19 and 30-day mortality status were recorded. Results A total of 7090 patients were included, with a mean age of 82.2 (range 50-104) years and 4959 (70%) being female. Of 651 (9.2%) patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 225 (34.6%) were positive at presentation and 426 (65.4%) became positive postoperatively. Positive COVID-19 status was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio (OR) 1.38, p=0.001), residential care (OR 2.15, p<0.001), inpatient fall (OR 2.23, p=0.003), cancer (OR 0.63, p=0.009), ASA grade 4-5 (OR 1.59, p=0.008; OR 8.28, p<0.001), and longer admission (OR 1.06 for each increasing day, p<0.001). Patients with COVID-19 at any time had a significantly lower chance of 30-day survival versus those without COVID-19 (72.7% versus 92.6%, p<0.001). COVID-19 was independently associated with an increased 30-day mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) 2.83, p<0.001). Increasing age (HR 1.03, p=0.028), male sex (HR 2.35, p<0.001), renal disease (HR 1.53, p=0.017), and pulmonary disease (HR 1.45, p=0.039) were independently associated with a higher 30-day mortality risk in patients with COVID-19 when adjusting for confounders. Conclusion The prevalence of COVID-19 in hip fracture patients during the first wave of the pandemic was 9%, and was independently associated with a three-fold increased 30-day mortality risk.

METHODS Participants were 238 adolescents (132 males; 118 with ADHD) aged 15.64-17.99 years and their parents. Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires in May/June 2020 when in-person schools were closed in the U.S. RESULTS Twenty-two percent of families incurred financial costs to support remote learning, and only 59% of school-based services received before COVID-19 continued during COVID-19 remote learning. Adolescents with ADHD had fewer routines and more remote learning difficulties than adolescents without ADHD. Parents of adolescents with ADHD had less confidence in managing remote learning and more difficulties in supporting home learning and home-school communication. Thirty-one percent of parents of adolescents with ADHD with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or receiving academic accommodations (504 Plan) reported remote learning to be very challenging, compared with 18% of parents of adolescents with ADHD without an IEP/504 Plan, and only 4% of parents of adolescents with neither ADHD nor an IEP/504 Plan. Fewer adolescent routines, higher negative affect, and more difficulty concentrating because of COVID-19 were each associated with greater adolescent remote learning difficulties only in adolescents with ADHD.

The virus crossed the species barrier and established in the human population taking advantage of the spike protein high affinity for the ACE receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. The Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) are highly immunogenic structural proteins and most commercial COVID-19 diagnostic assays target these proteins. In an unpredictable epidemic, it is essential to know about their genetic variability. The objective of this study was to describe the substitution frequency of the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in South America. A total of 504 amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from seven South American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, and Colombia), reported as of June 3, and corresponding to samples collected between March and April 2020, were compared through substitution matrices using the Muscle algorithm in MEGA X. Forty-three sequences from 13 Colombian departments were obtained in this study using the Oxford Nanopore and Illumina MiSeq technologies, following the amplicon-based ARTIC network protocol. The substitutions D614G in S and R203K/G204R in N were the most frequent in South America, observed in 83% and 34% of the sequences respectively. Strikingly, genomes with the conserved position D614 were almost completely replaced by genomes with the G614 substitution between March to April 2020. A similar replacement pattern was observed with R203K/G204R although more marked in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, suggesting similar introduction history and/or control strategies of SARS-CoV-2 in these countries. It is necessary to continue with the genomic surveillance of S and N proteins during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as this information can be useful for developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostic tests.","output":"Substitutions in Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in South America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Besides reports of alarming potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccinations there have been rare observations of rather benign reactions to foreign materials such as cosmetic hyaluronic acid filler injections after a COVID-19 immunization.

Literature on ideal management of accessory auricles is limited. Traditionally, accessory auricles are managed by paediatricians with suture ligation at the base of the accessory auricle to induce ischaemic necrosis (Mehmi et al, 2007). This method can be associated with complications and poor cosmesis thus leading to the vogue of surgical excision ( Frieden et al, 1995; Sebben, 1989). We present our experience in managing these lesions in children with the application of a titanium clip in a one-stop outpatient setting. Methods. Data was collected retrospectively through review of patient records and telephone questionnaire identifying outcomes from the parents' perspective. Results. Of 42 patients, 24 (57.1%) responded. Eleven (26.2%) underwent surgical excision, 6 (14.3%) had no intervention, and 1 (2.4%) was not contactable. All parents were happy with the outcome and would recommend this management to other parents. Twenty-three (96%) had no complications apart from a tiny residual nubbin, which was considered cosmetically acceptable. One child had a residual nubbin that grew in size requiring surgical excision at later stage. Conclusion. Management of accessory auricles by the application of a titanium clip in one-stop outpatient setting is safe, simple, quick, and well tolerated with no need for admission, anaesthesia, or followup due to the low complication rate.","output":"One-stop outpatient management of accessory auricle in children with titanium clip."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of febuxostat (FBX) in comparison with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and chest CT findings in outpatients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial involving adult outpatients with the moderate respiratory illness following COVID-19 infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either FBX or HCQ for 5 days. The measured variables were needs to hospitalisation, clinical and laboratory data including fever, cough, breathing rate, C-Reactive Protein level, lymphocytes count at onset of admission and was well as at 5 days of treatments. In addition, CT findings were evaluated on admission and 14 days after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Sixty subjects were enrolled in the study with a 1 to 1 ratio in FBX and HCQ groups. On admission, fever (66.7%), cough (87%), tachypnoea (44.4%), dyspnoea (35%), elevated CRP value (94.4%) and lung involvement according to chest CT (100%) were documented in enrolled patients with insignificant difference between FBX and HCQ groups. Fever, cough and tachypnoea were significantly mitigated in both groups after five days of treatments without any significant differences between groups. The mean percentages of lung involvement were significantly reduced to 7.3% and 8% after 14 days of treatment with FBX and HCQ, respectively. In adult outpatients with moderate COVID-19 infection, the effectiveness of FBX and HCQ was not different in terms of resolution of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and lung CT findings. CONCLUSION: This trial suggests that FBX is as an alternative treatment to HCQ for COVID-19 infection and may be considered in patients with a contraindication or precaution to HCQ.","output":"Febuxostat therapy in outpatients with suspected COVID-19: A clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychophysical well-being can be supported during development by the integration of extra-curricular activities in scholastic settings.

Consequently, the current pilot study aimed to examine the effect of short daily school-based sitting and movement meditation trainings on creativity and spatial cognition. Utilizing a crossover design, we evaluated their feasibility and efficacy at different ages among children (n = 50) in 5th to 8th grade. We observed that 5 weeks of daily training in sitting and movement meditation techniques improved childrens cognition differently. Specifically, younger children showed greater creativity and better spatial cognition following the movement-based meditation, while older children showed greater enhancement in these areas following sitting meditation training. This suggests that training can affect childrens cognition differently depending on their developmental stage. We discuss these results within the framework of embodied and grounded cognition theories. Information on feasibility and age-related effect sizes derived from the current study paves the way for future well-powered larger-scale efficacy studies on different forms of school-based interventions to cognitive development promotion.","output":"Age-Related Differential Effects of School-Based Sitting and Movement Meditation on Creativity and Spatial Cognition: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: WALANT procedures are becoming more popular and are particularly useful in the COVID-19 pandemic. Procedures can be performed without needing access to general theatres and anaesthetic support, minimising the number of patient-healthcare interactions and avoiding aerosolisation. Our unit has taken this approach and aim to present a case series that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of WALANT. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of WALANT cases in a single plastic surgery centre during March-August 2020 was performed. All procedures using a WALANT approach were included, that would have otherwise required general anaesthetic or regional block. Data was collected on a number of variables, including patient satisfaction. RESULTS: 37 procedures were included in analysis. The majority of the injuries consisted of hand trauma. There were no cases of post-operative complications, although one required completion in main theatres due to technicality. No patients required additional anaesthetic during the procedure and all reported pain score as 0/10. Overall patient satisfaction was 10/10 for 26 patients, 9/10 for 10 patients and 7/10 for one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Results show the use of WALANT can facilitate an effective plastic surgery trauma service during COVID-19. Most of the procedures were performed in the outpatient department setting, without the need for main operating theatres or anaesthetic support. All procedures were performed within 24 hours of initial presentation and were able to be discharged on the same day. In addition, patient satisfaction remained high and post-operative complications were minimal.

The economic well-being of Korean families has been threatened because many family members lost their jobs or earned reduced incomes due to the pandemic. COVID-19 substantially changed the work environment and has provided the momentum for the growth of flexible work including telecommuting in Korea, which was not commonly used before the pandemic. However, the work-from-home arrangements created an ambiguous boundary between work and family, particularly among employed mothers because childcare facilities and schools were closed during COVID-19. The postponed 2020 school year started with online schooling in April, and children in secondary schools often continued private education during the pandemic. Although COVID-19 provided an opportunity to build emotional ties for some families, many Korean families who were stuck at home experienced relational difficulties. Socioeconomic and gender inequality along with discrimination against certain groups were heightened. Our analysis of social media posts showed that childcare, schooling, and religion were important domains of family life during the pandemic. We conclude that COVID-19 has changed the meaning of home in Korea from a place to sleep to a basecamp involving numerous major activities related to work, schooling, parenting, housework, shopping, leisure, and religion. Korean families have found it challenging to spend intensive time with their family, to share gendered family responsibilities, and to support other families. Thus, we suggest that professional and policymakers develop a new service model that is more effective for the changing family climate.Alternate abstract: L'objectif principal de cet article est de discuter de l'impact du COVID-19 sur les familles corennes.

The effect of translation on mRNA decay has mainly been studied using ensemble measurements and global inhibitors of transcription and translation, which can mask the underlying mechanisms. We developed a single-molecule imaging approach to control the translation of a specific transcript that enabled simultaneous measurement of translation and mRNA decay. Our results demonstrate that mRNAs undergoing translation are degraded faster than non-translating ones, although with slower kinetics than translation-coupled degradation of transcripts targeted by NMD. Furthermore, our results indicate that miRNAs mediate efficient degradation of both translating and non-translating target mRNAs. Single-molecule measurements of translation and decay reveal a predominant role of mRNA decay in miRNA-mediated regulation. Simultaneous visualization of translation and decay on single mRNAs provides a framework to study how these processes are interconnected in cells.","output":"Single-molecule imaging reveals the coupling of translation and mRNA decay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BVA's Young Vet of the Year in 2021 was Alex Davies, who developed a mentoring programme that has enabled school students to benefit from virtual work experience placements during Covid-19.","output":"Dedicated to nurturing a motivated and diverse cohort of vet school applicants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study investigated the relationship between outward orientation and COVID-related prosocial behavior, including adherence to containment measures, caring for others and providing support, limiting ones social life and responsible purchasing behavior.

In less than two months, the disease had spread to more than 200 herds in thirteen states. Experts from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) engaged in laboratory diagnostics, analytic support, epidemiology expertise, and data management to facilitate the effort. By 2014, a great deal had been learned about the disease; however, the question of how it entered the United States remained unanswered. In 2014, USDA formed an investigative group to address the question and leverage current knowledge with resources and partnerships not readily available to non-federal investigators. The group formed collaborations with other government and non-government organizations and individuals, and followed many avenues of inquiry; ultimately arriving at a small number of scenarios that describe possible mechanisms for PED introduction. For a scenario to be plausible, it had to explain: contamination of a person or product in the source country, its transit and entry to the United States, rapid dispersal across a wide geographic area, and exposure/infection of pigs. It had to be compatible with findings of swine herd investigations and research studies. Potential products had to have been imported legally during the time prior to the beginning of the epidemic, or delivered to the United States through prohibited channels. Follow-up studies were initiated to gather more evidence for the most plausible scenarios.

To address the function of myeloid CD13 directly, we created a CD13 null mouse and assessed the responses of purified primary macrophages or DCs from WT and CD13 null animals in cell assays and inflammatory disease models, where CD13 has been implicated previously. We find that mice lacking CD13 develop normally with normal hematopoietic profiles except for an increase in thymic but not peripheral T cell numbers. Moreover, in in vitro assays, CD13 appears to be largely dispensable for the aspects of phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen presentation that we tested, although we observed a slight decrease in actin-independent erythrocyte uptake. However, in agreement with our published studies, we show that lack of monocytic CD13 completely ablates anti-CD13-dependent monocyte adhesion to WT endothelial cells. In vivo assessment of four inflammatory disease models showed that lack of CD13 has little effect on disease onset or progression. Nominal alterations in gene expression levels between CD13 WT and null macrophages argue against compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, although CD13 is highly expressed on myeloid cells and is a reliable marker of the myeloid lineage of normal and leukemic cells, it is not a critical regulator of hematopoietic development, hemostasis, or myeloid cell function.","output":"CD13 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis and myeloid cell functions in the mouse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cluster randomized trials are frequently used in educational research for methodological reasons.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished via ACE-2 receptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection coactivates both innate and adaptive immune responses. Although SARS-CoV-2 stimulates antibody production with a typical pattern of IgM/IgG, cellular immunity is also impaired. In severe cases, low CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts are associated with impaired immune functions, and high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios accompanying low lymphocyte subsets have been demonstrated.

The second wave of data was collected approximately one month later, where we collected a measure of physical distancing behavior and a measure of disinfecting behaviors. In AI adults, health mindset predicted frequency of physical distancing behaviors and disinfecting behaviors, with individuals who viewed health as less fixed engaging in more physical distancing and disinfecting behaviors, while individuals who viewed health as more fixed reported less physical distancing and less disinfecting behaviors. In AIs, growth health mindsets predicted physical distancing and disinfecting behaviors, both of which are important in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. METHOD: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. RESULTS: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"An Analysis on Self-Management and Treatment-related Functionality and Characteristics of Highly Rated Anxiety Apps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reflective practice is important in pharmacy education to support skill development for decision-making, critical thinking, problem-solving, and in continuing professional development and beyond.

The role of androgens has been recently highlighted as they control two key steps of coronavirus infection mediated through the transmembrane protease serin 2 (TMPRRS2) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the lung tissue. Furthermore, a high incidence of androgenic alopecia among males with COVID-19 disease have been reported. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the telogen effluvium (TE) prevalence and its relationship with clinical and immunologic parameters in a sample of patients consecutively evaluated after recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia in Northern Italy. Methods: Overall 104 patients were recruited within three months from COVID-19 pneumonia recovery; 80 (77%) had been hospitalized in a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit and the remaining ones had been treated at home. The extent of TE was assessed with a visual analogic scale for thick bundle of hairs. Demographic and clinical data and systemic inflammation biomarkers were also evaluated. Results. Thirty-two patients reported a history of TE and their mean TE-VAS score was 5.78  1.72 (range 3C9). Women had about a 5-fold higher risk (odds) of complaining of TE compared to males (OR = 4.69, 95%CI: 1.91, 11.49; p = .001), and the association became stronger when adjusted for COVID-19 severity (hospital admission vs home care: OR = 6.09, 95%CI: 2.34, 15.88; p < .001). Levels of C-reactive protein >1.90 mg/l (OR(adj): 2.43, 95%CI 0.85, 7.05, p = 0.096) or IL 1 > 5 ng/l (OR(adj) 4.72, 95%CI: 1.31, 23.19, p = .03) were also significantly associated with TE. Conclusion: KEY MESSAGES: The presence of Telogen effluvium (TE) was significantly more common in women. Higher severity of the Covid-19 disease seems to play a critical role, more important than the hormonal influence, in the development of TE. The severity of inflammation related to TE and Covid-19 could also play a role as suggested by the higher levels of CRP and platelets and IL1.","output":"Relationship between hair shedding and systemic inflammation in COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination around the world has substantially reduced the number of new cases of COVID-19 and their severity in highly vaccinated countries.

Chronic bronchitis is extremely rare in the pediatric patient and is a manifestation of reactive airway disease or cystic fibrosis. The absolute severity, the extent of the disease, responses to treatment, and long-term course should be evaluated by repeated pulmonary function tests. Fortunately, asthma responds well to pharmacologic and supportive therapy, and it is important to approach its management as that of a chronic rather than episodic illness. Therapy should include comprehensive, closely supervised drug therapy, health education, and a program of selfmanagement. Asthma usually starts before youngsters enter school, and the majority get better as they get older. Nevertheless, many children with moderate or severe asthma will continue to be troubled by intermittent or chronic airway obstruction into adulthood, and they require long-term, anticipatory treatment programs.

Olfactory event-related potentials from cranial nerve V produced by the stimulation with mint were registered in 26 patients (68.4%). The lack of any responses, from both cranial nerve I and V, was found in 12 patients (32% of cases). Conclusions: Findings from our study indicate the application of both subjective and objective examinations in the evaluation of patients with olfactory impairment. In the diagnosis of post-traumatic anosmia or hyposmia, objective examinations are particularly useful when the patients' level of cognition may be impaired or when subjects may be exaggerating their olfactory defects for a secondary gain. The diagnosis of damage to the olfactory system, specifically in the receptive part of the olfactory pathway, can be established in patients who showed reduced amplitudes or absent cortical responses in addition to absent odor identification and perception threshold in the subjective examination.","output":"Subjective and Objective Assessments of Post-traumatic Olfactory Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 has created major challenges for academic education and clinical training, as well as on routine, emergency, and elective patients who have been impacted by the health services response to COVID-19.

Home-based rehabilitation protocols (HBRP) can be effective alternatives. We use a HBRP for the non-surgically treated proximal humeral fractures (PHF) in older patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess patient satisfaction and preferences of using a booklet, videos, or an app to guide physiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, single-center observational study of patients 55 years old who sustained a non-surgically treated PHF. The HBRP consisted of immediate mobilization, followed by 5 physiotherapist-guided, weekly sessions of rehabilitation and standard physiotherapy after 3 months, if needed. A booklet with images, videos, or a smartphone application were offered to guide the patients. RESULTS: Mean degree of satisfaction (1-5) was 4.66  .9: 84 patients (82.4%) were very satisfied, 11 patients (10.8%) were satisfied, and 5 patients (4.9%) were not satisfied at all. Mean Oxford Shoulder Score achieved was 40.5  6.6. 59.8% patients preferred the booklet and 29.4% the videos. Exercise compliance was considered very high in 87.3% of patients, while 4% hardly never followed the HBRP. Only 17.7% patients needed center-based physiotherapy after the HBRP. DISCUSSION: Reasons for satisfaction were good final functional outcome, no need for transportation, being away from hospital, immediate rehabilitation availability and being capable of maintaining independence. Adherence is a major concern. Videos are more didactic explaining the exercises. CONCLUSION: If standard physiotherapy is not available, the HBRP can be a valid treatment option for PHF management in older patients, with a high degree of patient satisfaction.

Since the beginning of the industrialization of the dairy cattle sector (1950s), driven by the need to feed the rapidly growing urban areas, this industry has experienced several improvements, evolving in management and technology. These changes have been felt above all in the terms of milking, rearing, nutrition, reproductive management, and design of facilities. Shortage of labor, emphasis on increasing farm efficiency, and quality of life of the farmers were the driving factors for these changes. To achieve it, in many areas of the world, pasture production has been abandoned, moving to indoor production, which allows for greater nutritional and reproductive control of the animals. To keep pace with this paradigm in milk production, animal health management has also been improved. Prevention and biosecurity have become essential to control and prevent pathologies that cause great economic losses. As such, veterinary herd health management programs were created, allowing the management of health of the herd as a whole, through the common work of veterinarians and farmers. These programs address the farms holistically, from breeding to nutrition, from prevention to consultancy. In addition, farmers are now faced with a consumer more concerned on animal production, valuing certified products that respect animal health and welfare, as well as environmental sustainability.","output":"Historical Evolution of Cattle Management and Herd Health of Dairy Farms in OECD Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current research aims at identifying the reality of educational security practices for the Egyptian family in light of the Corona pandemic, from the educational elites perspective .For this purpose ? both descriptive and analytical methods were used.

Our Cancer Centre in South-East London treats approximately 8,800 patients annually and is one of the largest Comprehensive Cancer Centres in the UK. When dealing with the second wave of COVID-19, it is important to further evaluate the safety of cancer treatments whilst balancing the risks of COVID-19 infection and complications. Here, we report on the patient/tumour characteristics of those patients undergoing SACT for a urological cancer diagnosis during the first wave, so as to help establish clinical guidelines for the management of these patients in a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods: All urological cancer patients receiving at least one SACT between 1st March- 31st May 2020 (COVID-19 period) were compared to the same timeframe in 2019. SARSCoV2 infection was defined as a positive RT-PCR test;patients with symptoms or radiological changes alone were excluded. As part of Guy's Cancer Cohort, we collected information on demographics, and cancer type, stage, and treatment. Results: A total of 455 patients (305 prostate, 102 renal, 38 bladder, and 10 testicular) received SACT in 2020 as compared to 535 (353 prostate, 129 renal, 37 bladder, and 15 testicular) in 2019 (15% overall decline). Patient characteristics in terms of demographics were fairly comparable, with 10% female patients in 2019 and 9% in 2020;49% aged 70+ vs 45%;and 77% in the low socioeconomic category vs 78%. There was an increase in patients with stage 4 (89% vs 95% in 2020) and a slight change in distribution of SACT types (2019 vs 2020): chemotherapy (18% vs 14%), immunotherapy (7% vs 10%), biological or targeted (63% vs 66%), combination of biological/targeted (6% vs 5%), other combinations (5% vs 5%). The proportion of SACT delivered as part of radical treatment declined from 3% to 0.2% in 2020. A total of 5 patients (1%) developed COVID-19 (2 prostate, 2 renal, and 1 bladder). All were male and aged 60+;three had 2+ comorbidities. One patient was on immunotherapy and four on biological or targeted treatment. Four patients had severe pneumonia and one died of their COVID-19 (bladder cancer). Conclusions: Whilst there was a decline of number of patients receiving SACT during COVID-19, we were still able to provide a safe high-quality urological cancer SACT pathway during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with very few COVID-19 positive patients. In a next step we will evaluate oncological outcomes at 6 months follow-up.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on delivery of systemic anti-cancer treatment in urological cancer patients: A comparison with 2019 data from Guy's Cancer Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has become a widespread public health concern Restrictions to dental health care services have been implemented to reduce the risk of transmission Managing dental pain can become difficult and challenging for those undergoing mandatory quarantine for 14 days and as a result are unable able to access dental care They often need to resort to pharmacological intervention such as antibiotics and analgesics for pain relief This case report presents a returned overseas traveller to Australia who developed dental pain and significant facial swelling while in quarantine The traveller had recently undergone third molar surgery in another country prior to returning home Upon release, the patient attended a dental clinic and the cause of pain was due to an iatrogenic foreign body (gauze strip and surgical bur) in the mandibular third molar extraction socket This case reemphasises the dilemma that foreign bodies can have harmful consequences and can lead to a serious complication without surgical retrieval ? 2020 The British Association of Oral Surgeons and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in managing dental pain: a case report on a foreign body reaction after third molar surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. However, the hazard to newborns in pregnancy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the vertical transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from mother to child and developmental toxicity in the fetus. METHODS: All clinical information was recorded on 22 neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in Tongji Hospital. RESULTS: The average birth weight of the 22 newborns (16 males and 6 females) was 2980 g, and the mean gestational week was 37W+3. The birth weight of three babies was <2500 g, and the gestational week of all three low-birth-weight neonates was less than 36W. Three newborns had minor lesions of infection in the lungs as shown by computed tomography (CT) scans. Furthermore, three newborns had elevated SARS-CoV-2-related immunoglobin M (IgM) antibodies, and 11 newborns (52.4%) had positive immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies. Notably, both cystatin C and ?2-microglobulin were increased in all newborns. Five of the 21 tested newborns had leukocytosis, and 11 had increased neutrophil levels. In addition, the aspartate aminotransferase of 18 newborns and the ?3-glutamyl transpeptidase of 19 newborns were increased. Total bilirubin was elevated in all newborns and serum albumin was reduced in 20 of 22 newborns. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to discover that COVID-19 infection in the third trimester of pregnancy could cause fetal kidney developmental injury, as indicated by increased cystatin C and ?2-microglobulin in all neonates.

The primary outcome was clinical improvement within 28 days, and the secondary outcome measures were time to hospital discharge, all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, the temporal trend in 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positivity and the frequency of adverse drug events within 28 days from the start of medication. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial and data from 100 patients (48 patients in the treatment arm and 52 patients in the control arm) were analyzed.

However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Liver centers should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplant programs need to consider offering some leniency to patients with AUD/ALD who cannot obtain alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.","output":"COVID-19 Hangover: A Rising Tide of Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the primary pathogen of enzootic pneumonia, occurs worldwide and causes major economic losses to the pig industry. The organism adheres to and damages the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract. Affected pigs show chronic coughing, are more susceptible to other respiratory infections and have a reduced performance. Control of the disease can be accomplished in a number of ways. First, management practices and housing conditions in the herd should be optimized. These include all-in/all-out production, limiting factors that may destabilize herd immunity, maintaining optimal stocking densities, prevention of other respiratory diseases, and optimal housing and climatic conditions. Strategic medication with antimicrobials active against M. hyopneumoniae and, preferably, also against major secondary bacteria may be useful during periods when the pigs are at risk for respiratory disease. Finally, commercial bacterins are widely used to control M. hyopneumoniae infections. The main effects of vaccination include less clinical symptoms, lung lesions and medication use, and improved performance. However, bacterins provide only partial protection and do not prevent colonization of the organism. Different vaccination strategies (timing of vaccination, vaccination of sows, vaccination combined with antimicrobial medication) can be used, depending on the type of herd, the production system and management practices, the infection pattern and the preferences of the pig producer.

METHODS: The prospective open non-randomized interventional study (Siena Eye-Cross Study 2) included 156 eyes of 112 patients with early progressive KC undergoing the Epi-Off 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 ACXL at the Siena Crosslinking Centre, Italy. The mean age was 18.05  5.6 years. The 20-min treatments were performed using the New KXL I (Avedro, Waltham, USA), 10 min of 0.1% HPMC Riboflavin soaking (VibeX Rapid, Avedro, Waltham, USA) and 10 min of continuous-light UV-A irradiation. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), Kmax, coma, minimum corneal thickness (MCT), surface asymmetry index (SAI), endothelial cell count (ECC) were measured, and corneal OCT performed. RESULTS: UDVA and CDVA improved significantly at the 3rd (P = 0.028), &#916; + 0.17 Snellen lines and 6th postoperative month, respectively (P < 0.001), &#916; + 0.23 Snellen lines. Kmax improved at the 6th postoperative month (P = 0.03), &#916; - 1.49 diopters from the baseline value. Also, coma aberration value improved significantly (P = 0.004).

The tasks of COVID-19 containment facilitated by PHC facilities were different among different regions and during different periods of COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to investigate the gaps on task participation, explore existing problems and provide corresponding solutions. METHODS: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews with COVID-19 prevention and control management teams of PHC facilities were conducted. Purposive stratified sampling was used and 32 team members of 22 PHC facilities were selected from Wuhan (as high-risk city), Shanghai (as medium-risk city) and Zunyi (as low-risk city). Framework analysis was employed to analyze the transcribed recordings. RESULTS: The main tasks of PHC facilities during the early period of the pandemic included assisting in contact tracing and epidemiological investigation, screening of populations at high-risk at travel centers/internals, house-by-house, or pre-examination/triage within PHC facilities; at-home/ centralized quarantine management; the work of fever sentinel clinics. Further analyses revealed the existing problems and suggestions for improvement or resolutions. Regular medical supply reserves were recommended because of the medical supply shortage during the pre-outbreak period. Temporarily converted quarantine wards and centralized quarantine centers could be used to deal with pressures on patients treatment and management of the febrile patients. Only after strict evaluation of nucleic acid testing (NAT) results and housing conditions, decision on quarantine at-home or centralized quarantine centers could be made. Settings of fever sentinel clinics at PHC facilities allowed fever patients with no COVID-19 infection risks for treatment without being transferred to fever clinics of the designed secondary hospitals. Psychological intervention was sometimes in need and really helped in addressing individuals mental pressures. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 containment, PHC facilities in China were responsible for different tasks and several problems were encountered in the working process. Accordingly, specific and feasible suggestions were put forward for different problems. Our findings are highly beneficial for healthcare teams and governments in handling similar situations.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the presence of influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting their general practitioner for uncomplicated acute diarrhea (AD) and the proportion of concurrent infections by enteric and influenza viruses. METHOD: A case-control study was conducted from December 2010 to April 2011. Stool specimens were collected and tested for influenza viruses A (seasonal A/H3N2 and pandemic A/H1N1) and B, and for four enteric viruses (astrovirus, group A rotavirus, human enteric adenovirus, norovirus of genogroups I C NoVGI - and genogroup II - NoVGII). RESULTS: General practitioners enrolled 138 cases and 93 controls. Of the 138 stool specimens collected, 92 (66.7%) were positive for at least one of the four enteric viruses analysed and 10 (7.2%) tested positive for one influenza virus. None of these 10 influenza positive patients reported respiratory symptoms. In five influenza-positive patients (3.6%), we also detected one enteric virus, with 4 of them being positive for influenza B (2 had co-detection with NoVGI, 1 with NoVGII, and 1 with astrovirus). None of the 93 controls tested positive for one of the enteric and/or other influenza viruses we investigated. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we showed that the simultaneous detection of influenza and enteric viruses is not a rare event. We have also reported, for the first time in general practice, the presence of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting for uncomplicated AD. A simultaneous investigation of enteric and influenza viruses in patients complaining of gastrointestinal symptoms could be useful for future studies to better identify the agents responsible for AD.","output":"Simultaneous investigation of influenza and enteric viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting in general practice for acute diarrhea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreads worldwide, awaiting the development of a vaccine, researchers are looking among the arsenal of available drugs, for a potential cure or medication to improve patients outcome.

Methods: We summarize published key findings about imatinib, aiming to rationalize its use as a potential pharmacologic treatment for COVID-19. Results: Data from cellular, animal models and clinical trials, showed a beneficial role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the regulation of inflammation, the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity, as well as the expression of antiviral properties. This data is especially derived from imatinib, the most studied Abl family kinase inhibitor, that is currently in clinical use for multiple medical conditions. Discussion: Based on this encouraging data, we hypothesize that imatinib might be beneficial for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in the aim of preventing disease progression into the severe phenotype of hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Nonetheless, the excessive use of sanitizers and disinfectants promotes the development of antibiotic-resistant microbes. Moreover, that improper disinfection could lead to more virus transfer, which leads to more viral mutations. Recently developed antiviral surface coatings can reduce the reliance on traditional disinfectants. These surfaces remain actively antimicrobial between periods of active cleaning of the surfaces, allowing a much more limited and optimized use of disinfectants. The novel nature of these surfaces has led, however, to many inconsistencies within the rapidly growing literature. Here we provide tools to guide the design and development of antimicrobial and antiviral surfaces and coatings. We describe how engineers can best choose testing options and propose new avenues for antiviral testing. After defining testing protocols, we summarize potential inorganic and organic materials able to serve as antiviral surfaces and present their antiviral mechanisms. We discuss the main limitations to their application, including issues related to toxicity, antimicrobial resistance, and environmental concerns. We propose solutions to counter these limitations and highlight how the context of specific use of an antiviral surface must guide material selection.

BACKGROUND: In Italy, COVID outbreak has mostly occurred in the metropolitan area of Milan, and in the surrounding region of Lombardy, and previously \\"conventional\\" hospitals were converted into COVID spokes to increase ICU beds availability, and to allow only urgent CS procedures. METHODS: Among urgent CS patients (left main stenosis with unstable angina, acute endocarditis, valvular regurgitation with impending heart failure), 10 patients (mean age = 57  9 years), despite a negative admission triage, developed COVID-pneumonia postoperatively, at a median of 7 days after CS. RESULTS: Patients showed typical lymphopenia, higher prothrombotic profile, and higher markers of inflammation (ferritin and interleukin-6 values). At the zenith of pulmonary distress, patients presented with severe hypoxia (median PaO2/FIO2 ratio = 116), requiring advanced noninvasive ventilation (Venturi mask and continuous positive airway pressure) in the majority of cases. All patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and low-molecular-weight heparin at anticoagulant dose. Overall in-hospital mortality was 10% (1/10), peaking 25% in patients who developed COVID pneumonia immediately after CS. The remaining patients, with late infection, were all discharged home without oxygen support, at a median of 25 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: As postoperative mortality in case of COVID pneumonia is not negligible, meticulous rules (precise triage, safe hospital path, high level of protection for health-care teams, prompt diagnosis of suspicious symptoms) should be strictly followed in patients undergoing CS during COVID pandemic. The role of therapies alternative to CS should be further assessed.","output":"Clinical Course of COVID-19 Infection in Patients Urgently Operated of Cardiac Surgical Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To meet the educational, physical, social, and emotional needs of children, many U.S. schools opened for in-person learning during fall 2020 by implementing strategies to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2).

Using data from Georgia kindergarten through grade 5 (K-5) schools that opened for in-person learning during fall 2020, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) assessed the impact of school-level prevention strategies on incidence of COVID-19 among students and staff members before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.? Among 169 K-5 schools that participated in a survey on prevention strategies and reported COVID-19 cases during November 16-December 11, 2020, COVID-19 incidence was 3.08 cases among students and staff members per 500 enrolled students. Adjusting for county-level incidence, COVID-19 incidence was 37% lower in schools that required teachers and staff members to use masks, and 39% lower in schools that improved ventilation, compared with schools that did not use these prevention strategies. Ventilation strategies associated with lower school incidence included methods to dilute airborne particles alone by opening windows, opening doors, or using fans (35% lower incidence), or in combination with methods to filter airborne particles with high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filtration with or without purification with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) (48% lower incidence). Multiple strategies should be implemented to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools (2); mask requirements for teachers and staff members and improved ventilation are important strategies that elementary schools could implement as part of a multicomponent approach to provide safer, in-person learning environments.

However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy.","output":"A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with a greater risk of COVID-19 and an increased mortality when the disease is contracted.

Nurses had psychological symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, and physiological symptoms such as respiratory, musculoskeletal symptoms. The majority of nurses experienced the following psychological stressors: fear of being a COVID-19 carrier and infecting loved ones, and getting sick with COVID-19. Reasons for physiological stress were mostly due to working with personal protective equipment (PPE), skipping toilet breaks, and inadequate hydration. Reasons for patient care-related stress included excessive sweating in PPE, fogging of goggles, and inability to select a venipuncture site with double gloves.

Despite an increased demand, teaching on GH remains fragmented and heterogeneous in the university landscape in German-speaking countries. Moreover, there is a lack of common understanding of GH and interpretations range from GH as tropical medicine to GH as everything related to health. This project aims to develop (A) a framework of different GH concepts, as a basis for (B) a set of GH learning objectives for German-speaking countries. METHODS: A review of publications providing GH definitions was carried out. Following a concept analysis approach, we developed a general framework of different and partially overlapping GH understandings. Building on these results we conducted an overview of reviews on learning objectives and curricula for GH to develop a set of learning objectives. RESULTS: The general framework distinguishes between GH concepts describing GH as (1)a set of global health issues (e.g. COVID-19), (2) a global ideal to strive for, (3 + 4) any activities relating to said global health issues or ideals (e.g. all activities contributing to health equity), and (5) sets of activities meeting various characteristics (e.g. being transdisciplinary and transnational). Within each concept, multiple sets of axes allow a more granular distinction of the concepts (e.g. regarding the relation to public health and tropical medicine). The list of key learning objectives shows considerable overlap with widely accepted public health core competencies. Differences include e.g. a (stronger) emphasis on intercultural and interdisciplinary collaboration, globalisation and transnational determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic reflection on commonalities and differences in the understanding of GH is important for a shared understanding. Based on the GH learning objectives we will develop core competencies for GH, including through an online survey of GH experts.

Clopidogrel resistance is associated with increased periprocedural thromboembolic complications from neurovascular stent placement procedures. The addition of cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) has been reported to reduce platelet reactivity and to improve clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of adjunctive cilostazol in patients with CAS. METHODS Platelet function was assessed by light transmittance aggregometry using the VerifyNow assay. Sixty-four consecutive patients who underwent CAS received standard DAT, clopidogrel (75 mg daily), and aspirin (100 mg daily) more than 4 weeks before the procedure. From 2010 to 2011 (period I), 28 patients underwent CAS under standard DAT. From 2011 to 2013 (period II), 36 patients prospectively had preoperative assessment of platelet function, and 13 patients with clopidogrel resistance received adjunctive cilostazol (200 mg daily) in addition to standard DAT. The incidence of new ipsilateral ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging a day after CAS and ischemic or hemorrhagic events within 30 days was assessed. RESULTS Clopidogrel resistance was indentified in 12 patients (43%) in period I and 13 patients (36%) in period II (P = .615). In period II, the addition of cilostazol significantly decreased P2Y12 reaction units and % inhibition (P = .006 and P = .005, respectively), and there was a significant difference in P2Y12 reaction units between the two periods. New ipsilateral ischemic lesions were significantly decreased in period II (2/36 patients) compared with period I (7/28 patients; P = .034); however, there was no significant difference in hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive cilostazol (triple antiplatelet therapy) in clopidogrel-resistant patients reduces the rate of clopidogrel resistance and suppresses new ischemic lesions without hemorrhagic complications, as compared with standard DAT. Antiplatelet management based on the evaluation of antiplatelet resistance would be required for prevention of perioperative thromboembolic complications in CAS.","output":"Platelet inhibition by adjunctive cilostazol suppresses the frequency of cerebral ischemic lesions after carotid artery stenting in patients with carotid artery stenosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Podcast audio Podcast audio","output":"Cancer care during the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy: young oncologists perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Notified Body, ovla?tenog za ispitivanje RZO) Dodatne oznake na respiratoru su: NR - Non reusable (za jednokratno kori?tenje, ukupno do 8 h) R - Reusable (za vi?ekratno kori?tenje) D - Testirano dolomitom, ?to daje pove?ani kapacitet zadr?avanja i manji otpor disanja Ovim testom potvreuje se da odreeeni respirator dobro brtvi na lice odreeene osobe, ?to zna?i da se time osigurava stvarna filtracija zraka prema odgovaraju?em APF-u Ako nositelj tijekom testa koji traje cca pola sata ne osjeti prisutnost testne tvari unesene u zrak, smatra se da je odreeeni respirator prikladan za njega","output":"Respiratorna Za?tita, Filtarske Polumaske C Respiratori (ffp 1) I Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Primary results from the Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 studies demonstrated upadacitinib efficacy and safety through 16 weeks in patients with atopic dermatitis. Longer-term outcomes remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term (52 weeks) efficacy and safety of upadacitinib treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 are ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled, replicate phase 3 randomized clinical trials that include adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis at 151 and 154 centers, respectively. Cutoffs for this analysis were December 21, 2020 (Measure Up 1), and January 15, 2021 (Measure Up 2). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive once-daily oral upadacitinib 15 mg, 30 mg, or placebo. At week 16, patients randomized at baseline to receive upadacitinib 15 mg (273 and 260 patients in Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2, respectively) and 30 mg (270 and 268 patients) continued assigned treatment; placebo-treated patients were rerandomized 1:1 to receive upadacitinib 15 mg (121 and 120 patients in Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2, respectively) or 30 mg (123 and 121 patients) in a double-blinded manner. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Safety and efficacy, including 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index and Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with 2 or greater grades of improvement, were assessed. RESULTS: Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 included a total of 1609 patients (mean [SD] age, 33.8 [15.6] years; 727 women [45.2%]; 882 men [54.8%]). Efficacy at week 16 was maintained through week 52. At week 52, 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index was achieved by 82.0% (95% CI, 77.0%-86.9%) and 79.1% (95% CI, 73.9%-84.4%) of patients continuing the 15-mg dose and 84.9% (95% CI, 80.3%-89.5%) and 84.3% (95% CI, 79.6%-89.0%) of patients continuing the 30-mg dose (for Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2, respectively); Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with 2 or greater grades of improvement was achieved by 59.2% (95% CI, 52.9%-65.5%) and 52.6% (95% CI, 46.2%-59.1%) and 62.5% (95% CI, 56.3%-68.7%) and 65.1% (95% CI, 58.9%-71.2%) of patients in the Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 studies, respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was low overall but was slightly higher for the upadacitinib 30-mg dose. Both upadacitinib doses were well tolerated with no new safety signals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis of follow-up data from 2 randomized clinical trials, longer-term treatment of adolescents and adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with upadacitinib demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile, with sustained efficacy responses through 52 weeks.

We evaluated the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on extra- vs intra-cerebral blood flow and on [Formula: see text]. METHODS In 10 healthy males (age 20-54 yr), phenylephrine or ephedrine was infused for an 20 mm Hg increase in mean arterial pressure. Cerebral oxygenation (SavO?) was calculated from the arterial and jugular bulb oxygen saturations. Blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICAf) and blood flow in the external carotid artery (ECAf) were assessed by duplex ultrasonography. Invos-5100c (SinvosO?) and Foresight (SforeO?) determined [Formula: see text] while forehead skin oxygenation (SskinO?) was assessed. RESULTS Phenylephrine reduced SforeO? by 6.9% (95% confidence interval: 4.8-9.0%; P<0.0001), SinvosO? by 10.5 (8.2-12.9%; P<0.0001), and ECAf (6-28%; P=0.0001), but increased ICAf (5-21%; P=0.003) albeit with no consequence for SskinO? or SavO?.

ICAf was stable and ECAf increased by 11 (4-18%; P=0.005) with administration of ephedrine while SskinO? did not change. CONCLUSIONS The effect of phenylephrine on ScO? is governed by a decrease in external carotid blood flow since it increases cerebral blood flow as determined by flow in the internal carotid artery.

Although there are numerous contributing variables to decreased vaccination rates, it is critical to evaluate the impact of the relevant factors. Also, because we are in the midst of a sad epidemic and vaccination for COVID-19 is critical to maintaining public health and limiting the virus's spread, there is a risk of vaccine rejection on the horizon. Methods Five hundred and fourteen married Riyadh inhabitants aged 18 years and over were issued an online Web-based survey. The research took place from June to October 2020. The study calculates the percentage of vaccination apprehension and analyzes immunization attitudes and knowledge. It also contrasts the participants' attitudes regarding vaccines before and during the COVID-19 global pandemic, as well as the associated causes for vaccine reluctance and rejection. Result The majority of the respondents (48.1%) were between 37C47 and 26C36 years of age (37.5%). Females (80%) made up the majority of the group. Around 66.3% of participants have a bachelor's degree, and 80.8% have an average monthly income. During the pandemic, 38.5% of participants said they do not want to be vaccinated. When comparing vaccine-hesitant participants' sociodemographic characteristics, it was discovered that the percentage of vaccine-hesitant participants was significantly higher in the younger age-group (<36 years), those who had been married for more than 10 years, those with 1C3 children (p < 0.001), and those who did not work (p = 0.002).

In this article, we show that an abundance of information can be extracted from contact tracing for COVID-19 prevention and control, providing the first data-driven evidence that supports the wide implementation of such APPs. Specifically, we construct a temporal contact graph that quantifies the daily contacts between infectious and susceptible individuals by exploiting a large volume of location related data contributed by 10,527,737 smartphone users in Wuhan, China. Five time-varying indicators we introduce can accurately capture actual contact trends at individual and population levels, demonstrating that travel restriction in Wuhan played an important role in containing COVID-19. We reveal a strong correlation (Pearson coefficient 0.929) between daily confirmed cases and daily total contacts, which can be utilized as a new and efficient way to evaluate and predict the evolving epidemic situation of COVID-19. Further, we find that there is a prominent distinction of contact behaviors between the infected and uninfected contacted individuals, and design an infection risk evaluation framework to identify infected ones. This can help narrow down the search of high risk contacted individuals for quarantine. Our results indicate that user involvement has an explicit impact on individual-level contact trend estimation while minor impact on situation evaluation, offering guidelines for governments to implement contact tracing APPs.","output":"Temporal Contact Graph Reveals the Evolving Epidemic Situation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lead halide perovskite has in recent years gained widespread interest due to its excellent physical and chemical properties, as well as superior optoelectronic performance.

To date, the use of conventional chemical oxidants (e.g., chlorine) represent the main applied process for wastewater (WW) disinfection following a series of operational advantages. However, toxicity linked to the production of highly dangerous disinfection by-products (DBPs) has been widely demonstrated. Therefore, in recent years, there is an increasing attention to implement sustainable processes, which can simultaneously guarantee the microbiological quality of the WWs treated and the protection of both humans and the environment. This review focuses on treatments based on ultraviolet radiation (UV) alone or in combination with other processes (sonophotolysis, photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis with both natural and artificial light) without the dosage of chemical oxidants. The strengths of these technologies and the most significant critical issues are reported. To date, the use of synthetic waters in laboratory tests despite real waters, the capital and operative costs and the limited, or absent, experience of full-scale plant management (especially for UV-based combined processes) represent the main limits to their application on a larger scale. Although further in-depth studies are required to ensure full applicability of UV-based combined processes in WWTPs for reuse of their purified effluents, excellent prospects are presented thanks to an absent environmental impact in terms of DBPs formation and excellent disinfection yields of microorganisms (in most cases higher than 3-log reduction).","output":"Disinfection of Wastewater by UV-Based Treatment for Reuse in a Circular Economy Perspective.

The primary objective of this study was to understand the prevalence of burnout in gastroenterology and ascertain if there was a common prevalence within the field. The secondary objective was to identify factors and job-related stressors that commonly contribute to burnout in gastroenterologists. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and PsycINFO by two reviewers independently for articles published to 1 September 2020. The primary outcome measure was the reported prevalence of burnout in gastroenterologists. The secondary outcome measures were (i) the prevalence of non-somatic burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment) and (ii) the frequency of risk factors and stressors reported in studies. Data were presented and limited meta-analyses discussed. RESULTS Data were extracted from 11 studies. 54.5% (6/11) of these studies reported the prevalence of burnout in gastroenterologists; this ranged from 18.3% to 64.4%. Similar to burnout prevalence, burnout symptoms showed geographical variation and were common in gastroenterologists (up to 63.9%). Factors associated with work volume, age, and female gender were the three most frequently reported risk factors for increased levels of stress and burnout in 72.7% (8/11), 54.5% (6/11), and 45.5% (5/11) of studies respectively.

Critics have claimed that some methods, such as counting deaths with COVID-19 rather than deaths from COVID-19, resulted in overcounts of COVID-19 deaths. While it is clear from alternate measures like excess mortality that all states undercounted COVID-19 deaths, we investigated whether different methods had any effect on state death reporting. Methods & Materials We identified the methods states use to report COVID-19 deaths on their dashboards, then compared state-reported data collected by CDC in its COVID Data Tracker against data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)s national review of death certificates measuring deaths from COVID-19. Comparing state data against this standardized national dataset allowed us to see if state definitions affected their reporting. Results Contrary to critics claims, few states have definitions that could systematically include individuals who died of causes unrelated to COVID-19. State death definitions instead vary along two lines: whether positive PCR tests were required to count COVID-19 deathswith states requiring tests having cumulative totals 9.03% lower than NCHS data, while states not requiring them had totals 10.21% higher (p=.06)and whether states exclusively used death certificates to measure COVID-19 deaths, with these states totals coming in 27.63% higher than NCHS data, compared to 3.26% higher for states using additional information (p=.11). Conclusion Rather than certain methods leading to systematic overcounts of COVID-19 deaths, it appears some methods could be especially prone to undercounts. Only states using death certificate reviews had counts substantially higher than NCHS data, and since NCHS also uses death certificates, the difference appears to be a matter of the faster speed of state review. Meanwhile, many states using different methods have discovered they missed large quantities of COVID-19 deaths in their counts. The CDC should have provided leadership to states on how they should report COVID-19 deaths to avoid any preventable undercounts, and public communication to quell misinformation about overcounts.","output":"Methods for Counting COVID-19 Deaths in US States and Territories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exhaled aerosol particles play an important role in the transmission of SARS-CoV?2, particularly when many people gather indoors. This article summarises the knowledge on virus transmission in schools and practical measures to reduce aerosol-driven infections. A central preventive measure is to enhance room and building ventilation, i.e. the exchange of possibly contaminated indoor air with ambient air. Besides the concentrations of possibly infectious particles, ventilation reduces carbon dioxide concentrations, humidity and other chemical substances in indoor air as well. Irrespective of ventilation, face masks (surgical or FFP2) represent a vital part of hygiene measures. Fixed or mobile air purifiers can support these measures particularly when rooms providing only poor ventilation must be utilized. The article reflects the state of knowledge in October 2021 of the various techniques that have been shown as useful for the prevention of indirect infections. New variants of SARS-CoV?2, the progress of the vaccination campaign in children and adolescents, and the increase in general immunity might require a re-evaluation of the prevention strategies described. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed common deficits in room and building ventilation, not least in schools. Apart from short-term measures for the prevention of airborne infectious diseases, a long-term strategy seems advisable to alleviate the deficits encountered in schools with respect to room and building ventilation.

Therefore, a question arises of whether organizations are ready to use modern e-health solutions in the context of a rapidly and radically changing situation, and how this readiness can be verified. The aim of this article is to clarify the organizational e-heath readiness concept of Polish primary healthcare units. This study employs the triangulation of analytical methods, as it uses: (i) a literature review of e-health readiness assessment, (ii) primary data obtained with a survey (random sampling of 371 managers of PHC facilities across Poland) and (iii) the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method, employed to estimate the structural model. The evaluation of the model revealed that its concept was adequate for more mature entities that focus on the patient- and employee-oriented purpose of digitization, and on assuring excellent experience derived from a consistent care process. In the context of patients' restricted access to medical facilities and limited social mobility, a simpler version of the research model assesses the readiness more adequately. Finally, the study increases the knowledge base of assets (resources and capabilities), which will help healthcare systems better understand the challenges surrounding the adoption and scaling of e-health technologies.","output":"Organizational e-Health Readiness: How to Prepare the Primary Healthcare Providers' Services for Digital Transformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reclaimed water (RW) has been widely used as an alternative water resource to recharge rivers in mega-city Beijing. At the same time, the RW also recharges the ambient aquifers through riverbank filtration and modifies the subsurface hydrodynamic system and hydrochemical characteristics. To assess the impact of RW recharge on the unconfined groundwater system, we conducted a 3D groundwater flow and solute transport model based on 10 years of sequenced groundwater monitoring data to analyze the changes of the groundwater table, Cl- loads, and NO3-N loads in the shallow aquifer after RW recharge to the river channel. The results show that the groundwater table around the river channel elevated by about 3-4 m quickly after RW recharge from Dec. 2007 to Dec. 2009, and then remained stable due to the continuous RW infiltration. However, the unconfined groundwater storage still declined overall from 2007 to 2014 due to groundwater exploitation. The storage began to recover after groundwater extraction reduction, rising from 3.76  108 m3 at the end of 2014 to 3.85  108 m3 at the end of 2017. Cl- concentrations varied from 5-75 mg/L before RW recharge to 50-130 mg/L in 2 years (2007-2009), and then remained stable. The zones of the unconfined groundwater quality affected by RW infiltration increased from 11.7 km2 in 2008 to 26.7 km2 in 2017. Cl- loads in the zone increased from 1.8  103 t in 2008 to 3.8  103 t in 2017, while NO3-N loads decreased from 29.8 t in 2008 to 11.9 t in 2017 annually. We determined the maximum area of the unconfined groundwater quality affected by RW, and groundwater outside this area not affected by RW recharge keeps its original state. The RW recharge to the river channel in the study area is beneficial to increase the groundwater table and unconfined groundwater storage with lesser environmental impacts.","output":"Numerical modeling of changes in groundwater storage and nitrate load in the unconfined aquifer near a river receiving reclaimed water"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant advances have been made in minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) over the past 3 decades.

Reports of patients presenting with syncope and pre-syncope, as well as hypoxemia without symptoms of dyspnea (silent hypoxemia), have led researchers to speculate whether SARS-CoV-2 can alter autonomic nervous system function. As viral infections are commonly reported triggers of altered autonomic control, we must consider whether SARS-CoV-2 can also interfere with autonomic activity, at least in some patients. As we are still in the early stages of understanding COVID-19, we still do not know whether syncope and silent hypoxemia are more strongly associated with COVID-19 compared to any other viral infections that severely compromise gas exchange. Therefore, in this perspective we discuss these two intriguing clinical presentations, as they relate to autonomic nervous system function. In our discussion, we will explore COVID-specific, as well as non-COVID specific mechanisms that may affect autonomic activity and potential therapeutic targets. As we move forward in our understanding of COVID-19, well-designed prospective studies with appropriate control and comparator groups will be necessary to identify potential unique effects of COVID-19 on autonomic function.","output":"Syncope and silent hypoxemia in COVID-19: Implications for the autonomic field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dermatological problems are the most widely spread skin diseases amongst human beings. They can be infectious, chronic, and sometimes may also lead to serious health problems such as skin cancer. Generally, rural area clinics lack trained dermatologists and mostly rely on the analysis of remotely accessible experts through mobile-based networks for sharing the images and other related information. Under such circumstances, poor image quality introduced due to the capturing device results in misleading diagnosis. Here, a genetic-algorithm- (GA-) based approach used as an image enhancement technique has been explored to improve the low quality of the dermatological images received from the rural clinic. The diagnosis is performed on the enhanced images using convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the identification of the diseases. The scope of this paper is limited to only motion blurred images, which is the most prevalent problem in capturing of the images, specifically when any of the two (device or the object) may move unpredictably. Seven types of skin diseases, namely, melanoma, melanocytic nevus, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, benign keratosis, vascular lesion, and squamous cell carcinoma, have been investigated using ResNet-152 giving an overall accuracy of 87.40% for the blurred images. Use of GA-enhanced images increased the accuracy to 95.85%. The results were further analyzed using a confusion matrix and t-test-based statistical investigations. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it reduces the analysis time and errors due to manual diagnosis. Furthermore, speedy and reliable diagnosis at the earliest stage reduces the risk of developing more severe skin problems.","output":"An Evolutionary Approach for the Enhancement of Dermatological Images and Their Classification Using Deep Learning Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\\\","output":"Are health care policies for COVID\\\\19 evidence\\\\based?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of the aesthetic result of breast reconstruction surgery from the perspective of plastic surgeons compared with physicians who are not specialists in plastic surgery. METHODS: Twenty patients who underwent breast reconstruction after mastectomy had their aesthetic results evaluated by 16 plastic surgeons and 16 nonplastic physicians, yielding a total of 620 ratings (320 ratings from plastic surgeons and 320 ratings from other specialists). For all analyses, the level of rejection adopted for the null hypothesis was 5% (p-value <0.05). RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the two groups. On average, medical professionals who specialized in plastic surgery always obtained higher scores than other physicians. However, no significant differences were found in the assessment of the aesthetic outcome of breast reconstruction according to the sex of the rating medical professional for any of the assessments considered in this study. A strong positive linear correlation between the time since training in the medical specialty of plastic surgery (r=0.750, p=0.001) and the mean aesthetic outcome score was observed in this study.

CURE was recently piloted within a single trust in Greater Manchester, with preliminary evidence suggesting this intervention may be successful in improving patient outcomes. Plans are currently underway to pilot a model based upon CURE in other sites across England. To inform implementation, we conducted a qualitative study, which aimed to identify factors influencing healthcare professionals implementation behaviour within the pilot site. METHODS: Individual, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 10 purposively sampled health professionals involved in the delivery and implementation of the CURE project pilot. Topic guides were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Transcripts were analysed in line with the framework method, with data coded to TDF domains to highlight important areas of influence and then mapped to the COM-B to support future intervention development. RESULTS: Eight TDF domains were identified as important areas influencing CURE implementation; environmental context and resources (physical opportunity), social influence (social opportunity), goals, professional role and identity and beliefs about consequences (reflective motivation), reinforcement (automatic motivation), skills and knowledge (psychological capability). Most domains had the potential to both hinder and/or facilitate implementation, with the exception of beliefs about consequences and knowledge, which were highlighted as facilitators of CURE. Participants suggested that environmental context and resources was the most important factor influencing implementation; with barriers most often related to challenges integrating into the wider healthcare context. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study identified multi-level barriers and facilitators to CURE implementation. The use of theoretical frameworks allowed for the identification of domains known to influence behaviour change, and thus can be taken forward to develop targeted interventions to support future service implementation. Future work should focus on discussing these findings with a broad range of stakeholders, to ensure resultant intervention strategies are feasible and practicable within a healthcare context.

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the capacity of the many healthcare systems and created cascading economic impacts on interdependent sectors of the global society. This paper specifically explores the impact of pandemics on the workforce. The model proposed in this paper comprises of three major steps. First, sources for epidemic curves are identified to generate the attack rate, which is the daily number of infections normalized with respect to the population of the affected region. Second, the model assumes that the general attack rate can be specialized to reflect sector-specific workforce classifications, noting that each economic sector has varying dependence on the workforce. Third, using economic input-output (IO) data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, this paper analyzes the performance of several mitigation and suppression measures relative to a baseline pandemic scenario. Results from the IO simulations demonstrate the extent to which mitigation and suppression measures can flatten the curve. This paper concludes with reflections on other consequences of pandemics such as the mental health impacts associated with social isolation and the disproportionate effects on different socioeconomic groups.","output":"Using input-output analysis to model the impact of pandemic mitigation and suppression measures on the workforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic around the world is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV2) in humans. SARS-CoV2 is an enveloped virus and E proteins present in them are reported to form ion channels, which is mainly associated with pathogenesis. Thus, there is always a quest to inhibit these ion channels, which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV2 in humans. Considering this, in the present study, authors employed computational approaches for studying the structure as well as function of the human SARS-CoV2 E protein as well as its interaction with various phytochemicals. Result obtained revealed that -helix and loops present in this protein experience random movement under optimal condition, which in turn modulate ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates. However, after binding with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E, and Vibsanol B, the random motion of the human SARS-CoV2 E protein gets reduced, this, in turn, inhibits the function of the SARS-CoV2 E protein. It is pertinent to note that two amino acids, namely VAL25 and PHE26, play a key role while interacting with these three phytochemicals. As these three phytochemicals, namely, Belachinal, Macaflavanone E & Vibsanol B, have passed the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) property as well as Lipinskis Rule of 5s, they may be utilized as drugs in controlling disease caused via SARS-COV2, after further investigation.

METHODS: A prospective observational study including patients hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19 in a COVID unit was performed from 20th March to 5th April 2020, in Perpignan, France. Patients for which there was a doubt upon diagnosis, who were recently under oral corticosteroids, had myeloid malignancy or human immunodeficient virus infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using an RT-PCR assay, from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Complete blood count were performed for all patients. RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-one patient were included: 57 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 64 patients were not. Eosinophil count was lower in the COVID-19 group (median: 0/L versus 70/L, p < 0.0001). To diagnose COVID-19, eosinopenia had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 78.1% while lymphopenia's were 73.7% and 62.5% respectively. Using area under curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves, eosinophil's optimal cut-off level was 10/L, sensitivity and specificity were 86%, and 79.7% respectively. Regarding the eosinophil/PMN ratio, the optimal cut-off level was 3.344, sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% and 73.4% respectively. The AUC of lymphocyte/PMN ratio was significantly lower than eosinophil/PMN ratio's (0.621 versus 0.846, p = 0.0003).

Typically, lung function is assessed using in-clinic medical equipment, and quite recently, via portable spirometry devices. Research has shown that the obstruction and restriction in the respiratory airways affect individuals' voice characteristics. Hence, audio features could play a role in predicting the lung function and severity of the obstruction.

In this study, we carried out a virtual screening for almost all members of ARBs (nine) against COVID-19 main protease. Molecular docking as one of the important computational techniques was performed in this work. Interestingly, the tested compounds showed variable binding affinities in the order of N3 inhibitor (10, docked) > Fimasartan (8) > Candesartan (2) > Olmesartan (7) > Azilsartan (9) > Eprosartan (5) > Valsartan (3) > Losartan (1) > Irbesartan (6) > Telmisartan (4). Moreover, Fimasartan (8), Candesartan (2), and Olmesartan (7) were additionally estimated through molecular dynamic simulations monitored via computing the binding free energy using MM-GBSA. The results are promising for rapidly repurposing such drugs (especially, Fimasartan (8) and Candesartan (2)) after further preclinical and clinical studies either alone or in combination with others for the treatment of COVID-19 virus especially known to cause vasodilatation (to prevent blood coagulation) and to reduce inflammation and fibrosis (to prevent pulmonary fibrosis), with well-known safety profiles.

Ideally, anti-COVID-19 masks should protect the carrier not only by size exclusion of virus aerosol particles, but also be able to capture and destroy or inactivate the virus. Here we present the proof-of-concept of a filter mat for such a mask, which actively attracts aerosol droplets and kills the virus. The electrospun mats are made of polycaprolactone (PCL) a hydrophilic, functionalizable and biodegradable polyester, into which inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) a physiological biocompatible, biodegradable and antivirally active polymer (chain length, 40 P(i) units) has been integrated. A soluble Na-polyP as well as amorphous calcium polyP nanoparticles (Ca-polyP-NP) have been used. In this composition, the polyP component of the polyP-PCL mats is stable in aqueous protein-free environment, but capable of transforming into a gel-like coacervate upon contact with divalent cations and protein like mucin present in (virus containing) aerosol droplets. In addition, the Ca-polyP-NP are used as a carrier of tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) which blocks the function of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein, an ion channel forming viroporin. The properties of this novel mask filter mats are as follows: First, to attract and to trap virus-like particles during the polyP coacervate formation induced in situ by aerosol droplets on the spun PCL fibers, as shown here by using SARS-CoV-2 mimicking fluorescent nanoparticles. Second, after disintegration the NP by the aerosol-mucus constituents, to release polyP that binds to and abolishes the function of the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein. Third, to destroy the virus by releasing tretinoin, as shown by the disruption of virus-mimicking liposomes with the integrated recombinant viral viroporin.

Arginase I (ARG1) and arginase II (ARG2) compete with NO synthases for their common substrate L-arginine, therefore influencing the NO formation. We examined here whether ARG1 and ARG2 genotypes and haplotypes affect the changes in blood pressure and NO bioavailability in response to propofol. METHODS: Venous blood samples were collected from 167 patients at baseline and after 10 min of anesthesia with propofol. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Nitrite concentrations were measured by using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay, while NOx (nitrites + nitrates) levels were determined by using the Griess reaction. RESULTS: We found that patients carrying the AG + GG genotypes for the rs3742879 polymorphism in ARG2 gene and the ARG2 GC haplotype show lower increases in nitrite levels and lower decreases in blood pressure after propofol anesthesia. On the other hand, subjects carrying the variant genotypes for the rs10483801 polymorphism in ARG2 gene show more intense decreases in blood pressure (CA genotype) and/or higher increases in nitrite levels (CA and AA genotypes) in response to propofol. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ARG2 variants affect the hypotensive responses to propofol, possibly by modifying NO bioavailability.

Methods: The Target to B! SARS-CoV-2 study is a multicentre study, taking place in 7 Dutch academic hospitals. Patients with the following IMIDs were recruited: Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), autoimmune hepatitis, rheumatic (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), neurological (e.g. multiple sclerosis) and dermatological IMIDs (e.g. atopic dermatitis). Patients were recruited based on immunosuppressants (table 1) and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The control group consisted of healthy subjects and IMID patients without immunosuppressants. SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies were measured 28 days after completed SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Seroconversion was defined as anti-RBD IgG >4 AU/mL. In this , we focus on therapies relevant for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and present results for these treatments from patients with IBD, but also other IMIDs. Results: Numbers of recruited patients with each immunosuppressant are shown in table 1. Amongst these patients, 312 patients had CD and 176 UC, the rest was diagnosed with another IMID. Seroconversion was reduced in patients receiving sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) modulators (all multiple sclerosis patients) while seroconversion was similar to controls in the other treatment groups. However, use of Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF), methotrexate, janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor monotherapy and all combination therapies (except for corticosteroids combined with other immunosuppressants) were associated with reduced Sars-CoV-2 antibody titres. Patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher median antibody titres after second vaccination than those without a previous SARSCoV- 2 infection. The type of IMID did not affect seroconversion rates. Conclusion: No immunosuppressant, registered for IBD, reduced the rates of seroconversion after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Some immunosuppressants were associated with lower antibody titres. However, the clinical relevance of lower antibody titres remains unknown. S1P modulators, had a clear negative impact on the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. This might be relevant in the future as this therapy is currently being approved for UC. Disease aetiology did not impair immunity against SARS-CoV-2 immunity after vaccination. Disclaimer: Absolute numbers of antibody titres and rates of seroconversion will be reported at the conference and are not reported in this as this might negatively impact the current submission process.","output":"Humoral immune response after SARSCoV- 2 vaccination in patients with immunemediated inflammatory diseases treated with immunosuppressive therapy-a Target to B! study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tremendous use of plastic products to averse the infection rate during Covid-19 pandemic has developed great pressure on the management and disposal systems of plastic waste.

National reports have declared such schools to connote risk for elevated problems among teens. Asian American students are commonly referred to as model minorities, but little is known about adjustment issues within academically competitive settings, specifically. Guided by past research on culturally salient issues, multiple U.S. high schools were examined to (a) determine areas of relative strength versus weakness in adjustment of Asian Americans compared with Whites, and (b) more importantly, to illuminate salient within-group processes related to Asian Americans' well-being. Risk modifiers examined were perceptions of ethnic discrimination, parent perfectionism, internalized achievement pressure, authenticity in self-presentation, and closeness to school adults. Outcome variables included depression, anxiety, and isolation at school. Results demonstrated that Asian Americans fared better than Whites on anxiety and school isolation, but with low effect sizes. By contrast, they fared more poorly on almost all risk modifiers, with a large effect size on discrimination. Regression results showed that among Asian Americans the most consistent associations, across cohorts and outcomes, were for discrimination and authenticity. Findings underscore the need for greater recognition that discrimination could be inimical for students not typically thought of as vulnerable-Asian Americans in high-achieving schools; these issues are especially pressing in light of increased racism following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results also suggest that feelings of inauthenticity could be a marker of generalized vulnerability to internalizing symptoms. Implications for future theory and interventions are discussed.

The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds.

During the Spring of 2020, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA experienced a surge of COVID-19 ICU cases. Many of these patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) with hemodialysis (HD) or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) which taxed our hospital's supply of equipment and staff. The goal of our study was to identify predictors of mortality in ICU patients requiring RRT in the setting of COVID-19, should rationing of ICU care became necessary. Methods: Between March 2020 and April 2020, we prospectively collected data on patients admitted to the Lahey ICUs with severe COVID-19 who required RRT and assessed patient characteristics and mortality. Results: Thirty ICU patients were identified with severe COVID-19 requiring RRT. Twenty-seven patients (90%) required acute initiation of CVVH, while three (10%) only utilized intermittent HD during their hospitalization. Only ten (33%) survived their hospitalization. No significant difference was found between survivors and patients who died with respect to age, comorbidities (BMI, CKD, HTN, DM, alcohol use, heart disease, malignancy, COPD, asthma) or baseline creatinine. All 30 patients (100%) required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 25 (83%) developed shock requiring vasopressors prior to initiation of RRT. Seventy percent of survivors (7/10) had been on either an ACE-inhibitor (ACEI) or an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) prior to hospitalization, compared to only 20% (4/20) who died (p=0.0147) Survivors were treated with hydroxychloroquine (HC) significantly more frequently (10/10 vs 8/20;p=0.0016) and treated with systemic corticosteroids (CS) significantly less frequently (5/10 vs 20/20;p=0.0018) than those who died. There was no difference in survival between those who received Vancomycin or Tocilizumab and those who did not. The median hospital stay was significantly longer for survivors (46 days) than for those who died (19 days;p =0.0003). Conclusion: The need for RRT in ICU patients with COVID-19 was associated with significant mortality (66%) and a significant need for MV (100%) and vasopressors (83%). The use of an ACEI or ARB prior to admission was significantly associated with improved survival, the use of CS was associated with higher mortality, and the use of HC was associated with improved survival. These latter findings go against current theories of COVID pathophysiology and may be a result of the small number of patients in our study.","output":"Predictors of mortality in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 and renal failure-the Lahey experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 has been implicated in a number of extra-pulmonary manifestations including rhabdomyolysis.

To develop new recruitment and retention strategies, therefore, we need to draw on as wide a variation in blood donor motivations as possible. The primary aim of this study is to draw on a large survey of donors to develop a broad, theoretically instantiated typology of donor motivations to identify new and less common, yet practically important, motivations that have not been previously reported. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the UK Blood Donor Survey run by NHS Blood and Transplant/Public Health England Epidemiology Unit (N = 61 123 donors), we analyze fixed (N = 52 225) and free (N = 8867) responses to develop a more comprehensive typology of blood donor motivations based on theories from the biology, psychology, philosophy, economics, and sociology of altruism. RESULTS: We identified 54 motivations, including a number of newly identified motivations, for blood donations which we organized into 12 superordinate categories (eg, \\"inspiration via moral elevation,\\" \\"perceived social closeness,\\" and \\"fungibility of donations\\"). These are linked to intervention suggestions such as donating blood in memoriam or donating blood as an alternative to other charitable acts. CONCLUSION: We present the most comprehensive account of blood donor motivations to-date.

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is the most widely prospective hazard analysis used in healthcare. FMEA relies on brainstorming by multi-disciplinary teams to identify hazards. This approach has two major weaknesses: significant time and human resources investments, and lack of complete, and error free results. OBJECTIVES: To introduce the algorithmic prediction of failure modes in healthcare (APFMH); to examine whether APFMH is leaner in resources allocation in comparison to the traditional FMEA and whether it ensures complete identification of hazards. METHODS: The patient identification during imaging process at the emergency department of Sheba Medical Center, was analyzed by FMEA and APFMH, independently and separately. We compared the hazards predicted by APFMH and FMEA methods; the total participants' working hours invested in each process; adverse events, categorized as \\"patient identification\\", before and after the recommendations resulted from the above processes were implemented. RESULTS: APFMH is more effective in identifying hazards (P<0.0001) and is leaner in resources than the traditional FMEA: the former used 21 hours whereas the latter required 63. Following implementing the recommendations, the adverse events decreased by 44% annually (P=0.0026). Most adverse events were preventable, had all recommendations have been fully implemented. CONCLUSION: In the light of our initial and limited in size study, APFMH is more effective in identifying hazards (P<0.0001) and is leaner in resources than the traditional FMEA. APFMH is suggested as an alternative to FMEA that is leaner in time and human resources, ensures more complete hazard identification and is especially valuable during crisis time, when new protocols are often adopted, such as in the current days of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Algorithmic Prediction Of Failure Modes In Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2020 will forever be marked as a year that brought with it an unprecedented number of challenges for the healthcare community.

Proliferation (MTT assay), cytokines (Elisa kits), ATP levels, cytotoxic effect (micronucleus test) and oxidative markers (glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents) were investigated after 48-h incubation. Our results showed that H2O2/FeSO4 treatment induced a reduction in T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion and ATP levels associated to an evident intracellular oxidative stress, inflammatory profile and DNA damage. Addition of L1 at 100 M was able to increase cell proliferation, IL-2, IL-4 and INF secretion and ATP contents and to reduce hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents, catalase activity and micronuclei number in lymphocytes under oxidative stress, with a partial protection. The [Cu(L1)] exhibited protective effects in T lymphocytes by inhibiting H2O2/FeSO4 - induced cell proliferation suppression, inflammatory status, ATP loss and oxidative stress generation, whatever the concentration used.

We performed an exome-wide rare variant analysis of six AD biomarkers (-amyloid, total/phosphorylated tau, NfL, YKL-40, and Neurogranin) to discover genes associated with these markers. Genetic and biomarker information was available for 480 participants from two studies: EMIF-AD and ADNI. We applied a principal component (PC) analysis to derive biomarkers combinations, which represent statistically independent biological processes. We then tested whether rare variants in 9576 protein-coding genes associate with these PCs using a Meta-SKAT test. We also tested whether the PCs are intermediary to gene effects on AD symptoms with a SMUT test. One PC loaded on NfL and YKL-40, indicators of neuronal injury and inflammation. Four genes were associated with this PC: IFFO1, DTNB, NLRC3, and SLC22A10. Mediation tests suggest, that these genes also affect dementia symptoms via inflammation/injury. We also observed an association between a PC loading on Neurogranin, a marker for synaptic functioning, with GABBR2 and CASZ1, but no mediation effects. The results suggest that rare variants in IFFO1, DTNB, NLRC3, and SLC22A10 heighten susceptibility to neuronal injury and inflammation, potentially by altering cytoskeleton structure and immune activity disinhibition, resulting in an elevated dementia risk. GABBR2 and CASZ1 were associated with synaptic functioning, but mediation analyses suggest that the effect of these two genes on synaptic functioning is not consequential for AD development.","output":"Rare variants in IFFO1, DTNB, NLRC3 and SLC22A10 associate with Alzheimer's disease CSF profile of neuronal injury and inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Choriocarcinoma is a rare neoplasm, which is commonly treated with chemotherapy.

In particular, solid organ transplant patients are subjected to increased morbidity and mortality from infection. In the face of these challenges, transplant centers need to develop innovative protocols to ensure high-quality care. METHODS: A multidisciplinary protocol was developed that included the following: virtual selection meetings, coronavirus disease 2019 negative donors, pretransplant symptom screening, rapid testing on presentation, telehealth follow-up, and weekly community outreach town halls. All orthotopic liver transplants completed between January 2018 and August 2020 were included in the study (n = 344). The cohort was stratified from January 2018 to February 2020 as \\"pre-COVID-19,\\" and from March 2020 to August 2020 as \\"COVID-19.\\" Patient demographics and postoperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS: From March 2020 to August 2020, there was a significant decrease in average monthly referrals for orthotopic liver transplantation (29.8 vs 37.1, P = .01). However, listings (11.0 vs 14.3, P = .09) and transplant volume remained unchanged (12.2 vs 10.6, P = .26). Rapid testing was utilized on arrival for transplant, zero patients tested positively preoperatively, and median time from test result until abdominal incision was 4.5 h [interquartile range, 1.2, 9.2]. Simultaneously, telehealth visits increased rapidly, peaking at 85% of all visits. It is important to note that there was no difference in outcomes between cohorts.

The development of new methods for early screening of cancers is highly desired. Targeted metallomics has been successfully applied in the screening of cancers through quantification of elements in the matrix, which is time consuming and requires combined techniques for the quantification due to the large elemental difference in the matrix. This work proposed a non-targeted metallomics (NTM) approach through synchrotron radiation based X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the screening of cancers. One hundred serum samples were collected from cancer patients who were confirmed by pathological examination with 100 matched serum samples from healthy volunteers. The serum samples were studied with SRXRF and the spectra from both groups were directly clarified through MLAs, which did not require the quantification of elements. The NTM approach through SRXRF and MLAs is fast (5s for data collection for one sample) and accurate (over 96% accuracy) for cancer screening. Besides, this approach can also identify the most affected elements in cancer samples like Ca, Zn and Ti as we found, which may shed lights on the drug development for cancer treatment. This NTM approach can also be applied through commercially available XRF instruments or ICP-TOF-MS with MLAs.

This plant has increasingly been used by local folk as a treatment for cancer or cancer-related symptoms though its bioactivity has not been scientifically determined. This investigation also sought to identify constituent compounds in the crude extract preparations responsible for their antiproliferative efficacy. The antiproliferative effects of six-leaf extracts on Jurkat-T in vitro were investigated using the Trypan blue exclusion assay. The extracts were tested with increasing concentration, using chlorambucil as a standard anticancer drug. Cytotoxicity of extracts was determined against RAW 264.7 cells using a colorimetric tetrazolium-based assay. In additionthe ability of the extracts to induce apoptosis was determined for the most potent leaf extracts. The order of potency of the leaf extracts of D. kilimandscharicus against Jurkat-T cell line was found to be MeOH < Ethyl Acetate < DCM: MeOH < EtOH with IC50s of 33.56, 30.44, 22.93, and 21.59 g/mL, respectively.

Colonoscopy capacity is an important constraint, limiting the number of primary tests offered. Many European programmes lack sufficient colonoscopy capacity to provide optimal screening intensity regarding screening age ranges, intervals and FIT cut-offs. It is currently unclear how to optimise programmes within colonoscopy capacity constraints. Design: The MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model was used to determine if more effective CRC screening programmes can be identified within existing colonoscopy capacity. The model assessed 525 strategies of varying screening intervals, age ranges and FIT cut-offs, including previously unevaluated 4 and 5 year screening intervals. These strategies were compared with policy decisions taken in Ireland to provide CRC screening within available colonoscopy capacity. Outcomes estimated net costs, quality-adjusted-life-years and required colonoscopy numbers. The optimal strategies within finite colonoscopy capacity constraints were identified. Results: Combining a reduced FIT cut-off of 10 micrograms Hb/g, an extended screening interval of 4 years and an age range of 60-72 years requires 6% fewer colonoscopies, reduces net costs by 23% while preventing 15% more CRC deaths and saving 16% more QALYs relative to current policy. Conclusion: Previously overlooked longer screening intervals may balance optimal cancer prevention with finite colonoscopy capacity constraints. Simple changes to screening configurations could save lives, reduce costs, and relieve colonoscopy capacity pressures. These findings are directly relevant to CRC screening programmes across Europe that employ FIT-based testing and face colonoscopy capacity constraints.","output":"Colorectal cancer screening within colonoscopy capacity constraints: can FIT-based programmes save more lives by trading-off more sensitive test cut-offs against longer screening intervals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging health care systems worldwide; none more so than critical and intensive care settings.

Approximately 15% of patients will develop a distress syndrome responsible in most cases of mortality. A host hyperinflammatory response induced by a cytokine storm, is the main cause of this severe complication. Chemotherapy myelosuppression is associated with higher risk of infections and mortality in cancer patients. There have been no previous reports about the clinical management of patients with neutropenia and concomitant COVID- 19. Herein, we present a multicenter experience in several hospitals during COVID-19 outbreak in neutropenic cancer patients infected by SARSCov- 2. Methods: Retrospective clinical data were collected from clinical reports. Protocol was approved by a Clinical Research Ethics Committee (HULP: PI-4194). Inclusion criteria were cancer patients with neutropenia (&lt;1500 cells/mm3) and concomitant COVID-19 infection. Comorbidities, tumor type and stage, treatment, neutropenia severity, filgrastim (G-CSF), COVID-19 parameters and mortality were analyzed. Exploratory analysis included a description of all data collected and bivariate analyses among different pairs of variables, including their impact in mortality in this cohort. In addition, multivariable logistic regression was used to predict respiratory failure and death as a function of multiple variables. Results: Among 943 patients with cancer screened in 14 hospitals in Spain, eighty-three patients (8%) had a febrile neutropenia and COVID-19 infection. Lung (26%), breast (22%), colorectal (13%) and digestive noncolorectal (17%) cancers were the main locations and most patients had advanced disease (67%). Fifty-three (63%) of patients included died because respiratory failure. Neumonia was presented in 76% of patients, bilateral in 47% and 12% of all patients had thrombotic events. The median of neutrophils was 650cls/mm3 and 49% received GCSF with a median of days on treatment around 4,5 days. Among all variables related with mortality in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19 infection, we found that the number of days with GCSF showed a significant trend toward worse outcome and higher mortality. In particular, a logistic regression model was developed to predict respiratory failure, as a function of the number of days of G-CSF treatment. As adjusting covariates, sex, age, treatment purpose (palliative vs curative, to adjust for patient status), tumor type, and the lowest level of neutrophils in the patient (to adjust for neutropenic status) were used. A significant effect was obtained for the days of G-CSF treatment (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.03, 1.92], p-value = 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a prolonged G-CSF treatment could be disadvantageous for these cancer patients with COVID-19, with a higher probability of worse outcome.","output":"A multicenter analysis of the outcome of cancer patients with neutropenia and COVID-19 infection optionally treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic amplified existing inequities in higher education.

Therefore, clarifying the incidence and clinical characteristics of olfactory and taste disorders in Chinese COVID\\\\19 patients is of great significance and urgency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, which included 229 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 confirmed patients, through face\\\\to\\\\face interviews and telephone follow\\\\up. Following the completion of questionnaires, the patients participating in the study, were categorized according to the degree of olfactory and taste disorders experienced, and the proportion of each clinical type of patient with olfactory and taste disorders and the time when symptoms appeared were recorded. RESULTS: Among the 229 patients, 31 (13.54%) had olfactory dysfunction, and 44 (19.21%) had gustatory dysfunction. For the patients with olfactory dysfunction, 6 (19.35%) developed severe disease and became critically ill. Olfactory dysfunction appeared before the other symptoms in 21.43% of cases. The proportion of females with olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was higher than that of males (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was much lower than that reported abroad; the prognosis of patients with olfactory dysfunction is relatively favorable; olfactory and gustatory dysfunction can be used as a sign for early screening; females are more prone to olfactory and gustatory dysfunction.","output":"Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions of COVID\\\\19 patients in China: A multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective: To study the hemostatic system of patients diagnosed with the novel new coronavirus infection and compare the data obtained with hemostatic system parameters in patients with advanced deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism without COVID-19.

However, targeting tau effectively remains a considerable challenge due to the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which excludes 99.9% of peripherally administered antibodies. We have previously shown that the delivery of tau-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) with low-intensity scanning ultrasound in combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS+MB) increases the passage of IgG antibodies into the brain. SUS+MB transiently opens tight junctions to allow paracellular transport, but also facilitates transcellular transport, particularly for larger cargoes. However, therapeutic efficacy after enhanced brain delivery has not been explored. To assess whether ultrasound-mediated delivery of tau-specific mAbs leads to an enhanced therapeutic response, K369I tau transgenic K3 mice were passively immunised once weekly for 12 weeks with a novel mAb, RNF5, in combination with SUS+MB. While none of the treatment arms improved behaviour or motor functions in these mice, we found that both RNF5 and SUS+MB treatments on their own reduced tau pathology, but, surprisingly, the combination of both (RNF5+SUS+MB) did not achieve an additive reduction in tau pathology. This was despite observing increased antibody penetration in the brain. Interestingly, a significant fraction of the antibody in the combination treatment was visualized in brain endothelial cells, suggesting that paracellular transport may not be the preferred uptake mechanism for RNF5. Taken altogether, more research is warranted to develop SUS+MB as a delivery modality for anti-tau antibodies.","output":"Ultrasound-mediated delivery of novel tau-specific monoclonal antibody enhances brain uptake but not therapeutic efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frailty assessed using Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a good predictor of adverse clinical events including mortality in older people. CFS is also an essential criterion for determining ceilings of care in people with COVID-19. Our aims were to assess the prevalence of frailty in older patients hospitalised with COVID-19, their sex and age distribution, and the completion rate of the CFS tool in evaluating frailty. Methods: Data were collected from thirteen sites. CFS was assessed routinely at the time of admission to hospital and ranged from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill). The completion rate of the CFS was assessed. The presence of major comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease was noted. Results: A total of 1277 older patients with COVID-19, aged  65 (79.9  8.1) years were included in the study, with 98.5% having fully completed CFS. The total prevalence of frailty (CFS  5) was 66.9%, being higher in women than men (75.2% vs. 59.4%, p < 0.001). Frailty was found in 161 (44%) patients aged 65C74 years, 352 (69%) in 75C84 years, and 341 (85%) in 85 years groups, and increased across the age groups (<0.0001, test for trend). Conclusion: Frailty was prevalent in our cohort of older people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. This indicates that older people who are also frail, who go on to contract COVID-19 may have disease severity significant enough to warrant hospitalization. These data may help inform health care planners and targeted interventions and appropriate management for the frail older person.","output":"The Clinical Frailty Scale: Estimating the Prevalence of Frailty in Older Patients Hospitalised with COVID-19.

Uncertainty remains about the optimal initial antihypertensive therapy in the settings of real practice. Methods: The Learning Implementation of Guideline-based decision support system for Hypertension Treatment (LIGHT) trial is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial of CDSS versus usual care conducted in 100 primary care practices in China. The primary outcome is the proportion of hypertension visits with appropriate (guideline-recommended) antihypertensive treatment. Among patients recruited from primary care practices of the intervention group in the LIGHT trial, we further conducted a sub-study, the LIGHT-ACD trial, to compare the effects of initial antihypertensive therapy by randomizing individual patients to receive different antihypertensive regimens of initial monotherapy or dual therapy. The primary outcome of the sub-study is the absolute change in blood pressure from baseline to 9 months. Results: We hypothesize that the use of CDSS will result in a higher proportion of appropriate antihypertensive treatments being prescribed during visits for hypertension control in the LIGHT trial, and that particular choices of monotherapy or combinations of dual therapy lead to greater blood pressure change in the LIGHT-ACD trial. Conclusion: These nested trials will provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of CDSS for improving adherence to guidelines for hypertension management in primary care, and data on the effectiveness of different initial antihypertensive regimens for blood pressure reduction.","output":"Rationale and design of the Learning Implementation of Guideline-based decision support system for Hypertension Treatment (LIGHT) Trial and LIGHT-ACD Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The influence of the microbiota on viral infection susceptibility and disease outcome is undisputable although varies among viruses.

The initial step for achieving this goal is to gather clinical evidences, focusing on the viral pathogensfrom human and animal studiesthat have already been shown to interact with microbiota. The subsequent step is to identify mechanisms, through experimental evidences, to support the development of translational applications that target microbiota.

Recombinant proteins represent the most reliable and safe vaccine approach but generally require a suitable adjuvant for robust and durable immunity. We used the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and in silico structural modelling to design a recombinant spike protein vaccine (Covax-19?). A synthetic gene encoding the spike extracellular domain (ECD) was inserted into a baculovirus backbone to express the protein in insect cell cultures. The spike ECD was formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant and first tested for immunogenicity in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Covax-19 vaccine induced high spike protein binding antibody levels that neutralised the original lineage B.1.319 virus from which the vaccine spike protein was derived, as well as the variant B.1.1.7 lineage virus. Covax-19 vaccine also induced a high frequency of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cells with a dominant Th1 phenotype associated with the ability to kill spike-labelled target cells in vivo. Ferrets immunised with Covax-19 vaccine intramuscularly twice 2 weeks apart made spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and were protected against an intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus given two weeks after the last immunisation. Notably, ferrets that received the two higher doses of Covax-19 vaccine had no detectable virus in their lungs or in nasal washes at day 3 post-challenge, suggesting that in addition to lung protection, Covax-19 vaccine may have the potential to reduce virus transmission.

Objective: To evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to COVID-19 vaccines longitudinally over 6 months in patients with cancer undergoing treatment or who received a stem cell transplant (SCT). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective, observational, longitudinal cross-sectional study of 453 patients with cancer undergoing treatment or who received an SCT at the University of Kansas Cancer Center in Kansas City, blood samples were obtained before 433 patients received a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the second dose. Blood samples were also obtained 2, 4, and 7 months after 17 patients received the JNJ-78436735 vaccine. For patients receiving a third dose of an mRNA vaccine, blood samples were obtained 30 days after the third dose. Interventions: Blood samples and BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or JNJ-78436735 vaccines. Main Outcomes and Measures: Geometric mean titers (GMTs) of the anti-RBD; the ratio of GMTs for analysis of demographic, disease, and treatment variables; the percentage of neutralization of anti-RBD antibodies; and the correlation between anti-RBD and nAb responses to the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: This study enrolled 453 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.4 [13,1] years; 253 [56%] were female). Of 450 patients, 273 (61%) received the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer), 160 (36%) received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna), and 17 (4%) received the JNJ-7846735 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson). The GMTs of the anti-RBD for all patients were 1.70 (95% CI, 1.04-2.85) before vaccination, 18.65 (95% CI, 10.19-34.11) after the first dose, 470.38 (95% CI, 322.07-686.99) at 1 month after the second dose, 425.80 (95% CI, 322.24-562.64) at 3 months after the second dose, 447.23 (95% CI, 258.53-773.66) at 6 months after the second dose, and 9224.85 (95% CI, 2423.92-35107.55) after the third dose. The rate of threshold neutralization (30%) was observed in 203 of 252 patients (80%) 1 month after the second dose and in 135 of 166 patients (81%) 3 months after the second dose. Anti-RBD and nAb were highly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.93 [0.92-0.94]; P < .001). Three months after the second dose, anti-RBD titers were lower in male vs female patients (ratio of GMTs, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34-0.81]), patients older than 65 years vs patients 50 years or younger (ratio of GMTs, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.25-0.57]), and patients with hematologic malignant tumors vs solid tumors (ratio of GMTs, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.20-0.81]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, after 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine, anti-RBD titers peaked at 1 month and remained stable over the next 6 months. Patients older than 65 years of age, male patients, and patients with a hematologic malignant tumor had low antibody titers. Compared with the primary vaccine course, a 20-fold increase in titers from a third dose suggests a brisk B-cell anamnestic response in patients with cancer.","output":"Evaluation of the Durability of the Immune Humoral Response to COVID-19 Vaccines in Patients With Cancer Undergoing Treatment or Who Received a Stem Cell Transplant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the coronavirus pandemic getting worse, we are turning to new techniques to deliver a vaccine in record time.

OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: We used blood samples from health care workers (HCW) with or without history of COVID-19 to define test accuracy of a novel interferon- release assay (IGRA). For a real-life performance evaluation, we analysed interferon- response to complete COVID-19 vaccination in HCW receiving homologous or heterologous vaccination regimens and in patients receiving immunosuppressive or immune modulating therapies. RESULTS: The assay had a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity of the IGRA to detect past infection was 72.2% after infection more than 5 months ago and 93.8% after COVID-19 up to 5 months ago. Quantitative results showed significant differences between first and second vaccine dose, but no difference between homologous and heterologous vaccination regimen. Immunocompromised patients often had no immune response or isolated T cell or antibody response to complete vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The novel IGRA proved to be a highly specific tool to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response to COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 vaccination, with sensitivity getting lower over time.

Post-mortem examination can provide important mechanistic insights. METHODS: We present a COVID-19 autopsy series including findings in lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and bone, from a New York academic medical center. FINDINGS: In seven patients (four female), regardless of anticoagulation status, all autopsies demonstrated platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary, hepatic, renal, and cardiac microvasculature. Megakaryocytes were seen in higher than usual numbers in the lungs and heart. Two cases had thrombi in the large pulmonary arteries, where casts conformed to the anatomic location. Thrombi in the IVC were not found, but the deep leg veins were not dissected. Two cases had cardiac venous thrombosis with one case exhibiting septal myocardial infarction associated with intramyocardial venous thrombosis, without atherosclerosis. One case had focal acute lymphocyte-predominant inflammation in the myocardium with no virions found in cardiomyocytes. Otherwise, cardiac histopathological changes were limited to minimal epicardial inflammation (n = 1), early ischemic injury (n = 3), and mural fibrin thrombi (n = 2). Platelet-rich peri?tubular fibrin microthrombi were a prominent renal feature. Acute tubular necrosis, and red blood cell and granular casts were seen in multiple cases. Significant glomerular pathology was notably absent. Numerous platelet-fibrin microthrombi were identified in hepatic sinusoids. All lungs exhibited diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with a spectrum of exudative and proliferative phases including hyaline membranes, and pneumocyte hyperplasia, with viral inclusions in epithelial cells and macrophages. Three cases had superimposed acute bronchopneumonia, focally necrotizing. INTERPRETATION: In this series of seven COVID-19 autopsies, thrombosis was a prominent feature in multiple organs, in some cases despite full anticoagulation and regardless of timing of the disease course, suggesting that thrombosis plays a role very early in the disease process. The finding of megakaryocytes and platelet-rich thrombi in the lungs, heart and kidneys suggests a role in thrombosis.

METHODS: We identified children presenting to a large children's hospital with PIMS-TS from March to June 2020 and performed a retrospective medical note review, identifying clinical and investigative features alongside short-term outcome of children presenting with neurologic symptoms. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients with PIMS-TS were identified, 9 (12%) had neurologic involvement: altered conciseness (3), behavioral changes (3), focal neurology deficits (2), persistent headaches (2), hallucinations (2), excessive sleepiness (1), and new-onset focal seizures (1). Four patients had cranial images abnormalities. At 3-month follow-up, 1 child had died, 1 had hemiparesis, 3 had behavioral changes, and 4 completely recovered.

The slot assignment is proportional to the priority order, and the critical index factor resolves slot conflict. This guarantees data priority preservation with fair allocation for critical and non-critical medical data. The simulation is carried out using the Castalia-OMNeT++ simulator, and the results are shown that the proposed DDSA algorithm outperforms priority-based MAC and the conventional method in terms of packet reception rate, energy efficiency, and latency. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Demand-Based Dynamic Slot Allocation for Effective Superframe Utilization in Wireless Body Area Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) adds more challenges to the perioperative management of parturients. The aim of this study is to examine perioperative adverse events and hemodynamic stability among COVID-19 positive parturients undergoing spinal anesthesia. This prospective observational investigation was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Jordan between January and June 2021, during which 31 COVID-19 positive parturients were identified. Each COVID-19 positive parturient was matched with a COVID-19 negative parturient who received anesthesia under similar operating conditions as a control group. Of the 31 COVID-19 patients, 22 (71%) were otherwise medically free, 8 (25.8%) were emergency cesarean sections. The sensory level of spinal block after 10 min was T8 (T6CT10) among COVID-19 positive group, compared to T4 (T4CT6) among control group (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in heart rate, SBP, DBP, and MAP intraoperatively (p > 0.05). Twelve (36.4%) neonates born to COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to NICU, compared to four (11.8%) among control group (p = 0.018). There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative complications. In conclusion, spinal anesthesia is considered a safe anesthetic technique in COVID-19 parturients, and therefore it is the anesthetic method of choice for cesarean deliveries among COVID-19 patients.","output":"Perioperative Outcomes in COVID-19 Obstetric Patients Undergoing Spinal Anesthesia for Cesarean Section: A Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress and anxiety levels in cancer patients tend to decrease by performing bodily-kinesthetic and musical activities. The hypothesis of the present study is that attending lessons in Greek traditional dance is an effective method for managing anxiety and stress in patients diagnosed with cancer of any type both during and after treatment. The study was conducted on 300 cancer patients (150 experimental subjects, 150 controls) selected by Attica hospitals and nonprofit cancer patients' organizations. Each patient in the experimental group attended an 8-week Greek traditional dance lesson program. Lessons were held twice per week, lasting 60 min each. A similar group of cancer patients not participating in any organized physical activity during the same time period served as a control group. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (Dass-21) questionnaire and subjected to reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha) and deviation-dependent analysis (one-way repeated). Both stress and anxiety values decreased significantly in the experimental group (stress value: initial mean = 16.27, second mean = 2.58, final mean = 6.77, p < 0.001; anxiety value: initial mean = 15.59, second mean = 2.81, final mean = 5.35, p < 0.001).

The aim of this study was to determine variations in the prevalence of psychological distress among elite sambo athletes and their recreational counterparts. METHODS: A sample consisting of 245 athletes (127 males and 118 females) was chosen. Out of the total sample, 105 were elite-level athletes while 140 were recreational athletes. Participants were accessed via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 to determine their stress in various domains at a given time. RESULTS: Data indicated that all tested differences between elite sambo athletes and recreational athletes were statistically significant; recreational athletes had a higher score on the depression scale, anxiety and stress, and a general distress score than sambo athletes. Although there are no gender differences in psychological distress in the total sample of athletes, elite sambo athletes achieve significantly lower scores in all tested variants than recreational ones. Women who engage in recreational activities have stood out as a vulnerable subsample in psychological stress.

Using a strain of HV68 that is cleared following acute infection, we show that ABCs persist in the absence of latent virus, though their expression of IFN and TNF is decreased. With a fluorescent virus we demonstrate that ABCs are infected with HV68 at similar rates to other previously activated B cells. We find that mice without ABCs display defects in anti-viral IgG2a/c antibodies and are more susceptible to HV68 reactivation when challenged with heterologous infection.

However, it remains unclear how this change has impacted patients and clinicians perceptions of service quality. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify process factors that influence patients and clinicians experiences of outpatient teleconsultation services during COVID-19. METHODS: Arksey and OMalley scoping review framework was used to search PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycInfo for original peer-reviewed research studies that examined the experiences of synchronous teleconsultation between a clinician and patient in a home-setting since the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 global pandemic. The service quality model SERVQUAL was used to conduct a deductive thematic analysis to identify the key factors that impacted the patients and clinicians perception of teleconsultation services. RESULTS: A total of nineteen studies published between January 1, 2020, and April 17, 2021, were identified. The most common service process factors affecting the patients and clinicians experiences of teleconsultation were technical issues, addressing logistical needs, communication, ability to perform clinical activities, appropriate triage, and administrative support. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identified six key service process factors affecting the patients and clinicians teleconsultation experiences in outpatient neurology services. The need for improvement of triage process and standardizing administrative virtual care pathway are identified as important steps to improve patients and clinicians teleconsultation experiences compared to pre-COVID era.

We provide a detailed histopathologic description of morphological changes accompanied by an analysis of presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placental tissue. All placentas were term deliveries (40th and 41st gestational weeks). One SARS-CoV-2-positive patient presented with cough and dyspnoea. This placenta showed prominent lymphohistiocytic villitis and intervillositis and signs of maternal and foetal malperfusion.

After China, few other countries have emerged as potential epicenters of this disease including the US, Italy, Spain and Pakistan, as indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since proper preventive and curative measures in the form of a vaccine or medication are currently unavailable throughout the world, the only remedy devised to stop the spread of this virus is self-isolation. Such a measure necessitates ample awareness and understanding among people to avoid actions that lead to the spread of this virus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, observational cohort study used a retrospective control group for comparison. Multivariate analyses evaluated whether N-acetylglucosamine was an independent predictor of primary outcomes (rate of intubation, hospital length-of-stay, and mortality) and select secondary outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, ICU length-of-stay, supplemental oxygen use duration, hospice initiation, and poor clinical outcome [defined as combined hospice initiation/death]). RESULTS: Of the 50 patients enrolled in the N-acetylglucosamine treatment group, 48 patients had follow-up data (50.0% [24/48] male; median age 63 years, range: 29C88). Multivariate analysis showed the treatment group had improved hospital length-of-stay (: 4.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) ?5.67; ?2.85], p < 0.001), ICU admission (odds ratio [OR] 0.32 [95% CI 0.10; 0.96], p = 0.049), and poor clinical outcome (OR 0.30 [95% CI 0.09; 0.86], p = 0.034).

RESULTS: In the first example, the DID estimate of the difference in health insurance coverage rates between expanded states and unexpanded states in the post-Medicaid expansion period compared to the pre-expansion period was 5.93 (95% CI, 3.99 to 7.89) percentage points. In the second example, a comparative segmented regression of ITS analysis showed that the mean imaging order appropriateness score in the emergency department at a tertiary care hospital exceeded that of the inpatient setting with a level change difference of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.73) and a trend change difference of 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.03) after the introduction of a clinical decision support tool. In the third example, the results from an interventional ARIMA analysis show that numbers of creatinine clearance tests decreased significantly within months of the start of eGFR reporting, with a magnitude of drop equal to ?0.93 (95% CI, ?1.22 to ?0.64) tests per 100,000 adults and a rate of drop equal to 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.99) tests per 100,000 per adults per month. DISCUSSION: When choosing the appropriate method to model the intervention effect, it is necessary to consider the structure of the data, the study design, availability of an appropriate comparison group, sample size requirements, whether other interventions occur during the study window, and patterns in the data.","output":"Three Statistical Approaches for Assessment of Intervention Effects: A Primer for Practitioners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Facemasks are recommended to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but concern about inadequate gas exchange is an often cited reason for non-compliance. RESEARCH QUESTION: Among adult volunteers, do either cloth masks or surgical masks impair oxygenation or ventilation either at rest or during physical activity? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With IRB approval and informed consent, we measured heart rate (HR), transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) tension and oxygen levels (SpO2) at the conclusion of six 10-minute phases: sitting quietly and walking briskly without a mask, sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a cloth mask, and sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a surgical mask. Brisk walking required at least a 10bpm increase in heart rate. Occurrences of hypoxemia (decrease in SpO2 of &#8805;3% from baseline to a value of &#8804;94%) and hypercarbia (increase in CO2 tension of &#8805;5 mmHg from baseline to a value of &#8805;46 mmHg) in individual subjects were collected. Wilcoxon signed-rank was used for pairwise comparisons among values for the whole cohort (e.g. walking without a mask versus walking with a cloth mask). RESULTS: Among 50 adult volunteers (median age 33 years; 32% with a co-morbidity), there were no episodes of hypoxemia or hypercarbia (0%; 95% confidence interval 0-1.9%). In paired comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences in either CO2 or SpO2 between baseline measurements without a mask and those while wearing either kind of mask mask, both at rest and after walking briskly for ten minutes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients underwent PPCI after finishing the screening protocol from January 23, 2020 to June 10, 2020 while FPCI was applied when COVID-19-confirmed cases reoccurred in Beijing near our hospital from June 11, 2020 to July 20, 2020. The door-to-balloon time (DTB) or door-to-needle time (DTN) as well as in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. A propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was performed to diminish the potential influence of confounding factors on the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 126 STEMI patients underwent PPCI after finishing the screening protocol and 17 patients received FPCI before PSM. Patients who received FPCI were younger than patients who underwent PPCI (50.814.0 versus 64.114.2 years, p=0.001), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) was less common in FPCI patients than in patients who underwent PPCI (0% versus 24.6%, p=0.024). The DTN was significantly shorter than DTB (25.84.2 versus 61.110.7, p=0.000) before PSM. The DTN was significantly shorter than DTB (26.94.2 versus 64.923.6, p=0.000); however, the incidence rate of in-hospital ischemia and bleeding adverse clinical outcomes were comparable between the two groups after PSM.

Widespread use of PFAS in industrial processing and manufacturing over the last 70 years has led to global contamination of built and natural environments. The brain is a lipid rich and highly vascularized organ composed of long-lived neurons and glial cells that are especially vulnerable to the impacts of persistent and lipophilic toxicants. Generally, PFAS partition to protein-rich tissues of the body, primarily the liver and blood, but are also detected in the brains of humans, wildlife, and laboratory animals. Here we review factors impacting the absorption, distribution, and accumulation of PFAS in the brain, and currently available evidence for neurotoxic impacts defined by disruption of neurochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral endpoints. Emphasis is placed on the neurotoxic potential of exposures during critical periods of development and in sensitive populations, and factors that may exacerbate neurotoxicity of PFAS. While limitations and inconsistencies across studies exist, the available body of evidence suggests that the neurobehavioral impacts of long-chain PFAS exposures during development are more pronounced than impacts resulting from exposure during adulthood. There is a paucity of experimental studies evaluating neurobehavioral and molecular mechanisms of short-chain PFAS, and even greater data gaps in the analysis of neurotoxicity for PFAS outside of the perfluoroalkyl acids. Whereas most experimental studies were focused on acute and subchronic impacts resulting from high dose exposures to a single PFAS congener, more realistic exposures for humans and wildlife are mixtures exposures that are relatively chronic and low dose in nature. Our evaluation of the available human epidemiological, experimental, and wildlife data also indicates heightened accumulation of perfluoroalkyl acids in the brain after environmental exposure, in comparison to the experimental studies. These findings highlight the need for additional experimental analysis of neurodevelopmental impacts of environmentally relevant concentrations and complex mixtures of PFAS.","output":"A Critical Review and Meta-Analysis of Impacts of Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances on the Brain and Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has increased concerns about vaccine uptake required to overcome the pandemic and protect public health.

Methods: Descriptive analysis of planned, ongoing or completed trials by April 9, 2020 testing any intervention to treat or prevent COVID-19, systematically identified in trial registries, preprint servers, and literature databases. A survey was conducted of all trials to assess their recruitment status up to July 6, 2020. Results: Most of the 689 trials (overall target sample size 396,366) were small (median sample size 120; interquartile range [IQR] 60-300) but randomized (75.8%; n=522) and were often conducted in China (51.1%; n=352) or the USA (11%; n=76). 525 trials (76.2%) planned to include 155,571 hospitalized patients, and 25 (3.6%) planned to include 96,821 health-care workers. Treatments were evaluated in 607 trials (88.1%), frequently antivirals (n=144) or antimalarials (n=112); 78 trials (11.3%) focused on prevention, including 14 vaccine trials. No trial investigated social distancing. Interventions tested in 11 trials with >5,000 participants were also tested in 169 smaller trials (median sample size 273; IQR 90-700).

Even in high-income countries sepsis causes about 8% of admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Early diagnosis, rapid anti-infective treatment, and prompt hemodynamic stabilization are crucial for patient survival. In this context, it is essential to identify the causative pathogen as soon as possible to optimize antimicrobial treatment. To date, culture-based diagnostic procedures (e.g., blood cultures) represent the standard of care. However, they have 2 major problems: on the one hand, in the case of very small sample volumes (and thus usually in children), they are not sufficiently sensitive. On the other hand, with a time-to-result of 2 to 5 days, blood cultures need a relatively long time for the anti-infective therapy to be calculated. To overcome these problems, culture-independent molecular diagnostic procedures such as unbiased sequence analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma samples of septic patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been tested successfully in adult septic patients. However, these results still need to be transferred to the pediatric setting. METHODS: The Next GeneSiPS-Trial is a prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicenter study used to assess the diagnostic performance of an NGS-based approach for the identification of causative pathogens in (preterm and term) neonates (d1Cd28, n = 50), infants (d29 to <1 yr, n = 50), and toddlers (1 yr to <5 yr, n = 50) with suspected or proven severe sepsis or septic shock (according to the pediatric sepsis definition) by the use of the quantitative sepsis indicating quantifier (SIQ) score in comparison to standard of care (culture-based) microbiological diagnostics. Potential changes in anti-infective treatment regimens based on these NGS results will be estimated retrospectively by a panel of 3 independent clinical specialists. DISCUSSION: Neonates, infants, and young children are significantly affected by sepsis. Fast and more sensitive diagnostic approaches are urgently needed.

Methods We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. All students enrolled at the College of Health Sciences;Makerere University received the link to this questionnaire to participate. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with double mask use. Results A total of 348 participants were enrolled. The majority (61.8%) were male;the median age was 23 (range: 32) years. Up to 10.3%, 42%, and 4.3% reported past COVID-19 positive test, history of COVID-19 symptoms, and having comorbidities, respectively. Up to 40.8% had been vaccinated against COVID-19. More than half (68.7%) believed double masking was superior to single masking for COVID-19 IPC, but only 20.5% reported double masking. Participants with a past COVID-19 positive test [aOR: 2.5;95% CI: 1.1C5.8, p = 0.026] and participants who believed double masks had a superior protective advantage [aOR: 20;95% CI: 4.9C86.2, p < 0.001] were more likely to double mask. Lack of trust in the quality of masks (46.5%) was the most frequent motivation for double masking, while excessive sweating (68.4%), high cost of masks (66.4%), and difficulty in breathing (66.1%) were the major barriers.

The purpose of the current article was to assess the populations' perception of DTCOs and to examine various factors that may influence their decision in choosing treatment with DTCO products. METHODS A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted in the United States. The 35-question survey was disseminated through Amazon Mechanical Turk (Amazon.com, Inc, Seattle, Wash), and participants were asked questions about their demographics, their perceptions of DTCOs, orthodontists, and factors that may influence their decision should they decide to pursue orthodontic treatment. Pearson's correlations were conducted to assess the association between various factors and the participants' likelihood to choose DTCO products. RESULTS A total of 1441 subjects participated in the study. More than 83% of the participants have considered pursuing orthodontic treatment to some extent. Twenty-three percent reported that they would highly likely choose DTCO products. The majority of participants reported convenience to be the greatest benefit of DTCOs, followed by cost. The majority of responses seemed to favor DTCOs. Forty-seven percent reported that the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic did not affect their preference, whereas 26.6% reported to be more likely to pursue DTCOs because of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The majority of participants seemed to perceive DTCOs as a viable alternative for seeking orthodontic care. Although participants had concerns about the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, results showed that the pandemic might not significantly affect the preferences. Orthodontists and their constituent organizations may consider more robust awareness and advocacy campaigns to educate the population about orthodontic treatment and the benefits of pursuing treatment with a trained orthodontist.","output":"When convenience trumps quality of care: A population-based survey on direct to consumer orthodontics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Surgical programs are facing major and fluctuating changes to the resident workforce because of decreased elective volumes and high exposure risk during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

However, thermal plasticity is rarely studied in response to thermal variability and is often measured in a single life stage. Plasticity in response to thermal variability likely differs from responses to constant temperatures or acute stress. In addition, life stages likely differ in their plasticity and responses in one stage may be affected by the experiences in a previous stage. Increasing the resolution with which we understand thermal plasticity in response to thermal variation across ontogeny is crucial to understanding how organisms cope with the thermal variation in their environment and to estimating the capacity of plasticity to mitigate costs of rapid environmental change. We wanted to know if life stages differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity under temperature fluctuations. We reared Onthophagus taurus dung beetles in either low or high temperature fluctuation treatments and quantified thermal plasticity of metabolism of pupae and adults. We found that adults were thermally plastic and pupae were not. Next, we wanted to know if the plasticity observed in the adult life stage was affected by the thermal conditions during development. We again used low and high temperature fluctuation treatments and reared individuals in one condition through all egg to pupal stages. At eclosion, we switched half of the individuals in each treatment to the opposite fluctuation condition and, later, measured thermal plasticity of metabolism on adults. We found that temperature conditions experienced during the adult stage, but not egg to pupal stages, affects adult thermal plasticity. However, temperature fluctuations during development affect adult body size, suggesting that some aspects of the adult phenotype are decoupled from previous life stages and others are not. Our data demonstrate that life stages mount different responses to temperature variability and uniquely contribute to the adult phenotype. These findings emphasize the need to broadly integrate the life cycle into studies of phenotypic plasticity and physiology; doing so should enhance our ability to predict organismal responses to rapid global change and inform conservation efforts.","output":"Life stages differ in plasticity to temperature fluctuations and uniquely contribute to adult phenotype."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim of the study was to analyze the posttraumatic stress disorder risk nurses, detecting the relationship between distress experience and personality dimensions in Italian COVID-19 outbreak A cross-sectional study was conducted based on 2 data detection (March 2020 and September 2020) Mental evaluation was carried out in Laboratory of Clinical Psychology on n 69 nurses in range age 22-64 years old (mean age 37 3;sd +/- 10 3;55% working in nursing care with confirmed COVID-19 patients (named frontline;secondline nurses have been identified by nursing care working with infectious patients but no confirmed COVID-19) Measurement was focused on symptoms anxiety, personality traits, peritraumatic dissociation and post-traumatic stress for all participants No online screening was applied Comparisons (ANOVA test) within the various demographic characteristics demonstrated few significant differences between groups on DASS-21, PDEQ, and ISE-R scores Correlation analysis (Spearman test) was performed among PDEQ, DASS-21, BFI-10 and IES-R and confirmed between anxiety (DASS-21) and peritraumatic dissociation and post-traumatic stress;then anxiety is positively correlated to agreeableness variable of BFI-10 test The emotional distress was protracted overtime (after 6 months) but in long-term personality traits resulted mediator facing subjective stress Our finding drew details for protective and predictive risk factors as well as mental health issues of nurses dealing with pandemic: healthcare workers faced the protracted challenge caring COVID-19 patients over and over again: in short time the impact was relevant, and the prolonged exposition to the stressor was tackled by personal resources such as personality traits","output":"Prolonged COVID 19 Outbreak and Psychological Response of Nurses in Italian Healthcare System: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 has brought about complex challenges in healthcare delivery.

The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of high-dose ulinastatin for the treatment of patients with Covid-19. A total of 12 patients hospitalized with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were treated with a high dose of ulinastatin alongside standard care. Changes in clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and chest images were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 10 patients with severe Covid-19 and two patients with moderate Covid-19 received ulinastatin treatment. The average age of the patients was 68.011.9 years (age range, 48-87 years). In total, nine of the 12 patients (75.0%) had one or more comorbidities. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (8/12, 66.7%), cough (5/12, 41.7%) and dyspnea (5/12, 41.7%). The percentage of lymphocytes was decreased in 41.7% of patients (5/12) and 58.3% of patients (7/12) had elevated hypersensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (mean, 49.7077.70 mg/l). The white blood cell levels and the percentage of lymphocytes returned to normal in all of the patients, and CRP was significantly decreased and returned to normal in 83.3% of patients (10/12;mean, 6.876.63 mg/l) on day 7 after ulinastatin treatment. Clinical symptoms were relieved synchronously. The peripheral oxygen saturation improved and 66.7% of the patients (8/12) did not require further oxygen therapy 7 days after ulinastatin treatment. No patients required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. All patients revealed different degrees of absorption of pulmonary lesions after treatment. Compared with the standard care group, ulinastatin treatment significantly prevented illness deterioration. In conclusion, these preliminary data revealed that high-dose ulinastatin treatment was safe and exhibited a potential beneficial effect for patients with Covid-19.

Our objectives are to analysis the expression profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human spermatogenic cells, follicle cells, and preimplantation embryos, thereby providing mechanistic insights into viral entry and viral impact on reproduction. We found that ACE2 is mainly expressed during gametogenesis in spermatogonia and oocytes of antral follicles, granulosa cells of antral follicles and pre-ovulatory follicles, while TMPRSS2 almost has no expression in spermatogenic cells, oocytes or granulosa cells. In preimplantation embryos, ACE2 is expressed in early embryos before eight-cell stage, and trophectoderm of late blastocysts, while TMPRSS2 initiates its robust expression in late blastocyst stage. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 only show significant co-expression in trophectoderm of late blastocysts in all above cell types. We speculate that trophectoderm of late blastocysts is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and that the chance of SARS-CoV-2 being passed on to offspring through gametes is very low. Therefore, we propose that fertility preservation for COVID-19 patients is relatively safe and rational. We also recommend embryo cryopreservation and embryo transfer into healthy recipient mother at cleavage stage instead of blastocyst stage. Moreover, we unexpectedly found that co-expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in oocytes and preimplantation embryos in human, rhesus monkey and mouse are totally different, so animal models have significant limitations for evaluating transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in reproduction.","output":"Suggestions on cleavage embryo and blastocyst vitrification/transfer based on expression profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in current COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plants have been used as a source for many pharmaceutical since long. However, utilization of plant systems for production of edible vaccines has been a comparatively recent phenomenon. There are several potential advantages of plant derived vaccines over other conventional systems of vaccine production such as mammalian or avian cell culture. The cost of vaccines is one factor preventing further use of vaccination, leaving hundreds of thousands of children susceptible to preventable diseases. Especially for developing world this novel technique proved to be a boon for its low cost of production, convenient administration, easy storage and negligible chances of infection whereas the conventional system of vaccine production limits the applicability of vaccines in many parts of the world. These vaccines are prepared by introducing selected desired genes into plants and inducing these genetically modified plants to manufacture the encoded proteins. Transgenic plants may provide an ideal expression system, in which transgenic plant material can be fed directly as oral dose of recombinant vaccines. Expression of vaccines in plant tissue eliminates the risk of contamination with animal pathogen, provides a heat stable environment and enables oral delivery thus eliminating infection related hazards. Identification of transgenic material, containment of the transgenes and control of recombinant protein may be potential problems for large scale production of vaccines in plants. Factors like scaling up production as well as distribution and handling of transgenic plant material must comprise the future consideration in this field.","output":"Plant Edible Vaccines: A Revolution in Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Palliative care is an effective, multidisciplinary healthcare service to alleviate severe illness patients from physical, psychological, and spiritual pain.

By examining the variation in the indices, we propose the existence of a so-called Matthew effect, i.e., the rich get richersyndrome among the 27 EU Member States. We also hypothesised that the COVID-19 pandemic would influence the change in the DESI. Issues investigated were those using bibliometric, statistical-mathematical methods. The -convergence analysis was used to estimate the reduction over time of the differences between the Member States, while the -convergence analysis was used to estimate the rate of catching up with the initial level of development. A PCA analysis was performed to verify the Mathew effect with additional -variances considering real GDP per capita change. The -convergence was confirmed over the period 2016C2021. The -convergence was significantly confirmed, and the research also revealed that the half-life of catching up is approximately 20 years.

There were 6,567 RdRp related publications in PubMed, including 1,263 with NIH support, and 11,073 NcAn-related publications, including 2,319 with NIH support. NIH support for RdRp research comprised 2,203 Project Years with Costs of $1,875 million. NIH support for NcAn research comprised 4,607 Project Years with Costs of $4,612 million.

The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H+ ions. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. Additionally, two distinct \\"core\\" structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis.

R1 development is nonuniform: there is faster development in white matter that is less mature in newborns, and along inferior-to-superior as well as anterior-to-posterior spatial gradients. As R1 is linearly related to myelin fraction in white matter bundles, these findings open new avenues to elucidate typical and atypical white matter myelination in early infancy, which has important implications for early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders.","output":"White matter myelination during early infancy is explained by spatial gradients and myelin content at birth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence suggests that children's popular media may model maladaptive and distorted experiences of pain to young children. In a recent study, pain depicted in popular media targeting 4C6-year-olds was frequently and unrealistically portrayed, evoked little response or empathy from observing characters, and perpetuated unhelpful gender stereotypes. Parents play a critical role in both children's pain experiences and children's media consumption. Yet, no study to date has examined parents' beliefs and attitudes regarding how pain is portrayed in media for young children. The present study aimed to fill this gap by examining how parents perceive and appraise painful instances depicted in children's popular media. Sixty parents (48% fathers) of children aged 4 to 6 years completed a semi-structured interview to assess their general beliefs and attitudes toward how pain is portrayed in children's media. Inductive reflexive thematic analysis was conducted to identify and analyze key patterns in the data. Qualitative analyses generated two major themes representing parental beliefs regarding pain that is portrayed in children's media: entertaining pain and valuable lessons. Findings reveal that parents believe that pain portrayed in popular media serves either a function of entertaining and amusing children or can provide valuable lessons about appropriate emotional responses and empathic reactions. Further, pain portrayals could also instill valuable lessons and provide children with a point of reference and language for their own painful experiences. Parents serve as a primary socialization agent for young children; thus, it is important that parents remain aware of underlying messages about how pain is portrayed in children's popular media so that they can optimally discuss these portrayals, promote their children's pain education and understanding and positively impact future pain experiences.","output":"Portrayals of Pain in Children's Popular Media: Mothers' and Fathers' Beliefs and Attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, almost all over the world attention of doctors and scientists is focused on a new coronavirus infection, the source of which was the causative agent SARS-CoV-2.

Much of the publics behavioural and emotional response to the virus can be understood through the framework of terror management theory, which proposes that fear of death drives much of human behaviour. In the context of the current pandemic, death anxiety, a recently proposed transdiagnostic construct, appears especially relevant. Fear of death has recently been shown to predict not only anxiety related to COVID-19, but also to play a causal role in various mental health conditions. Given this, it is argued that treatment programmes in mental health may need to broaden their focus to directly target the dread of death. Notably, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to produce significant reductions in death anxiety. As such, it is possible that complementing current treatments with specific CBT techniques addressing fears of death may ensure enhanced long-term symptom reduction. Further research is essential in order to examine whether treating death anxiety will indeed improve long-term outcomes, and prevent the emergence of future disorders in vulnerable populations. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1).. To understand terror management theory and its theoretical explanation of death anxiety in the context of COVID-19. (2).. To understand the transdiagnostic role of death anxiety in mental health disorders. (3)..

It also shows non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment and dementia. The number of patients is gradually increasing worldwide. Aging is a risk factor for the onset of Parkinson's disease, and various physiological effects of aging influence its progression. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome in which the reversible and vulnerable status between robustness and disability is affected by various physiological stressors with aging. Frailty consists of physical, psychological and social aspects. Furthermore, sarcopenia, a syndrome characterized by the loss of muscle mass, strength and function, is also significantly associated with frailty. To maintain the quality of life of older people, frailty, including sarcopenia, should be quickly and appropriately managed. Polypharmacy is an important factor causing the progression of frailty in geriatric syndrome. Although Parkinson's disease and frailty have similar symptoms, and are considered to affect each other, the clinical features and mechanisms of both largely remain unclear. Nevertheless, little literature on the relationship between frailty and Parkinson's disease is currently available. This narrative review aims to clarify the relationships between Parkinson's disease and frailty, not only on the physical, but also on the mental, cognitive, and social aspects and issues regarding polypharmacy in Parkinson's disease explored by previous studies.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study in patients discharged from the COVID designated areas of a large tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan from the 1st of May to the 31st of July, 2020. 581 patients were included and the COVID GRAM score was calculated at the time of admission and patients developing critical disease as per COVID GRAM study criteria (need of intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation or death) after 24 hours of admission were noted. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 56.314.8 years. Patients that developed critical illness (as per COVID GRAM study criteria) beyond 24 hours after admission had higher COVID GRAM scores at admission versus those that did not (183.280.7 versus 130.342.6). The Area under the Receiver Operator Curve for the COVID gram score to predict critical illness in the study population was 0.802 (95% confidence interval, 0.753-0.850). On binary logistic multivariable regression analysis, the COVID GRAM and SOFA scores on admission and need of ICU admission during hospitalization were significant predictors of mortality 24 hours after admission.

We showed that the HIDROX solution exhibits time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities, and that HIDROX has more potent virucidal activity than pure HT. The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities. Thus, the HIDROX-containing cream can be applied topically as an antiviral hand cream.

Thus, this study examines the perceptions of preservice teacher and language instructors on the use of Google Meet (GM) as a synchronous language learning tool for a distant online program in Cyprus. Design/methodology/approach: To elicit information on the perception of preservice teachers and language instructors on this issue, a quantitative research design was used for this study. Findings: Though the language instructors deemed GM effective and efficient as a language learning tool, the preservice teachers thought otherwise. Research limitations/implications: It was difficult to collect data during this pandemic outbreak. Obtaining ethical consent from the participants was difficult as well and so the sample size was small. Practical implications: The study was able to demonstrate that the use of GM was somewhat effective as a language learning tool for the online distant program, though the level of efficiency and effectiveness varies from preservice teachers to the language instructors. Also, the study was able to highlight the use of GM could be very effective if it is well managed by the teachers to stimulate student engagement during lessons. The study showcased that the unavailability of Internet data, poor Internet connection are possible constraints to the efficiency of GM. Recently, a university in Northern Cyprus has decided to partner with a telecommunication network (Turkcell) toward providing free Internet access for all registered students within a particular period of learning.

Factors at a national or health system-level that could influence delay were changing public service messages, an excessive focus on COVID-19 and urgent issues, and poor service integration. Influential factors at a primary care-level were communication and outreach, use of technology, gatekeeping, staff manner and the safety of the clinical practice environment. Factors that influenced patients' individual decisions to seek healthcare were the ability to self-manage and self-triage, consciousness of perceived pressure on health services and fear of infection. CONCLUSION: In future pandemic lockdowns or crises, appropriate access to primary care services can be improved by unambiguous national messages and better integration of services. Primary care practices should adopt rapid proactive outreach to patients, fostering a calm but safe clinical practice environment. More support for patients to self-manage and self-triage appropriately could benefit over-burdened health systems during lockdowns and as part of business as usual in less extraordinary times.","output":"Seeking Healthcare During Lockdown: Challenges, Opportunities and Lessons for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis is having a large impact on acute and chronic cardiac care.

An example is the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which led to the loss of lives and economic depreciation. One of the essential ways of handling the spread of viruses is the discovery and administration of vaccines. However, the major challenges of vaccination programs are associated with the vaccine cold chain management and cold storage facilities. This paper discusses how vaccine cold chain management and cold storage technology can address the challenges of vaccination programs. Specifically, it examines different systems for preserving vaccines in either liquid or frozen form to help ensure that they are not damaged during distribution from manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, A vaccine is likely to provide very low efficacy when it is not properly stored. According to preliminary studies, the inability to store vaccine properly is partly due to the incompetency of many stakeholders, especially in technical matters. The novelty of this study is to thoroughly explore cold storage technology for a faster and more comprehensive vaccine distribution hence it is expected to be one of the reference and inspiration for stakeholders.","output":"Vaccine cold chain management and cold storage technology to address the challenges of vaccination programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have reported a substantial drop in the number of patients attending the emergency department with acute coronary syndromes and a reduced number of cardiac procedures. We aimed to understand the scale, nature, and duration of changes to admissions for different types of acute coronary syndrome in England and to evaluate whether in-hospital management of patients has been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data on hospital admissions in England for types of acute coronary syndrome from Jan 1, 2019, to May 24, 2020, that were recorded in the Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care database. Admissions were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), myocardial infarction of unknown type, or other acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina). We identified revascularisation procedures undertaken during these admissions (ie, coronary angiography without percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], PCI, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery). We calculated the numbers of weekly admissions and procedures undertaken; percentage reductions in weekly admissions and across subgroups were also calculated, with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome declined from mid-February, 2020, falling from a 2019 baseline rate of 3017 admissions per week to 1813 per week by the end of March, 2020, a reduction of 40% (95% CI 37-43). This decline was partly reversed during April and May, 2020, such that by the last week of May, 2020, there were 2522 admissions, representing a 16% (95% CI 13-20) reduction from baseline. During the period of declining admissions, there were reductions in the numbers of admissions for all types of acute coronary syndrome, including both STEMI and NSTEMI, but relative and absolute reductions were larger for NSTEMI, with 1267 admissions per week in 2019 and 733 per week by the end of March, 2020, a percent reduction of 42% (95% CI 38-46). In parallel, reductions were recorded in the number of PCI procedures for patients with both STEMI (438 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 346 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 21%, 95% CI 12-29) and NSTEMI (383 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 240 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 37%, 29-45). The median length of stay among patients with acute coronary syndrome fell from 4 days (IQR 2-9) in 2019 to 3 days (1-5) by the end of March, 2020. INTERPRETATION: Compared with the weekly average in 2019, there was a substantial reduction in the weekly numbers of patients with acute coronary syndrome who were admitted to hospital in England by the end of March, 2020, which had been partly reversed by the end of May, 2020. The reduced number of admissions during this period is likely to have resulted in increases in out-of-hospital deaths and long-term complications of myocardial infarction and missed opportunities to offer secondary prevention treatment for patients with coronary heart disease. The full extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome will continue to be assessed by updating these analyses.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively influenced patient outcomes. The majority of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients received antibiotics during hospitalization. AIM: To analyze the factors that influenced CDI development after SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Between March 2020 to December 2020, we performed a prospective observational study including 447 patients diagnosed with CDI who were admitted to our tertiary referral university hospital. The diagnosis of CDI was based on the presence of diarrhea ( 3 watery stools within 24 h) associated with Clostridium difficile toxins A or B. We excluded patients with other etiology of acute diarrhea. RESULTS: Among the total 447 (12.5%) patients with CDI, most were male (54.3%) and mean age was 59.7  10.8 years. Seventy-six (17.0%) had history of COVID-19, most being elderly (COVID-19: 62.6  14.6 years vs non-COVID-19: 56.8  17.6 years, P = 0.007), with history of alcohol consumption (43.4% vs 29.4%, P = 0.017), previous hospitalizations (81.6% vs 54.9%, P < 0.001) and antibiotic treatments (60.5% vs 35.5%, P < 0.001), requiring higher doses of vancomycin and prone to recurrent disease (25.0% vs 13.1%, P = 0.011).

Methods A prospective longitudinal study design from first throughout third vaccination in Danish and American MS centers. All participants were treated with ocrelizumab. Antibody (Ab) levels were assessed before and after third vaccination using SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (Abbott Laboratories). B- and T-lymphocytes enumeration was done with BD Multitest(TM)6-color TBNK reagent. Spike-specific T-cell responses were measured through PBMC stimulation with spike peptide pools (JPT Peptide Technologies).

Individuals tend to actively seek the sources of meaning in their lives or consciously enact efforts to create or craft meaning in different life domains. These overall Life Crafting behaviors refer to the conscious efforts individuals exert to create meaning in their lives through (a) cognitively (re-)framing how they view life, (b) seeking social support systems to manage life challenges, and (c) actively seeking challenges to facilitate personal growth. Specifically, these behaviors are actioned to better align life goals, personal needs, values, and capabilities. However, no psychological assessment instrument currently exists to measure overall life crafting. As such, the purpose of this paper was twofold: to conceptualize life crafting and to develop, validate and evaluate a robust measure of overall life crafting. A mixed-method, multi-study research design was employed. First, nine participants were interviewed to determine the methods or techniques used to craft meaningful life experiences. These methods/techniques were used as indicators to create an initial item pool which was then reviewed by a panel of experts to ensure face validity. Second, in Study 1, the factorial structure of the instrument was explored by gathering data from a convenience sample (N = 331), with the results showing support for a three-factor structure of life crafting, consisting of (a) cognitive crafting, (b) seeking social support, and (c) seeking challenges. Finally, in Study 2 (N = 362), the aim was to confirm the factorial structure of the Life Crafting scale and to determine its level of internal consistency, partial measurement invariance across genders, and criterion validity [meaning in life ( = 0.91), mental health ( = 0.91), work engagement ( = 0.54), and job burnout ( = ?0.42)]. The results supported a second-order factorial model of Life Crafting, which comprised of three first-order factors (cognitive crafting, seeking social support, and seeking challenges). Therefore, the Life Crafting Scale can be used as a valid and reliable instrument to measure- and track the effectiveness of life crafting interventions.","output":"The Life Crafting Scale: Development and Validation of a Multi-Dimensional Meaning-Making Measure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs impair protective immunity following pneumococcal, influenza and viral hepatitis vaccination and increase the risk of serious respiratory infections. We sought to determine whether infliximab-treated patients with IBD have attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. DESIGN: Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared with a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin 47 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between 22 September and 23 December 2020. RESULTS: Rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% (161/4685) vs 6.0% (134/2250), p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.87), p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92), p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity. In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% (39/81) vs 83% (30/36), p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut-off index (0.2C5.6) vs 37.0 (15.2C76.1), p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is associated with attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 that were further blunted by immunomodulators used as concomitant therapy. Impaired serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection might have important implications for global public health policy and individual anti-TNF-treated patients. Serological testing and virus surveillance should be considered to detect suboptimal vaccine responses, persistent infection and viral evolution to inform public health policy.

The mental health need was summarized into two parts, needs expressed by doctors and nurses and needs observed by researchers. Doctors and nurses mostly did not feel that they needed any psychological support, but the researchers noticed several signs of stress or potential mental health problems among interviewees. Doctors and nurses faced significant complex and multidimensional difficulties. Many denied needing psychological support, even though the researchers noted signs that it might be helpful. Interventions and support strategies that involve mental health promotion activities should consider individual needs related to doctors and nurses' situation.","output":"The Difficulties and Mental Health Intervention Need of Doctors and Nurses in Biological Emergencies: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate immune memory was first described for monocytes and other myeloid cells. This memory is designated Immune Training, in which the host animals that had experienced pathogen infection earlier acquire improved resistance to a second infection. Innate immune memory is mediated by an epigenetic mechanism traced to transcriptional memory that is conserved throughout evolution and has been selected for the ability to mount an adaptive response to shifting environments. Accumulating evidence shows that not only peripheral myeloid cells but hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HSPCs) can acquire epigenetic memory upon pathogen exposure. Systemic pathogen infection causes HSCs to exit from quiescence and facilitate myeloid-biased differentiation that leads to efficient host defense. This sequence of events is common in HSC memory generation, which is triggered by different stimuli. Recent studies show that not only pathogens but other stimuli such as metabolic stress can generate memory in HSCs. This review summarizes recent publications relevant to HSC memory. We discuss the current understanding of initial sensors, soluble mediators/cytokines involved in memory formation, including Type I and Type II interferons along with future implications.","output":"Innate Immune Memory in Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells: Myeloid-Biased Differentiation and the Role of Interferon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As multiple adverse events in 2021 illustrated, virtually all aspects of our societal functioning -- from water and food security to energy supply to healthcare -- more than ever depend on the dynamics of environmental factors. Nevertheless, the social dimensions of weather and climate are noticeably less explored by the machine learning community, largely, due to the lack of reliable and easy access to use data. Here we present a unique not yet broadly available NASA's satellite dataset on aerosol optical depth (AOD), temperature and relative humidity and discuss the utility of these new data for COVID-19 biosurveillance. In particular, using the geometric deep learning models for semi-supervised classification on a county-level basis over the contiguous United States, we investigate the pressing societal question whether atmospheric variables have considerable impact on COVID-19 clinical severity.","output":"Using NASA Satellite Data Sources and Geometric Deep Learning to Uncover Hidden Patterns in COVID-19 Clinical Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been renewed interest in harnessing the power of the immune system as a countermeasure against infectious pathogens and cancers.

About one-quarter (25.6%) of children lived in communities of concentrated poverty. Findings suggest that achievement gaps by neighborhood disadvantage are large and present before Kindergarten, shrink during the Kindergarten year, but then widen the year following, and remain relatively consistent in the first years of elementary school. Growth in math skills appeared to vary more with neighborhood poverty than growth in reading skills. There was limited evidence that the relationship between neighborhood poverty and test score trajectories varied by child race, ethnicity, early education and Kindergarten experience, and parents immigration status, but growth differences across student characteristics were small.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 321 patients who presented with respiratory impairment suspicious for COVID-19 infection between February 3 and May 8, 2020 and who received a chest radiograph were included in this analysis. Imaging findings were classified as typical for COVID-19 (bilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations), non-typical (findings consistent with lobar pneumonia), indeterminate (all other distribution patterns of opacifications/consolidations), or none (no opacifications/consolidations). The sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive value for the diagnostic value of the category \\"typical\\" were determined. Chi2 test was used to compare the pattern distribution between the different types of pneumonia. RESULTS: Imaging patterns defined as typical for COVID-19 infections were documented in 35/111 (31.5a??%) patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection but only in 4/210 (2a??%) patients with any other kind of pneumonia, resulting in a sensitivity of 31.5a??%, a specificity of 98.1a??%, and a positive and negative predictive value of 89.7a??% or 73a??%, respectively. The sensitivity could be increased to 45.9a??% when defining also unilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations with no relevant pathology contralaterally as consistent with a COVID-19 infection, while the specificity decreases slightly to 93.3a??%. The pattern distribution between COVID-19 patients and those with other types of pneumonia differed significantly (pa??<a??0.0001). CONCLUSION: Although the moderate sensitivity does not allow the meaningful use of chest radiographs as part of primary screening, the specific pattern of findings in a relevant proportion of those affected should be communicated quickly as additional information and trigger appropriate protective measures. KEY POINTS:  COVID-19 infections show specific X-ray image patterns in 1/3 of patients..  Bilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations are typical imaging patterns..  Unilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations should also raise suspicion of COVID-19 infection.. CITATION FORMAT:  Kasper J, Decker J, Wiesenreiter K eta??al.

Material and methods: A total of 86 patients with COVID-19 were analyzed, including the clinical, laboratory and imaging features. The following imaging features were analyzed, the lesion amount, location, density, lung nodule, halo sign, reversed-halo sign, distribution pattern, inner structures and changes of adjacent structures. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test was used for the enumeration data. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to draw a regression equation to estimate the likelihood of severe and critical category. The forward conditional method was employed for variable selection. Results: Significant statistical differences were found in age (p = 0.001) and sex (p = 0.028) between mild and moderate and severe and critical category. No significant difference was found in clinical symptoms and WBC count between the two groups. The majority of cases (91.8%) showed multifocal lesions. The presence of GGO was higher in severe and critical category than in the mild and moderate category. (57.8% vs.31.7%, p = 0.015). Lymphocyte count was important indicator for the severe and critical category. Conclusion: The initial CT features of the different clinical category overlapped.

The topic of compassionate love has therefore attracted growing interest from researchers interested in its psychological and social dimensions. Given the importance of compassion to the education and health sectors, and the expansion of these sectors in Iran, this paper aims to provide Persian (Farsi) speaking practitioners and researchers with an effective instrument for measuring compassion. As such, the authors have translated the compassionate love for humanity scale-short form (CLS-H-SF) into the Persian language, and assessed the psychometric properties of this instrument among a sample of the Iranian population. A sample of 827 adults (49.9% women and 51.1% men) completed the Persian version of the CLS-H-SF through an online survey. Concurrent validity was assessed using the Persian versions of the positive and negative affect scale, self-esteem scale, and satisfaction with life scale. The CLS-H-SF positively correlated with positive affect, self-esteem and life satisfaction, and negatively correlated with negative affect. These findings indicate acceptable concurrent validity for the CLS-H-SF. Cronbachs alpha for the scale was 0.88, indicating good internal consistency between items. A confirmatory factor analysis supported a one-factor model same as the English version of the CLS-H-SF.

METHODS: A team of clinicians and educators rapidly reengineered the surgical care process. An online learning management system (LMS) and authoring tool that supported iterative remote asynchronous communication was used to build a learning module employed to train an interprofessional team to the new care process. RESULTS: Care process redesign was accomplished in a concentrated effort involving clinicians and educators. Patient flow and the role of each team member at every phase of care was presented in the LMS. The LMS was refined by input from team members provided through the authoring tool directly to the educator on the screens where the edit was applicable. The LMS was deployed after four days to more than 100 surgical team members who managed their first COVID-19 patient two days later. The number of COVID-19 patients managed was limited, but there were no untoward patient events and no staff exposure. CONCLUSION: Care process reengineering and deployment efforts are accelerated by early involvement of educators and use of an LMS with an authoring tool that supports rapid module build and refinement in a socially distant workplace. The LMS enables access on any online platform at a time convenient to team members who can then learn at their own pace.

Methods: Taking Hubei province of China as an example, where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of confirmed cases (total 67773 cases) and ten meteorological parameters up to March 10. Correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Results: Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=+0.358).The negative correlations included average temperature (r=-0.306), minimum temperature (r=-0.347), and average water vapor pressure (r=-0.326). The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1, the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. Conclusion: Statistically, the incidence of COVID-19 was correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure.

Many EDs have leveraged telehealth to innovatively respond to these challenges. This review describes the landscape of telehealth initiatives in emergency care that have been described during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature using PubMed, supplemented by a review of the gray literature (ie, non-peer reviewed), with input from subject matter experts to identify telehealth initiatives in emergency care during coronavirus disease 2019. We categorized types of telehealth use based on purpose and user characteristics. Results: We included 27 papers from our review of the medical literature and another 8 sources from gray literature review. The vast majority of studies (32/35) were descriptive in nature, with the additional inclusion of 2 cohort studies and one randomized clinical trial.

Conclusion: Telehealth has been used in a variety of manners during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, enabling innovation in emergency care delivery. The findings from this study can be used by institutions to consider how telehealth may address challenges in emergency care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and beyond.

METHODS: A matched caseCcontrol study was conducted in 366 Thai participants, including 122 who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR (case group) and 244 who were SARS-CoV-2-negative (control group). Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. RESULTS: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively).

Next to established criteria of objectivity, reliability and validity, ecological validity refers to the concerns of whether measurements and behavior in research settings are representative of the real-world. Since exercise neuroscience investigations using mobile electroencephalography are oftentimes conducted in laboratory settings under controlled environments, methodological approaches may interfere with the idea of ecological validity. This review utilizes an original ecological validity tool to assess the degree of ecological validity in current exercise neuroscience research. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify articles investigating cortical dynamics during goal-directed sports movement. To assess ecological validity, five elements (environment, stimulus, response, body and mind) were assessed on a continuum of artificiality-naturality and simplicity-complexity. 47 studies were included in the present review. Results indicate lowest average ratings for the element of environment. The elements stimulus, body and mind had mediocre ratings, and the element of response had the highest overall ratings. In terms of the type of sport, studies that assessed closed-skill indoor sports had the highest ratings, while closed-skill outdoor sports had the lowest overall rating. Our findings identify specific elements that are lacking in ecological validity and areas of improvement in current exercise neuroscience literature. Future studies may potentially increase ecological validity by moving from reductionist, artificial environments towards complex, natural environments, and incorporating real-world sport elements such as adaptive responses and competition.","output":"Ecological Validity in Exercise Neuroscience Research: A Systematic Investigation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, oncologists were mildly concerned about how it might affect cancer screening.

This phenomenon of ripple effect, immensely existing in practice, has received great interest in recent years. Moreover, forward and backward disruption propagations became major stressors for SCNs during the COVID-19 pandemic triggered by simultaneous and sequential supply and demand disruptions. However, current literature has paid less attention to the different impacts of the directions of disruption propagation. This study examines the disruption propagation through simulating simple interaction rules of firms inside the SCN. Specifically, an agent-based computational model is developed to delineate the supply chain disruption propagation behavior. Then, we conduct multi-level quantitative analysis to explore the effects of forward and backward disruption propagation, moderated by network structure, network-level health and node-level vulnerability. Our results demonstrate that it is practically important to differentiate between forward and backward disruption propagation, as they are distinctive in the associated mitigation strategies and in the effects on network and individual firm performance. Forward disruption propagation generally can be mitigated by substitute and backup supply and has greater impact on firms serving the assembly role and on the supply/assembly networks, whereas backward disruption propagation is normally mitigated by flexible operation and distribution and has bigger impact on firms serving the distribution role and on distribution networks. We further analyze the investment strategies in a dual-focal supply network under disruption propagation. We provide propositions to facilitate decision-making and summarize important managerial implications.","output":"Ripple Effect in the Supply Chain Network: Forward and Backward Disruption Propagation, Network Health and Firm Vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was occurred. Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 are more likely to die, especially elderly patients. We aimed to describe the effect of age on the clinical and immune characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively included 32 patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 by the local health authority and who were admitted to the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou, China between January 3 and March 20, 2020. Clinical information and experimental test data were retrospectively collected for the patients. The 32 patients in this study were all in a critical condition and were classified as severe, according to the guidelines of 2019-nCoV infection from the National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China. Data were compared between those <60 years old and 60 years old. RESULTS: Of 32 patients, 13 were under 60 years old, and 19 patients were 60 years old. The most common symptom among all patients upon admission was fever (93.8%, 30/32). Compared to younger patients, older patients exhibited increased comorbidities. Among patients who were 60 years and older, platelet count, direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin(IBIL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were significantly higher than in younger patients who were less than 60 years old. CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and NKT lymphocytes were decreased, CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly increased in all 32 patients, while there were no evident differences between younger and older patients. The CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory, rate, blood pressure plus age 65 years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and pH value were significantly higher in older patients than in patients who were under 60 years old. However, the PaO2 and PaO2:FiO2 were lower in older patients than the younger. Compared to patients under 60 years old, patients who were 60 years and older tended to develop ARDS (15 [78.9%] vs 5 [38.5%]), septic shock (7 [36.8%] vs 0 [0.0%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (13 [68.4%] vs 3[23.1%]). Dynamic trajectories of seven laboratory parameters were tracked on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and significant differences in lymphocyte count (P = 0.026), D-dimer (P = 0.010), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.000) and C-reactive protein (P = 0.000) were observed between the two age groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of critically ill patients were 60 or older. Furthermore, rapid disease progression was noted in elderly patients. Therefore, close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed in elderly COVID-19 patients.","output":"The effect of age on the clinical and immune characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19: A preliminary report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Critical illness myopathy (CIM) is a consequence of modern critical care resulting in general muscle wasting and paralyses of all limb and trunk muscles, and prolonged weaning from the ventilator. CIM is associated with severe morbidity/mortality and significant negative socioeconomic consequences which has become increasingly evident during the current COVID-19 pandemic, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS Ten neuro-ICU patients exposed to long-term controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) were followed with repeated muscle biopsies 3times/week for up to 12 days. Single muscle fiber contractile recordings were conducted on the first and final biopsy. A multiomics approach was taken to analyze gene and protein expression in muscle and plasma at all six timepoints. FINDINGS i) A progressive preferential myosin loss, the hallmark of CIM, was observed in all neuro-ICU patients during the observation period. The myosin loss was coupled to a general transcriptional downregulation of myofibrillar proteins and activation of protein degradation pathways, resulting in significant muscle fiber atrophy and loss in force generation capacity which declined >65% during the 12-day observation period, ii) membrane excitability was not affected as indicated by the maintained compound muscle action potential amplitude upon supramaximal stimulation of upper and lower extremity motor nerves, and iii), analyses of plasma revealed early activation of inflammatory and proinflammatory pathways, as well as a redistribution of zinc ions from plasma in parallel with the activation of zinc transporters. INTERPRETATION The mechanical ventilation induced lung injury with release of cytokines/chemokines and the complete mechanical silencing uniquely observed in immobilized ICU patients affecting skeletal muscle gene/protein expression are forwarded as the dominant factors triggering CIM. It is therefore suggested that future intervention strategies should target the lung injury and the mechanical silencing in critical ill ICU patients.","output":"A prospective clinical study on the mechanisms underlying Critical Illness Myopathy - A time-course approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Data on lymphoma patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) are lacking. A large cancer cohort study showed that number of comorbidities, active cancer, and worse performance status were associated with increased 30-day mortality (Kuderer 2020). Variables contributing to risk of poor outcomes of COVID-19 in lymphoma patients have not been reported. We aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on lymphoma patients' clinical outcomes including the effect of lymphoma-specific therapies on COVID-19 recovery. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. Data was obtained from 4,302 patients flagged in the electronic health records system with COVID-19, of which 89 lymphoma patients were identified. Presenting clinical information was abstracted from review of unstructured notes as well as structured data. Demographic and baseline parameters were summarized. The differences in the distributions between CD20 antibody treated or non-treated patients were compared using Mann-Whitney's test for continuous variables and Pearson's chi-squared test for categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to compare the median time from date of diagnosis to date of last follow up or death. Results: 89 lymphoma patients were evaluable. The median age was 67 (range 29-94) with a male predominance (63%). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (54%), shortness of breath (52%), cough (47%), and gastrointestinal (13%). Hypertension and diabetes were present in 51 of 89 (57%) and 19 of 89 (21%) patients, respectively. Laboratory abnormalities included a median absolute neutrophil count of 4.67x103/mcL (range 0-15.9) and lymphocyte count 0.8x103/mcL (range 0-97.7). Inflammatory markers at diagnosis showed median CRP 9.4 mg/dL (0.7-126, n=62) and ferritin of 966 ng/mL (96-14,511, n=42). 76 of 89 (85%) patients required hospitalization, 11 (12%) required mechanical ventilation, and 31 (Case Fatality Rate=35%) died. The overall survival of lymphoma patients is shown in Figure 1A. The presence of hypertension (HR 3.7, p=.005), diabetes (HR 2.6, p=.02), or advanced age 70 (HR 2.2, p=.03) were associated with increased COVID-19 related mortality (Figure 1B-D). Lymphoma subtypes included CLL (n=32), DLBCL or Burkitt's (n=18), indolent non-Hodgkin (n=20), Hodgkin (n=6), T cell lymphoma (n=6), and other (n=7). 76% were stage III-IV (n=68), with 40 patients (44%) on active lymphoma treatment at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. 41 patients (48%) received rituximab within the last 3 years, with 11 requiring chronic immune gamma globulin replacement. 25 patients were tested for seropositivity to COVID-19 at median of 42 days from COVID-19 diagnosis (IQR 32-50). 5 of 9 (55%) patients who did not receive CD20 antibody therapy showed immunity. In contrast, out of 16 patients who received anti-CD20 treatment and had a COVID-19 IGG antibody test, only 2 (12.5%) became seropositive (p =.03). Patients who tested seronegative in the CD20 antibody group and had a second negative IgG antibody test (n=6) were a median of 50 days (range 12-82 days) from COVID-19 diagnosis. The median time from diagnosis until a negative COVID-19 PCR test in CD20 antibody treated patients was 56 days (IQR 29-67.5) compared to 14 days (IQR 13-54) (p=0.037) in CD20 antibody na?ve patients. Conclusion: Survival was poor in lymphoma patients with hypertension, diabetes, or age  70. The rate of seropositivity in patients treated with CD20 antibody therapy was significantly lower (12.5% vs 55%). Patients exposed to anti-CD20 therapy also required significantly more days to clear viral shedding (median 56 days vs 14 days). While limited by sample size, this study merits further validation and suggests anti-CD20 therapy may place lymphoma patients at higher risk of prolonged or repeated COVID-19 infection. Further investigations to determine infectivity of patients with prolonged SARS-CoV2 shedding are needed.

In this study, we investigated the pulmonary function and computed tomography (CT) findings of critical COVID-19 patients approximately 100 days after symptom onset. METHODS: We retrospectively extracted data on critical COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from April to December 2020 and evaluated their pulmonary function, residual respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities on CT. RESULTS: We extracted 17 patients whose median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR], 59-67) years. The median lengths of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation were 23 (IQR, 18-38) and 9 (IQR, 6-13) days, respectively. At 100 days after symptom onset, the following pulmonary function abnormalities were noted in 8 (47%) patients: a diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) of <80% for 6 patients (35%); a percent vital capacity (%VC) of <80% for 4 patients (24%); and a forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1%) of <70% for 1 patient (6%) who also presented with %DLCO and %VC abnormalities. Twelve (71%) patients reported residual respiratory symptoms and 16 (94%) showed abnormalities on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Over 90% of the critical COVID-19 patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation continued presenting with abnormal imaging studies and 47% of the patients presented with abnormal pulmonary function 100 days after symptom onset.

This single-institution case series evaluates the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the management of metastatic HB. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2008 and February 2015, RFA was used as part of multidisciplinary management for HB recurrence or metastasis in 5 children (median 5.0 years old) in an attempt to provide locoregional control and preclude additional surgery. Combined local treatments of 38 metachronous metastases included surgical metastasectomy (14 lesions: 7 lung, 7 liver), percutaneous RFA (23 lesions: 21 lung, 1 liver, 1 bone), and stereotactic radiotherapy (1 liver lesion). RESULTS For lesions treated with RFA (median diameter 6 mm, range 3-15 mm), local control was achieved in 22/23 metastases (95.6%) with median follow-up of 30.1 months after RFA (range 18.9-65.7). Median hospitalization was 3 days (2-7), with major complications limited to 1 pneumothorax requiring temporary small-caliber chest tube. Four children remain in complete remission with median follow-up of 67 months (range 41.2-88.8) after primary tumor resection, with mean disease-free survival of 31.7 months after last local treatment.

This study aims to clarify the material basis of total ginsenosides of red ginseng (RGW) and verify the activity of RGW in treating lipid metabolism disorders caused by T2DM. Methods: An ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) technology was applied to quantitatively analyze RGW. A T2DM rat model was established to verify the activity of RGW in treating lipid metabolism disorders caused by diabetes. First, the changes in diabetes-related parameters were observed, then the biochemical parameters of the rat serum and liver were measured, and finally, the pathological sections of the rat liver were observed, and the content of short-chain fatty acids in stools was measured. The in vitro activity of RGW was verified by fatty degenerated HepG2 cells. Results: A total of 10 ginsenosides were identified and quantitatively analyzed in RGW. Experimental results demonstrated that RGW can improve lipid metabolism disorders. RGW significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose and TG and TC levels in T2DM rats, and hepatic steatosis was significantly ameliorated. In vitro experiments by RGW treatment also significantly attenuated lipid deposition in HepG2 cells. RGW upregulated the content of 5 short-chain fatty acids in rat stools, which are related to lipid oxidation and liver gluconeogenesis. Conclusion: The total RGW were quantitatively analyzed by UHPLC-MS, and its effect on lipid metabolism of T2DM was studied.

Building on qualitative interview studies of the Norwegian middle and working classes a moral ideal type labelled the socially responsible citizen is identified. Findings: The authors argue that dugnad is embedded in a moral repertoire of the socially responsible citizen that is indicative of a specific Norwegian welfare mentality and that is imperative for the sustainability and resilience of the Norwegian welfare model. This repertoire is found across social classes and has to be understood in light of the Norwegian welfare model and the role of civil society.

MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients with an acute ischemic stroke, who underwent endovascular recanalization using the APERIO? thrombectomy device with a diameter of 3.5 mm, were identified in retrospect and included in the present analysis. Demographic and clinical data as well as data on the procedures performed were collected (patient sex, mean age, NIHSS, mRS, TICI score, and complications). RESULTS Stent retriever-based thrombectomy with the Aperio? 3.5/28 alone (n = 10 vessels) or in combination with other devices (n = 13 vessels) was performed in 22 acute stroke patients with embolic occlusions of distal branches of the anterior and posterior circulations (median NIHSS = 8.5). For vessels treated with the Aperio? 3.5/28, we achieved a TICI 2b/3 reperfusion rate of 73.9%. One patient suffered a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombectomy; otherwise, no procedure-related complications were seen. CONCLUSION Our data suggest that mechanical thrombectomy of distal cerebral artery occlusions with the Aperio? 3.5/28 is feasible and in general safe, thus offering a promising option for endovascular stroke therapy.

Furthermore, the present study assessed the prognostic value of GINS2 in patients with breast cancer via the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The results of the present study demonstrated that the mRNA levels of GINS2 were significantly higher in breast cancer tissue compared with normal tissue. In addition, high mRNA expression levels of GINS2 were associated with high Scarff-Bloom-Richardson status grades, a basal-like status and age (51 years); however, it was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The survival analysis revealed that increased GINS2 mRNA levels were associated with a worse prognosis for relapse-free survival in all patients with breast cancer, particularly in those with estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive subtypes. In addition, a positive association between the GINS2, CENPM and MCM4 genes was confirmed.

Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: \\"Which patients to attend\\", \\"How should the clinic work\\", and \\"What interventions should be avoided\\". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.","output":"Atencin de pacientes oftalmolgicos durante la pandemia COVID-19: revisin panormica rpida./ Atencin de pacientes oftalmolgicos durante la pandemia COVID-19: revisin panormica rpida./ Care of ophthalmological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presented guidance describes the basic principles of the management of children admitted to the emergency department (ED), emergency room (ER), or hospital diagnosed or not with COVID-19 This guidance is based on the literature review conducted and is valid at the date of issue It may evolve over time as our knowledge about the infection increases The majority of children will develop mild symptoms from the infection In addition, the majority of children will not have any breathing problems Current experience suggests that the department of paediatrics will not be involved in the frontline fight against coronavirus However, we will play a crucial role in that fight, and so we should remember and plan our actions well ? 2020 Termedia Publishing House Ltd All rights reserved","output":"Guidance for paediatric emergency departments/rooms and departments of paediatrics on the management of a child suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March of 2020, the COVID19 pandemic had expanded to the United States of America (US).

A whole-body PBPK model was created to simulate 100 adult individuals aged 18-60 years. Physiological changes (e.g., plasma protein concentration, liver size, CP450 expression, hepatic blood flow) and portal vein shunt were incorporated into the LD model. The changes were implemented by using the Child-Pugh (CP) classification system. DEX was qualified using clinical data in healthy adults for both oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) administrations and similarly propranolol (PRO) and midazolam (MDZ) were qualified with PO and IV clinical data in healthy and LD adults. The qualified model was subsequently used to simulate a 6 mg PO and 20 mg IV dose of DEX in patients with varying degrees of LD, with and without shunting. The PBPK model was successfully qualified across DEX, MDZ and PRO. In contrast to healthy adults, the simulated systemic clearance of DEX decreased (35% - 60%) and the plasma concentrations increased (170% - 400%) in patients with LD. Moreover, at higher doses of DEX, the AUC ratio between healthy/LD individuals remained comparable to lower doses. The exposure of DEX in different stages of LD was predicted through PBPK modelling, providing a rational framework to predict PK in complex clinical scenarios related to COVID-19. Model simulations suggest dose adjustments of DEX in LD patients are not necessary considering the low dose administered in the COVID-19 protocol.","output":"PBPK modelling of dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 and liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a public health concern, and increasingly, individuals experiencing loneliness are seeking support on online forums, some of which focus on discussions around loneliness (loneliness forums). Some of these individuals may also seek support around loneliness on online forums not related to loneliness or well-being (nonloneliness forums). Hence, to design and implement appropriate and efficient online loneliness interventions, it is important to understand how individuals who express and seek support around loneliness on online loneliness forums communicate in nonloneliness forums; this could provide further insights into the support needs and concerns of these users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore how users who express the feeling of loneliness and seek support around loneliness on an online loneliness forum communicate in an online nonloneliness forum. METHODS: A total of 2401 users who expressed loneliness in posts published on a loneliness forum on Reddit and had published posts in a nonloneliness forum were identified. Using latent Dirichlet allocation (a natural language processing algorithm); Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (a psycholinguistic dictionary); and the word scoreCbased language features valence, arousal, and dominance, the language use differences in posts published in the nonloneliness forum by these users compared to a control group of users who did not belong to any loneliness forum on Reddit were determined. RESULTS: It was found that in posts published in the nonloneliness forum, users who expressed loneliness tend to use more words associated with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count categories on sadness (Cohen d=0.10) and seeking to socialize (Cohen d=0.114), and use words associated with valence (Cohen d=0.364) and dominance (Cohen d=0.117). In addition, they tend to publish posts related to latent Dirichlet allocation topics such as relationships (Cohen d=0.105) and family and friends and mental health (Cohen d=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: There are clear distinctions in language use in nonloneliness forum posts by users who express loneliness compared to a control group of users.

The goal of this study is to evaluate fear of relapse, social support, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress level) of Iranian patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic stage. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. We asked all cases to fill valid and reliable Persian version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), perceived social support, and fear of relapse scale questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. Female to male ratio was (F/M) = 4.6. Mean age and mean duration of disease were 35.38.6 and 7.15 years, respectively. Mean scores of social support, DASS, and FoR questionnaires were 63.116.8, 16.413.4, and 51.417.3, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between social support and FoR scores and also significant positive correlations between components of DASS and FoR. Linear regression analysis by considering FoR as dependent variable and age, sex, marital status, duration of the disease, and EDSS as dependent variables showed that sex was an independent predictor of FoR score.

However, little is known about the use of health information technology in community-engaged research, such as which types of health information technology are used, which populations are engaged, and what are the research outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this scoping review were to examine studies that used health information technology for community engagement and to assess (1) the types of populations, (2) community engagement strategies, (3) types of health information technology tools, and (4) outcomes of interest. METHODS: We searched PubMed and PCORI Literature Explorer using terms related to health information technology, health informatics, community engagement, and stakeholder involvement. This search process yielded 967 papers for screening. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 37 papers were analyzed for key themes and for approaches relevant to health information technology and community engagement research. RESULTS: This analysis revealed that the communities engaged were generally underrepresented populations in health-related research, including racial or ethnic minority communities such as Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Latino ethnicity, and communities from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The studies focused on various age groups, ranging from preschoolers to older adults. The studies were also geographically spread across the United States and the world. Community engagement strategies included collaborative development of health information technology tools and partnerships to promote use (encompassing collaborative development, use of community advisory boards, and focus groups for eliciting information needs) and use of health information technology to engage communities in research (eg, through citizen science). The types of technology varied across studies, with mobile or tablet-based apps being the most common platform. Outcomes measured included eliciting user needs and requirements, assessing health information technology tools and prototypes with participants, measuring knowledge, and advocating for community change. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the current landscape at the intersection of health information technology tools and community-engaged research approaches. It highlights studies in which various community-engaged research approaches were used to design culturally centered health information technology tools, to promote health information technology uptake, or for engagement in health research and advocacy. Our findings can serve as a platform for generating future research upon which to expand the scope of health information technology tools and their use for meaningful stakeholder engagement. Studies that incorporate community context and needs have a greater chance of cocreating culturally centered health information technology tools and better knowledge to promote action and improve health outcomes.","output":"Intersection of Health Informatics Tools and Community Engagement in Health-Related Research to Reduce Health Inequities: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an abrupt behavioural change in the form of the widespread wearing of masks has become prominent (1) Wearing a mask is beneficial in lowering the risk of virus transmission However, this measure is also known to cause various facial skin problems(2, 3) , and their incidence might differ with the type of mask used","output":"Adverse skin reactions following different types of mask usage during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The etiological mechanism of hypospadias is multifactorial and may be heterogeneous by severity. To date, very limited analyses on proteome in hypospadias have been conducted, and there are still no severe hypospadias proteomics analyses. Methods: In our study, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics was performed, exploring the clinical samples from hypospadias patients and healthy donators, in order to identify distinctly expressed proteins for severe hypospadias. To further uncover the mechanistic links in these complex proteomics data, we performed several core ingenuity pathway analyses (IPA) to predict, based on these observed different expression of proteins (DEPs). Results: Compared with the unaffected controls, 299 proteins were found to be down-regulated and 176 proteins up-regulated in severe hypospadias foreskin tissues. Functional annotation revealed that these DEPs were mainly in the extracellular space and were associated with complement activation and coagulation cascades. Similarly, the IPA core analysis revealed enriched pathways of the acute phase response signaling and complement system, demonstrating that by mediating their targeted, differentiated expressed proteins (A2M, APOE, C4A/C4B, C5, CAT, CD74, CFP, CREB1, CTSB, FGA, FGB, FGG, FN1, FOS, HP, LYZ, PF4, RBP1, S100A12, SERPINA3, SLC2A1, and THBS1) may be involved in the activation of myeloid cell degranulation, phagocytes degranulation, molecule secretion, and were mainly regulated by CSF1, JNK, STAT1, and STAT3.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed among dentists across the globe using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. The questionnaire was divided into 4 sections: the 1st one contained personal information, whereas the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sections assessed knowledge (11 questions), attitudes (6 questions) and practices (7 questions) of the dentists. The data was subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate linear regression, and Pearson's correlation; 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and odds ratio (OR) was obtained. The analysis was done using IBM SPSS for Windows, v. 21.0. RESULTS: The total number of the responses received (860) was divided with regard to various continents (Asia, Americas - North and South, Europe, Africa, and other - Australia and Antarctica). The largest number of dentists came from the Asian continent (264; 30.7%).

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study whether the hemostatic status in ACLF is merely an exaggeration from the status in patients with compensated and acutely decompensated cirrhosis, or whether sepsis-associated hemostatic changes contribute. METHODS: We performed extensive hemostatic profiling in 31 adult patients with ACLF, 20 patients with sepsis without underlying CLD, and 40 healthy controls. RESULTS: We found similarly elevated plasma levels of the platelet adhesive protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) and decreased levels of the VWF-regulating protease ADAMTS13 in both groups compared to healthy controls. In vivo markers of activation of coagulation (TAT, D-dimer) were similarly elevated in both groups compared to controls, but ex vivo thrombin generating capacity was similar between patients and controls, despite a much more profound INR elevation in ACLF. Plasma fibrinogen levels were much higher in septics, which was accompanied by a decreased ex vivo clot permeability and an increased in ex vivo resistance to clot lysis. All hemostatic parameters were remarkably stable over the first 10 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: We have found hemostatic changes in ACLF to partially overlap with that of patients with sepsis, and evidence of preserved hemostatic capacity in both patient groups.

Design/Methods/Approach: An online survey has been conducted to examine self-protective behaviour in times of public health crisis. The survey was distributed to Slovenian citizens (n = 280) using the social network Facebook. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and measured variables. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine associations between identified factors. Findings: The results of the study indicate that there are no significant differences in self-reported self-protection between younger adults and others. Additionally, attitude toward self-protective measures is the most important predictor of self-protective behaviour for both age groups. Only the attitude is significantly associated with self-protective behaviour among young adults, whereas among others, all three predictors are significantly associated with self-protective behaviour, explaining nearly twice the variance. Research Limitations/Implications: This research contributes to the understanding of motivators that drive individuals to engage in self-protective behaviour in times of health crises. It provides insight into young adults' self-protective behaviour. Most of the limitations are related to the sample, which only contains respondents from one social network and one country. Originality/Value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explored the self-protective behaviour of young adults during COVID-19 using the theory of planned behaviour and compares the differences in self-protective behaviour predictors among different age groups.","output":"Self-protective Behaviour Among Young Adults During Public Health Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a current health concern in the world. People applying the prevention methods of COVID-19 are vital determinants of curbing the spread of the coronavirus. This study aimed to assess the practices and associated factors of the COVID-19 preventive measures among Dire Dawa residents. METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional mixed method was used. We conducted the study between June 15th and July 15th, 2020. The subjects of the study were selected by using systematic random sampling. We collected data through face-to-face and in-depth interviews. Both bivariate and multiple logistic regression were employed to determine the predictor variables with the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures. Thematic content analysis analyzed qualitative data. RESULTS: The practice of COVID-19 preventive measures was 40.7% (95% CI: 37C44.4%).

The qualitative result revealed the communities are not willingly practicing prevention measures because of carelessness and ignorant of the consequences of COVID-19, and some communities believed that COVID-19 is not a real pandemic rather government uses it merely to gain political profit. CONCLUSION: The proportion of practice of COVID-19 preventive measures was low. Sex, marital status, income, history of chronic disease, history of khat chewing, knowledge, and attitude about COVID-19 were associated factors with COVID-19 preventive practices. The communities were not practicing the COVID-19 prevention method because of poor knowledge and a negative attitude.","output":"Practice of COVID-19 Prevention Measures and Associated Factors Among Residents of Dire Dawa City, Eastern Ethiopia: Community-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID 19 outbreak has hit the global (including the EU) economy unexpectedly and with great force. Many so far healthy undertakings have had to face the looming lack of liquidity. In order to counter the damage inflicted on undertakings and to perverse the continuity of economic activity during and after the coronavirus pandemic, public authorities were forced to step in and launch various types of support measures for entrepreneurs. This has raised particular issues from the State aid regime perspective. The article seeks to answer the question what is the EU response to the coronavirus pandemic in terms of the revised state aid policy. To this end, it is discussed what types of public instruments for entrepreneurs constitute state aid and thus fall within the EU control;what concrete support measures for business are utilized by member states in these troubled times and what are the guiding principles in deciding on their approval by the European Commission.

In this study, we describe sequence-independent amplification for samples containing ultra-low amounts of viral RNA coupled with Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly optimized for viral genomes. With 5 million reads, we capture 96 to 100% of the viral protein coding region of HIV, respiratory syncytial and West Nile viral samples from as little as 100 copies of viral RNA.

DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care facility. PATIENTS: All patients 2 years of age and older tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 14, 2020, and April 30, 2020, who had at least 2 SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests within 7 days. METHODS: The primary outcome measure was a false-negative testing episode, which we defined as an initial negative test followed by a positive test within the subsequent 7 days. Data collected included symptoms, demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, labs, and imaging studies. Logistic regression was used to model associations between clinical variables and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: Of the 1,009 SARS-CoV-2 test results included in the analysis, 4.0% were false-negative results. In multivariable regression analysis, compared with true-negative test results, false-negative test results were associated with anosmia or ageusia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4C50.5; P = .02), having had a COVID-19Cpositive contact (aOR, 10.5; 95% CI, 4.3C25.4; P < .0001), and having an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (aOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2C9.3; P = .03).

Understanding the temporal pattern of subway ridership through statistical models is crucial during such shocks. However, many existing statistical frameworks may not be a good fit to analyze the ridership data sets during the pandemic since some of the modeling assumption might be violated during this time. In this paper, utilizing change point detection procedures, we propose a piece-wise stationary time series model to capture the nonstationary structure of subway ridership. Specifically, the model consists of several independent station based autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models concatenated together at certain time points. Further, data-driven algorithms are utilized to detect the changes of ridership patterns as well as to estimate the model parameters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data sets of focus are daily ridership of subway stations in New York City for randomly selected stations. Fitting the proposed model to these data sets enhances our understanding of ridership changes during external shocks, both in terms of mean (average) changes as well as the temporal correlations.","output":"Non-Stationary Time Series Model for Station Based Subway Ridership During Covid-19 Pandemic (Case Study: New York City) (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS Gut microbiota has been reported to protect from lung viral infection in animal models by stimulating type-I interferon signaling. Type-I interferons can have direct antiviral activity while also stimulating antibody-producing B cells. Antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) have been correlated to faster infection clearance and protection against reinfection. A specific 4-strain probiotic combination (Pediococcus acidilactici CECT7483 plus Lactoplantibacillus plantarum CECT7484, CECT7485 and CECT30292) was recently studied in a randomized, quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 300 SARS-CoV2-infected, symptomatic ambulatory patients (NCT04517422). Study subjects did not receive corticosteroids or antivirals. Compared to placebo, probiotic intervention (2x109 cfu/day for 30 days) achieved faster symptom clearance and increased SARS-CoV2-specific immunoglobulins M and G (IgM and IgG). We hypothesize these effects could be related to increased type-I interferon signaling. METHODS A random subset of 70 subjects (35 probiotic and 35 placebo) was selected out of the 300 participants in the clinical study. Stored serum samples collected on day 0 (baseline), 15 and 30 (end of intervention) were analyzed for interferon-alpha 2a (IFNa) and interferon-beta 1a (IFNb) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Demographic data, baseline viral load, symptom duration and SARS-CoV2-specific IgM and IgG serum titers were retrieved from patient case report forms. Differences between probiotic and placebo were compared using Mann-Whitney or Chi-squared tests, as appropriate. Correlations between type-I interferons and other variables were assessed by Spearman correlation. All procedures on study subjects had been approved by the Internal Review Board of Hospital General Dr. Manuel Gea (Mexico City) and adhered to Helsinki Declaration. SUMMARY OF RESULTS In the selected subset of patients, study groups were comparable at baseline (all p>0.10, Table 1). Probiotic treatment was associated to a larger increase of IFNa on day 30 (p=0.007) and of IFNb on days 15 and 30 (both p<0.001), compared to placebo (Figure 1). Similarly, SARS-CoV2-specific IgM and IgG were higher on days 15 and 30 (all p<0.001) and duration of fever, cough, headache and myalgia were shorter (all p<0.05) in probiotic compared to placebo. Increase in IFNb across the study correlated to increase in SARS-CoV2-specific IgM (rho=0.55, p<0.001) and IgG (rho=0.61, p<0.001), and inversely correlated to duration of cough (rho=-0.26, p=0.033) and fever (rho=-0.24, p=0.042). Conversely, increase in IFNa correlated to increase in SARS-CoV2-specific IgM (rho=0.33, p=0.005) only. Neither increase in IFNa nor IFNb correlated to age, number of metabolic comorbidities or days from onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION Compared to placebo, oral administration of a specific 4-strain probiotic combination resulted in significant increase in type-I interferons in serum, especially IFNb, correlating to higher SARS-CoV2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies and faster clearance of some symptoms.","output":"Probiotic Effect on SARS-CoV2 Immunity Is Associated to Type-1 Interferons: A Post-Hoc Analysis of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As new technology becomes more integrated in daily tasks, new challenges to the right to the protection of personal data arise.

However, they fail to generate plausible results inside the missing regions for irregular and large holes as there is a lack of understanding between missing regions and existing counterparts. To overcome this limitation, we combine two non-local mechanisms including a contextual attention module (CAM) and an implicit diversified Markov random fields (ID-MRF) loss with a multi-scale architecture which uses several dense fusion blocks (DFB) based on the dense combination of dilated convolution to guide the generative network to restore discontinuous and continuous large masked areas. To prevent color discrepancies and grid-like artifacts, we apply the ID-MRF loss to improve the visual appearance by comparing similarities of long-distance feature patches. To further capture the long-term relationship of different regions in large missing regions, we introduce the CAM. Although CAM has the ability to create plausible results via reconstructing refined features, it depends on initial predicted results. Hence, we employ the DFB to obtain larger and more effective receptive fields, which benefits to predict more precise and fine-grained information for CAM. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both in quantity and quality.","output":"Non-Local and Multi-Scale Mechanisms for Image Inpainting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are highly regarded components of pharmacy residency applications, as they provide insight into an applicant's character and capabilities. In other medical fields, differences in language have been reported for letters written for female and male applicants; however, data on gender differences in LORs for pharmacy residency applications are currently lacking. METHODS: LORs for applicants to our institution's postgraduate year 1 pharmacy residency program for the 2019-2020 academic year were extracted and processed by a natural language processing service. Words within 18 categories were identified and counted for each LOR. Total was also compared. RESULTS: Of the 473 LORs included for analysis, 320 (67.7%) were written for female applicants and 153 (32.3%) were written for male applicants. Approximately two-thirds of all writers were women for both female and male applicants. In comparing letters for women and men, there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of LORs that contained terms in categories described as gendered, solitary/reserved, and desire. There was no statistically significant difference in total or in the presence of words in other categories such as grindstone, standout, agentic, or communal. When controlling for grade point average, writer gender, duration that the writer knew the applicant, and the writer's professional position, there were no changes to the statistical findings. CONCLUSION: Letters written for female and male applicants were largely similar with regard to length and word categories utilized. While no clear gender bias was found when evaluating pharmacy residency LORs, writers must continue to assess their implicit biases and how those biases might affect a candidate's application.","output":"Assessment of gender differences in letters of recommendation for pharmacy residency applicants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Testing plays a critical role in treatment and prevention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT. Methods: Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a hospital setting; and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a community setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the cost and impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgment. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters. Results: In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 85%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 90% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions. Conclusions: Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and cost-effective, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.","output":"Quantifying the potential value of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19: a modelling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The manifestations of COVID-19 have been evolving over time. Various post-COVID-19 syndromes are being recognised. Various viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and we expect a similar outcome with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 virus penetrates various tissues and organs and has a predisposition to lead to endotheliitis that may cause vascular manifestations including thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to activate Toll-like receptors and the complement system. It perpetuates NETosis and leads to autoantibody formation. These predispose to systemic autoimmunity. Both reactive arthritis and connective tissue disorders such as lupus and inflammatory myositis have been reported after COVID-19. Other reported autoimmune disorders include haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenia, cutaneous vasculitis, and Guillain BarrClike acute demyelinating disorders. The multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children and its adult counterpart are another post-COVID-19 entity that presents as an admixture of Kawasaki disease and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. Patients with preexisting rheumatic diseases may flare during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. They may develop novel autoimmune features also. The immune-suppressants used during the acute COVID-19 illness may confound the outcomes whereas comorbidities present in patients with rheumatic diseases may mask them.

Electrodermal activity (EDA) was recorded simultaneously to indicate participants' arousal levels. Results showed that both background speech and white noise significantly improved visual WM performance, which further correlated with individuals' changes of EDA signals.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate heterogeneity in associations between various heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality. Method and results We used data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry and LEOSS study. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between different types of pre-existent heart disease and in-hospital mortality. 10,481 patients with COVID-19 were included (22.4% aged 66-75 years; 38.7% female) of which 30.5% had a history of cardiac disease. Patients with heart disease were older, predominantly male and more likely to have other comorbid conditions when compared to those without. COVID-19 symptoms at presentation did not differ between these groups. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease (30.3%; n=968 versus 15.7%; n=1143). However, following multivariable adjustment this difference was not significant (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.06 [95% CI 0.98-1.15, p-value 0.13]). Associations with in-hospital mortality by heart disease subtypes differed considerably, with the strongest association for NYHA III/IV heart failure (aRR 1.43 [95% CI 1.22-1.68, p-value <0.001]) and atrial fibrillation (aRR 1.14 [95% CI 1.04-1.24, p-value 0.01]).

Whether subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevents severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and subsequent Covid-19 in persons at high risk for infection because of household exposure to a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, participants (12 years of age) who were enrolled within 96 hours after a household contact received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to receive a total dose of 1200 mg of REGEN-COV or matching placebo administered by means of subcutaneous injection. At the time of randomization, participants were stratified according to the results of the local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 and according to age. The primary efficacy end point was the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 28 in participants who did not have SARS-COV-2 infection (as measured by reverse-transcriptaseCquantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay) or previous immunity (seronegativity). RESULTS: Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection developed in 11 of 753 participants in the REGEN-COV group (1.5%) and in 59 of 752 participants in the placebo group (7.8%) (relative risk reduction [1 minus the relative risk], 81.4%; P<0.001). In weeks 2 to 4, a total of 2 of 753 participants in the REGEN-COV group (0.3%) and 27 of 752 participants in the placebo group (3.6%) had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (relative risk reduction, 92.6%). REGEN-COV also prevented symptomatic and asymptomatic infections overall (relative risk reduction, 66.4%). Among symptomatic infected participants, the median time to resolution of symptoms was 2 weeks shorter with REGEN-COV than with placebo (1.2 weeks and 3.2 weeks, respectively), and the duration of a high viral load (>10(4) copies per milliliter) was shorter (0.4 weeks and 1.3 weeks, respectively). No dose-limiting toxic effects of REGEN-COV were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevented symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously uninfected household contacts of infected persons.

However, selection of drug resistant parasites is a constant threat to the continued use of this approach. Antimalarial drugs are used not only to treat infections but also as part of population-level strategies to reduce malaria transmission toward elimination. While there is strong evidence that the ongoing use of antimalarial drugs increases the risk of the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites, it is less clear how population-level use of drug-based interventions like seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) or mass drug administration (MDA) may contribute to drug resistance or loss of drug efficacy. Critical to sustained use of drug-based strategies for reducing the burden of malaria is the surveillance of population-level signals related to transmission reduction and resistance selection. Here we focus on Plasmodium falciparum and discuss the genetic signatures of a parasite population that are correlated with changes in transmission and related to drug pressure and resistance as a result of drug use. We review the evidence for MDA and SMC contributing to malaria burden reduction and drug resistance selection and examine the use and impact of these interventions in Senegal. Throughout we consider best strategies for ongoing surveillance of both population and resistance signals in the context of different parasite population parameters.

METHODS From July 2005 to December 2008, 227 patients underwent colorectal resection for cancer at S. Martino Hospital in Genoa. Sixty-one patients underwent curative rectal resection for mid or low rectal cancer using Ligasure? device applied on smaller vessels and for the execution of total mesorectal excision. Forty-six patients underwent open laparotomy (OL), 15 laparoscopic surgery. There were no differences concerning demographics data and diagnosis, but only regarding staging (P=0.009). Primary goal was to evaluate major complications, operating time, hospital stay, distal margin of the tumor and number of nodes harvested in specimen. Secondary goal was to assess the average time of survival in the short period. RESULTS The mean operative times were shorter in the OL group (188 vs. 246 min) overall. This difference was significant (P=0.004). In particular two parameters of specimens were analyzed: the total number of nodes and distal clearing from cancer, excluding abdominoperineal resection. An average number of 16.6 nodes in the OL group and 13.9 in the VL group (P=ns) were detected; mean distal clearing in the OL group was 30.7 mm and 48.1 mm in the VL group (P=ns). There were no differences concerning major complications in either group. The hospital stay in the VL group was shorter than in the OL group, but the differences were not significant. CONCLUSION The Ligasure? device does not reduce operating time in laparoscopy rectal cancer resection but it allows to get correct oncologic results in patients submitted to total mesorectal excision.","output":"Total mesorectal excision with radiofrequency in rectal cancer: open versus laparoscopy approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zusammenfassung Die Tollwut geh?rt in Deutschland inzwischen zu den sogenannten vergessenen Krankheiten, obwohl weltweit j?hrlich mehr als 55 000 F?lle auftreten und mehr als 10 Millionen Post-Expositions-Impfungen durchgefhrt werden.

Nach Biss einer Fledermaus, oder meist eines Fuchses in Mitteleuropa, eines Hundes in Afrika, Asien und Sdamerika oder eines anderen Tieres wird das Virus in Muskelzellen aufgenommen, vermehrt sich und bekommt einige Zeit sp?ter Zugang zu Nervenzellen. Das Virus lagert sich z.B. an den Acteycholin-Rezeptor an und wird im Axon zum Gehirn transportiert und vermehrt sich intrazellul?r. Infizierte Nervenzellen ?ndern ihre Funktion.

Abstract Rabies is one of the so-called lost diseases in Germany despite every year more than 55.000 cases occur worldwide and more than 10 million post-exposition immunisations are being accomplished. The disease is caused by a virus. After a bite by a bat or, more often, a fox in Central Europe, or a dog in Africa, Asia or South America or any other animal the virus is being incorporated in muscle cells, multiplies and after a while gets access to nerve cells. The virus attaches e.g. to acetylcholine receptors, is transported via the axon to the brain where it reproduces intracellularly. Infected nerve cells change their function. Incubation period up to the appearance of any signs and symptoms is approximately 2 weeks to months. Signs and symptoms are encephalitis or paralysis followed by hypersalivation, hydrophobia, coma and death. In people who have no vaccine protection and do not receive post-exposure vaccination the disease is lethal throughout. There is no antiviral therapy available. Rabies can be prevented by pre-emptive immunisation or after injuries of the lower limb by post-exposure prophylaxis. Natural hosts are small rodents, bats, and carnivores; in this respect rabies is a zoonotic disease and the virus can not be extinguished.","output":"Tollwut (Rabies, Lyssa)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and mandated physical distancing requirements significantly impacted volunteer programs for older persons with many long-standing programs either ceasing altogether or pivoting to connecting through virtual technologies.

Some tutors expressed that virtual volunteering may eliminate barriers to in-person volunteering, while others were concerned with establishing a personal connection with students online.

In the healthy lung, ATII cells coordinate the host defense mechanisms, not only generating a restrictive alveolar epithelial barrier, but also orchestrating host defense mechanisms and secreting surfactant proteins, which are important in lung protection against pathogen exposure. Moreover, surfactant proteins help to maintain homeostasis in the distal lung and reduce surface tension at the pulmonary airCliquid interface, thereby preventing atelectasis and reducing the work of breathing. ATII cells may also contribute to the fibroproliferative reaction by secreting growth factors and proinflammatory molecules after damage. Indeed, various acute and chronic diseases are associated with intensive inflammation. These include oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, fibrosis and numerous interstitial lung diseases, and are characterized by hyperplastic ATII cells which are considered an essential part of the epithelialization process and, consequently, wound healing.

This stemmed initially from the discovery that antigen presenting cells such as macrophages could actively metabolise precursor 25\\\\hydroxyvitamin D (25D) to active 1,25\\\\dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Parallel observation that activated cells from the immune system expressed the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) for 1,25D suggested a potential role for vitamin D as a localised endogenous modulator of immune function. Subsequent studies have expanded our understanding of how vitamin D exerts effects on both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. At an innate level, intracrine synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) stimulates expression of antimicrobial proteins such as cathelicidin, as well as lowering intracellular iron concentrations via suppression of hepcidin. By potently enhancing autophagy, 1,25D may also play an important role in combatting intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis and viral infections. Local synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and DC also appears to play a pivotal role in mediating T cell responses to vitamin D, leading to suppression of inflammatory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and concomitant induction of immunotolerogenic T regulatory (Treg) responses. The aim of this review is to provide an update on our current understanding of these prominent immune actions of vitamin D, as well as highlighting new, less well\\\\recognised immune effects of vitamin D. The review also aims to place this mechanistic basis for the link between vitamin D and immunity with studies in vivo that have explored a role for vitamin D supplementation as a strategy for improved immune health.

However, the assessment and selection of right S3PRLP is a complex uncertain decision-making problem due to involvement of numerous conflicting attributes, imprecise human mind and lack of information. Recently, Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS) has been recognized as one of the suitable tools to tackle the uncertain and inaccurate information. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid methodology based on CRITIC and EDAS methods with Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) to solve the S3PRLP selection problem in which the attributes and decision makers weights are completely unknown. In this framework, CRITIC approach is applied to calculate the attribute weight and EDAS method is used to evaluate the priority order of S3PRLP options. To do this, a new improved generalized score function (IGSF) is developed with its elegant properties. Also, a formula is discussed to calculate the decision makers weights based on the developed IGSF. Next, developed framework is applied to assess a case study of S3PRLP selection problem with Fermatean fuzzy information, which elucidates the usefulness and practicality of the proposed method.

AIM: To determine the frequency and associations of persistently normal blood tests in patients with RA prescribed methotrexate, and patients with IBD prescribed azathioprine. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two-year retrospective study of a cohort taken from an electronic pseudonymised primary care/laboratory database covering >1.4 million patients across Hampshire, UK. METHOD: Patients with RA and IBD, and associated methotrexate and azathioprine prescriptions, respectively, were identified. Tests and test thresholds recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence were applied. Persistent normality was defined as no abnormalities of any tests nor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), white blood count (WBC), neutrophils, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) individually. Logistic regression was used to identify associations with test normality. RESULTS: Of 702 265 adults, 7102 had RA and 8597 had IBD. In total, 3001 (42.3%) patients with RA were prescribed methotrexate and 1162 (13.5%) patients with IBD were prescribed azathioprine; persistently normal tests occurred in 1585 (52.8%) and 657 (56.5%) of the populations, respectively.

Here, we examine the effect of variability in test interval, adjusted for the frequency, on change in HbA1c (HbA1c). Materials & Methods. HbA1c results were collected on 83,872 people with HbA1c results at baseline and 5 years (3 months) later and 6 tests during this period. We calculated the standard deviation (SD) of test interval for each individual and examined the link between deciles of SD of the test interval and HbA1c level, stratified by baseline HbA1c. RESULTS: In general, less variability in testing frequency (more consistent monitoring) was associated with better diabetes control. This was most evident with moderately raised baseline HbA1c levels (7.0C9.0% (54C75 mmol/mol)). For example, in those with a starting HbA1c of 7.0C7.5% (54C58 mmol/mol), the lowest SD decile was associated with little change in HbA1c over 5 years, while for those with the highest decile, HbA1c rose by 0.4C0.6% (4C6 mmol/mol; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that the association was independent of the age/sex/hospital site. Subanalysis suggested that the effect was most pronounced in those aged <65 years with baseline HbA1c of 7.0C7.5% (54C58 mmol/mol). We observed a 6.7-fold variation in the proportion of people in the top-three SD deciles across general practices. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the consistency of testing interval, not the just number of tests/year, is important in maintaining diabetes control, especially in those with moderately raised HbA1c levels.

The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was ?11.0% (95% confidence interval ? 22.0% to 1.5%), resulting in a 24% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017C2019. CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID\\\\19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID\\\\19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID\\\\19 wave.

Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.","output":"Record-breaking wildfires in the world's largest continuous tropical wetland: Integrative fire management is urgently needed for both biodiversity and humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND AIM At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Serbian government instituted a 24-h curfew for people aged 65 years for 2 months. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and perceptions of curfew for older people in Serbia 15 months after the curfew had ended. METHODS In-depth interviews were carried out with 23 older adults from urban areas in Serbia. We identified the first three participants, while others were selected using the snowballing method. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and data were analyzed according to guidelines for qualitative studies. RESULTS Six topics emerged: (1) perception of the curfew announcement; (2) attitude toward the curfew; (3) organization of daily living; (4) mood; (5) frustrations/limitations and 6) making sense of the curfew 15 months after. Older people in this study overall remember not feeling disturbed by the curfew because they perceived it as prevention, especially because this population group is considered to have the highest rate of mortality from COVID-19. Some people remember being extremely frustrated because of the restrictions and considered them unnecessary. Most people remembered that the lack of social interactions and lack of physical activity were the most difficult to cope with. CONCLUSIONS Although challenging and bothersome, the majority of older people in this study accepted the curfew as an appropriate measure to avoid catching the virus and combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Experiences and aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdown among community-dwelling older people in Serbia: A qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compared with the general population, oncology patients face a higher morbidity and mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic As a result, health systems had to quickly adapt cancer care in order to maintain the best quality and patient safety From March to May and from October to December 2020, 254 patients diagnosed with cancer and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 benefited from a tele-health monitoring at the Oncology Department at CHUV This article describes the key points of the development, implementation and operation of this tele-health monitoring, enabled by an interdisciplinary and inter-professional collaboration between different units and healthcare professionals","output":"[Telephone follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at the Oncology Department of Lausanne University Hospital]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the covid-19 health crisis, there have been many studies on the application of deep learning models in order to detect the virus on chest X-ray images.

Thus, usually only researchers in large institutions or companies have the necessary resources to bring the task to fruition. Other researchers employ transfer learning, a technique that is based on using pre-trained deep neural networks that have been trained on a similar dataset and retrain only their last neuron layers. However, using deep neural networks with transfer learning is not always the best option;in some cases, training a shallow neural network from scratch achieves better results. In this paper we compare training from scratch, shallow neural networks to transfer learning from deep neural models.

Surprisingly enough, training from scratch shallow neural networks produced significantly better results in terms of both specificity and sensitivity. The results of the models' evaluation showed that the three shallow neural networks achieved specificity rates higher than 98%, while having a sensitivity rate of 98%, exceeding the best performing pre-trained model, the DenseNet121, which achieved a specificity rate of 91.3%, while having a sensitivity rate of 98%. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Shallow Neural Networks beat Deep Neural Networks trained with transfer learning: A Use Case based on training Neural Networks to identify Covid-19 in chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute, life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) caused by acquired or congenital severe deficiency of ADAMTS13.

We hypothesized that CAR would be more often impaired in infants with NEC compared with infants without NEC. METHODS We measured cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen saturation, and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) during 48 h. We calculated the correlation between cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction and MABP for each patient. A statistically significant negative correlation reflected impaired CAR. RESULTS We included 15 infants with definite NEC (median (range) gestational age 27.4 (25.6-34.7) wk; birth weight 1,070 (670-2,400) g) and 13 infants without NEC (gestational age 27.9 (26.3-34.7) wk; birth weight 980 (640-2,640) g). Fourteen infants had a statistically significant negative correlation ( -0.468 to-0.104), of whom five were infants without NEC (5/13; 38%) and nine with definite NEC (9/15; 60%).

However, as 3D imaging technology advances, it has become more widely implemented into forensic anthropology analysis and practice. Teaching and learning in forensic anthropology still often relies on 2D images, but increasingly three-dimensional (3D) models are available to be used by students training in anatomy and osteology. Additionally, 3D models have been found to be beneficial to comprehension in other contexts within forensic anthropology, such as in the courtroom. The use of these models in the teaching of forensic anthropology is not yet widely implemented and more importantly, the impact on learning is not yet understood. The use of 3D imaging and visualisation in other educational contexts has seen positive results, for example in medical training. To explore this further, a study was conducted using an online activity to compare the comprehension scores of students educated using 2D textbook style images or 3D models on Sketchfab. The results showed that the use of 3D images was not detrimental to comprehension. Students using the 3D models were more consistent in their performance and reported an increase in confidence regardless of prior experience.

We present a pilot prospective, randomized, three-arm clinical trial of 1-year duration that was conducted as a noninferiority trial comparing single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and flexible single-incision surgery (FSIS) with conventional laparoscopy for elective cholecystectomy (NCT01558414). METHODS Sixty patients between aged 18 and 65 years who were eligible for elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (n = 20 per group): group A (SILS), single-incision endoscopic surgery using a transumbilical SILS? device; group B (FSIS), single-incision transumbilical surgery using a flexible endoscope; and group C (CL), conventional laparoscopy. The main outcome variable of the study was \\"parietal complications\\" (wound infection, bleeding, and ventral hernia). The analysis was by intention to treat and attritions were not replaced. RESULTS Cholecystectomy was performed in 100 % of the cases; perioperative complications occurred in only 1.6 % of the cases, and umbilical surgical wound infection in 3.33 %, with no differences between groups. After a minimum follow-up of 1 year, no differences were noted in the frequency of parietal complications and no ventral hernias occurred. Postoperative pain, hospital length of stay, and downtime from work were similar in all three groups. Surgical time was longer in cases in which a single-incision transumbilical approach was used (58.95 min for SILS and 54.15 for FSIS vs. 49.21 for laparoscopy).

Recent evidence indicates that it also plays important role in platelet aggregation and thrombus growth through interaction with fibrin(ogen). However, there are discrepancies in the literature regarding whether the monomeric or dimeric form of GPVI binds to fibrinogen at high affinity. The mechanisms of interaction are also not clear, including which region of fibrinogen is responsible for GPVI binding. We aimed to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of interaction at molecular level and to identify the regions on fibrinogen important for GPVI binding. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using multiple surface- and solution-based protein-protein interaction methods, we observe that dimeric GPVI binds to fibrinogen with much higher affinity and has a slower dissociation rate constant than the monomer due to avidity effects. Moreover, our data show that the highest affinity interaction of GPVI is with the C-region of fibrinogen. We further show that GPVI interacts with immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin variants at a similar level, including a nonpolymerizing fibrin variant, suggesting that GPVI binding is independent of fibrin polymerization. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above findings, we conclude that the higher affinity of dimeric GPVI over the monomer for fibrinogen interaction is achieved by avidity. The C-region of fibrinogen appears essential for GPVI binding. We propose that fibrin polymerization into fibers during coagulation will cluster GPVI through its C-region, leading to downstream signaling, further activation of platelets, and potentially stimulating clot growth.","output":"GPVI (Glycoprotein VI) Interaction With Fibrinogen Is Mediated by Avidity and the Fibrinogen C-Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Along with an increasing risk caused by migrant workers returning to the urban areas for the resumption of work and production and growing epidemiological evidence of possible transmission during the incubation period, a study of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is warranted among key populations to determine the serum antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 and the carrying status of SARS-CoV-2 to identify potential asymptomatic infection and to explore the risk factors.

In addition to their glucose-lowering effects, SGLT2 inhibitors prevent both renal damage and the onset of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events, in particular heart failure with both reduced and preserved ejection fraction. These unexpected benefits prompted changes in treatment guidelines and scientific interest in the underlying mechanisms. Aside from the target effects of SGLT2 inhibition, a wide spectrum of beneficial actions is described for the kidney and the heart, even though the cardiac tissue does not express SGLT2 channels. Correction of cardiorenal risk factors, metabolic adjustments ameliorating myocardial substrate utilization, and optimization of ventricular loading conditions through effects on diuresis, natriuresis, and vascular function appear to be the main underlying mechanisms for the observed cardiorenal protection. Additional clinical advantages associated with using SGLT2 inhibitors are antifibrotic effects due to correction of inflammation and oxidative stress, modulation of mitochondrial function, and autophagy.

Our economic model is designed to address the unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption. We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects, and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare, and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.","output":"Production networks and epidemic spreading: How to restart the UK economy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergency of the healthcare device unit such as a ventilator has been experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

From April 2020 to December 2020 on the basis of the University Clinical Hospital No. 4 of the First Moscow State Medical University named I.M. Sechenov (Sechenov University) of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation 245 patients between the ages of 27 and 89 with SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia were treated. The mean age of the patients was 56.7 +/- 4.2 years. All patients participating in the study were divided by simple randomization into two groups. The volume of lesion of the lung parenchyma was assessed according to the data of computed tomography. All patients were treated for SARS-CoV-2 in a comprehensive manner in accordance with the temporary guidelines of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation with the mandatory prescription of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). Assessment and correction of the hemostasis system in 177 patients (47.7%) of group 1 was carried out daily using local coagulation tests (LCT), including APTT, PT, TT, PTI, INR, Fibrinogen and D-dimer level. The second group included 128 patients (52.3%), who, in addition to local coagulation tests, used the integral coagulation test - the thrombodynamics test- to assess and correct the state of the hemostatic system. Assessment and correction of hemostasis were performed at the control points (1, 7, 14 days) of the study. Compared to LCT, the thrombodynamics test reliably more often revealed the state of hypercoagulability, which was promptly corrected by increased doses of LMWH in group 2. Positive dynamics of clinical symptoms were detected in patients of group 2 1.8 times more often than in group 1 (p&lt;0.05): fever and shortness of breath in group 2 decreased faster, the SpO2 index recovered more rapidly, especially in patients with severe hypoxia (with SpO2&lt;90), the number of patients with moderate and severe severity by the third point of the study in group 2 was 1.8 times less than in group 1 (p&lt;0.05). Severe forms of lung damage (CT-3 and CT-4) were detected in group 2 3.2 times less frequently (p &lt;0.01) compared with group 1, and the number of deaths was 3.3 times less frequent (p&lt;0.01) by the end of the study. The average bed-day in group 2 of patients (15+/-1.6 days) was 1.6 times shorter than in group 1 (24+/-7.2 days). Hemorrhagic complications were not recorded, despite the therapeutic doses of LMWH in patients of group 2. The severity of the condition of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the dynamics of their symptoms depend on the state of microcirculation in the lungs and in the periphery and on the volume of thrombotic lesions. Anticoagulant therapy prescribed as early as possible in adequate therapeutic doses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated viral pneumonia made it possible to achieve positive treatment results.

SEARCH We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EconLit, Embase and Scopus to September 2017 and supplemented this with grey literature searches. We assessed study quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme suite of tools, excluding those judged to be of poor methodological quality. RESULTS Thirteen studies were included; eight quantitative studies, two qualitative, two mixed methods studies and one case study. There was substantial agreement across quantitative and qualitative studies that a move to community living was associated with improved QoL. QoL for people with any level of intellectual disabilities who move from any type of institutional setting to any type of community setting was increased at up to 1 year postmove (standardised mean difference [SMD] 2.03; 95% CI [1.21 to 2.85], five studies, 246 participants) and beyond 1 year postmove (SMD 2.34. 95% CI [0.49 to 4.20], three studies, 160 participants), with total QoL change scores higher at 24 months comparative to 12 months, regardless of QoL measure used.

However, the majority of mobility performance parameters were different between groups with large to very large effect size, Cohen's d ranging from 0.91 to 1.59. Among assessed mobility performance, the largest effect sizes were observed for sedentary-behavior (d = 1.59, p = 0.006), light-activity (d = 1.48, p = 0.009), and duration of sitting+lying (d = 1.46, p = 0.016). The largest correlations between mobility performance and FACIT-F were observed for sitting+lying (rho = -0.67, p<0.001) and the number of steps per day (rho = 0.60, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that sensor-based mobility performance monitoring could be considered as a potential digital biomarker for CRF assessment. Future studies warrant evaluating utilization of mobility performance to track changes in CRF over time, response to CRF-related interventions, and earlier detection of CRF.","output":"Harnessing digital health to objectively assess cancer-related fatigue: The impact of fatigue on mobility performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China implemented stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in spring 2020, which has effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2.

Using these data, and a network model of people and places represented as a stochastic graph rewriting system, we estimated the relative contribution of transmission in households, schools and religious institutions to the epidemic, and the relative risk of infection in each of these settings. All congregate settings were important for transmission, with some such as primary schools and places of worship having a higher share of transmission than others. We found that the model needed a higher general-community transmission rate for women (3.3-fold), and lower susceptibility to infection in children to recreate the observed serological data. The precise share of transmission in each place was related to assumptions about the internal structure of those places.

A comparison was made considering an intensive sampling program and former literature sources. Two groups of lakes were selected: (a) lakes in the state park of Rio Doce (PERD) and (b) lakes situated in the area dominated by Eucalyptus plantations. Sampling was done in seven lakes on July 2004, January 2005, and August 2005, using vertical net hands of 68 and 150 m mesh size for micro and mesozooplankton, respectively.

At this point, it is crucial to scrutinize the effects of WBMI on K-16 students mathematics learning comprehensively. This meta-analysis research contained a total of 63 studies with 115 effect sizes, which aimed to investigate the effectiveness of WBMI on K-16 students mathematics learning by incorporating potential moderators, namely mathematics topics, mathematical content standards, feedback status, type of instructional features, age (i.e., grade level), and assessment methods. Based on findings, WBMI has a significantly strong effect on K-16 students mathematics learning (g = 1.10, p = 0.01, 95% CI [0.95, 1.27]). Moderator analyses reveal that the effect sizes of WBMI on K-16 students mathematics learning varied significantly depending on all these potential moderators. Additionally, higher-level mathematical concepts, statistics and probability, WBMI with providing feedback, tutorial systems, undergraduate students, and traditional paper-pencil assessment are the strongest moderators in their context. The most notable results of this research are that WBMI is significantly more effective on students mathematics learning than TMI, while even in the context of WBMI, traditional paper-pencil assessment is significantly more effective than online assessment.

Medical students interested in urology and neurosurgery have reported concerns regarding COVID-19s effects on clinical experience and the residency application process; however, the impact amongst students interested in plastic surgery is unknown. We hypothesized that students applying into plastic surgery may experience much distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey was developed by 3 plastic surgery residents and 2 academic plastic surgeons and later refined by 4 fourth-year medical students. Questions focused on medical education curricular changes, perceived impact on medical education, and demographics. From AprilCMay 2020 the survey was distributed to medical students who were interested in plastic surgery. Participants were identified through plastic surgery residency program personnel and social media platforms. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 130 of the 140 respondents reported interest in plastic surgery careers. An estimated 67% were in their clinical years or completing research year(s) before residency applications. Of the respondents, 80% believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on their medical education. Clinical-level students compared with preclinical-level students, and students applying to residency during the 2020C2021 match cycle compared with students not applying during the 2020C2021 match cycle were significantly more likely to perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as having a negative impact on their medical education (P = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively).

Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios.Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single confirmed case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 confirmed cases.

We use a panel data set for 2005C2018, through which the export flows from Colombia to 136 of its trading partners are considered. The findings indicate that Colombian institutional quality and the institutional distance between the country and its partners are statistically significant and affect its foreign sales. Similarly, there is a prominent influence of regulatory quality and the rule of law variables in the performance of Colombian exports in relation to other variables included in the model. We conclude that the Colombian government must improve its institutional quality considerably as a fundamental step towards boosting its overseas sales, not least because the countrys institutional distance from the world average is notable, which also affects its exports.","output":"The role of institutional quality in the international trade of a Latin American country: evidence from Colombian export performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to investigate the binding affinity of andrographolide and its derivative i.e., 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide with targets related to COVID-19 and their probable role in regulating multiple pathways in COVID-19 infection.

The aim of this study is to report the safety and efficacy of a single-center FD treatment for ruptured BBAs in the early phase of SAH using the SAPT regimen. Material and Method: This study involved a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. Records of patients admitted to our clinic and treated by endovascular route on ruptured BBA between January 2013 and December 2020 were reviewed. Ruptured supraclinoid ICA BBAs treated with FD devices with SAPT within 48 h from ictus of SAH are included. BBA of atypical anatomic locations, other endovascular techniques performed, and delayed admissions (>48 h) were excluded from the study. Demographic, clinical and angiographic features of patients and aneurysms, FD types and numbers, periprocedural complications, immediate and follow-up angiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded. Results: A total of six patients with ruptured BBAs treated via FDs within 48 h and used SAPT were included in the study. The mean age was 41.6 years (range from 34 to 45 years), and four of six patients were female. All patients were treated within 48 h after ictus, and the mean treatment day was 1.33 days. One patient received ticagrelor, and five patients received prasugrel as SAPT for one year after treatment. No procedure-related death and rebleeding were recorded. One (16.7 %) treatment responsive procedure-related complication occurred (transient ischemia). Overall good outcome rate was 83.3%. One patient died due to pneumonia. The immediate control angiograms showed complete occlusions of BBAs in one patient (16.6%). The complete occlusion rate was 100 % for five survivors at the control angiogram.

In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19.

Instead, diseases in livestock and wildlife are predictable in terms of the geography, time, and species affected. Ecological niche modeling approaches have been crucial to the advancement of our understanding of diversity and diseases distributions. This contribution is an introductory overview to the field of distributional ecology, with emphasis on its application for spatial epidemiology. A new, revised modeling framework is proposed for more detailed and replicable models that account for both the biology of the disease to be modeled and the uncertainty of the data available. Considering that most disease systems need at least two organisms interacting (i.e., host and pathogen), biotic interactions lie at the core of the pathogen's ecological niche. As a result, neglecting interacting organisms in pathogen dynamics (e.g., maintenance, reproduction, and transmission) may limit efforts to forecast disease distributions in veterinary epidemiology. Although limitations of ecological niche modeling are noted, it is clear that the application and value of ecological niche modeling to epidemiology will increase in the future. Potential research lines include the examination of the effects of biotic variables on model performance, assessments of protocols for model calibration in disease systems, and new tools and metrics for robust model evaluation. Epidemiologists aiming to employ ecological niche modeling theory and methods to reconstruct and forecast epidemics should familiarize themselves with ecological literature and must consider multidisciplinary collaborations including veterinarians to develop biologically sound, statistically robust analyses.

Following detection of advanced cancers, 5-year survival rates remain bleak, making identification of early neoplasia, which has a better outcome, important. Detection of subtle oesophageal lesions during endoscopy can be challenging, and advanced imaging techniques might improve their detection. High-definition endoscopy has become a standard in most endoscopy centres, and this technology probably provides better delineation of mucosal features than standard-definition endoscopy. Various image enhancement techniques are now available with the development of new electronics and software systems. Image enhancement with chromoendoscopy using dyes has been a cost-effective option for many years, yet these techniques have been replaced in some contexts by electronic chromoendoscopy, which can be used with the press of a button. However, Lugol's chromoendoscopy remains the gold standard to identify squamous dysplasia. Identification and characterization of subtle neoplastic lesions could help to target biopsies and perform endoscopic resection for better local staging and definitive therapy. In vivo histology with techniques such as confocal endomicroscopy could make endotherapy feasible within a shorter timescale than when relying on histology on tissue samples. Once early neoplasia is identified, treatments include endoscopic resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection or various ablative techniques.

However, not all desired image contrasts may be available due to scan-time limitations, suboptimal signal-to-noise ratio, and/or image artifacts. Deep learning approaches have brought revolutionary advances in medical image synthesis, enabling the generation of unacquired image contrasts (e.g., T1-weighted MRI images) from available image contrasts (e.g., T2-weighted images). Particularly, CycleGAN is an advanced technique for image synthesis using unpaired images. However, it requires two separate image generators, demanding more training resources and computations. Recently, a switchable CycleGAN has been proposed to address this limitation and successfully implemented using CT images. However, it remains unclear if switchable CycleGAN can be applied to cross-contrast MRI synthesis. In addition, whether switchable CycleGAN is able to outperform original CycleGAN on cross-contrast MRI image synthesis is still an open question. In this paper, we developed a switchable CycleGAN model for image synthesis between multi-contrast brain MRI images using a large set of publicly accessible pediatric structural brain MRI images. We conducted extensive experiments to compare switchable CycleGAN with original CycleGAN both quantitatively and qualitatively. Experimental results demonstrate that switchable CycleGAN is able to outperform CycleGAN model on pediatric MRI brain image synthesis.","output":"Multi-Contrast MRI Image Synthesis Using Switchable Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had a major impact worldwide due to its high infectiousness.

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate COVID-19 testing data in NYC relative to risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and demographic characteristics of NYC neighborhoods. METHODS: COVID-19 testing and the racial/ethnic composition of NYC Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) were obtained from the NYC Coronavirus data repository and the American Community Survey, respectively. The prevalence of neighborhood-level risk factors for COVID-19 severity according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for risk of severe illness and complications from COVID-19 were used to create a ZCTA-level risk index. Poisson regressions were performed to study the ratio of total tests relative to the total ZCTA population and the proportion of positive tests relative to the total tests performed over time. RESULTS: From March 2nd-April 6th, the total tests/population (%) was positively associated with the proportion of white residents (IRR(adj): 1.0003, 95% CI: 1.0003C1.0004) and the COVID risk index (IRR(adj): 1.038, 95% CI: 1.029C1.046). The risk index (IRR(adj): 1.017, 95% CI: 0.939C1.101) was not associated with total tests performed from April 6th-May 12th, and inversely associated from May 12th-July 6th (IRR(adj): 0.862, 95% CI: 0.814C0.913). From March 2nd-April 6th the COVID risk index was not statistically associated (IRR(adj): 1.010, 95% CI: 0.987C1.034) with positive tests/total tests.

This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of offering such an intervention for pregnant women with moderate-to-moderately-severe depression symptoms. Methods: We conducted a single-arm trial within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants were identified through KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program. Eligible participants included English-speaking pregnant women (<28 weeks of gestation) with moderate-to-moderately-severe depressive symptoms without a regular (<3 times/week) mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to follow a self-paced, 6-week mindfulness meditation program using a mobile app, Headspace&#8482;, 10-20 min/day.

In this paper, bimetallic sulfide coupled with CNTs ((Co, Mg)S2@CNTs) hybrid catalyst is developed via a proposed vulcanization process. The (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs) with controllable Mg substitution has a tailored crystal structure (amorphous and crystalline), which catalyzes oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/ OER), respectively. The active sites of CoS2@CNTs are activated by doping Mg ions, which accelerates the kinetics of the oxygen adsorption for ORR and oxygen desorption for OER. Meanwhile, the hybrid catalyst exhibits a unique hierarchal morphology and \\"catalytic buffer\\", which further accelerate the mass transfer of catalytic processes. In addition, the outer wall of CNTs as substrate effectively avoids the agglomeration of (Co, Mg)S2 particles by reasonably providing adsorption sites. The inter and outer walls of CNTs forms a high-speed conduction pathway, quickly transferring the electrons produced by oxygen catalytic reactions. As a result, the (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs exhibits an ORR performance comparable with commercial catalyst Pt/C-RuO2 and remarkable OER performance (Ej=10=1.59V). The high power density of 268 mW cm-2 and long-term charge/discharge-stability of the zinc-air battery proves the feasibility of (Co, Mg)S2@CNTs application in high power devices.","output":"Bimetallic sulfide with controllable Mg substitution anchored on CNTs as hierarchical bifunctional catalyst toward oxygen catalytic reactions for rechargeable zinc-air batteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To discuss the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by nucleic acid and antibody testing as well as its contribution to mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019. RECENT FINDINGS Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the firstly developed and most widely used diagnostic technique for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAT assays is always unsatisfactory, mainly due to insufficient viral RNA in samples, especially when upper respiratory samples were used. Compared with NAT assays, serological tests are more convenient and less dependent on the quality of sample collection. But the sensitivity of antibody assays varies largely to test samples collected at different time after onset of symptoms. The diagnostic sensitivity can be significantly improved by combination of RNA and antibody testing. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccines, population prevention results mainly from timely triage and quarantine of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Thus, extensive testing with NAT and antibody assays simultaneously is very important to constrain coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic.

Current UK national guidance recommends VGCs for patients with ocular hypertension, glaucoma suspects or early glaucoma. This study evaluates whether expanded eligibility criteria, including other glaucoma phenotypes and disease stages, can deliver safe and effective care with a positive patient experience. METHODS Records of over 8000 patients were reviewed in order to determine suitability for VGC attendance using expanded eligibility criteria. Patients with three prior consecutive visits within the glaucoma service were included. Follow-up interval, clinic type, visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual field performance were recorded. Patient satisfaction was recorded for a sample of 118 patients. RESULTS 2017 patients over 31 months were included. Two-thirds of eyes had ocular comorbidities, a fifth of eyes had undergone prior cataract surgery and 10% of eyes had undergone a prior laser treatment for glaucoma.

Theoretical saturation sampling was performed. Each participant was interviewed between 2 and 3 times in accordance with the open, axial, and selective coding of the grounded theory. RESULTS: A common preference set emerged in all patients related to the attributes of healthcare professionals and is a category that unites their scientific and humanistic aspects. On the other hand, very heterogeneous preferences were presented that were associated with the doctorCpatient relationship and the therapeutic objectives. In the doctorCpatient relationship, there are those who adhere to a paternalistic model and those who opt for an informative model. In therapeutic objectives, two subcategories emerged: those who are inclined to preserve life and those who accord more value to the quality of life. CONCLUSION: The categories that emerged illustrate the complexity and challenges of the preferences of patients with cancer in theoretical and experiential terms for social studies of medicine, philosophy, and bioethics. From medical social studies, its emphasized that the experiences of dehumanization are constant, which generates shared preferences in the patients related to the ideal of the medical professional.

Since May 2020, 142 federal, state, and local public health agencies have deployed TIM for COVID-19 symptom monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility, benefits, and challenges of TIM to help guide decision-making for improvements and expansion to support future public health emergency response efforts. METHODS: We conducted a brief online survey of previous and current TIM administrative users (admin users) from November 28 through December 21, 2020. Closed- and open-ended questions inquired about the onboarding process, decision to use TIM, groups monitored with TIM, comparison of TIM to other symptom monitoring systems, technical challenges and satisfaction with TIM, and user support. A total of 1479 admin users were invited to participate. RESULTS: A total of 97 admin users from 43 agencies responded to the survey. Most admin users represented the Indian Health Service (35/97, 36%), state health departments (26/97, 27%), and local or county health departments (18/97, 19%), and almost all were current users of TIM (85/94, 90%). Among the 43 agencies represented, 11 (26%) used TIM for monitoring staff exclusively, 13 (30%) monitored community members exclusively, and 19 (44%) monitored both staff and community members. Agencies most frequently used TIM to monitor symptom development in contacts of cases among community members (28/43, 65%), followed by symptom development among staff (27/43, 63%) and among staff contacts of cases (24/43, 56%). Agencies also reported using TIM to monitor patients with COVID-19 for the worsening of symptoms among staff (21/43, 49%) and community members (18/43, 42%). When asked to compare TIM to previous monitoring systems, 78% (40/51) of respondents rated TIM more favorably than their previous monitoring system, 20% (10/51) said there was no difference, and 2% (1/51) rated the previous monitoring system more favorably than TIM. Most respondents found TIM favorable in terms of time burden, staff burden, timeliness of the data, and the ability to monitor large population sizes. TIM compared negatively to other systems in terms of effort to enroll participants (ie, persons TIM monitors) and accuracy of the data. Most respondents (76/85, 89%) reported that they would highly or somewhat recommend TIM to others for symptom monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation of TIM showed that agencies used TIM for a variety of purposes and rated TIM favorably compared to previously used monitoring systems.

We conducted a cross-sectional study to detect carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales at 10 sentinel hospitals in Havana, Cuba for a six year-period (2016C2021) by the National Reference Laboratory for Health Care-Associated Infections in the Pedro Kour Institute. A total of 152 isolates were collected with phenotypic production of metallo--lactamase. NDM-type carbapenemase was detected in all the 152 isolates, and KPC-type enzyme gene was simultaneously identified in four NDM-positive isolates. The most abundant carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) species was Klebsiella pneumoniae (69.7%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae complex (13.2%), and Escherichia coli (5.9%). Over the study period, among CPE, prevalence of K. pneumoniae was almost constant, while Enterobacter spp. showed slightly increasing tendency. The urinary tract (36.2%) was the most prevalent source of infection with CPE, followed by bloodstream (26.3%) and surgical wound (17.1%), being frequently derived from Intensive Care Units (35.5%) and urology wards (21.7%).

HIV self-testing is a promising tool to overcome barriers to HIV testing and improve HIV testing uptake among migrant GBMSM. We compared the preferences for HIV testing services, including HIV self-testing, among migrant and Australian-born GBMSM. METHODS: Preferences were assessed via two discrete choice experiments (DCEs). Participants were recruited between December 2017 and January 2018 using online and offline advertising and randomly assigned to complete one of two online DCE surveys. Migrant GBMSM were classified as being born in a country with a reciprocal healthcare agreement (RHCA) with Australia (providing free or subsided health care) or not. Latent class analysis and mixed logit models were used to explore heterogeneity in preferences. FINDINGS: We recruited 1,606 GBMSM, including 583 migrant men of whom 419 (72%) were born in non-RHCA countries. Most participants preferred a free or cheap oral test with higher accuracy and a shorter window period to facilitate early detection of infections. Cost was more important for men born in non-RHCA countries than for men from RHCA countries or Australia. All groups preferred accessing kits through online distributers or off the shelf purchasing from pharmacies. Men born in RHCA countries least preferred accessing HIV self-testing kits from a medical clinic, while more than half of men from non-RHCA countries most preferred sourcing kits from a clinic. Sex-on-premises venues were the least preferred location to access test kits among all groups. In addition, two latent class analyses explored heterogeneity in preferences among men from non-RHCA countries and we found four latent classes for HIV testing services and two latent classes for HIVST distribution. INTERPRETATION: Our findings emphasise the need for high-performing and low-cost HIV self-testing kits that are accessible from a variety of distribution points as a component of Australia's HIV response, especially for those who do not have access to free or subsidised health care in Australia.","output":"Preferences for HIV Testing Services and HIV Self-Testing Distribution Among Migrant Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning techniques have been massively employed in the last years over a wide variety of applications, especially those based on deep learning, which obtained state-of-the-art results in several research fields.

The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures.

Social touch is a common and mutual way of expressing affection, care, and intimacy. From an evolutionary perspective, affiliative and affectionate touch are considered necessary for social and cognitive development throughout life-stages and across species. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic as a public health threat has mandated social distancing as a measure to contain the global outbreak. Travel restrictions, lockdown, and quarantine have led to separation and segregation, giving rise to social touch deprivation that might have adverse biopsychosocial consequences. METHODS: Affective touch has rarely been discussed within the purview of social psychiatry. We attempted to review the neurobiological, social, and behavioural correlates of social and sexual touch, as well as the neurophysiological models involved. RESULTS: The unmyelinated peripheral C-fibre afferents projecting to insular cortex and somatosensory areas form the prime pathway for affective touch. 'Top-down' modulation via the periaqueductal grey area, rostroventral medulla and sub-cortical structures, and 'Bottom-up' approach via the dorsal horn of the spine form the two theoretical models of 'social touch' system. The mu - opioid receptor (MOR) implicated in the Brain Opioid Theory of Social Attachment (BOTSA) and social neuropeptides like oxytocin and vasopressin are the primary neurochemical substrates involved. Sexual intimacy involves other neurotransmitters, with increased oxytocin activity in the limbic structures, Nucleus Accumbens, Anterior Cingulate, and Prefrontal Cortex. The discrimination and amalgamation of touch senses, their affiliative value and emotional valence in humans are based on a complex interplay between psychobiological, environmental, and personal factors. CONCLUSION: The neurobehavioral and emotional effects of 'touch hunger' and strategies to mitigate it during COVID-19 are discussed in the context of psychoneuroimmunity and stress.","output":"Biopsychosocial intersections of social/affective touch and psychiatry: Implications of 'touch hunger' during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importanceA greater benefit was suggested with early treatment with remdesivir against COVID-19 Aim and objectivesTo develop a systematic review and methodological interpretation of subgroup analyses according to timing of use of remdesivir in COVID-19 Material and methodsA bibliographic review in MEDLINE was conducted up to 10 October 2020 The Clinical Queries/Narrow tool was used with the search strategy: ((Therapy/Narrow[filter]) AND (remdesivir AND COVID)) Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with subset analysis about early and late use of remdesivir (10 vs &gt;10 days from symptom onset, or 9 vs &gt;9 days) were selected The rest of the studies were excluded All endpoints with subgroup analysis regarding timing of remdesivir use were assessed Two methodologies were applied The first considered statistical interaction among subsets, prespecification, biological plausibility and consistency of the subgroup analyses of similar RCTs 1 The second methodology was a validated tool with preliminary questions to discard subset analysis without minimal relevance, and a checklist 2 This checklist assigned a score related to a recommendation for applicability of subgroup analysis in clinical practice Results20 results were found after review;16 studies were excluded because they were not RCTs and 1 study had no efficacy evaluation of remdesivir Therefore, three RCTs were selected Endpoints considered were: time to clinical improvement, mortality, viral load, and clinical status at days 11 and 15 According to the first methodology, no statistical interaction was observed in the outcomes of the RCTs Prespecification was established in time to clinical improvement, and clinical status at day 15 of an RCT Biological plausibility was described in the subset analysis of each endpoint of the RCTs No consistency of subgroup analyses were found The second methodology discarded the applicability of the subset analysis through preliminary questions in two RCTs because of the absence of minimal relevance For the third RCT, null recommendation (score ?3 points) of clinical applicability was reached for clinical status at day 11 Conclusion and relevanceNo differences were found between early and late use of remdesivir in COVID-19 We developed the first study with a systematic review and methodology about subgroup analysis of timing of use of remdesivir References and/or acknowledgementsSun X, et al How to use a subgroup analysis: users guide to the medical literature JAMA 2014;311:405C11 Gil-Sierra MD, et al Checklist for clinical applicability of subgroup analysis J Clin Pharm Ther 2020;45:530C8 Conflict of interestNo conflict of interest","output":"2SPD-031 Subgroup analysis about efficacy of early use of remdesivir in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This paper describes two patient-reported measures of social contact and loneliness, which are closely related concepts. The first measure (R-Outcomes Social Contact measure) was developed from scratch, based on customer needs and literature review. It covers emotional and social aspects using positive terms. The second measure (R-Outcomes Loneliness measure) is adapted from the GSS Loneliness Harmonised Standard. Both measures are patient-reported outcome measures, based on patients own perception of how they feel. METHOD: This development started in 2016 in response to customers requests to measure social contact/loneliness for patients in social prescribing projects. Both measures are compared with three other loneliness measures (the GSS Loneliness Harmonised Standard, De Jong Gierveld and Campaign to End Loneliness). Both measures are short (36 and 21 words, respectively). Mean improvement is reported as a positive number on a 0C100 scale (where high is good). We tested the psychometric performance and construct validity of the R-Outcomes Social Contact measure using secondary analysis of anonymised data collected before and after social prescribing interventions in one part of Southern England. RESULTS: In the validation study, 728 responses, collected during 2019C2020, were analysed. 90% were over 70 years old and 62% women. Cronbachs =0.76, which suggests that it is appropriate to use a single summary score. Mean Social Contact scores before and after social prescribing intervention were 59.9 (before) and 66.7 (after, p<0.001). Exploratory factor analysis shows that measures for social contact, health status, health confidence, patient experience, personal well-being, medication adherence and social determinants of health are correlated but distinct factors. Construct validation shows that the results are consistent with nine hypotheses, based on the loneliness literature. CONCLUSION: The R-Outcomes Social Contact measure has good psychometric and construct validation results in a population referred to social prescribing. It is complementary to other R-Outcomes measures.","output":"Development of social contact and loneliness measures with validation in social prescribing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recurrent respiratory tract infections in children are common.

METHODS The participants in this study were 200 consecutive patients who underwent RARP. These patients were categorized into unilateral and bilateral NS groups and the non-NS group. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, frequency-volume chart, uroflowmetry, 1-h pad test, and the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire were evaluated before and after RARP. RESULTS The total IPSS score was significantly lower in the unilateral (P = 0.03) and bilateral NS groups (P = 0.03) than in the non-NS group after RARP. Diurnal maximum voided volume (MVV) values were significantly greater in the bilateral NS group than in the non-NS group after RARP (P = 0.002). Nocturnal frequency was significantly decreased in the unilateral NS group than in the non-NS group after RARP (3 months P = 0.01, 12 months P = 0.01). Erectile function was significantly better in both the unilateral NS group (P < 0.0001) and the bilateral NS group (P = 0.02) than in the non-NS group 12 months after RARP. CONCLUSIONS The NS procedure in RARP has the possibility to improve not only erectile function, but also LUTS, owing to both the increase of MVV and the decrease of nocturia. Therefore, the NS procedure is also recommended from the viewpoint of early improvement of LUTS and lower urinary tract dysfunction after RARP.","output":"The impact of nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on lower urinary tract function: Prospective assessment of patient-reported outcomes and frequency volume charts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo assess whether utilization of health care services for newly vaccinated health care workers changed after media attention about fatal side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine on March 11th, 2021, and whether changes differed by age, sex, or occupation.

METHODS: The population was a nationally representative sample of 175 English general practices covering a population of over 1.6 million patients registered with sentinel network general practices. General practice presentation rates per 100,000 population were reported for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and infectious conditions grouped into upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infection, and acute gastroenteritis by the UK Office for National Statistics urban-rural category. We used multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, comorbidities, and smoking status, reporting odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: For allergic rhinitis, the OR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23; P=.003) for urban and 1.29 (95% CI 1.19-1.41; P<.001) for conurbation compared with rural dwellers. Conurbation living was associated with a lower OR for both asthma (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.67-0.73; P<.001) and lower respiratory tract infections (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98; P=.005). Compared with rural dwellers, the OR for upper respiratory tract infection was greater in urban (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.08; P<.001) but no different in conurbation dwellers (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03; P=.93). Acute gastroenteritis followed the same pattern: the OR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.25; P=.03) for urban dwellers and 1.04 (95% CI 0.93-1.17; P=.46) for conurbation dwellers. The OR for urinary tract infection was lower for urban dwellers (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99; P=.02) but higher in conurbation dwellers (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.13; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Those living in conurbations or urban areas were more likely to consult a general practice for allergic rhinitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Both conurbation and rural living were associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection. Living in rural areas was associated with an increased risk of asthma and lower respiratory tract infections. The data suggest that living environment may affect rates of consultations for certain conditions. Longitudinal analyses of these data would be useful in providing insights into important determinants.","output":"Conurbation, Urban, and Rural Living as Determinants of Allergies and Infectious Diseases: Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre Annual Report 2016-2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebola virus is very challenging problem of the world.

This study aimed to determine the association between food security and cooking and eating habits, food access and availability, self-sufficiency and perceptions of the food supply at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Tasmania, Australia. Throughout MayCJune 2020 during strict social distancing restrictions, a cross-sectional survey was conducted including the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module Six-Item Short Form, twenty Likert scale questions on cooking and eating habits, food access, self-sufficiency and perceptions of the food supply (responses from 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree), two questions on food availability and eleven socio-demographic questions. Survey data (n = 1067) were analysed using multivariate linear regression, and binary logistic regression. Food insecure households were significantly more likely to agree they were consuming less fresh food compared with food secure households (Mean difference between scale responses (MD) = 0.66; 95%CI:0.36C0.66; p < 0.001), and significantly more food insecure households agreed it was more difficult to get to the shops (MD = 0.49; 95%CI:0.34C0.64; p < 0.001) and they had less money available for food than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (MD = 0.95; 95%CI:0.79C1.10; p < 0.001).

Little is known about whether this association is consistent across individuals or differs in strength. We adopt a quantile regression approach to explore heterogeneity in the association between youth unemployment and later mental health along the mental health distribution. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort of secondary schoolchildren in England followed from age 13/14 in 2004 to age 25 in 2015. SETTING: England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 7707 participants interviewed at age 25. Primary and secondary outcome measures 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) Likert score, a measure of minor psychiatric morbidity. RESULTS: Youth unemployment was related to worse mental health at age 25. The association was several times stronger at deciles of GHQ representing the poorest levels of mental health. This association was only partly attenuated when adjusting for confounding variables and for current employment status. In fully adjusted models not including current employment status, marginal effects at the 50th percentile were 0.73 (95% CI ?0.05 to 1.54, b=0.11) points, while marginal effects at the 90th percentile were 3.76 (95% CI 1.82 to 5.83; b=0.58) points.

However, three major data may change the severity of these pathologies: in young adults, simple measures of healthy lifestyle (control of vascular risk factors, physical activity and cognitive stimulation), have an impact on a future cognitive decline; the same lifestyle interventions may delay the start of the disease for elderly people potentially at-risk; finally, and for the first time, a monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid lesions has just shown a significant effect on the progression of AD in patients at an early stage of the disease. According to these results, we will have to reconsider the strategy for managing minor or severe cognitive disorders and particularly AD. Nowadays, patients start the care process too late. The solution is to act earlier, even preventively. It is necessary to improve a care offer adapted to this new situation in order to impact on the disease as soon as possible, even before the onset of symptoms, based on: predictive algorithms aimed at establishing whose cognitively unimpaired individuals may further develop the disease.

Herein, we exploited a live attenuated SG mutant, JOL967, to deliver spike (S) protein 1 of IB virus (V) to elicit protective immunity against both FT and IB in chickens. The codon optimized S1 nucleotide sequence was cloned in-frame into a prokaryotic constitutive expression vector, pJHL65. Subsequently, empty pJHL65 or recombinant pJHL65-S1 plasmid was electroporated into JOL967 and the resultant clones were designated as JOL2068 and JOL2077, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the chickens vaccinated once orally with JOL2077 elicited significantly (p < 0.05) higher IBV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity compared to JOL2068 and PBS control groups. Consequently, on challenge with the virulent IBV strain at 28(th) day post-vaccination, JOL2077 vaccinated birds displayed significantly (p < 0.05) lower inflammatory lesions in virus-targeted tissues compared to control groups. Furthermore, 33.3% (2 of 6) of birds vaccinated with JOL2077 vaccine had shown virus recovery from tracheal tissues compared to 100% (6 of 6) recovery obtained in both the control groups. Against wild-type SG lethal challenge, both JOL2077 and JOL2068 vaccinated groups exhibited only 10% mortality compared to 80% mortality observed in PBS control group. In conclusion, we show that JOL2077 can induce efficient IBV- and carrier-specific protective immunity and can act as a bivalent vaccine against FT and IB. Further studies are warranted to investigate the potential of JOL2077 vaccine in broiler and young layer birds.

Two hundred fifty-six tumors in 222 patients were treated with RFA (mean [ SD] tumor size, 1.9  0.5 cm), and 189 tumors in 163 patients were treated with cryoablation (mean tumor size, 2.3  0.5 cm). Major complications and efficacy as measured by technical success and local tumor recurrence rates were recorded. RESULTS There were five (1.1%) technical failures, including one (0.4%) among tumors treated with RFA and four (2.1%) among tumors treated with cryoablation (p = 0.17). Of the 218 tumors treated with RFA and with follow-up beyond 3 months, seven (3.2%) developed local tumor recurrence, at a mean of 2.8 years after treatment (range, 1.2-4.1 years). Of the 145 tumors treated with cryoablation and with follow-up beyond 3 months, four (2.8%) developed local tumor recurrence at a mean of 0.9 years after treatment (range, 0.3-1.6 years). For biopsy-proven renal cell carcinoma, estimated local recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years after RFA were 100%, 98.1%, and 98.1%, respectively, compared with 97.3%, 90.6%, and 90.6%, respectively, after cryoablation (p = 0.09).

Healthcare utilisation data were collected for 12 months following pulmonary rehabilitation from self-report (monthly telephone questionnaires and diaries) and administrative sources (Medicare Benefits Schedule, medical records). Feasibility was assessed by the proportion of self-reports completed and accuracy was established using month-by-month and per participant comparison of self-reports with administrative data. RESULTS: Data were available for 145/163 eligible study participants (89%, mean age 69 (SD 9) years, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s 51 (SD 19) % predicted; n = 83 male). For 1725 months where data collection was possible, 1160 (67%) telephone questionnaires and 331 (19%) diaries were completed. Accuracy of recall varied according to type of health care encounter and self-report method, being higher for telephone questionnaire report of emergency department presentation (Kappa 0.656, p < 0.001; specificity 99%, sensitivity 59%) and hospital admission (Kappa 0.669, p < 0.001; specificity 97%, sensitivity 68%) and lower for general practitioner (Kappa 0.400, p < 0.001; specificity 62%, sensitivity 78%) and medical specialist appointments (Kappa 0.458, p < 0.001; specificity 88%, sensitivity 58%). A wide variety of non-medical encounters were reported (allied health and nursing) which were not captured in administrative data. CONCLUSION: For self-reported methods of healthcare utilisation in people with COPD following pulmonary rehabilitation, monthly telephone questionnaires were more frequently completed and more accurate than diaries. Compared to administrative records, self-reports of emergency department presentations and inpatient admissions were more accurate than for general practitioner and medical specialist appointments.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the role of company trade unions on the implementation of telework arrangements in Latvia during the 1(st) emergency state in spring 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey based on snowball sampling method and social media advertisements was used to gather information from teleworkers. After data cleaning, answers from 422 teleworkers reporting having (wTU) or not having trade unions (nTU) in their companies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher percentage of workers with teleworking experience in companies with no trade unions (37.4% nTU versus 18.1% wTU). More respondents from companies with trade unions reported buying a new computer and headphones which means that more persons had to invest their finances to be able to perform their work. Workers from companies with no trade unions were more often advised on home office ergonomics (21.2% wTU versus 28.1% nTU). The odds of all analyzed health problems (pain, sore eyes, and anxiety) were increased in workers who reported having trade unions. CONCLUSION: Companies with trade unions were less ready for the forced transition to teleworking. These results contradict the traditional understanding of trade unions as a promoting factor for a healthy and safe working environment.","output":"Transition to the forced telework C a challenge for trade unions identified by the study on working life with COVID-19 in Latvia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus outbreak has created a massive chaos and affected the domestic and global opportunities of Malaysian economy Majority of the businesses affected in Malaysia are micro, small and medium sized enterprises The aim of this article is to rewind back the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Malaysian-based global companies and provide recommendations for policymakers to focus on main agenda that are very important during post-COVID-19 that is needed mainly to reduce business losses and survival throughout this crisis This paper will help practitioners to put in place proper measures to curb any future pandemics of this kind by been proactive and apply the tenants of entrepreneurial orientation to survive in the midst of any turbulent business environment ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Evaluation of Coronavirus Covid-19s Impact on Malaysian-Based Global Companies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction This study examined associations between pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and substance use among adults, the role of gender and socioeconomic status in these outcomes, and the supports that adults needed to address these problems during the first wave of the pandemic in Canada Methods and Measures Data were collected from 933 community-based adults without a previous diagnosis of PTSD in June 2020 The Primary Care PTSD Screen was adapted to assess pandemic-related PTSD symptoms Participants were asked if alcohol or cannabis use had increased in the past month Adjusted logistic regression models examined associations between PTSD symptoms and substance use Results More women (19%) than men (13%) met criteria for high pandemic-related PTSD symptomology, while a similar percentage (13 4% of women, 13 2% of men) reported significant increases in substance use during the pandemic Adults 18-35 years;those who believed they would become infected with the virus;and those with low income, education, or pandemic-related job loss were more likely to report PTSD symptoms High PTSD symptomology was associated with significant substance use increases among both women (OR = 2 2) and men (OR = 2 3) in adjusted models Many adults (50% of women, 40% of men) indicated they needed help to address these problems Conclusions A significant proportion of adults were experiencing pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and substance use increases during the first wave of the pandemic in Canada, and needed help to address these problems Findings suggest that addressing pandemic-related PTSD symptoms may be important in substance use interventions","output":"Adult PTSD symptoms and substance use during Wave 1 of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social determinants of health are responsible for a large proportion of disease which disproportionately affects deprived population groups, resulting in striking disparities in life expectancy and quality of life. Even systems with universal access to healthcare (such as the UK's NHS) can only mitigate some consequences of health inequalities. Instead substantial societal measures are required both to reduce harmful exposures and to improve standards of housing, education, work, nutrition and exercise. The case for such measures is widely accepted among healthcare professionals but, in wider discourse, scepticism has remained about the role of government and society in improving life chances along with the belief that responsibility for health and wellbeing should rest with individuals themselves. The stark inequalities exposed by the coronavirus pandemic could be an opportunity to challenge this thinking. This paper argues that doctors should do more to persuade others of the need to address health inequalities and that to achieve this, it is important to understand the ethical and philosophical perspectives that are sceptical of such measures. An approach to gaining greater support for interventions to address health inequalities is presented along with reflections on effective political advocacy which is consistent with physicians' professional values.","output":"The ethics and politics of addressing health inequalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reninCangiotensin system (RAS) is one of the most complex hormonal regulatory systems, involving several organs that interact to regulate multiple body functions. The study of this system initially focused on investigating its role in the regulation of both cardiovascular function and related pathologies. From this approach, pharmacological strategies were developed for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, new findings in recent decades have suggested that the RAS is much more complex and comprises two subsystems, the classic RAS and an alternative RAS, with antagonistic effects that are usually in equilibrium. The classic system is involved in pathologies where inflammatory, hypertrophic and fibrotic phenomena are common and is related to the development of chronic diseases that affect various body systems. This understanding has been reinforced by the evidence that local reninCangiotensin systems exist in many tissue types and by the role of the RAS in the spread and severity of COVID-19 infection, where it was discovered that viral entry into cells of the respiratory system is accomplished through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is present in the alveolar epithelium and is overexpressed in patients with chronic cardiometabolic diseases.

METHODS: Annualized relapse rate (ARR), Expanded Disability Status Scale score, MRI, autoantibody titers, pain, and adverse events were retrospectively evaluated in 57 patients with MOGAD (n = 14), aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG seropositive (n = 36), and seronegative NMOSD (n = 7; 12%), switched to TCZ from previous immunotherapies, particularly rituximab. RESULTS: Patients received TCZ for 23.8 months (median; interquartile range 13.0C51.1 months), with an IV dose of 8.0 mg/kg (median; range 6C12 mg/kg) every 31.6 days (mean; range 26C44 days). For MOGAD, the median ARR decreased from 1.75 (range 0.5C5) to 0 (range 0C0.9; p = 0.0011) under TCZ. A similar effect was seen for AQP4-IgG+ (ARR reduction from 1.5 [range 0C5] to 0 [range 0C4.2]; p < 0.001) and for seronegative NMOSD (from 3.0 [range 1.0C3.0] to 0.2 [range 0C2.0]; p = 0.031). During TCZ, 60% of all patients were relapse free (79% for MOGAD, 56% for AQP4-IgG+, and 43% for seronegative NMOSD). Disability follow-up indicated stabilization. MRI inflammatory activity decreased in MOGAD (p = 0.04; for the brain) and in AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD (p < 0.001; for the spinal cord). Chronic pain was unchanged. Regarding only patients treated with TCZ for at least 12 months (n = 44), ARR reductions were confirmed, including the subgroups of MOGAD (n = 11) and AQP4-IgG+ patients (n = 28).

We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008).

Understanding mechanisms that intrinsically modulate the immune responses to transplants is vital to develop rational treatment for rejection. Here, we have investigated the impact of programed cell death-1 (PD-1) protein, a negative co-stimulatory receptor, on the rejection of MHC incompatible kidney transplants in mice. T cells were found to rapidly infiltrate the kidneys of A/J mice transplanted to C57BL/6 mice, which peaked at six days and decline by day 14. The T cells primarily encircled tubules with limited infiltration of the tubular epithelium. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a marker of tubular injury, also peaked in the urine at day six and then declined. Notably, flow cytometry demonstrated that most of the T cells expressed PD-1 (over 90% of CD8 and about 75% of CD4 cells) at day six. Administration of blocking antibody to PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1, before day six increased T cell infiltrates and urinary LCN2, causing terminal acute rejection. In contrast, blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions after day six caused only a transient increase in urinary LCN2. Depleting CD4 and CD8 T cells virtually eliminated LCN2 in the urine in support of T cells injuring tubules. Thus, our data indicate that PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are not just related to chronic antigenic stimulation of T cells but are critical for the regulation of acute T cell responses to renal transplants.","output":"Early T cell infiltration is modulated by programed cell death-1 protein and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) interactions in murine kidney transplants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we study how different categories of crucial COVID-19 information influence price dynamics in stock and option markets during the period from 01/21/20 to 01/31/21.

In addition to the magnitude and direction of the news and its payoff relevance to security prices, other factors such as fear, emotion, and social media can influence the sentiment level. Using Google search data, we construct novel proxies for the sentiment levels induced by five categories of news, COVID, Market, Lockdown, Banking, and Government relief efforts. If the relative presence of behavioral traders in the stock market exceeds that in the option market, different predictions obtain for the effect of sentiment indices on jump volatility of the VIX index, the S&P 500 index, and the S&P 500 Banks index. We find that the jump component in the VIX index is increasing significantly with COVID index, Market index, Lockdown index, and Banking index. However, only COVID index and Market index increase the jump component of realized volatility of the stock indices (S&P 500 index and S&P 500 Banks index). The Government relief efforts index decreases this jump component. Banking and Lockdown index reduce jump volatility in the S&P 500 index and S&P 500 Banks index, but only with a delay of 5 days.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orchid extracts were prepared using a cold methanol extraction procedure. To assess the immunomodulatory action, Swiss albino mice of either sex weighing 25C35 gm were divided into five groups each with six animals. Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) of 0.5  10(9) cells/ml were used to immunize all mice on the 7th day, and a booster dose of the same quantity of SRBC was given on the 11th day of the experiment. After 14 days of oral treatment with 100 and 200 mg/kg bw of orchid extract, the mice were sacrificed to collect serum and organs. Hematological assays, delayed type of hypersensitivity assays, phagocytic index (PI), and histopathological investigations were used to assess in vivo immunomodulatory efficacy. RESULTS: The body weight changes of the experimental animals were considerably greater at 100 mg/kg bw than at a higher dose (200 mg/kg bw). There was a substantial improvement of relative organ weights of the thymus and spleen at the low dose, but no effect on kidney weights was evident. The liver weight increased significantly (p < 0.05) at both doses. Total neutrophil, leukocyte, and lymphocyte counts, hemoglobin percentage, delayed hypersensitivity reaction, and PI were all significantly (p < 0.05) increased in mice receiving the lower dose. In contrast to the control group, the higher dose reduced immunological response, suggesting the negative influence of a higher dose of extracts on the immune reaction. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that orchid extracts can potentially modulate the innate immune system in the experimental animal.","output":"Wild epiphytic Bangladeshi orchids Cymbidium aloifolium (L.)

Evaluating ICU care, and what is effective in improving outcomes for these patients is critical. Care bundles, a small set of evidence-based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To identify the extent of the available evidence on the use of care bundles in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a scoping review to inform WHO guideline discussions. This review does not assess the effectiveness of the findings, assess risk of bias, or assess the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). As this review was commissioned to inform guideline discussions, it was done rapidly over a three-week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe the available evidence on the use of care bundles in the ICU for patients with COVID-19 or related conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) viral pneumonia or pneumonitis), or both. In carrying out the review the focus was on characterising the evidence base and not evaluating the effectiveness or safety of the care bundles or their component parts. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 26 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies of all designs that reported on patients who are critically ill with COVID-19, ARDS, viral pneumonia or pneumonitis, in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was implemented in providing care, were eligible for inclusion. One review author (VS) screened all records on title and abstract. A second review author (DR) checked 20% of excluded and included records; agreement was 99.4% and 100% respectively on exclude/include decisions. Two review authors (VS and DR) independently screened all records at full-text level. VS and DR resolved any disagreements through discussion and consensus, or referral to a third review author (AN) as required. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author (VS) extracted the data and a second review author (DR) checked 20% of this for accuracy. As the review was not designed to synthesise effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterise the certainty of the evidence (GRADE), we mapped the extracted data and presented them in tabular format based on the patient condition; that is patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, patients with ARDS, patients with any influenza or viral pneumonia, patients with severe respiratory failure, and patients with mixed conditions. We have also provided a narrative summary of the findings from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were of variable designs and included a systematic review of standardised approaches to caring for critically ill patients in ICU, including but not exclusive to care bundles (1 study), a randomised trial (1 study), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (4 studies), before and after studies (7 studies), observational quality improvement reports (4 studies), case series/case reports (3 studies) and audit (1 study). The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China (5 studies) and the USA (4 studies), were published between 1999 and 2020, and involved over 2000 participants in total. Studies categorised participant conditions patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (7 studies), patients with ARDS (7 studies), patients with another influenza or viral pneumonia (5 studies), patients with severe respiratory failure (1 study), and patients with mixed conditions (1 study). The care bundles described in the studies involved multiple diverse practices. Guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies) and prone positioning (7 studies) were identified most frequently, while only one study mentioned chest X-ray. None of the included studies reported the prespecified outcomes ICU-acquired weakness (muscle wasting, weight loss) and users' experience adapting care bundles. Of the remaining prespecified outcomes, 14 studies reported death in ICU, nine reported days of ventilation (or ventilator-free days), nine reported length of stay in ICU in days, five reported death in hospital, three reported length of stay in hospital in days, and three reported adherence to the bundle. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review has identified 21 studies on care bundle use in critically ill patients in ICU with COVID-19, ARDS, viral influenza or pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. The data for patients with COVID-19 specifically are limited, derived mainly from observational quality improvement or clinical experiential accounts. Research is required, urgently, to further assess care bundle use and optimal components of these bundles in this patient cohort. The care bundles described were also varied, with guidance on ventilator settings described in 10 care bundles, while chest X-ray was part mentioned in one care bundle in one study only. None of the studies identified in this scoping review measured users' experience of adapting care bundles. Optimising care bundle implementation requires that the components of the care bundle are collectively and consistently applied. Data on challenges, barriers and facilitators to implementation are needed. A formal synthesis of the outcome data presented in this review and a critical appraisal of the evidence is required by a subsequent effectiveness review. This subsequent review should further explore effect estimates across the included studies.","output":"Care bundles for improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19 or related conditions in intensive care - a rapid scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Demand for parks and green space for physical and mental relaxation has increased dramatically during and after the COVID?19 Pandemic in many countries.

METHODS: Weekly laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtypes seasonal A(H1N1), A(H3N2), pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza were obtained from 2004 to 2013. Age-specific epidemic curves of viruses other than A(H1N1)pdm09 were compared between the pre-pandemic (May 2004 C April 2009), pandemic (May 2009 C April 2010) and post-pandemic periods (May 2010 C April 2013). RESULTS: There were two peaks of A(H1N1)pdm09 in Hong Kong, the first in September 2009 and the second in February 2011. The infection rate was found highest in young children in both waves, but markedly fewer cases in school children were recorded in the second wave than in the first wave. Positive proportions of viruses other than A(H1N1)pdm09 markedly decreased in all age groups during the first pandemic wave. After the first wave of the pandemic, the positive proportion of A(H3N2) increased, but those of B and RSV remained slightly lower than their pre-pandemic proportions. Changes in seasonal pattern and epidemic peak time were also observed, but inconsistent across virus-age groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide some evidence that age distribution, seasonal pattern and peak time of other respiratory viruses have changed since the pandemic. These changes could be the result of immune interference and changing health seeking behavior, but the mechanism behind still needs further investigations.","output":"Impact of the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic on Age-Specific Epidemic Curves of Other Respiratory Viruses: A Comparison of Pre-Pandemic, Pandemic and Post-Pandemic Periods in a Subtropical City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Live attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccines have an impressive record of safety, efficacy and ability to induce life-long immunity against measles infection. Using reverse genetics technology, such negative-strand RNA viruses can now be rescued from cloned DNA. This technology allows the insertion of exogenous genes encoding foreign antigens into the MV genome in such a way that they can be expressed by the MV vaccine strain, without affecting virus structure, propagation and cell targeting. Recombinant viruses rescued from cloned cDNA induce immune responses against both measles virus and the cloned antigens. The tolerability of MV to gene(s) insertion makes it an attractive flexible vector system, especially if broad immune responses are required. The fact that measles replication strictly occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells without DNA intermediate has important biosafety implications and adds to the attractiveness of MV as a vector. In this article we report the characteristics of reporter gene expression (GFP, LacZ and CAT) and the biochemical, biophysical and immunological properties of recombinant MV expressing heterologous antigens of simian immunogeficiency virus (SIV).","output":"Attenuated Measles Virus as a Vaccine Vector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID-19 virus is so significant.

As disease protection during the first six months of life is provided via placental transfer of maternal antibodies, a maternal GBS vaccine may provide an effective strategy to reduce infectious death and disability. An efficacy study may be difficult because of the large sample size required and alternative approaches such as serocorrelates of protection based on natural antibody concentration are being considered. Such studies would need to be undertaken in high burden settings such as Uganda. We therefore aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a GBS sero-epidemiology study in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: This is a prospective cohort and nested case-control study, conducted across two-centres with two entry points. A) consecutive women and their infants at birth, with collection of maternal swab, cord and maternal blood, and follow up by telephone until the infant is 3 months old; B) any infant under 3 months of age, presenting with signs of sepsis to any of the paediatric units, with collection of blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs. Any infants identified as having GBS disease (defined as GBS isolated from a normally sterile site) will be recruited and followed up for two years to assess their neurodevelopment. A nested qualitative study will investigate stakeholder (pregnant women and their families, healthcare workers and community leaders) opinions of sampling for such a study and understanding and potential uptake of vaccines in pregnancy. Discussion: The primary aim is to determine anti-GBS antibody concentration in infants with GBS disease compared to healthy controls. Secondary outcomes include stillbirth and all-cause infection and acceptance of sample methods and vaccination.

Accordingly, there is an increasing demand to reduce the time and cost required for manufacturing LFAs. The current study introduces an equipment-free method of salt-mediated immobilization of nucleic acids (SAIoNs) for LFAs. Compared to general DNA immobilization methods such as streptavidinCbiotin, UV-irradiation, and heat treatment, our method does not require special equipment (e.g., centrifuge, UV-crosslinker, heating device);therefore, it can be applied in a resource-limited environment with reduced production costs. The immobilization process was streamlined and completed within 30min. Our method improved the color intensity signal approximately 14 times compared to the method without using SAIoNs and exhibited reproducibility with the long-term storage stability. The proposed method can be used to detect practical targets (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and facilitates highly sensitive and selective detection of target nucleic acids with multiplexing capability and without any cross-reactivity.

These high doses can result in high systemic toxicity if there is a drug leak from the isolated circulation of the limb to the systemic. This makes it imperative to monitor the leakage rate (F[%]) during the infusion, currently performed with radiotracers. The objective of this work was to develop a leakage monitoring protocol as accurate as possible to ensure safe ILP. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We built a phantom with 3compartments (body, limb and precordial area) and a high sensitivity collimator fitted to a portable gammacamera. We simulate ILP with scheduled leaks every 10minutes from 1% to 9% (theorical F[%]). We mesured F(%) using 2equation: one is the proposed in the literature and another corrected by decay of the radioisotope. We test the optimal radiopharmaceutical doses to minimize the detector dead time error and compare F(%) mesured by both equations regarding the theoretical F(%). The leakage monitoring protocol was used in 17 ILP of 16 patients and an analysis of the recorded data was performed. RESULTS: We found significant differences between F(%) mesured using the first equation and theoretical F(%), obtaining results very adjusted to the theorical after applying the decay correction.

We are herein discussing a possible novel therapeutic tool for COVID-19. METHODS: Virus binds to the cell surface receptor ACE2; indeed, recent evidences suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be using as co-receptor, when entering the cells, the same one used by MERS-Co-V, namely the DPP4/CD26 receptor. The aforementioned observation underlined that mechanism of cell entry is supposedly similar among different coronavirus, that the co-expression of ACE2 and DPP4/CD26 could identify those cells targeted by different human coronaviruses and that clinical complications may be similar. RESULTS: The DPP4 family/system was implicated in various physiological processes and diseases of the immune system, and DPP4/CD26 is variously expressed on epithelia and endothelia of the systemic vasculature, lung, kidney, small intestine and heart. In particular, DPP4 distribution in the human respiratory tract may facilitate the entrance of the virus into the airway tract itself and could contribute to the development of cytokine storm and immunopathology in causing fatal COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DPP4 inhibitors, such as gliptins, in patients with COVID-19 with, or even without, type 2 diabetes, may offer a simple way to reduce the virus entry and replication into the airways and to hamper the sustained cytokine storm and inflammation within the lung in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibition in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne pollen concentration varies depending on several factors, such as local plant biodiversity, geography and climatology.

The aim of this study was to analyze what environmental parameters are more suitable as regards setting up monitoring stations throughout a territory in order to obtain an aerobiological network that can represent environmental diversity. The analysis was carried out in 13 locations in Castilla y Len over an 8a?year period. This is a favorable territory in which to conduct this type of study owing to its climatic features, orography and biodiversity. The ten most abundant pollen types in the region were analyzed, and a clustering analysis was calculated with different distances so as to obtain homogeneous groups of stations. Moreover, the clusters obtained were analyzed in combination with altitudinal and different bioclimatic parameters, which derived from temperature and precipitation. The result here shows that the Castilla y Len aerobiological network RACYL represents most of the environmental variability of the territory. Furthermore, it can be divided into two clusters and five sub-clusters for which the start of the main pollen season is different. This corresponds with the division of the territory as regards bioclimatic conditions. The most important bioclimatic parameters were the seasonality of the precipitation and the maximum temperature of the warmest month, although orography must also be taken into account. All of these help discover the optimal places in which to install traps and could reduce the number of monitoring stations.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey with a study sample that mirrors general population norms according to sex, age, education, and region was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK. Measures included mental health-related quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests were applied to examine mental health indicators across different sociodemographic groups (age, sex, employment, income, physical activity, relationship status). RESULTS: The sample comprised N=1,006 respondents (54% women) from all regions of the UK. Approximately 52% of respondents screened positive for a common mental disorder, and 28% screened positive for clinical insomnia. Mean scores and standard deviations were as follows: PHQ-9: M=9.07.7; GAD-7: M=8.06.5; ISI: M=10.47.0; PSS-10: M=17.77.9; WHO-QOL BREF: M=58.621.4; WHO-5 score M=13.06.0.

METHODS: 67 health workers with biological risk in their tasks, who have been filed as non-responders to conventional vaccination against Hepatitis B, were enrolled in the Clinical Trial. All participants were from 18 years up to 64 years old. INCLUSION CRITERIA: NHS workers -including university students doing their internships in health centres dependent on the National Health System (inclusion of students is regulated and limited by specific instructions on labour prevention in each autonomous community)- classified as non-responders. The criteria defining them as non-responders to the conventional hepatitis B vaccine is anti HBsAb titers < 10 mUI/ml following the application of six doses of conventional vaccine at 20 g doses (two complete guidelines). The objective of this study was to provide Health workers-staff with an additional protection tool against hepatitis B infection, and to evaluate the efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine in healthy non-responders to conventional hepatitis B vaccine. The primary outcome was the measurement of antibody antiHBs before the first Fendrix? dose and a month after the administration of each dose. Other outcome was collection of adverse effects during administration and all those that could be related to the vaccine and that occur within 30 days after each dose. In this study, only one group was assigned. There was no randomization or masking. RESULTS: The participants were recruited between April 13, 2018 and October 31, 2019. 67 participants were enrolled in the Clinical Trial and included the analyses. The primary immunisation consists of 4 separate 0.5 ml doses of Fendrix?, administered at the following schedule: 1 month, 2 months and 6 months from the date of the first dose.

This raises the question of how evolution has chosen the nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 that is observed today, or to what extent the actual encoding contributes to virus replication capacity, evolvability and pathogenesis. Here, we applied the previously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach to HIV-1. RESULTS: Using synonymous codon pairs, we rationally recoded and codon pairCoptimized and deoptimized different moieties of the HIV-1 gag and pol genes. Deoptimized viruses had significantly lower viral replication capacity in MT-4 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Varying degrees of ex vivo attenuation were obtained, depending upon both the specific deoptimized region and the number of deoptimized codons. A protease optimized virus carrying 38 synonymous mutations was not attenuated and displayed a replication capacity similar to that of the wild-type virus in MT-4 cells and PBMCs. Although attenuation is based on several tens of nucleotide changes, deoptimized HIV-1 reverted to wild-type virulence after serial passages in MT-4 cells. Remarkably, no reversion was observed in the optimized virus. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that SAVE is a useful strategy to phenotypically affect the replicative properties of HIV-1.","output":"Changes in codon-pair bias of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 have profound effects on virus replication in cell culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%).

METHODS: Databases (Medline, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched electronically on 6th April and updated regularly until 8th June 2020. Reports of pregnant women with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 were included. Meta-analytical proportion summaries and meta-regression analyses for key clinical outcomes are provided. FINDINGS: 86 studies were included, 17 studies (2567 pregnancies) in the quantitative synthesis; other small case series and case reports were used to extract rarely-reported events and outcome. Most women (73.9%) were in the third trimester; 52.4% have delivered, half by caesarean section (48.3%). The proportion of Black, Asian or minority ethnic group membership (50.8%); obesity (38.2%), and chronic co-morbidities (32.5%) were high. The most commonly reported clinical symptoms were fever (63.3%), cough (71.4%) and dyspnoea (34.4%). The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised CRP or procalcitonin (54.0%), lymphopenia (34.2%) and elevated transaminases (16.0%). Preterm birth before 37 weeks gestation was common (21.8%), usually medically-indicated (18.4%). Maternal intensive care unit admission was required in 7.0%, with intubation in 3.4%. Maternal mortality was uncommon (~1%). Maternal intensive care admission was higher in cohorts with higher rates of co-morbidities (beta=0.007, p<0.05) and maternal age over 35 years (beta=0.007, p<0.01). Maternal mortality was higher in cohorts with higher rates of antiviral drug use (beta=0.03, p<0.001), likely due to residual confounding. Neonatal nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was positive in 1.4%. INTERPRETATION: The risk of iatrogenic preterm birth and caesarean delivery was increased. The available evidence is reassuring, suggesting that maternal morbidity is similar to that of women of reproductive age.

As a result, children may be susceptible to anxiety and digital eye strain, highlighting a need for population interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the intervention (n=485, 6 schools) and control (n=469, 6 schools) groups were aged 13.5 (SD 0.5) years, and 52.3% (n=499) were male. The assigned interventions were completed by 896 children (intervention: n=467, 96.3%; control: n=429, 91.5%). The 2-week change in square-root-transformed self-reported anxiety scores was greater in the intervention (-0.23, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.20) vs control group (0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.16; unadjusted difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.08; P=.02). There was a significant reduction in square-root-transformed eye strain in the intervention group (-0.08, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) compared to controls (0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.09; difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03; P=.02).

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We conducted a chart review of all patients admitted to the uncovered hospital medicine services at a large academic hospital for one year. For patients who had a PT consult at any time during their admission we obtained age, admission AMPAC score, and discharge destination. PT consults were considered potential overutilization for AMPAC scores >/=19 based on previous studies validating this cutoff for predicting discharge to home. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize % of patients < 65 years old vs. >/=65 years and % of patients discharged to home vs. post-acute care. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine independent associations between age group, AMPAC group, and an interaction term (age group x AMPAC group) with odds of being discharged home. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Of 6,634 patients admitted during the year, 58% (n=3582) had a PT consult. Mean age was 66.3 +/-15.4 and mean AMPAC was 18.3 +/- 5.3. Seventy percent were discharged home (N=2497). Using AMPAC of >/= 19, 55% of consults were potential overutilization. Patients <65 with AMPAC>19 represented 31% of PT consults. AMPAC>19 had increased odds of discharge home (OR 3.58 [95% CI=2.17 -5.91];P<0.001) as did age <45 years (OR 1.81 [95% CI=1.09-3.00];P=0.02). A significant interaction existed between all ages and AMPAC>/=19 (For age<45 OR 2.85 for discharge home [95% CI=1.37 -4.30] P=0.002;For age 46-64 OR 2.43 for discharge home [95% CI=1.37-4.34] P=0.002).

Urbanization and globalization have contributed to changing patterns of diet and physical activity, creating an obesogenic environment that increases noncommunicable disease risk, especially in low-income populations. Community-based and technological interventions can play an important role in addressing structural determinants that influence noncommunicable disease burden. The Better Health Programme Malaysia aims to co-create and develop a community-based digital intervention for low-income populations to enable community stakeholders to address obesogenic environments and improve peoples knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to noncommunicable disease risk. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study will assess community member and community health volunteer knowledge, attitudes, and practices on noncommunicable disease prevention, risk factors, and health-seeking behavior in three geographical areas of Kuala Lumpur, each representing a different ethnicity (Malay, Indian, and Chinese). Assessment will take place before and after a 9-month intervention period, comparing intervention areas with matched control geographies. We plan to engage 2880 community members and 45 community health volunteers across the six geographic areas. A digital health needs assessment will inform modification of digital health tools to support project aims. Intervention co-creation will use a discrete choice experiment to identify community preferences among evidence-based intervention options, building from data collected on community knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Community health volunteers will work with local businesses and other stakeholders to effect change in obesogenic environments and NCD risk. The study has been approved by the Malaysian Ministry of Health Medical Research Ethical Committee. DISCUSSION: The Better Health Programme Malaysia anticipates a bottom-up approach that relies on community health volunteers collaborating with local businesses to implement activities that address obesogenic environments and improve community knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to NCD risk. The planned co-creation process will determine which interventions will be most locally relevant, feasible, and needed.

Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, preparedness, counselling practices of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19, and the perceived barriers to adequately prevent and control COVID-19 in Yemen. METHODS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) from major healthcare facilities participated in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire comprising of five main domains (demographics, knowledge, self-preparedness, counselling practice, perceived barriers) was distributed among HCWs after obtaining informed consent. A convenient sampling technique was used. Descriptive and inferential analyses were applied using SPSS software. RESULTS: A total of 1000 participants were initially targeted to participate in the study with 514 (51.4%) responding, of which 55.3% were female. Physicians and nurses constituted the largest proportion of participants, with 39.5% and 33.3%, respectively. The median scores for knowledge, self-preparedness, and counselling practice were 8 (out of 9), 9 (out of 15), and 25 (out of 30), respectively. The physician group showed a statistically significant association with better knowledge compared to the nurse group only, P<0.001. Males had higher preparedness scores than females, p<0.001. Also, the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency departments presented a statistically significant difference by which the participants from these departments were more prepared compared to the others (e.g. outpatients, paediatrics and surgery) with P < 0.0001. The lack of awareness among the general population about COVID-19 preventive measures was perceived as the most common barrier for the adequate prevention and control of COVID-19 in Yemen (89.1%). CONCLUSION: The major highlight of this study is that HCWs have, overall, good knowledge, suboptimal preparedness, and adequate counselling practices prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen, despite the high number of perceived barriers. However, urgent action and interventions are needed to improve the preparedness of HCWs to manage COVID-19. The perceived barriers also need to be fully addressed by the local healthcare authorities and international organisations working in Yemen for adequate prevention and control measures to be in place in managing COVID-19.","output":"Healthcare workers' knowledge, preparedness, counselling practices, and perceived barriers to confront COVID-19: A cross-sectional study from a war-torn country, Yemen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A whirlwind of developments have unfolded in the UK since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has subsequently instigated an intensely animated debate among British Muslim religious leaders about the contentious and sensitive topic of mosque closure, producing a rich and sophisticated spectrum of responses These responses emerged within the dramatic global background of an imminent closure of Islam&rsquo;s most cherished mosque to international pilgrims, namely the sacred precinct in Mekkah The stakes were, therefore, high for British Muslim religious leaders considering mosque closure, facing the stark dilemma of compromising the sacrosanct status of the mosque and congregational worship in Islam or putting the lives of British Muslims in their hundreds of thousands at risk This paper seeks to analyze the role of religious authority within the British Muslim community through the lens of the responses of the community&rsquo;s religious leaders to the COVID-19 closure of mosques It builds upon a Special Issue published by this journal on leadership, authority and representation in British Muslim communities The issue of COVID-19 mosque closure in the UK presented an excellent case study for this paper&rsquo;s analysis, manifesting as it does the dynamic way in which religious authority in the British Muslim community continues to evolve This paper thus seeks to use this case-study to further enrich the literature on this topic","output":"To Open or Close?

METHODS We illustrate the approach using data for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer (n = 5914, 33% event fraction) and obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD; n = 4888, 44% event fraction). We used logistic regression to develop a prediction model consisting only of a priori selected predictors and assumed linear relations for continuous predictors. We mimicked prospective patient recruitment by developing the model on 100 randomly selected patients, and we used bootstrapping to internally validate the model. We sequentially added 50 random new patients until we reached a sample size of 3000 and re-estimated model performance at each step. We examined the required sample size for satisfying the following stopping rule: obtaining a calibration slope  0.9 and optimism in the c-statistic (or AUC) < = 0.02 at two consecutive sample sizes. This procedure was repeated 500 times. We also investigated the impact of alternative modeling strategies: modeling nonlinear relations for continuous predictors and correcting for bias on the model estimates (Firth's correction). RESULTS Better discrimination was achieved in the ovarian cancer data (c-statistic 0.9 with 7 predictors) than in the CAD data (c-statistic 0.7 with 11 predictors). Adequate calibration and limited optimism in discrimination was achieved after a median of 450 patients (interquartile range 450-500) for the ovarian cancer data (22 events per parameter (EPP), 20-24) and 850 patients (750-900) for the CAD data (33 EPP, 30-35). A stricter criterion, requiring AUC optimism < = 0.01, was met with a median of 500 (23 EPP) and 1500 (59 EPP) patients, respectively. These sample sizes were much higher than the well-known 10 EPP rule of thumb and slightly higher than a recently published fixed sample size calculation method by Riley et al. Higher sample sizes were required when nonlinear relationships were modeled, and lower sample sizes when Firth's correction was used.

PCF was seen in 9.5% of the patients and was associated with persistent breathlessness at 6 weeks and inpatient ventilation [adjusted OR 5.02(1.76-14.27) and 4.45(1.27-15.58)] respectively. It was more common in men and in patients with peak CRP >171.5 mg/L, peak WBC count 12 x 10 9/L, severe inpatient COVID-19 CXR changes and CT changes. Ventilation was also a risk factor for persisting fatigue and myalgia, the latter was also more common in those with severe cytokine storm and severe COVID-19 inpatient CXR changes. Conclusions: All the patients discharged after COVID-19 should be assessed using a set protocol by a multidisciplinary team. Patients who had severe COVID-19 infection particularly those who were intubated and who have persistent breathlessness are at risk of developing PCF. They should have a CT Chest and have respiratory follow-up.","output":"Complications after Discharge with COVID-19 Infection and Risk Factors Associated with Development of Post-COVID Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elderly patients are at high risk of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) infection and severe COVID-19 patients are treated in intensive care units (ICU).

METHODS: A population-based cohort study of all injury-related deaths between 1January 2006 and 31 December 2017 registered with Births Death and Marriages in Australia was conducted using Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Cause of Death information. Population data on travellers were obtained from Tourism Research Australia. RESULTS: There were 4,503 injury-related traveller deaths (domestic interstate:3,055; international:934; new arrivals:514). The average annual age-standardised mortality rates in domestic interstate travellers was 0.75 per 100,000, compared with 2.22 per 100,000 in international travellers. Leading causes of injury-related death were land transport incidents (n=1495, 33.2%), self-harm (n=786, 17.5%) and falls (n=513, 11.4%), with differences in mechanism by state/territory, traveller type and age group. Intentional self-harm was common amongst all visitor types, however, it was the primary cause of death in new arrivals Conclusion: Age-standardised mortality rates were almost three-fold higher in international than domestic travellers. New arrivals, international and domestic travellers have different injury profiles, and each require specific prevention strategies.

No standard second-line regimen has been established. Different options have been reported, including anti-TNF antibodies. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 15 patients with steroid-refractory (SR) aGVHD treated with etanercept at our institution. Patients were transplanted for a hematological malignancy and received either a myeloablative or a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. Prophylaxis of GVHD consisted of cyclosporin A and mycophenolic acid. RESULTS: Acute GVHD was diagnosed at a median of 61 days post-transplantation. All patients had grade III aGVHD of the gut. Second-line treatment with etanercept was started at a median of 13 days after initiation of first-line therapy. Overall response rate was 53%, with CR in 3 patients and PR in 5 patients. Median overall survival after initiation of treatment with etanercept was 66 days (range 5C267) for the entire group. Median overall survival was 99 days (range 47C267 days) for responders and 17 days (range 5C66 days) for non-responders (p<0.01). Nevertheless, all patients died.

In Turkey, long quarantine periods and curfews have increased both physical and psychological problems. Due to the rapid spread and substantial impact of the COVID-19 virus, different psychological effects were observed among different segments of society, such as among young people, elderly people, and active workers. Because of fear caused by the COVID-19 virus, it is thought that depression, stress, and anxiety levels have increased. It is estimated that there are more psychological issues for people with poor health and others whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. To explore and test the situation mentioned above, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Turkey with 3287 participants above 16 years old. We measured COVID-19 fear, along with anxiety, stress, and depression levels (DASS21) and demographics. Firstly, we tested whether COVID-19 fear predicts stress, anxiety, and depression. Secondly, we investigated if the effect of COVID-19 fear is stronger for those who have underlying illness and for those whose friends or family became ill or have died because of COVID-19. The results showed that women and 16-25 years old youths have higher COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between COVID-19 fear and stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as significant moderation effects of having an underlying illness and having friends or family who were infected or have died.

In addition, we developed a personalized model based on machine learning methods that match an online PP for each student to maximize the students score in the exam. In the case of an academic mathematical course, the online PP had a major influence on the students scores in the exam. We found that students with high grades in previous courses preferred synchronous learning, which indicates the importance of picking the right online PP for each student.

To elucidate this question, 12 mild to moderate PD patients were assessed in March 2020 before and after two months of isolation as part of a clinical study that had to be interrupted due to the pandemic and the implementation of COVID19 mobility restrictions. METHODS: Twelve patients were systematically evaluated before and after the lockdown period as part of a larger cohort that previously underwent thermal water rehabilitation. Clinical outcomes were the Body Mass index, the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test, the MDS-Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale part III, the 6 Minute Walking Test and the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire. Global cognition was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale. The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on quality of life and functional independence was evaluated with The Parkinsons disease Quality of life (PDQ-39), the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living questionnaires (IADL) and the Parkinsons disease cognitive functional rating scales (PD-CFRS). RESULTS: After two months of isolation the Mini-BESTest score worsened (p=0.005), and four patients reported one or more falls during the lockdown. BMI increased (p=0.031) while the remaining clinical variables including quality of life did not change. CONCLUSION: We observed moderate worsening at Mini-BESTest, greater risk of falls and increased body weight as consequence of prolonged immobility.

Therefore, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) aimed to analyze the situation in different countries and systematically collect all information available regarding tolerability and possible amendments in daily practice of sublingual AIT (SLIT), subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) for inhalant allergies and venom AIT. METHOD: Under the framework of the EAACI, a panel of experts in the field of AIT coordinated by the Immunotherapy Interest Group (IT IG) set-up a web-based retrospective survey (SurveyMonkey?) including 27 standardized questions on practical and safety aspects on AIT in worldwide clinical routine. RESULTS: 417 respondents providing AIT to their patients in daily routine answered the survey. For patients (without any current symptoms to suspect COVID-19), 60% of the respondents informed of not having initiated SCIT (40% venom AIT, 35% SLIT) whereas for the maintenance phase of AIT, SCIT was performed by 75% of the respondents (74% venom AIT, 89% SLIT). No tolerability concern arises from this preliminary analysis. 16 physicians reported having performed AIT despite (early) symptoms of COVID-19 and/or a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: This first international retrospective survey in atopic diseases investigated practical aspects and tolerability of AIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and gave no concerns regarding reduced tolerability under real-life circumstances.

Objective We sought to investigate whether the duration of wheezy episodes in young children depends on the microbial trigger. Methods Two hundred eighty-three children from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood2000 at-risk birth cohort were prospectively examined for common airway pathogenic bacteria and viruses during acute wheezy episodes in the first 3 years of life. Findings were related to symptomatic duration of episodes, as monitored in daily diary cards from birth. Results Eight hundred thirty-seven samples were investigated for viruses, bacteria, or both. Both viruses and bacteria were identified in 55% of episodes, bacteria were identified exclusively in 31% of episodes, and viruses were identified exclusively in 10% of episodes. The median duration of acute symptoms was 9 days (interquartile range, 5-16 days), and duration was independent of bacterial or viral species. Conclusions The duration of wheezy episodes was independent of pathogenic airway bacterial or viral species. This suggests that symptom burden from infections is dependent on other factors, such as environmental exposures or host factors.

RESULTS A total of 160 articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria was analyzed. The majority (91.3%) was produced by half (53.7%) of African countries, with important regional disparities, and generally without sources of funding mentioned. The majority (>85.0) of authors in lead positions (first, second, third, and last authors) were Africans.

In recent years, studies reported that magnetic effects can impart considerable changes on the pH, ORP and DO concentration of water. However, the correlation between electron density and magnetic effects on these parameters has yet to be disclosed despite the fact that increased electron density in water could improve waters reductive properties, heat capacity and hydrogen bonding characteristics. In this study, the magnetic effects on pH, ORP and DO concentration were investigated using different magnets arrangements and water flow rates based on reversed electric motor principle. Results showed that the improvement of pH, ORP and DO concentration from 5.40C5.42 to 5.58C5.62 (+ 3.5%), 392 to 365 mV (? 6.9%), and 7.30 to 7.71 mg L(? 1) (+ 5.6%), respectively were achieved using combined variables of non-reversed polarity magnet arrangement (1000C1500 G magnetic strength) and water flow rate of 0.1C0.5 mL s(? 1).

Several modifications to SH have been suggested, but none are sufficiently compliant with safety and efficiency standards. The purpose of this investigation was the development of a filter adaptor, which converts SHs into efficient, safe and disinfectable PAPRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Four critical features were investigated close to regulatory requirements: total inward leakage (TIL) of particles, CO2 concentrations, intra-helmet differential pressure, and automated disinfection. RESULTS The average TIL in the two independent tests were 0.005% and 0.01%. CO2 concentrations were lower than in the original SH. The modification generates a positive differential pressure. The filter's performance was not compromised after 50 cycles in a sterilization machine. DISCUSSION The modified SH provides several hundred times better protection than FFP-3 masks.

Improper test utilization (ITU) is a common problem for all healthcare systems as it costs substantial expenses for the health systems and impacts optimal patient care. PURPOSE: The present small-scale survey aims to highlight the current practice of ITU among the labs and physicians, and investigate the actions of diagnostic laboratories towards ITU, and identify the reasons affecting test ordering decisions among physicians. METHODS: A cross sectional study based on two different surveys was developed and distributed from March 2017 to April 2017 to laboratory supervisors and physicians (clinicians) at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Qatar. Fourteen laboratory supervisors and eighty-nine physicians were surveyed about improper test utilization practices. The overall results are descriptive data. RESULTS: The overall proportion of improperly utilized tests detected by the laboratory supervisors were 50.0%, 35.7%, and 14.3% for overused, misused, and underused lab tests, respectively. Among the physicians, 91% used the electronic ordering template to select the appropriate tests. Moreover, 78.7% of the physicians used the clinical guidelines, while 73% were not employing the laboratory handbook. Furthermore, 95.5%% of the physicians preferred to get feedback about inappropriate tests, while 51.1% were not receiving any, and 40.9% were rarely receiving. Finally, 67.4% were unaware of the tests costs among surveyed physicians, and 63.6% showed a willingness to reduce their orders if the cost was high and unnecessary.

Babies born at term (>37/40) were included. Babies who were premature (<37/40) or repatriated from other hospitals were excluded. This also included reviewing term babies re-admitted from home within 7 days of birth.ResultsAdmissions to NICU had reduced by 1/3 (143 during period 1, 97 during period 2). Similarly, there was a marked reduction in admissions related to respiratory distress (64 in period 1, 42 in period 2) and infection (14 in period 1, 4 in period 2). There were only 2 direct admissions due to Covid-19. There were similar numbers of admissions from home (31 in period 1, 35 in period 2). There was an increase in the number of babies admitted from D4-5 of life, yet NICU admissions from home had nearly halved (21 in Period 1, 11 in period 2). There was an increase in admissions to the TC ward instead (10 in Period 1, 24 in Period 2), including more babies requiring treatment for jaundice. The admissions to the TC ward were mostly not in line with the existing readmission from home policy however there were no complications from these admissions. There was a reduction in the readmissions from home due to hypernatremic dehydration and infection.ConclusionsAlthough overall delivery numbers were similar between the two time periods, Elective C-sections occurred off site which may explain the reduction in admissions for respiratory distress. The improvement in isolation and infection protocols could explain the reduction in admissions due to infection. Similarly isolation at home and perhaps reduced visits from friends and relatives may have improved feeding success and explain the reduced admissions due to hypernatremic dehydration. Using TC services reduced the admission load on NICU, whilst also allowing mums and babies to stay together on the postnatal ward. In doing so, we will now review the readmission from home policy and capacity of TC to allow more babies to be kept together with their mums on re-admission, as we have demonstrated this can be done in a clinically safe manner. It is also a useful strategy for further waves of Covid-19, should there be more direct Covid-related admissions.

Throughout its almost 50-year history, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) regime has faced many challenges, a majority of which have demanded attention ever since. For example, the problem of universality remains topical. The verification mechanism has not received enough development since 2001. Also, the BTWC regime has to face the inequality of economic, scientific and technological development of the States parties that, altogether with the inequalities in the BTWC implementation experience, makes the regime vulnerable. Amid these long-standing and profound issues new threats continue to emerge, like the erosion of global arms control and disarmament architecture as well as developments in science and technology. Even though States parties to the BTWC agree on the need to establish effective mechanisms for reviewing scientific and technological developments, there is no unanimity in approach or possible format. Moreover, agroterrorism, despite its increased relevance, is not covered properly within the BTWC regime.

While acute care and intensive care units are the main pillars of the early response to the disease, rehabilitative medicine should play an important part in allowing COVID-19 survivors to reduce disability and optimize the function of acute hospital setting. AIM: To share the experience and the international perspective of different rehabilitation centers, treating COVID-19 survivors. DESIGN: Not applicable. POPULATION: COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: A group of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation specialists from eleven different countries in Europe and North America have shared their clinical experience in dealing with COVID-19 survivors and how they have managed the re-organization of rehabilitation services. RESULTS: In our experience the most important sequelae of severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are: 1) respiratory; 2) cognitive, central and peipheral nervous system; 3) deconditioning; 4) critical illness related myopathy and neuropathy; 5) dysphagia; 6) joint stiffness and pain; 7) psychiatric.

Serious health hazards have been described including cardiac diseases, neurological complications, multi-organ failure, and even death. Spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) is rarely described as a result of ecstasy ingestion. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of a 19-year-old male patient who was admitted to our rehabilitation center, after developing a T11 AIS B SCI/D following recreational use of ecstasy. DISCUSSION In our case magnetic resonance imaging was inconclusive due to artifacts caused by metallic rods used for surgical scoliosis treatment in the past. This individual received no surgical or pharmacological treatments; however, it is questionable whether any specific treatments would have been beneficial. Ecstasy ingestion leads to a serotonin surge and induces microvascular changes. Neurovascular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, de novo aneurysm formation, and subsequent rupture can occur. 5-hydroxytryptamine, which comes from serotonergic terminals, is a very potent vasoconstrictive amine and can thus lead to prolonged vasoconstriction and ischemia. It is most likely that the SCI/D in our case is the result of an ischemic event following the vasoconstrictive effects of ecstasy ingestion. It is important to stress the possible consequences of recreational ecstasy usage and in unexplained SCI/D, one should consider the possibility of drug-related causes.","output":"Spinal cord injury after the use of ecstasy in a young male."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Offer some recommendations or guidelines during the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of diagnosis, treatment and follow-upin the field of Reconstructive Urology.

A web and PubMed search was performed using \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"COVID-19 Urology\\", \\"COVID19 urology complications\\", \\"COVID-19 reconstructive surgery\\".A narrative review of the literature was carried out (5/17/2020) and after the nominal group technique modified due to the extraordinary restrictions, a first draft was made to unify criteria and reach a quick consensus. Finally, a definitive version was made, agreed by all the authors (5/22/2020). RESULTS: The authors defined the following surgical priorities for Urological Reconstructive Surgery: Emergency/Urgency (life-threatening or emergencies still in anormal situation), Elective Urgency/High priority (potentially dangerous pathology if postponed for more than 1month), Elective Surgery/Intermediate priority (pathology with little probability of being dangerous but it is recommended not to delay more than 6 months), Delayed surgery/Low priority (non-dangerous pathology if it is postponed for more than 6 months). According to this classification, the Working Group agreed on the distribution of the different surgical scenarios of Reconstructive Urology. In addition, consensus was reached on recommendations regarding the diagnosis and follow-up of pathology in the field of Reconstructive Urology.

In parts of Yemen, reports indicated a peak in hospital admissions and burials during MayCJune 2020. To estimate excess mortality during the epidemic period, we quantified activity across all identifiable cemeteries within Aden governorate (population approximately 1 million) by analysing very high-resolution satellite imagery and compared estimates to Civil Registry office records. METHODS: After identifying active cemeteries through remote and ground information, we applied geospatial analysis techniques to manually identify new grave plots and measure changes in burial surface area over a period from July 2016 to September 2020. After imputing missing grave counts using surface area data, we used alternative approaches, including simple interpolation and a generalised additive mixed growth model, to predict both actual and counterfactual (no epidemic) burial rates by cemetery and across the governorate during the most likely period of COVID-19 excess mortality (from 1 April 2020) and thereby compute excess burials. We also analysed death notifications to the Civil Registry office over the same period. RESULTS: We collected 78 observations from 11 cemeteries. In all but one, a peak in daily burial rates was evident from April to July 2020. Interpolation and mixed model methods estimated 1500 excess burials up to 6 July, and 2120 up to 19 September, corresponding to a peak weekly increase of 230% from the counterfactual. Satellite imagery estimates were generally lower than Civil Registry data, which indicated a peak 1823 deaths in May alone. However, both sources suggested the epidemic had waned by September 2020. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first instance of satellite imagery being used for population mortality estimation. Findings suggest a substantial, under-ascertained impact of COVID-19 in this urban Yemeni governorate and are broadly in line with previous mathematical modelling predictions, though our method cannot distinguish direct from indirect virus deaths. Satellite imagery burial analysis appears a promising novel approach for monitoring epidemics and other crisis impacts, particularly where ground data are difficult to collect.","output":"Excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: a geospatial and statistical analysis in Aden governorate, Yemen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. By crossing boundaries between the disciplines of biophysics and pathophysiology, we present evidence that WCR may: (1) cause morphologic changes in erythrocytes including echinocyte and rouleaux formation that can contribute to hypercoagulation; (2) impair microcirculation and reduce erythrocyte and hemoglobin levels exacerbating hypoxia; (3) amplify immune system dysfunction, including immunosuppression, autoimmunity, and hyperinflammation; (4) increase cellular oxidative stress and the production of free radicals resulting in vascular injury and organ damage; (5) increase intracellular Ca2+ essential for viral entry, replication, and release, in addition to promoting pro-inflammatory pathways; and (6) worsen heart arrhythmias and cardiac disorders. Relevance for Patients In short, WCR has become a ubiquitous environmental stressor that we propose may have contributed to adverse health outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and increased the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we recommend that all people, particularly those suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduce their exposure to WCR as much as reasonably achievable until further research better clarifies the systemic health effects associated with chronic WCR exposure.","output":"Evidence for a connection between coronavirus disease-19 and exposure to radiofrequency radiation from wireless communications including 5G."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on domestic economy, such as a decrease in peoples consumption and purchasing power, a decline in company performance, as well as SMEs.

The agricultural sector, and particularly small and family farms, forced to align with the quarantine measures since March 2020, have suffered the full impact of Covid-19. Indeed, the pandemic crisis put a strain on food supply chains: a complex network of interactions involving farmers, agricultural inputs, processing plants, retailers, and others. This study proposes to analyze the impact of the sanitary crisis, and of the national lock-down measures imposed since March 22, 2020, on small farms in the most vulnerable rural areas of Tunisia and on the functioning of small local chains. A survey based on the approach of the Participatory Systemic Rapid Diagnosis (PSRD) was conducted during the month of June 2020 just after 2 months of containment, with a sample of 240 farmers operating in local channels and distributed from north to south of Tunisia on 6 governorates the poorest and most vulnerable, according to the economic development indicator and poverty line. The results of this survey have shown that the health crisis has resulted in major disruptions to agricultural activities mainly at the level of supply chains of raw materials (treatment products, fertilizers, seeds, animal feed,  etc.), and marketing channels due to the closure of weekly markets (leafy vegetables, small livestock,  etc.). This dysfunction of the production system and local agricultural sectors has not only had an impact on farmers incomes, which have dropped significantly compared to a normal year, but has also disrupted the functioning of the entire food system at the local level.

Emerging evidence from different parts of the world showed significantly poor outcome among males compared to female patients. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this difference might be a fundamental step for a more effective and targeted response to the outbreak. For that reason, here we try to investigate the molecular basis of the gender variations in mortality rates related to COVID-19 infection. To achieve this, we used our in-house pipeline to process publicly available lung transcriptomic data from 141 females compared to 286 males. After excluding Y specific genes, our results showed a shortlist of 73 genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups. Our results showed downregulation of a group of genes that are involved in the regulation of hydrolase activity including (AGTR1, CHM, DDX3X, FGFR3, SFRP2, and NLRP2), which is also believed to be essential for lung immune response and antimicrobial activity in the lung tissues in males compared to females. In contrast, our results showed an upregulation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that plays a role in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity modulation. Interestingly, recent reports and experimental animal models highlight an important role of this receptor in SARS-Coronavirus lung damage as well as pulmonary edema, suggesting a possible role of its blockers like losartan and olmesartan as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 infection. Finally, our results also showed a differential expression of different genes that are involved in the immune response including the NLRP2 and PTGDR2, further supporting the notion of the sex-based immunological differences. Taken together, our results provide an initial evidence of the molecular mechanisms that might be involved in the differential outcomes observed between both genders during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Nucleic acids were extracted from each sample with subsequent amplification of VP4/2 by semi-nested RT-PCR for HRV detection. Other viral respiratory pathogens were also detected by PCR, RT-PCR or real time PCR. Nucleotide sequences of the VP4 region were used for genotyping and phylogenetic tree construction. Result In total, 87 of 289 specimens were positive for HRV indicating an annual prevalence of 30%. Wheezing or asthma exacerbation was the most common clinical presentation observed in infected patients. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree showed that 29 (33%) and 8 (9%) specimens belonged to HRV-A and HRV-B, respectively. Most of the HRV positive samples were HRV-C (58%).

To quantify this phenomenon requires the analysis of the effect of the variance and higher moments of the infection distribution. Working in the framework of stochastic branching processes, we derive an approximate analytical formula for the probability of an outbreak in the high variance regime of the infection distribution, verify it numerically and analyze its regime of validity in various examples. We show that it is possible for an outbreak not to occur in the high variance regime even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is larger than one and discuss the implications of our results for COVID-19 and other pandemics.","output":"Superspreaders and High Variance Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The very recent Covid-19 pandemic has made the need to understand biocompatible polymers as support material in drug delivery systems and controlled release clearer, especially for organo-hydrogels This study aims to synthesize various new polymeric materials called gels, hydrogels, and organo-hydrogels according to the monomer used and to investigate their use as drug release systems The agar-glycerol (AG) pair was used to synthesize the polymers, N, N, methylene bisacrylamide (MBA, m) and glutaraldehyde (GA, g) were used as cross-linkers and peppermint oil (PmO) was included to obtain the organo-hydrogels Therefore, one AG gel and two p (AG-m) and p (GA-g) hydrogels were synthesized within the scope of the study Six different organo-hydrogels based on p(AG-m-PmO) or p (AG-g-PmO) were also synthesized by varying the amount of peppermint oil Paracetamol and carboplatin were selected as the sample drugs Synthesized gels, hydrogels and organo-hydrogels were characterized by FTIR and SEM analysis Additionally, swelling behaviors of the synthesized gels were investigated in different media (ID water, tap water, ethanol, acetone, ethanol/ID water (1:1), acetone/ID water (1:1) and gasoline) and at different pHs Moreover, it was determined that organo-hydrogels were blood compatible and had antioxidant properties based on hemolysis, blood clotting and antioxidant analysis Therefore, the release of paracetamol (a known antipyretic-painkiller, recommended and used in the treatment of Covid-19) and carboplatin (widely used in cancer treatment) were studied Evidently, as the amount of PMO oil increases, the -OH groups in organo-hydrogels will increase and the chemical and physical bonding rates will increase;therefore it was observed that increasing peppermint oil in the organo-hydrogels structure to 0 3 mL stimulated the release of the drugs For instance, maximum paracetamol release amount from p(AG-g-PmO) and p(AG-m-PmO) organo-hydrogels was calculated to be 72 3% at pH 7 4 and 69 8% at pH 2 0, respectively The maximum carboplatin release amount from p(AG-g-PmO) and p(AG-m-PmO) organo-hydrogels was calculated to be 99 7% at pH 7 4 and 100% at pH 7 4, respectively It was concluded that the synthesized organo-hydrogels might easily be used as drug carrier and controlled drug release materials","output":"Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Organo-hydrogel based Agar, Glycerol and Peppermint Oil as a Natural Drug Carrier/Release Material"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Racial and ethnic minorities have shouldered a disproportioned burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection to date in the US, but data on the various drivers of these disparities is limited. Objectives: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients and explore factors associated with hospitalization risk by race. Methods: Case series of 448 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA), an integrated health care system serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, from March 3 to May 12, 2020. KPGA members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Multivariable analyses for hospitalization risk also included an additional 3489 persons under investigation (PUI) with suspected infection. COVID-19 treatment and outcomes, underlying comorbidities and quality of care management metrics, socio-demographic and other individual and community-level social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators. Results: Of 448 COVID-19 positive members, 68,3% was non-Hispanic Black (n=306), 18% non-Hispanic White (n=81) and 13,7% Other race (n=61). Median age was 54 [IQR 43-63) years. Overall, 224 patients were hospitalized, median age 60 (50-69) years. Black race was a significant factor in the Confirmed + PUI, female and male models (ORs from 1.98 to 2.19). Obesity was associated with higher hospitalization odds in the confirmed, confirmed + PUI, Black and male models (ORs from 1.78 to 2.77). Chronic disease control metrics (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) were associated with lower odds of hospitalization ranging from 48% to 35% in the confirmed + PUI and Black models. Self-reported physical inactivity was associated with 50% higher hospitalization odds in the Black and Female models. Residence in the Northeast region of Atlanta was associated with lower hospitalization odds in the Confirmed + PUI, White and female models (ORs from 0.22 to 0.64) Conclusions: We found that non-Hispanic Black KPGA members had a disproportionately higher risk of infection and, after adjusting for covariates, twice the risk of hospitalization compared to other race groups. We found no significant differences in clinical outcomes or mortality across race/ethnicity groups. In addition to age, sex and comorbidity burden, pre-pandemic self-reported exercise, metrics on quality of care and control of underlying cardio-metabolic diseases, and location of residence in Atlanta were significantly associated with hospitalization risk by race groups.

Recently, this issue of fairness in predictions has attracted significant attention, as data-driven models are increasingly utilized to perform crucial decision-making tasks. Existing methods to achieve fairness in the machine learning literature typically build a single prediction model in a manner that encourages fair prediction performance for all groups. These approaches have two major limitations: i) fairness is often achieved by compromising accuracy for some groups; ii) the underlying relationship between dependent and independent variables may not be the same across groups. We propose a Joint Fairness Model (JFM) approach for logistic regression models for binary outcomes that estimates group-specific classifiers using a joint modeling objective function that incorporates fairness criteria for prediction. We introduce an Accelerated Smoothing Proximal Gradient Algorithm to solve the convex objective function, and present the key asymptotic properties of the JFM estimates. Through simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of the JFM in achieving good prediction performance and across-group parity, in comparison with the single fairness model, group-separate model, and group-ignorant model, especially when the minority group's sample size is small. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the JFM method in a real-world example to obtain fair risk predictions for under-represented older patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"Joint Fairness Model with Applications to Risk Predictions for Under-represented Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global impact of COVID-19 forced nursing education to provide an alternative for scheduled clinical experiences during the Spring and Fall of 2020.

The challenge for policy makers consists of implementing a suitable approach to contain the outbreak and limit extra deaths without exhausting healthcare forces while mitigating the impact on the country's economy and on individuals well-being. To better describe the trade-off between the economic, societal and public health dimensions, we developed an integrated bioeconomic optimization approach. We built a discrete age-structured model considering three main populations (youth, adults and seniors) and 8 socio-professional characteristics for the adults. Fifteen lockdown exit strategies were simulated for several options: abrupt or progressive (4 or 8 weeks) lockdown lift followed by total definitive transitory final unlocking. Three values of transmission rate (Tr) were considered to represent individuals barrier gesture compliance. Optimization under constraint to find the best combination of scenarios and options was performed on the minimal total cost for production losses due to contracted activities and hospitalization in the short and mid-term, with 3 criteria: mortality, person-days locked and hospital saturation. The results clearly show little difference between the scenarios based on the economic impact or the 3 criteria. This means that policy makers should focus on individuals behaviours (represented by the Tr value) more than on trying to optimize the lockdown strategy (defining who is unlocked and who is locked). For a given Tr, the choices of scenarios permit the management of the hospital saturation level with regard to both its intensity and its duration, which remains a key point for public health. The results highlight the need for behavioural or experimental economics to address COVID-19 issues through a better understanding of individual behaviour motivations and the identification of ways to improve biosecurity compliance.","output":"Individual behaviours and COVID-19 lockdown exit strategy: a mid-term multidimensional bio-economic modelling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic forced several people into social isolation and research has shown a paradoxical effect on people's sexual functioning.

Yet, studies failed to examine its interpersonal and intrapersonal correlates, distinguish between solitary and joint use, or explore differences between partnered and single people. We examined if changes in solitary or joint online pornography use since the lockdown were associated with sexual functioning, sexual satisfaction, perceived health, and sleep quality. We conducted an online cross-sectional study with convenience sampling in Portugal (N = 303 participants;56.3% men;Mage = 31.32, SD = 10.55;71.0% in a relationship) during May and July 2020. Partnered participants who reported increases in solitary online pornography use also reported decreases in their sex life quality. For partnered and single participants, increases in joint online pornography use were associated with increases in sex life quality. Single participants who reported increases in solitary online pornography use also perceived better health and sleep quality, and those who reported increases in joint online pornography use also reported more intimacy with casual partner(s) and better sleep quality.

Nevertheless, few studies notably focused on the mental health conditions of nurses and explored protective factors to prevent posttraumatic stress and psychological distress. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and the predictive factors especially defensive predictors associated with posttraumatic stress and psychological distress in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this online study, 1,728 nurses (~77.5% came from the COVID-19 pandemic frontline) were included in the final analysis. Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (PCL-5) and Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) was used to assess posttraumatic stress and psychological distress. Results: The results demonstrated that the prevalence of posttraumatic stress and psychological distress in nurses throughout China between February 1, 2020 and February 13, 2020 was 39.12 and 24.36%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that insomnia, high panic intensity, and high impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were risk predictors of posttraumatic stress and psychological distress in nurses. Married participants had a 1.58 times increased risk of having posttraumatic stress when compared with the single participants. Frontline medical staff were more likely to suffer from psychological distress. The adequate exercise was a protective predictor of psychological distress [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.655, 95% CI = 0.486C0.883], but not with posttraumatic stress. High-quality diet was a protective predictor of posttraumatic stress (AOR = 0.112, 95% CI = 0.037C0.336) and psychological distress (AOR = 0.083, 95% CI = 0.028C0.247). Conclusions: Our study revealed the prevalence and factors associated with posttraumatic stress and psychological distress in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Low panic intensity, low level of impact, satisfactory sleep, adequate exercise, and better diet were protective factors of posttraumatic stress and psychological distress. It indicated that the psychological status of nurses (particularly those from the COVID-19 pandemic frontline) should be monitored, and protective factors associated with posttraumatic stress and psychological distress should be increased.","output":"Protective Predictors Associated With Posttraumatic Stress and Psychological Distress in Chinese Nurses During the Outbreak of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) is successfully used to induce abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in mice. However, differences between mouse strains in susceptibility to PPE induction have been reported. Kunming mouse is one of the most frequently used strains in China but whether it is suitable for induction of AAA by PPE application remains unclear. METHODS: PPE infusion (1.5 units/ml) in temporary controlled aorta was performed to induce AAAs in both C57BL/6J and Kunming mice. Phosphate\\\\buffered saline (PBS) application was used as vehicle control. The aorta diameters of all mice were measured at days 0 and 14 after surgery to evaluate the AAA formation. RESULTS: After 14 days of PPE or PBS infusion, all mice were sacrificed and aorta tissues were collected for histological staining analysis. At the 14th day after infusion, PPE successfully induced aortic dilation in Kunming mice and typical AAA in C57BL/6J mice. The aorta diameter increased by 0.23 mm in Kunming mice after PPE infusion, while it was 0.72 mm in the C57BL/6J strain. PPE induced mild elastin degradation, smooth muscle cell (SMC) depletion and mural leucocyte infiltration in Kunming mice, but in PPE\\\\sensitive C57BL/6J mice, it induced total loss of SMCs, elastin disappearance and diffused infiltrated leucocytes in aortic aneurysmal segments. The effects of PPE in inducing angiogenesis and upregulating matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression in Kunming mice were also weaker than that in C57BL/6J mice. CONCLUSION: At the reported dose of PPE, Kunming mouse is not as susceptible to AAA formation as C57BL/6J mice. The failure of PPE to induce AAA formation in Kunming mice may be associated to its inability to boost a strong inflammatory response.","output":"Kunming mouse strain is less susceptible to elastase\\\\induced abdominal aortic aneurysms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dyjack offers insights about raven birds in the aspects of environmental health The raven seemed unfazed by the cloud of the victim's angry and agitated family members as it inserted its beak into a nesting cavity of much smaller birds and brusquely removed a tiny, wriggling pink mass The winged beast causally flew off to dismember and digest its meal According to him, he endured the spectacle of the raven returning again and again over a 2-hour period to eat multiple baby birds","output":"The Raven"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of our lives, including education Due to this unexpected catastrophe, education has shifted to virtual-learning and auto-grading models in most parts of the world This study explores the validity and appropriateness of auto-grading-assessment for online exams by comparing students' online exam scores where they are first auto-graded and then manually graded Furthermore, it investigates whether the mean differences in their scores are statistically significant The study included two calculus courses taught by the authors, during the spring semester 2019-2020 at a private university in Saudi Arabia The online exam was performed on the WebAssign platform, which has built-in calculus questions The sample consisted of fifty-five students who were registered on those calculus courses The quantitative data was analysed using the SPSS statistical tool A paired t-test at an alpha level of 0 05 was performed on differences in mean exam scores between auto-graded and manually-graded scores The statistical analysis results revealed a statistically significant difference in students' mean scores Our findings illustrate the importance of human intelligence, its role in assessing students' achievements and understanding of mathematical concepts, and the extent to which instructors can currently rely on auto-grading A careful manual investigation of auto-graded exams revealed different types of mistakes committed by students Those mistakes were characterized into two categories: non-mathematical mistakes (related to Platform Design) and minor mathematical mistakes, which might deserve partial credit The study indicated a need to reform the auto-grading system and provided some suggestions to overcome its setbacks ? 2021 The authors and IJLTER ORG All rights reserved","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges of E-assessment of calculus courses in higher education: A case study in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the effects of COVID-19 have been unfolding, growing attention has been paid to the intersection of COVID-19 and substance use and the related harms.

The pandemic is the result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has demonstrated high rates of infectivity leading to great morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations. At present, scientists are exploring various approaches to curb this pandemic and alleviate its health consequences, while racing to develop a vaccine. A particularly insidious aspect of COVID-19 is the delayed overactivation of the body's immune system that is manifested as the cytokine storm. This unbridled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can directly or indirectly cause massive organ damage and failure. Systemic vascular endothelial inflammation and thrombocytopenia are potential consequences as well. In the case of COVID-19, the cytokine storm often fits the pattern of the macrophage activation syndrome with lymphocytopenia. The basis for the imbalance between the innate and adaptive immune systems is not clearly defined, but highlights the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages. Here we discuss the potential underlying basis for the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages, both direct and indirect, and potential therapeutic targets. These include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferons, and CXCL10 (IP-10).

In zebrafish, Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity.

However, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused longer delays, and no recommendations are available to manage this huge extension. OBJECTIVES: To provide advice on how to resume VIT safely after a long delay from the last injection considering the potential risk factors for side effects, without starting again with the induction phase. METHODS: All the patients who delayed VIT because of the pandemic were consecutively enrolled in this single-center study. The time extension was decided according to their risk profile (eg, long prepandemic time interval, severe pre-VIT reaction, older age, multitreatments), and correlation analyses were performed to find potential risk factors of side effects. RESULTS: The mean delay from the pre- (7 weeks) to the postpandemic VIT interval (15.5 weeks) was 8.5 weeks. The total amount of the prepandemic VIT maintenance dose was safely administered in 1 day in 78% of patients, whereas only 3, of 87, experienced side effects, and their potential risk factors were identified in bee venom allergy and recent VIT initiation. CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, long VIT delays may be safe and well tolerated, but more caution should be paid in resuming VIT in patients with long prepandemic maintenance interval, severe pre-VIT reaction, recent VIT initiation, older age, multidrug treatments, and bee venom allergy.

European healthcare services must address this issue as the number of healthcare users with an MM background increases. Aim: To explore the perspectives of key stakeholders and healthcare users with an MM background on transcultural care in four European countries. Design: Qualitative phenomenological study. Methods: Semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted with stakeholders and MM users. Interviews were translated and transcribed verbatim and were carried out from February to May 2021. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the characteristics of the sample; qualitative data were analyzed thematically following Braun and Clarkes phases, resulting in 6 themes and 18 subthemes. Results: For stakeholders and MM users with long-established residence in their respective countries, cultural differences involve different family and community norms, religious beliefs, lifestyles, and habits. These components are perceived as in tension with healthcare norms and values, and they mediate in two key and related aspects of the relationship between MM users and healthcare providers: accessibility and communication. Conclusions: Communication and access to healthcare are key to MM health service users, and they are the most frequent sources of misunderstanding and conflict between them and healthcare professionals. Impact: It is important to extend the investigation of cultural issues in healthcare to stakeholders and MM users.

Delayed admissions may result in poorer outcomes due to prolonged mental suffering and delays in initiating treatment. Long waiting times also have a negative impact at a service level, impeding patient flow. National guidance has been recently updated, recommending that patient transfers to secure services take no longer than 28 days from referral. These transfers are frequently affected by delays in admission, possibly resulting in increased risk to patients, staff and the public. The aim of this project was to audit all referrals to Broadmoor High Secure Hospital in England within a one year period with special focus taken on calculating the time taken from referral to admission. We aimed to assess if there were any rate limiting steps which could be targeted to reduce time from referral to admission. Method We collected data and conducted a retrospective cohort review for all admissions from September 2019-September 2020. Where available, information was obtained for each step of the referrals process. Individual patient records were reviewed where required. Exclusion criteria: data withdrawn, transfers from other high secure services (HSS), incomplete data, MOJ instruction or urgent admission bypassing the process. Result 18 cases were excluded as per exclusion criteria. 46 patients were included in the study. 16 referrals originated from medium secure psychiatric hospitals, and 30 from prison. The average time from referral to admission was 44.3 days. Admission of patients from MSUs was quicker, taking an average of 40.3 days when compared to prison referrals, which took 45.9 days. The breakdown of timings for each step in the referrals process was calculated to determine if a rate limiting step could be identified.On average it took 2.1 working days to allocate a case to a clinician, 7.6 days for an assessment, 9.2 days to complete a report and 3.5 days to submit this to the admissions panel. The mean time from referral to the date of the panel hearing was 22.5 working days, and admission took a further 21.8 days on average.

Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives are to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the real-world epidemiology of the disease. METHODS: We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 degrees Celsius (or >39 oC without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will require ICU admission.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Prognostic Factors for Intensive Care Unit Admission of Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Study Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas are rare vascular malformations.

We evaluated presenting symptoms and imaging findings, including bone involvement and mode of treatment. To assess the treatment outcome, we compared initial and follow-up clinical status using the modified Aminoff and Logue Scale of Disability and the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS The presenting symptoms were lower back pain (n = 2), radiculopathy (n = 5), and myelopathy (n = 7). There is overlap of symptoms in 1 patient (No. 11). Distribution of spinal epidural arteriovenous fistulas was cervical (n = 3), thoracic (n = 2), lumbar (n = 6), and sacral (n = 2).

At a mean follow-up of 7.3 years (range, 5 to 10), patients had significant improvements in their mean CS from 63 (SD 18) to 80 (SD 18; p = 0.005), ASES from 57 (SD 18) to 81 (SD 18; p = 0.003), Walch-Duplay from 34 (SD 31) to 79 (SD 22; p < 0.001) and Rowe score from 37 (SD 23) to 79 (SD 24; p < 0.001). Pain level decreased from 5.6 (SD 2.5) preoperative to 2.3 (SD 2.3; p < 0.001) and SSV improved 58 (SD 20) to 76 (SD 24; p = 0.002). Global satisfaction with the procedure was 8.4 (SD 2.1). Clinical significance was met or exceeded by 84% for CS and 89% of the patients for ASES and 95% met or exceeded satisfaction threshold for CS. There were 7 shoulders (37%) re-operated for symptomatic screw irritation. CONCLUSION: This series reporting on the long-term follow-up after arthroscopic posterior ICBG for recurrent posterior shoulder instability demonstrates despite a high number of reoperation for symptomatic screw irritation its effectiveness with acceptable clinical outcomes and satisfied patients.

In Australia, human, animal and ecological health are managed by separate sectors with limited communication. This study aims to explore how professionals in these fields perceive a One Health approach to zoonotic disease surveillance, aiming to identify the challenges to the implementation of an integrated system in Australia. Using a qualitative research method, ten semistructured interviews were conducted with academic experts to gain insight into the possibility of developing an integrated surveillance system in Australia. A thematic analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings showed the absence of a clear definition and subsequent vision for the future of One Health act as a barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration, and that siloed approaches by different sectors restrict the ability for professionals to work collaboratively across disciplines. An understanding of disease transmission was considered by participants to be a necessary requirement for a successful One Health approach. Finally, participants considered political will an essential requirement for the integration of surveillance systems. This study demonstrates that for a One Health approach to be implemented in an Australian setting, those working in the fields of human, animal and ecological health must agree on several aspects. The establishment of a formal governance body with representatives from each sector could assist in overcoming long\\\\standing barriers of privacy and distrust. Further, developing interdisciplinary training in One Health concepts for medical, environmental and veterinary students may encourage cross\\\\disciplinary collaboration.

METHODS: Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weight-mismatched canine pairs. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without cardiopulmonary bypass; group 2, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and in which the cardiopulmonary bypass flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration. Hemodynamic parameters and lung function were monitored for 6 hours after reperfusion. The grafts were harvested for histologic studies, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time quantitive reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction of mRNA encoding interleukin 6. RESULTS: The hemodynamic parameters were similar among the 3 groups. In group 1 Pao(2) and alveolar to arterial gradient for O(2) levels were excellent throughout the 6-hour observation period, but in group 2 they progressively deteriorated. However, ultrafiltration significantly (P = .02) improved the Pao(2) level in group 3. On histology, interstitial edema and polynuclear cell infiltration were most marked in group 2 and significantly worse than in groups 1 and 3. Myeloperoxidase assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction showed increased myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression in group 2 grafts compared with group 1 grafts. Myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression were suppressed with ultrafiltration.

It was, therefore, hypothesised that ACE-2 expression might be related to cell cycle progression. To test this hypothesis, ACE-2 mRNA levels, protein levels and enzymatic activity were examined in fibrotic human lungs and in the alveolar epithelial cell lines A549 and MLE-12 studied at postconfluent (quiescent) versus subconfluent (proliferating) densities. ACE-2 mRNA, immunoreactive protein and enzymatic activity were all high in quiescent cells, but were severely downregulated or absent in actively proliferating cells. Upregulation of the enzyme in cells that were progressing to quiescence was completely inhibited by the transcription blocker actinomycin D or by SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In lung biopsy specimens obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, immunoreactive enzyme was absent in alveolar epithelia that were positive for proliferation markers, but was robustly expressed in alveolar epithelia devoid of proliferation markers. These data explain the loss of ACE-2 in lung fibrosis and demonstrate cell cycle-dependent regulation of this protective enzyme by a JNK-mediated transcriptional mechanism.","output":"Cell cycle dependence of ACE-2 explains downregulation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Multiple myeloma (MM) patients are immunocompromised due to defects in humoral/cellular immunity and immunosuppressive therapy. Reports indicate that the antibody (Ab) response in MM after 1 dose of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine is attenuated. Vaccine response kinetics in patients with prior COVID-19 and impact of treatment remain unknown. Methods We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding (anti-S) IgG level in 320 MM patients receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Blood and saliva were taken at multiple time points. 69 age-matched healthcare workers were used as controls. Results The 320 MM patients (median age 68 years) received two-dose mRNA vaccines (69.1% BNT162b2, 27.2% mRNA-1273). Median time to diagnosis was 60 months with a median of 2 prior treatment lines (range 0-16). We included 23 patients with smoldering MM. 59 patients (18.4%) were not on active treatment; 148 (43.8%) received anti-CD38 mAb-containing treatment and 36 (11.3%) were on BCMA-targeted therapy. 131 patients (40.9%) exhibited a complete response at last evaluation. 260 patients (81.3%) had anti-S IgG measured >10 days after the second vaccine (median 51 days). Of these, 84.2% mounted measurable anti-S IgG levels (median 149 AU/mL). In the control group, Ab levels were significantly higher (median 300 AU/mL). Ab levels in the 38 vaccinated MM patients with prior COVID-19 were 10-fold higher than those of patients without prior COVID-19 (median 801 vs 69 AU/mL, p<0.001). MM patients on active treatment had lower anti-S IgG levels (p=0.004) compared to patients not on therapy (median 70 vs 183 AU/mL). Notably, 41 patients (15.8%) failed to develop detectable anti-S IgG: 24/41 (58.5%) were on anti-CD38 mAb, 13/41 (31.7%) on anti-BCMA bispecific Ab therapy and 4/41 (9.8%) >3 months after CAR T. Multivariate analysis (corrected for age, vaccine type, lines of treatment, time since diagnosis, response status and lymphopenia) confirmed that anti-CD38-containing (p=0.005) and BCMA-targeted treatment (p<0.001) are associated with not developing detectable anti-S IgG. Clinical relevance is emphasized by 10 cases of COVID-19 after 1 (n=7) or 2 vaccine doses (n=3, all without anti-S IgG) with 1 patient passing due to respiratory failure. Conclusion MM patients mount a suboptimal IgG response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with 15.8% developing no detectable anti-S IgG. Ongoing analyses will show kinetics of patients with low-normal Ab levels in comparison to healthy controls. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses and extensive immunophenotyping of >40 patients in the context of vaccination will be reported at the meeting. Immediate implications are the continuation of non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. masking and social distancing, for vulnerable patients. The findings underscore a need for serological monitoring of MM patients following COVID-19 vaccination and for clinical trials assessing use of prophylactic strategies or studies exploring additional immunization strategies.","output":"OAB-048: Suboptimal humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in myeloma patients is associated with anti-CD38 mAb and BCMA-targeted treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Keloid scars following median sternotomy are rare and occur more frequently in pigmented skin. Different management strategies have been described with variable success. We present a case of keloid scar formation following cardiac surgery including our management and the final aesthetic result. CASE DESCRIPTION A 64 year old female of fair complexion underwent mitral valve replacement. The procedure and postoperative recovery were uncomplicated, however, during the following year, thick keloid scars formed over the incision sites. Initial non surgical measures failed to relieve pain and did not offer any tangible aesthetic benefit. Eventually surgical excision was attempted. She presented to our clinic for nine months follow up with significant improvement in pain and aesthetic result. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION Several theories have attempted to explore the pathophysiology of keloid scar formation. A number of predisposing factors have been documented however none existed in this case. A variety of invasive and non invasive approaches have been described but significant differences in success rates and methodology of investigations still precludes a standardized management protocol. CONCLUSIONS In this case study a rare presentation of keloid scar has been presented. The variety of methods used to improve pain and aesthetic result demonstrates the propensity of keloid scars to recur and the therapeutic challenges that surgeons have to face in their quest for a satisfactory patient outcome.","output":"Presentation and management of keloid scarring following median sternotomy: a case study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected an estimated 200 million people with over 4 million deaths.

Our study aims to report the phenotypical and genetic characteristics of nosocomial Klebsiella pneumoniae spp ozaenae isolates associated with mortality collected from a tertiary-level hospital in Panama City. In October 2020, 11 consecutive multidrug-resistant Gram-negative isolates were recovered from secretions and blood cultures from hospitalized patients. Nearly 90% (10/11) of these patients died, and bacteria was obtained from six patients for investigation. Biochemical evaluation of the six isolates revealed the presence of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae spp ozaenae. Phenotypic evaluation indicated resistance to carbapenemase and EBSL. In contrast, genetic evaluation by PCR showed that only 30% (2/6) were resistant to CTX-M-1 (CTX-M group 1), whereas 60.7% (4/6) presented carbapenemase resistance genes, and 33.3% (2/6) presented New Delhi metallo--lactamase (NDM) resistance genes.

Deferment of elective surgeries and procedures coupled with a shift of resources toward increased inpatient clinical needs for the care of COVID-19 patients has resulted in substantially decreased imaging examinations at many institutions. Additionally, both infection control and risk mitigation measures have resulted in minimal on-site staffing of both trainees and staff radiologists at many institutions. As a result, residents have been placed in nonstandard learning environments, including working from home, engaging in a virtual curriculum, and participating in training sessions in preparation for potential reassignment to other patient care settings. Typically, for residents to gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to practice independently upon graduation, radiology training programs must provide an optimal balance between resident education and clinical obligations.

Instead of detecting unexpected increases of infections by monitoring confirmed cases, syndromic surveillance aims at the detection of cases with early symptoms, which allows a more timely disclosure of outbreaks. However, the definition of these disease patterns is often challenging, as early symptoms are usually shared among many diseases and a particular disease can have several clinical pictures in the early phase of an infection. As a first step toward the goal to support epidemiologists in the process of defining reliable disease patterns, we present a novel, data-driven approach to discover such patterns in historic data. The key idea is to take into account the correlation between indicators in a health-related data source and the reported number of infections in the respective geographic region. In an preliminary experimental study, we use data from several emergency departments to discover disease patterns for three infectious diseases. Our results show the potential of the proposed approach to find patterns that correlate with the reported infections and to identify indicators that are related to the respective diseases. It also motivates the need for additional measures to overcome practical limitations, such as the requirement to deal with noisy and unbalanced data, and demonstrates the importance of incorporating feedback of domain experts into the learning procedure.","output":"Correlation-Based Discovery of Disease Patterns for Syndromic Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are limited reports of neurological symptoms in the pediatric population with COVID-19.

This paper reports on the establishment and first findings for the ATHENA COVID-19 Study. Methods: Part 1 of the ATHENA COVID-19 Study used Notifiable Conditions System data from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020, linked to: Emergency Department Collection data for the same period; Queensland Health Admitted Patient Data Collections (from 1 January 2010 to 30 January 2021); and Deaths Registrations data (from 1 January 2020 to 17 January 2021). Results: To 31 December 2020, a total of 1,254 people had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Queensland: half were female (49.8%); two-thirds (67.7%) were aged 20-59 years; and there was an over-representation of people living in less-disadvantaged areas. More than half of people diagnosed (57.6%) presented to an ED; 21.2% were admitted to hospital as an inpatient (median length of stay 11 days); 1.4% were admitted to an intensive care unit (82.4% of these required ventilation); and there were six deaths. Analysis of factors associated with these outcomes was limited due to small case numbers: people living in less-disadvantaged areas had a lower risk of being admitted to hospital (test for trend, p < 0.001), while those living in more remote areas were less likely than people living in major cities to present to an ED (test for trend: p=0.007), which may reflect differential health care access rather than health outcomes per se. Increasing age (test for trend, p < 0.001) and being a current/recent smoker (age-sex-adjusted relative risk: 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 2.61) were associated with a higher risk of being admitted to hospital.

Although it is best to evaluate student readiness prior to commencement of an online course, to ensure successful development and delivery of student-centric teaching and learning strategies, readiness towards online learning among physiotherapy undergraduates is unknown. The main aim of this study was to examine physiotherapy undergraduates readiness towards online learning. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants were selected through a combination of total population and convenience sampling. The Student Online Learning Readiness questionnaire was distributed among physiotherapy undergraduates from two public and two private universities in Malaysia to investigate their technical, social and communication competencies. Information about device characteristics were obtained to evaluate their equipment readiness. Descriptive and group comparisons were conducted using independent t-test, and analysis of variance with p < 0.05 as level of significance. RESULTS: A total of 352 physiotherapy undergraduates participated. The response rate was 81.6%. The results showed that physiotherapy undergraduates in these four institutions had moderate levels of readiness towards technical competencies (M = 3.7  0.5), social competencies with instructor (M = 3.7  0.6), social competencies with classmates (M = 3.8  0.6) and communication competencies (M = 3.6  0.5) related to online learning. The overall readiness for these four competencies was moderate (M = 3.7  0.4), however the physiotherapy undergraduates had high (> 80% possessed smartphones and laptop) level of equipment readiness. Institution and gender had no significant effect on the level of readiness (p > 0.05). Year 1 and 2 had significantly higher levels of social competencies with instructor compared to final year physiotherapy undergraduates (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Physiotherapy undergraduates in these four institutions had moderate to high levels of readiness towards online learning. Technical, social and communication competencies could be further enhanced with appropriate strategies. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides an insight into the level of readiness towards online learning among physiotherapy undergraduates. The findings of our study shed light on issues to consider when designing online courses. A pre-course training for undergraduates prior to the commencement of online courses may be useful.

Similarly, several growth factors over-expressed in ILDs, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activate JAK/STAT by canonical or non-canonical pathways, which indicates a predominant role of JAK/STAT in ILDs. Between the different JAK/STAT isoforms, it appears that JAK2/STAT3 are predominant, initiating cellular changes observed in ILDs. This review analyzes the expression and distribution of different JAK/STAT isoforms in ILDs lung tissue and different cell types related to ILDs, such as lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II cells and analyzes JAK/STAT activation. The effect of JAK/STAT phosphorylation on cellular fibrotic processes, such as proliferation, senescence, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or epithelial/fibroblast to mesenchymal transition will be described. The small molecules directed to inhibit JAK/STAT activation were assayed in vitro and in in vivo models of pulmonary fibrosis, and different JAK inhibitors are currently approved for myeloproliferative disorders. Recent evidence indicates that JAK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies directed to block IL-6 are used as compassionate use to attenuate the excessive inflammation and lung fibrosis related to SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Furthermore, we analyze the potential role of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies to prevent severe complications. OS has a potential key role in the COVID-19 pathogenesis by triggering the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB). While exposure to many pro-oxidants usually induces nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor2 (NRF2) activation and upregulation of antioxidant related elements expression, respiratory viral infections often inhibit NRF2 and/or activate NF-kB pathways, resulting in inflammation and oxidative injury.

Highly virulent SIV strains cause mortality of up to 10%. Importantly, pigs have long been considered mixing vessels that generate novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential, a constant threat to public health. Since its emergence in 2009 and subsequent pandemic spread, the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) has been detected in pig farms, creating the risk of generating new reassortants and their possible infection of humans. Pathogenesis in SIV or H1N1pdm-infected pigs remains poorly characterized. Proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine responses are considered correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, and swine macrophages are found to be indispensible in effective clearance of SIV from pig lungs. In this study, we report a unique pattern of cytokine responses in swine macrophages infected with H1N1pdm. The roles of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in the regulation of the host responses were examined. We found that proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF- were significantly induced and their induction was ERK1/2-dependent. IFN- and IFN-inducible antiviral Mx and 25-OAS were sharply induced, but the inductions were effectively abolished when ERK1/2 was inhibited. Induction of CCL5 (RANTES) was completely inhibited by inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which appeared also to regulate FasL and TNF-, critical for apoptosis in pig macrophages. We found that NFB was activated in H1N1pdm-infected cells, but the activation was suppressed when ERK1/2 was inhibited, indicating there is cross-talk between MAP kinase and NFB responses in pig macrophages. Our data suggest that MAP kinase may activate NFB through the induction of RIG-1, which leads to the induction of IFN- in swine macrophages. Understanding host responses and their underlying mechanisms may help identify venues for effective control of SIV and assist in prevention of future influenza pandemics.","output":"Distinct Regulation of Host Responses by ERK and JNK MAP Kinases in Swine Macrophages Infected with Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The value of graph-based big data can be unlocked by exploring the topology and metrics of the networks they represent, and the computational approaches to this exploration take on many forms. For the use-case of performing global computations over a graph, it is first ingested into a graph processing system from one of many digital representations. Extracting information from graphs involves processing all their elements globally, which can be done with single-machine systems (with varying approaches to hardware usage), distributed systems (either homogeneous or heterogeneous groups of machines) and systems dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC). For these systems focused on processing the bulk of graph elements, common use-cases consist in executing for example algorithms for vertex ranking or community detection, which produce insights on graph structure and relevance of their elements. Many distributed systems (such as Flink, Spark) and libraries (e.g. Gelly, GraphX) have been built to enable these tasks and improve performance.

Proteolysis of OPN by thrombin, matrix metalloproteases, caspase 8/3, cathepsin D, plasmin, and enterokinase generates various cleaved OPNs with a variety of bioactivities by binding to different target cells. Moreover, OPN is susceptible to gradual proteolysis. During inflammation, one of the cleaved fragments, N-terminal thrombin-cleaved OPN (trOPN or OPN-Arg(168) [OPN-R]), induces dendritic cell (DC) adhesion. Further cleavage by carboxypeptidase B2 or carboxypeptidase N removes Arg(168) from OPN-R to OPN-Leu(167) (OPN-L). Consequently, OPN-L decreases DC adhesion. In particular, the differences in plasma level over time are observed between FL-OPN and its cleaved OPNs during inflammation. We found that the undefined OPN levels (mixture of FL-OPN and cleaved OPN) were elevated in plasma and reflected the pathology of TB and COVID-19 rather than FL-OPN. These infections are associated with elevated levels of various proteases. Inhibition of the cleavage or the activities of cleaved products may improve the outcome of the therapy.

In Namibia, the national prevalence of diarrhoea was 17%; it was responsible for 5% of all deaths in children under 5 years old and is the second leading cause of death. AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology and factors associated with acute diarrhoea amongst children less than 5 years of age in Engela district in the Ohangwena region, Namibia. SETTING: The study was conducted in Ohangwena Region in Namibia which extends east to west along the borders of the southern part of Angola. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A structured questionnaire was administered through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the socio-demographic and epidemiological data of diarrhoea and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the prevalence of diarrhoea. RESULTS: The study found a prevalence of 23.8% for diarrhoea in the 2 weeks period preceding the survey amongst children aged under 5 years. The prevalence of diarrhoea was statistically significantly associated with children (p 0.05). The strongest predictor of the prevalence of diarrhoea was the residential area 'informal settlement', with an odds ratio of 36.42. This implies that children living in the informal settlement are 36.42 times at risk of contracting diarrhoea as compared to those living in other residential areas.

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms among US youth and young adults, and it has been used to educate the public about the potential harm of vaping through antivaping posts. OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze the characteristics of and user engagement with antivaping posts on Instagram to inform future message development and information delivery. METHODS: A total of 11,322 Instagram posts were collected from November 18, 2019, to January 2, 2020, by using antivaping hashtags including #novape, #novaping, #stopvaping, #dontvape, #antivaping, #quitvaping, #antivape, #stopjuuling, #dontvapeonthepizza, and #escapethevape. Among those posts, 1025 posts were randomly selected and 500 antivaping posts were further identified by hand coding. The image type, image content, and account type of antivaping posts were hand coded, the text information in the caption was explored by topic modeling, and the user engagement of each category was compared. RESULTS: Analyses found that antivaping images of the educational/warning type were the most common (253/500; 50.6%). The average likes of the educational/warning type (15 likes/post) were significantly lower than the catchphrase image type (these emphasized a slogan such as athletesdontvape in the image; 32.5 likes/post; P<.001). The majority of the antivaping posts contained the image content element text (n=332, 66.4%), followed by the image content element people/person (n=110, 22%). The images containing people/person elements (32.8 likes/post) had more likes than the images containing other elements (13.8-21.1 likes/post). The captions of the antivaping Instagram posts covered topics including lung health, teen vaping, stop vaping, and vaping death cases. Among the 500 antivaping Instagram posts, while most posts were from the antivaping community (n=177, 35.4%) and personal account types (n=182, 36.4%), the antivaping community account type had the highest average number of posts (1.69 posts/account). However, there was no difference in the number of likes among different account types. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple features of antivaping Instagram posts may be related to user engagement and perception. This study identified the critical elements associated with high user engagement, which could be used to design antivaping posts to deliver health-related information more efficiently.","output":"Characteristics of and User Engagement With Antivaping Posts on Instagram: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectif valuer les plaintes de sommeil des tudiants en 2021 suite aux confinements dus au COVID-19.

Results In our sample of residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19 (N=4007), COVID-19 was confirmed in 1538 residents (38%). Although, symptomatology overlapped between residents with COVID-19+ and COVID-19-, those with COVID-19+ were three times more likely to die within 30 days (hazard ratio (HR), 31; 95% CI, 27 to 36).

However, the association between PM2.5 and risk of CKD remains under-recognized, especially in regions with high levels of PM2.5, such as China. METHODS To explore the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and CKD prevalence in China, we used data from the China National Survey of CKD, which included a representative sample of 47,204 adults. We estimated annual exposure to PM2.5 before the survey date at each participant's address, using a validated, satellite-based, spatiotemporal model with a 10 km10 km resolution. Participants with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or albuminuria were defined as having CKD. We used a logistic regression model to estimate the association and analyzed the influence of potential modifiers. RESULTS The 2-year mean PM2.5 concentration was 57.4 g/m3, with a range from 31.3 to 87.5 g/m3. An increase of 10 g/m3 in PM2.5 was positively associated with CKD prevalence (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22 to 1.35) and albuminuria (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.47).

These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. OBJECTIVE: It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on people's interests, motives, and other psychological states. METHODS: We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. RESULTS: With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in people's search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that people's interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.","output":"Interests, Motives, and Psychological Burdens in Times of Crisis and Lockdown: Google Trends Analysis to Inform Policy Makers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia has increased significantly of late.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to describe clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, adolescents, and young adults with established type 1 diabetes (T1D) and explore the effects of COVID-19 on glycemic control and disease course. METHODS: An observational study was conducted at 3 pediatric diabetes clinics in Israel between mid-March 2020 and mid-March 2021. Included were young people with established T1D, age younger than 30 years, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). Data were collected from medical files, diabetes devices, and COVID-19 questionnaire. Outcome measures were analyzed by the presence/absence of clinical symptoms (symptomatic/asymptomatic) and by age group (pediatric, < 19 years/young adults, 19-30 years). RESULTS: Of 132 patients, mean age 16.9  5.3years, with COVID-19Cconfirmed infection, 103 (78%) had related symptoms; the most common were headaches, fatigue, fever, and loss of sense of smell. All had a mild disease course, but 4 required hospitalization and 2 cases were directly related to COVID-19 infection (pleuropneumonia in a patient with immunodeficiency syndrome, 1 case of diabetic ketoacidosis). Logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23; P = .033), elevated glucose levels (OR = 5.23; 95% CI, 1.12-24.41; P = .035), and comorbidities (OR = 8.21; 95% CI, 1.00-67.51; P = .050) were positively associated with symptomatic infection. Persistent symptoms occurred in 16.5% of the cohort over a median of 6.7 months; age (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.29; P = .030) and elevated glucose levels (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.12-10.40; P = .031) were positively associated with persistent symptoms. Usually, no change was reported in glucose levels (64%) except for a temporary deterioration in glycemic control during the short infection period. CONCLUSION: Young people with established T1D experience mild COVID-19 infection.

While in rare cases RIG-I gene loss has been detected in mammalian and avian species, most notably in the chicken, MDA5 pseudogenization has only been detected once in mammals. We have screened over a hundred publicly available avian genome sequences and describe an independent disruption of MDA5 in two unrelated avian lineages, the storks (Ciconiiformes) and the rallids (Gruiformes). The results of our RELAX analysis confirmed the absence of negative selection in the MDA5 pseudogene. In contrast to our prediction, we have shown, using multiple dN/dS-based approaches, that the MDA5 loss does not appear to have resulted in any compensatory evolution in the RIG-I gene, which may partially share its ligand-binding specificity.

This study examined the association between the nature of changes and psychological distress, in addition to the moderating effect of COVID-related stressors.

Positive and negative changes were associated with higher psychological distress compared to no lifestyle change, and there was a moderating effect of COVID-related stressors in the association between COVID-related lifestyle changes and distress. In conclusion, to reduce psychological distress in overwhelming circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people should carefully consider whether to make changes in their lifestyle habits before doing so, even if these changes are perceived as positive and health-enhancing.

METHODS: The CORONADO initiative is a French nationwide multicentre study of patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 with a 28-day follow-up. The patients were screened after hospital admission from 10 March to 10 April 2020. We mainly focused on hospital discharge and death within 28 days. RESULTS: We included 2796 participants: 63.7% men, mean age 69.7  13.2 years, median BMI (25th-75th percentile) 28.4 (25.0-32.4) kg/m2.

The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the EM protein, expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum.

It is characterized by the progressive worsening of lung function and has a poor prognosis (median survival is approximately 3 years). However, the clinical course of disease shows considerable individual variability. Therefore, it is important to monitor the clinical course and to predict prognosis for optimal therapy. Serum biomarkers are both less invasive and reproducible diagnostic tools. Useful biomarkers for patients with IPF are strongly coveted; however, to date, there are no biomarkers that are globally known. In Japan, surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, and KL-6 are commonly used as serum markers of interstitial pneumonia, including IPF, in the clinical setting, and empirical data has been accumulated over 10 years. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins and members of the collectin family. These collectins have been shown to function as host defense lectins in the lung. KL-6 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein and now classified as a human MUC1 mucin protein. These three proteins are mainly synthesized by alveolar type II cells. The mechanisms of increase for these protein levels in sera of patients with IPF are probably a combination of a loss of epithelial integrity due to injury and an increased mass of type II cells due to hyperplasia. It has been revealed that those proteins are useful for monitoring the clinical course and predicting prognosis as well as for the diagnosis of IPF. In this review article, the molecular structures and biological functions of these biomarkers are outlined, and we discuss the clinical application of these biomarkers for patients with IPF.","output":"Specific Serum Markers of IPF: What Is the Significance of KL-6, SP-A, and SP-D?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Platyrrhinus ismaeli is reported for the first time in the department of Ancash, Peru, becoming the sourthermost record from the western slope of the Peruvian Andes.

Northern blot analysis was used to demonstrate that the ORF5 gene measures 180 bp in length and overlaps completely with ORF1 when read in the same direction. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to show that the ORF5 protein is not essential for PCV2 replication. To investigate the biological functions of the novel protein, we constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid capable of expressing PCV2 ORF5. The results show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is degraded via the proteasome, inhibits PAM growth and prolongs the S-phase of the cell cycle. Further studies show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein induces ER stress and activates NF-B, which was further confirmed by a significant upregulation in IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression. In addition, five cellular proteins (GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3) were found to interact with ORF5 via yeast two-hybrid assay. These findings provide novel information on the identification and functional analysis of the PCV2 ORF5 protein and are likely to be of benefit in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity. However, additional experiments are needed to validate the expression and function of the ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection in vitro before any definitive conclusion can be drawn.","output":"Identification of Putative ORF5 Protein of Porcine Circovirus Type 2 and Functional Analysis of GFP-Fused ORF5 Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 disease spreads swiftly, and nearly three months after the first positive case was confirmed in China, Coronavirus started to spread all over the United States.

METHODS: This is a cohort study of hospitalised confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted from FebruaryCJune 2020 and followed up till 17th July 2020, analysed using a mixture multi-state model. All hospital patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease in Regione Lombardia were involved, admitted from FebruaryCJune 2020, with non-missing hospital of admission and non-missing admission date. RESULTS: The cohort consists of 40,550 patients hospitalised during the first wave. These patients had a median age of 69 (interquartile range 56C80) and were more likely to be men (60%) than women (40%). The hospital-fatality risk, averaged over all pathways through hospital, was 27.5% (95% CI 27.1C28.0%); and steadily decreased from 34.6% (32.5C36.6%) in February to 7.6% (6.3C10.6%) in June. Among surviving patients, median length of stay in hospital was 11.8 (11.6C12.3) days, compared to 8.1 (7.8C8.5) days in non-survivors. Averaged over final outcomes, median length of stay in hospital decreased from 21.4 (20.5C22.8) days in February to 5.2 (4.7C5.8) days in June.

Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein. Previously, we identified that the domain immediately downstream of the S2 cleavage site is the bona fide FP (amino acids 798C835) for SARS-1 using ESR spectroscopy technology. We also found that the SARS-1 FP induces membrane ordering in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion. In this study, we want to know which residues are involved in this Ca(2+) binding, to build a topological model and to understand the role of the Ca2+. We performed a systematic mutation study on the negatively charged residues on the SARS-1 FP. While all six negatively charged residues contributes to the membrane ordering activity of the FP to some extent, D812 is the most important residue. We provided a topological model of how the FP binds Ca(2+) ions: both FP1 and FP2 bind one Ca(2+) ion, and there are two binding sites in FP1 and three in FP2. We also found that the corresponding residue D830 in the SARS-2 FP plays a similar critical role. ITC experiments show that the binding energies between the FP and Ca(2+) as well as between the FP and membranes also decreases for all mutants. The binding of Ca(2+), the folding of FP and the ordering activity correlated very well across the mutants, suggesting that the function of the Ca(2+) is to help to folding of FP in membranes to enhance its activity. Using a novel pseudotyped virus particle (PP)-liposome methodology, we monitored the membrane ordering induced by the FPs in the whole S proteins in its trimer form in real time. We found that the SARS-1 and SARS-2 PPs also induce membrane ordering as the separate FPs do, and the mutations of the negatively charged residues also greatly reduce the membrane ordering activity. However, the difference in kinetic between the PP and FP indicates a possible role of FP trimerization. This finding could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca(2+) channel to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Critical Negatively Charged Residues Are Important for the Activity of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Fusion Peptides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic highlights the urgent need for increased support related to mental health concerns.

Oral janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) represent a novel therapeutic class of targeted therapy to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: To review the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of oral JAKi in the treatment of AD. Methods: A PRISMA systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE (Ovid), and PubMed databases for studies assessing the efficacy, safety, and/or pharmacokinetic properties of oral forms of JAKi in the treatment of AD in pediatric or adult populations from inception to June 2021. Results: 496 papers were reviewed. Of 28 articles that underwent full text screening, 11 met our inclusion criteria for final qualitative review. Four studies examined abrocitinib; three studies examined baricitinib; three examined upadacitinib and one examined gusacitinib (ASN002). Significant clinical efficacy and a reassuring safety profile was reported for all JAKi agents reviewed. Rapid symptom control was reported for abrocitinib, baricitinib and upadacitinib. Limitations: Given the relatively limited evidence for each JAKi and the differences in patient eligibility criteria between studies, the data was not deemed suitable for a meta-analysis at this time. Conclusion: Given their ability to achieve rapid symptom control with a reassuring safety profile, we recommend considering the use of JAKi as a reliable systemic treatment option for adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD, who are unresponsive to topical or skin directed treatments.","output":"Systematic Review on the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Janus Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concerns have arisen that pre-existing immunity to dengue virus (DENV) could enhance Zika virus (ZIKV) disease, due to the homology between ZIKV and DENV and the observation of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) among DENV serotypes.

Here we show that macaques with a prior DENV-2 exposure had a higher burden of ZIKV vRNA in maternal-fetal interface tissues as compared to DENV-naive macaques. However, pre-existing DENV immunity had no detectable impact on ZIKV replication kinetics in maternal plasma, and all pregnancies progressed to term without adverse outcomes or gross fetal abnormalities detectable at delivery. Understanding the risks of ADE to pregnant women worldwide is critical as vaccines against DENV and ZIKV are developed and licensed and as DENV and ZIKV continue to circulate.","output":"Previous exposure to dengue virus is associated with increased Zika virus burden at the maternal-fetal interface in rhesus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biggest challenge of today's world is to adjust to the rapidly changing environment brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, where uncertainty and unpredictability have become the norm.

METHODS Orthopaedic surgeons nationwide were invited through email and text messages to answer an online self-administered questionnaire collecting demographic information, COVID-19 exposure experience, perception of risk, and impact on orthopaedic practice. RESULTS Of the respondents, 4.7% and 14.0% were involved in frontline treatment for COVID-19 patients with non-orthopaedic and orthopaedic problem, respectively. Respondents working in Ministry of Health had highest percentage of involvement as frontliner, 7.8% (8/103) and 20.4% (21/103) for non-orthopaedic and orthopaedic related COVID-19 treatment, respectively (not significant). Their main concern was an infection of family members (125/235, 53.2%). Majority of respondents were still working (223/235, 94.9%), running outpatient clinics (168/223, 75.3%), and continued with their semi-emergency (190/223, 85.2%) and emergency surgeries (213/223, 95.5%). Of the surgeons, 11.2% (25/223) did not screen their patients for COVID-19 prior to elective surgeries, 30.9% (69/223) did not have any training on proper handling of personal protective equipment (PPE), 84.8% (189/223) make decision to manage more conservatively due to COVID-19 and 61.9% (138/223) had their income affected. Of the surgeons, 19.3% (43/223) started using telehealth facilities. CONCLUSION Direct exposure to treatment of COVID-19 patients among the respondent is low and the main concern was infecting their family member.

The implementation of the restrictions affects free movement, leading to limited physical activity (PA) level. The main aim of the study was to determine the level of PA of university students in Slovakia during COVID-19 pandemics. Material and Methods The sample consisted of 3128 university students. Data was obtained from students from three universities with different specializations. A questionnaire about lifestyle with questions about physical activity was used. The questionnaire was distributed using online communication systems of universities. The online questionnaire was answered by 3128 students. Results Analyzed data were obtained from 3128 students. The results indicate that 38% of all students exercise 3-4 times per week, while 41% exercise 1-2 times per week, and 21% do not exercise at all, or exercise 1-2 times per month. Found weak positive correlation (r=0,337) was between the exercise frequency and perception of well-being, and a very weak positive correlation (r=0,187) between the exercise frequency and stress intensity. A moderate positive correlation was found between the perception of health and life energy (r=0,579). A moderate positive correlation was observed between the perception of health and physical strength (r=0,579).

We expect a rise of a massive group of 'lonely' consumers who are deeply entrenched in the social isolation caused by COVID-19. There is an urgent need to revisit the phenomenon of lonely consumers to better prepare academic researchers, public policy makers and commercial managers in the post-COVID-19 era. Thus, this study conducts a synthesised review on past studies of lonely consumers. Based on an inductive analysis of 56 articles, 74 key themes are identified. These key themes are further categorised into five major clusters by way of a co-occurrence network analysis. Respectively, the five clusters address the psychological implications related to the dynamics between nonhuman attachment and consumers' loneliness, the commercial implications related to the paradoxical motivations of affiliation and self-affirmation in product selection and the dual information processing mechanism in response to advertisement appeals, and the social implications related to consumers' well-being in an ageing society and the anthropomorphic companionship in a virtual world.

This can hamper timely decision-making during outbreak response. Identifying available tools and assessing their functions in the context of outbreak response would support appropriate selection and use, and likely more timely data-driven decision-making during outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and a stakeholder survey of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and other partners to identify and describe the use of, and technical characteristics of, electronic data tools used for outbreak response in low- and middle-income countries. Databases included were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science and CINAHL with publications related to tools for outbreak response included from January 2010CMay 2020. Software tool websites of identified tools were also reviewed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and counts, and proportions of data obtained from the review or stakeholder survey were calculated. RESULTS: We identified 75 electronic tools including for data collection (33/75), management (13/75) and analysis (49/75) based on data from the review and survey. Twenty-eight tools integrated all three functionalities upon collection of additional information from the tool developer websites. The majority were open source, capable of offline data collection and data visualisation. EpiInfo, KoBoCollect and Open Data Kit had the broadest use, including for health promotion, infection prevention and control, and surveillance data capture. Survey participants highlighted harmonisation of data tools as a key challenge in outbreaks and the need for preparedness through training front-line responders on data tools. In partnership with the Global Health Network, we created an online interactive decision-making tool using data derived from the survey and review. CONCLUSIONS: Many electronic tools are available for data -collection, ?management and -analysis in outbreak response, but appropriate tool selection depends on knowledge of tools functionalities and capabilities. The online decision-making tool created to assist selection of the most appropriate tool(s) for outbreak response helps by matching requirements with functionality. Applying the tool together with harmonisation of data formats, and training of front-line responders outside of epidemic periods can support more timely data-driven decision making in outbreaks.

METHODS We used a two-part modified Delphi process to identify and rank factors relating to the consultation process across the different stages of setting up a new research network. RESULTS Research priorities for the new research network remained the same following consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. Broad networking and the establishment of a nationally recognised preparedness research network were clearly identified as the consultation's key strengths. The need for ongoing management of diverse expectations, particularly between researchers and public health practitioners, are clear challenges. Clarity on the distinct roles of researchers and decision makers are necessary to integrate research into a translational pathway. Researcher expectations for investigator-driven detailed inquiry must be balanced with expectations of routine public health activities and decision making. CONCLUSIONS Consultation had a clear benefit for the development of a complex public health network with a focus on policy translation.

METHODS: During 1 to 23 October 2020, we recruited a population-based sample of children presenting for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Each child provided paired nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR N, E and RdRp gene detection. RESULTS: Paired NP swab and saliva samples were obtained from 476 children with mean  standard deviation age of 10.8  3.9 years, and 58.2% were male (277/476). Nine participants were sampled twice, so 485 pairs of NP swab/saliva were tested. Virus detection in at least one specimen type was reported in 17.9% (87/485), with similar detection in NP swab (16.7%, 81/485) and saliva (15.9%, 77/485).

The pandemic has changed how individuals live and work, and in particular, frontline healthcare professionals have been exposed to alarming levels of stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the professional and personal effects of COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons working in the UK National Health Service (NHS). SETTING: Surgical departments in the NHS. DESIGN: Between May and July 2020, as part of an ongoing study, we asked surgeons two open-ended questions: 'What challenges are the COVID-19 crisis currently presenting to you in your work and home life?' and 'How is this stress affecting you personally?' Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data. Responses to the second question were also categorised into four groups reflecting valence: positive, neutral, mildly negative and strongly negative. RESULTS: A total of 141 surgeons responded to the survey and the results indicated that 85.8% reported that they were generally negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 7.8% were strongly affected in a negative way. Qualitative thematic analysis identified four key themes from responses relating to the impact of the pandemic: (1) changing and challenging work environment as a result of COVID-19; (2) challenges to professional life and development; (3) management of change and loss in the respondents' personal lives; (4) emotional and psychological impacts. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the substantial emotional and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons' mental health, particularly in relation to fear and anxiety, loss of motivation, low mood, stress and burnout.

METHODS: An electronic, self-administered questionnaire was sent to all hospital staff over 6 weeks surveying exposure to COVID-19 patients and degree of stress caused by this exposure. Responses from medical providers and nurses were analyzed for significant contributors to stress levels, as well as comparing responses from medical providers versus nurses. RESULTS: Stress levels from increased risk of disease contraction while on the job, fear of transmitting it to family or friends, and the resulting social stigma were highest in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with medical providers, nurses had nearly 4 times the odds of considering job resignation due to COVID-19. However, most health care workers (77.4% of medical providers and 52.9% of nurses) strongly agreed or agreed with the statements indicating high levels of altruism in their desire to treat COVID-19 patients.

Background: While at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the need for intensive care is increasing, the specific care needs of patients are still largely unknown. This is a challenge for the work of intensive care staff. AIM: The aim of the study is to understand how intensive care nurses perceive their working conditions and the consequences for patient care. METHODS: The study is a qualitative survey. Using a web-based questionnaire, narratives of n = 902 nurses were collected. This article reports the perceptions of n = 397 intensive care nurses. The evaluation is based on the qualitative content analysis according to 18-2Mayring (2015). RESULTS: The analysis of the data shows the following six categories: \\"The lack of staff is extremely noticeable\\" to \\"Waiting for something\\", \\"struggle for PPE (personal protective equipment)\\", \\"time to learn\\", \\"considerable discrepancy\\" in patient care, \\"attempts to compensate\\" and \\"constantly a bad feeling\\". The tension between the lack of knowledge and information on the one hand and the professional demand to do justice to the seriously ill and their relatives on the other hand, brings nurses to their professional limits. CONCLUSION: Conditions for ethical decision making have to be developed and concepts for a clear attribution of autonomy and responsibility for intensive care nurses must be introduced.","output":"Wahrnehmungen von Pflegenden im Bereich der Intensivpflege w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has raised the issue of its compatibility with breastfeeding.

We aimed to update the evidence of qigong on blood pressure reduction after taking into consideration the risks of random error and reliability of data in the cumulative meta-analysis using trial sequential analysis (TSA). METHODS: Included trials were assessed using Cochrane risk of bias instrument. We performed meta-analysis with random-effects model and random errors were evaluated with TSA. We performed the search for the eligible randomized controlled trial (RCT) through Medline, Cinahl, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and also PubMed. RESULTS: A total of 370 subjects sourced from seven eligible RCTs were entered into the analysis. The pooled results demonstrated the significant reduction with the use of qigong of the systolic blood pressure [weighted mean difference (WMD), ? 10.66 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) = ? 17.69,-3.62, p < 0.001] and diastolic BP [WMD, ? 6.76 mmHg, 95% CI = ? 12.22, ? 1.30, p < 0.001] as compared to the control group.

It is suspected that after violent events occur, EVD transmission will increase; however, empirical studies to understand the impact of violence on transmission are lacking. Here, we use spatial and temporal trends of EVD case counts to compare transmission rates between health zones that have versus have not experienced recent violent events during the outbreak. METHODS: We collected daily EVD case counts from DRC Ministry of Health. A time-varying indicator of recent violence in each health zone was derived from events documented in the WHO situation reports. We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate the reproduction number R for each case by day per zone in the 2018C2019 outbreak. We fit an exponentially decaying curve to estimates of R overall and by health zone, for comparison to past outbreaks. RESULTS: As of 16 April 2019, the mean overall R for the entire outbreak was 1.11. We found evidence of an increase in the estimated transmission rates in health zones with recently reported violent events versus those without (p = 0.008). The average R was estimated as between 0.61 and 0.86 in regions not affected by recent violent events, and between 1.01 and 1.07 in zones affected by violent events within the last 21 days, leading to an increase in R between 0.17 and 0.53. Within zones with recent violent events, the mean estimated quenching rate was lower than for all past outbreaks except the 2013C2016 West African outbreak. CONCLUSION: The difference in the estimated transmission rates between zones affected by recent violent events suggests that violent events are contributing to increased transmission and the ongoing nature of this outbreak.","output":"Estimating the impact of violent events on transmission in Ebola virus disease outbreak, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2018C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are serious fractures for the elderly.

We developed risk prediction models to identify patients with low risk for COVID-19 from this cohort of hospitalised patients with acute respiratory symptoms. METHODS This was a single-centre retrospective observational study. Patients admitted to our institution's respiratory surveillance wards from 10 February to 30 April 2020 contributed data for analysis. Prediction models for COVID-19 were derived from a training cohort using variables based on demographics, clinical symptoms, exposure risks and blood investigations fitted into logistic regression models. The derived prediction models were subsequently validated on a test cohort. RESULTS Of the 1,228 patients analysed, 52 (4.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Two prediction models were derived, the first based on age, presence of sore throat, dormitory residence, blood haemoglobin level (Hb), and total white blood cell counts (TW), and the second based on presence of headache, contact with infective patients, Hb and TW. Both models had good diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934 and 0.866, respectively. Risk score cut-offs of 0.6 for Model 1 and 0.2 for Model 2 had 100% sensitivity, allowing identification of patients with low risk for COVID-19. Limiting COVID-19 screening to only elevated-risk patients reduced the number of isolation days for surveillance patients by up to 41.7% and COVID-19 swab testing by up to 41.0%.

However, despite the dozens of clinical trials started, few topically applied liposomal systems have been authorized both in the EU and the USA.

The World Health Organization (WHO) set a goal for 35 countries to eliminate malaria by 2030, with an intermediate milestone of 10 countries by 2020. In 2017, the WHO established the Elimination-2020 (E-2020) initiative to help countries achieve their malaria elimination goals and included 21 countries with the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. METHODS: Across its three levels of activity (country, region and global), the WHO developed normative and implementation guidance on strategies and activities to eliminate malaria; provided technical support and subnational operational assistance; convened national malaria programme managers at three global meetings to share innovations and best practices; advised countries on strengthening their strategy to prevent re-establishment and preparing for WHO malaria certification; and contributed to maintaining momentum towards elimination through periodic evaluations, monitoring and oversight of progress in the E-2020 countries. Changes in the number of indigenous cases in E-2020 countries between 2016 and 2020 are reported, along with the number of countries that eliminated malaria and received WHO certification. RESULTS: The median number of indigenous cases in the E-2020 countries declined from 165.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 14.25C563.75) in 2016 to 78 (IQR 0C356) in 2020; 12 (57%) countries reported reductions in indigenous cases over that period, of which 7 (33%) interrupted malaria transmission and maintained a malaria-free status through 2020 and 4 (19%) were certified malaria-free by the WHO. Two countries experienced outbreaks of malaria in 2020 and 2021 attributed, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although the E-2020 countries contributed to the achievement of the 2020 global elimination milestone, the initiative highlights the difficulties countries face to interrupt malaria transmission, even when numbers of cases are very low.

However, a large amount of external electron donors is often required, causing great cost and environmental impact. Therefore, in this study, a two-stage technology was developed and to produce MCFAs from carbohydrate-rich wastewater without external electron donor addition, with the biofilm development and pH impact being explored. Stage I aimed at converting organics into ethanol and a yeast biofilm reactor is innovatively applied. The results showed that the yeast biofilm could quickly form on carriers with steady-state thickness reaching 50-200a?m. However, the attachment of yeast biofilm was weak at the initial stage so that the violent turbulence should be avoided during operation. The polyurethane foam was the most suitable for yeast biofilm development among the tested carriers, as evidenced by the highest ethanol production, accounting for 74.2% of soluble organics. The Nakaseomyces was the main fungal genus in the steady-state biofilm, while lactic acid bacteria were also developed, resulting in lactate and acetate production. In Stage II, the yeast biofilm reactor effluent was applied for MCFA production at different pH (5-8). However, the MCFA production selectivity was significantly affected by pH, with 65.2% at pH of 5 but decreasing substantially to 3.0% at pH of 8. Both the microbial and electron transfer efficiency analysis suggested that mildly acidic pH can promote the electron transfer from ethanol toward the chain elongation process instead of its excessive oxidation. Thus, if conditions of online extraction or microbial tolerance permit, a lower pH should be recommended for Stage II in the developed technology as well as other ethanol-based MCFA production process. This is a conceptual study that eliminated external electron donor addition in MCFAs production and provide a sustainable and reliable way in carbon resources recovery.","output":"Medium-chain fatty acids production from carbohydrates-rich wastewater through two-stage yeast biofilm processes without external electron donor addition: Biofilm development and pH impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In December 2019, we ran Pacific Eclipse, a pandemic tabletop exercise using smallpox originating in Fiji as a case study. Pacific Eclipse brought together international stakeholders from health, defence, law enforcement, emergency management and a range of other organisations. AIM To review potential gaps in preparedness and identify modifiable factors which could prevent a pandemic or mitigate the impact of a pandemic. METHODS Pacific Eclipse was held on December 9-10 in Washington DC, Phoenix and Honolulu simultaneously. The scenario began in Fiji and becomes a pandemic. Mathematical modelling of smallpox transmission was used to simulate the epidemic under different conditions and to test the effect of interventions. Live polling, using Poll Everywhere software that participants downloaded onto their smart phones, was used to gather participant decisions as the scenario unfolded. Stakeholders from state and federal government and non-government organisations from The United States, The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, as well as industry and non-government organisations attended. RESULTS The scenario progressed in three phases and participants were able to make decisions during each phase using live polling. The polling showed very diverse and sometimes conflicting decision making. Factors influential to pandemic severity were identified and categorised as modifiable or unmodifiable. A series of recommendations were made on the modifiable determinants of pandemic severity and how these can be incorporated into pandemic planning. These included preventing an attack through intelligence, law enforcement and legislation, improved speed of diagnosis, speed and completeness of case finding and case isolation, speed and security of vaccination response (including stockpiling), speed and completeness of contact tracing, protecting critical infrastructure and business continuity, non-pharmaceutical interventions (social distancing, PPE, border control) and protecting first responders. DISCUSSION Pacific Eclipse illustrated the impact of a pandemic of smallpox under different response scenarios, which were validated to some extent by the COVID-19 pandemic.

If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. CONCLUSIONS: Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","output":"People experiencing homelessness: Their potential exposure to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased staffing needs in emergency departments. The question quickly arose as to whether it was appropriate to offer medical students the opportunity to assist this staff. The dilemma stems in part from the potential impact on their psychological well-being as well as their academic and clinical performances. We sought to determine the level of anxiety of medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, and whether it was higher among the students who chose to return to the clinical setting, especially in first-line units (i.e., emergency departments and resuscitation units). In May 2020, 1180/1502 (78.5%) undergraduate medical students at Strasbourg Medical School (France) completed a questionnaire assessing their anxiety and clinical experience. A 2018 cohort of undergraduate medical students served as the baseline. The 2020 COVID cohort had higher rates of anxiety than the 2018 cohort. This difference was specifically observed in the students who chose not to return to the clinical setting during the crisis (N = 684, 59%). At linear regression, the main factors associated with anxiety were gender (p < 0.005) and perceived clinical activity personal conditions (p < 0.001). Employment site, including COVID first-line units, was not correlated with anxiety. Working in the clinical setting during the COVID-19 outbreak is not a risk factor for anxiety in medical students. Instead, it is an active coping strategy, suggesting that there are no barriers to allowing students to return to clinical settings during a pandemic, including first-line units, in terms of their psychological well-being.","output":"And if we had to do it all over again, would we send medical students to the emergency departments during a pandemic?

We introduce single-wavelength imaging biosensors capable of reconstructing spectral shift information induced by biomarkers dynamically using an advanced data processing technique based on an optimal linear estimator. Our method achieves superior sensitivity without wavelength scanning or spectroscopy instruments. We engineered diatomic dielectric metasurfaces supporting bound states in the continuum that allows high-quality resonances with accessible near-fields by in-plane symmetry breaking. The large-area metasurface chips are configured as microarrays and integrated with microfluidics on an imaging platform for real-time detection of breast cancer extracellular vesicles encompassing exosomes. The optofluidic system has high sensing performance with nearly 70 1/RIU figure-of-merit enabling detection of on average 0.41 nanoparticle/m(2) and real-time measurements of extracellular vesicles binding from down to 204 femtomolar solutions.

There is an increasing body of long-term results challenging resection and proving lower morbidities and costs. The aim of this paper is to share the experiences from a high-volume centre in introducing computer assisted targeting solutions and efficient ablation modalities like microwave generators and irreversible electroporation. Material and methods One thousand consecutive treatments in one high-volume centre were evaluated retrospectively from prospectively collected data. Results The purpose of this paper is to present the benefits of going into computer assisted targeting techniques and microwave technology; pitfalls and overview of outcomes. The main target organ was the liver and the main indications were ablation of hepatocellular carcinomas and colorectal liver metastases. With the assistance of computer assisted targeting the local recurrence rate within 6 months has dropped from 30 to near 10%. The survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal liver metastases is not worse if the tumour can be retreated after a local recurrence. Multiple colorectal liver metastases can be treated successfully. Discussion The incorporation of computer assisted targeting technologies for ultrasound-, ct guided- and laparoscopic tumour ablation has been very successful and without a noticeable learning curve. The same is true for switching from radiofrequency energies to microwave generators and irreversible electroporation.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been associated with different cancers. The polarization of macrophages towards the M2 (alternatively activated) phenotype promotes immunologic tolerance and can induce gastric tumorigenesis. Thus far, lncRNAs have been shown to modulate the differentiation of immune cells. Here, we investigated the biological effects of LINC00665 on the progression of GC and explored the mechanisms underlying its ability to mediate the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype. We report that the levels of LINC00665 were increased in GC tissues. Furthermore, this increase in LINC00665 expression could be associated with decreased overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and post-progression survival (PPS). Using cell-based macrophage polarization models, we demonstrated that LINC00665 upregulation in GC cells facilitated the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 but not M1 (classically activated) phenotype. Furthermore, the loss of LINC00665 prevented the M2 polarization of macrophages. Mechanically, we identified that Wnt1 was the downstream target of LINC00665. Additionally, LINC00665 could directly interact with the transcription factor BTB domain and CNC homology 1 (BACH1). The interaction between LINC00665 and BACH1 resulted in the activation and binding of BACH1 to the Wnt1 promoters. Furthermore, BACH1 silencing could inhibit GC progression, which highlighted a crucial role for BACH1 in LINC00665-mediated Wnt1 activation. In addition, genetic Wnt1 overexpression effectively abolished the repression of Wnt signaling after BACH1 depletion and mediated GC development by supporting M2 macrophage polarization. In conclusion, we report that LINC00665 modulates M2 macrophage polarization and suggest that it may facilitate macrophage-dependent GC progression.","output":"LINC00665 interacts with BACH1 to activate Wnt1 and mediates the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages in GC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a 2-family cluster of persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the city of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China, during January 2020.

Cybervictimization is associated with multiple negative consequences, including depressed mood. Few validated, easily disseminated interventions exist to prevent cybervictimization and its consequences. With over 97% of adolescents using social media (such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat), recruiting and delivering a prevention intervention through social media and apps may improve accessibility of prevention tools for at-risk youth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of and obtain preliminary outcome data on IMPACT (Intervention Media to Prevent Adolescent Cyber-Conflict Through Technology), a brief, remote app-based intervention to prevent and reduce the effect of cyberbullying. METHODS: From January 30, 2020, to May 3, 2020, a national sample of 80 adolescents with a history of past-year cybervictimization was recruited through Instagram for a randomized control trial of IMPACT, a brief, remote research assistantCled intervention and a fully automated app-based program, versus enhanced web-based resources (control). Feasibility and acceptability were measured by consent, daily use, and validated surveys. Although not powered for efficacy, outcomes (victimization, bystander self-efficacy, and well-being) were measured using validated measures at 8 and 16 weeks and evaluated using a series of longitudinal mixed models. RESULTS: Regarding feasibility, 24.5% (121/494) of eligible participants provided contact information; of these, 69.4% (84/121) completed full enrollment procedures. Of the participants enrolled, 45% (36/80) were randomized into the IMPACT intervention and 55% (44/80) into the enhanced web-based resources groups. All participants randomized to the intervention condition completed the remote intervention session, and 89% (77/80) of the daily prompts were answered. The retention rate was 99% (79/80) at 8 weeks and 96% (77/80) at 16 weeks for all participants. Regarding acceptability, 100% (36/36) of the intervention participants were at least moderately satisfied with IMPACT overall, and 92% (33/36) of the participants were at least moderately satisfied with the app. At both 8 and 16 weeks, well-being was significantly higher (=1.17, SE 0.87, P=.02 at 8 weeks and =3.24, SE 0.95, P<.001 at 16 weeks) and psychological stress was lower (=?.66, SE 0.08, P=.04 at 8 weeks and =?.89, SE 0.09, P<.001 at 16 weeks) among IMPACT users than among control group users. Participants in the intervention group attempted significantly more bystander interventions than those in the control group at 8 weeks (=.82, SE 0.42; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This remote app-based intervention for victims of cyberbullying was feasible and acceptable, increased overall well-being and bystander interventions, and decreased psychological stress. Our findings are especially noteworthy given that the trial took place during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Studies have been conducted in Italy and some European countries to highlight the role that quarantine has played in determining the lifestyle changes both in eating habits and physical activity and their possible correlation with increase in weight. The selection criteria involved answering a questionnaire that included information on the weight status and at least one of the other two aspects: changes in eating habits and/or physical activity during the quarantine period. The results obtained indicate, in general, that the negative effect of quarantine was on eating habits and physical activity.

Since then, a total of 120 consecutive patients who underwent uniportal VATS lobectomy were retrospectively enrolled. Surgical videos were reviewed to determine the operation time, to which cumulative sum (CUMSUM) method was applied to evaluate the learning phases of the procedure. Accordingly, patients' clinical features in different phases were collected and compared to determine the learning curve for uniportal VATS lobectomy. Results Among the 120 consecutive patients reviewed from October 2013 to September 2014, the CUMSUM curve showed its inflection at patient number 44: the first 30 patients were in the ascending phase, the second 30 patients were in the plateau phase, and the remaining patients were in the descending phase. Comparable CUMSUM results were recorded both from upper and not-upper lobectomy. Intra-operatively, more repeated stapler attempts (73% versus 13% and 5%, P<0.001) and higher conversion rate (17% versus 7% and 2%, P=0.028) were recorded in ascending phase vs. the plateau phase and descending phase, respectively. Post-operatively, the morbidity, mortality and the length of hospital stay were similar before and after the learning curve cases. Conclusions In a center with conventional VATS experience, the learning period of uniportal VATS lobectomy was characterized by repeated stapler attempts, and the volume requirements would be approximately 30 cases to reach the performance plateau. Upper lobectomy seemed not more difficult to learn than lower or middle lobectomy in uniportal VATS.","output":"Learning curve for uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy-results from 120 consecutive patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS) supports social and reproductive behavior through the sensation of environmental chemosignals. A growing number of excreted steroids have been shown to be potent AOS cues, including bile acids (BAs) found in feces. As is still the case with most AOS ligands, the specific receptors used by vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) to detect BAs remain unknown. To identify VSN BA receptors, we first performed a deep analysis of VSN BA tuning using volumetric GCaMP6f/s Ca2+ imaging. These experiments revealed multiple populations of BA-receptive VSNs with submicromolar sensitivities. We then developed a new physiology-forward approach for identifying AOS ligand-receptor interactions, which we call Fluorescence Live Imaging for Cell Capture and RNA sequencing, or FLICCR-seq. FLICCR-seq analysis revealed five specific V1R family receptors enriched in BA-sensitive VSNs. These studies introduce a powerful new approach for ligand-receptor matching and reveal biological mechanisms underlying mammalian BA chemosensation.","output":"Physiology-forward identification of bile acid-sensitive vomeronasal receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in large-scale school closures in an effort to reduce the spread of disease.

METHODS The study participants were 677 employed men and women who were followed up for 3 to 5 years (mean = 3.6 years) for the onset of diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Burnout was assessed by the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure with its three subscales: emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness. RESULTS The burnout symptoms were remarkably consistent over the follow-up period irrespective of changes in place of work and in employment status. During the follow-up period, 17 workers developed type 2 diabetes. Logistic regression results indicated that burnout was associated with a 1.84-fold increased risk of diabetes (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-2.85) even after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, leisure time physical activity, initial job category, and follow-up duration. In a subsample of 507 workers, the relative risk of diabetes was found to be much higher after additional control for blood pressure levels (odds ratio = 4.32, 95% CI = 1.75-10.67), available only for this subsample.

This study presents an analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak that occurred in a taekwondo gym in Korea, predominantly among children and adolescents, with the aim of providing insights on managing COVID-19 outbreaks in similar facilities. METHODS: All 108 taekwondo gym students and staff received COVID-19 tests. A survey and closed-circuit television analyses were used to identify risk factors. A univariate analysis was conducted, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis with backward elimination for variables with a significance level <0.10 in the univariate analysis. RESULTS: COVID-19 was confirmed in 30 of 108 subjects at the taekwondo gym (attack rate, 27.8%). The outbreak started in an adult class student. This student transmitted the virus to the staff, who consequently transmitted the virus to adolescent students. In the univariate analysis, the relative risk for younger age (9 years) was 2.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01C4.54; p=0.054), and that for food consumption inside the gym was 2.12 (95% CI, 1.04C4.30; p=0.048). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for younger age was 2.96 (95% CI, 1.07C8.20; p=0.036), and that for food consumption inside the gym was 3.00 (95% CI, 1.10C8.17; p=0.032). CONCLUSION: Food consumption inside the facility and young age were significant risk factors for COVID-19 transmission in this taekwondo gym.

In Spain, the heterogeneous distribution of the virus infection and the different health strategies have conditioned the morbidity and fatality rate. The aim of this study was to analyse the lethality of the infection by sex and age range in the Autonomous Communities (AC) of Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To perform the analysis, data were extracted from the Ministry of Health, Regional and Public Health Departments of the different AC. The infected population was estimated from the results of the ENE-COVID19 and the population registered on 1 January 2020 (INE) for the validity of the IgG antibody test with 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The case fatality rate (TL) (deaths/1000 estimated infected) by sex and age (<20years, 20-64 and &#8805;65years) was calculated for each AC. The standardized case fatality ratio (REL) was calculated by the exact method (EPIDAT). RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain was 6% (range, 1.4% [Ceuta] -14.1% [Community of Madrid]). The TL in Spain was 9,6/1000, ranged per AC from 1/1000 in Melilla to 26.6/1000 in La Rioja, with no correlation between case fatality and prevalence of infection. The TL was higher in men (10.2/1000, ratio 1.17 with respect to women), except in Catalu?a (ratio 0.92), and especially high in those over 64years of age in La Rioja (143.5/1000), Asturias (69.2/1000) and Basque Country (46.6/1000). Overall excess REL was found to be over 30% in La Rioja (2.91; 95%CI: 2.36-3.57), Asturias (1.51; 95%CI: 1.27-1.80), Basque Country (1.42; 95%CI: 1.31-1.54) and Extremadura (1.37; 95%CI: 1.20-1.57) and in those over 64 years in Madrid and the Canary Islands. CONCLUSIONS: SARs-CoV-2 virus infection has been very unevenly distributed in the different ACs, with notably differences in TL between ACs, particularly high in La Rioja, Asturias and the Basque Country. Is important to study the excess in TL the population over 64years of age in the ACs of Madrid and the Canary Islands.","output":"Anlisis de las tasas de letalidad de la infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en las comunidades autnomas de Espa?a./ [Analysis of fatality rates case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Autonomous Communities of Spain]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The shock associated with the outbreak of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic affected the lives of everyoneand religious communities were no exception.

However, the last stage of distribution is quite challenging, especially for rural or suburban areas, where local towns, pharmacy chains and hospitals may not have the infrastructure required to store the vaccine at the required temperature. In addition, there is limited data available to address ancillary challenges of the distribution framework for both transportation and storage stages, including safety concerns due to human exposure to large amounts of CO(2) from dry-ice sublimation, issues due to the pressure increase caused by dry-ice sublimation, and the potential issue caused by non-uniform cryogenic temperatures.

The results revealed that CaCl2 significantly enhanced the particle size, interfacial layer thickness, apparent viscosity, and viscoelastic behavior of filled hydrogels and decreased their light and whiteness values (p < 0.05). This phenomenon was mainly attributed to the strong binding ability between Ca2+ and protein/pectin mixtures, which were present in the interfacial area or aqueous phase, as verified by cryo-scanning electron microscopy results. Moreover, lower levels of CaCl2 (2 or 4 mM) significantly enhanced the oxidative stability of filled hydrogels (p < 0.05), particularly at a concentration of 4 mM. However, a higher level of CaCl2 (6 or 8 mM) resulted in an electrostatic shielding effect, which resulted in the aggregation of multiple droplets and the flocculation of the filled hydrogels, which negatively affected the oxidative stability of filled hydrogels. The findings of this study indicated that appropriate Ca2+ levels (4 mM) improved the physical and oxidative stability of filled hydrogel, and this finding may provide useful insights for the development of effective delivery systems for specific applications.","output":"Effects of the Incorporation of Calcium Chloride on the Physical and Oxidative Stability of Filled Hydrogel Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common comorbidities among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which may exacerbate complications of this new viral infection. Metformin is an anti-hyperglycemic agent with host-directed immune-modulatory effects, which relieve exaggerated inflammation and reduce lung tissue damage. The current systematic review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the potential mechanism of action and the efficacy of metformin in COVID-19 patients with DM. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science up to July 30, 2020. The following keywords were used: \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"2019-nCoV\\", \\"metformin\\", and \\"antidiabetic drug\\". Results: Fourteen studies were included in our systematic review.

Decreasing insulin resistance, reduction of some inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-&#945;, modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and improving neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio are some of the potential mechanisms of metformin in COVID-19 patients with DM. Nine out of fourteen articles revealed the positive effect of metformin on the prognosis of COVID-19 in diabetic or even non-diabetic patients. Moreover, different studies have shown that metformin is more effective in women than men.

Prior data on seroprevalence have been subject to variations in selection of individuals and nature as well as timing of testing in relation to exposures. Objective: We sought to determine the extent of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalance and the factors associated with seroprevelance across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers. Design: Observational cohort study of healthcare workers, including SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and participant questionaires. Participants: A diverse and unselected population of adults (n=6,062) employed in a multi-site healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County, including individuals with direct patient contact and others with non-patient-oriented work functions. Exposure: Exposure and infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as determined by seropositivity. Main Outcomes: Using Bayesian and multi-variate analyses, we estimated seroprevalence and factors associated with seropositivity and antibody titers, including pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics; potential Covid-19 illness related exposures; and, symptoms consistent with Covid-19 infection. Results: We observed a seroprevalence rate of 4.1%, with anosmia as the most prominently associated self-reported symptom in addition to fever, dry cough, anorexia, and myalgias. After adjusting for potential confounders, pre-existing medical conditions were not associated with antibody positivity. However, seroprevalence was associated with younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, and African-American race, as well as presence of either a personal or household member having a prior diagnosis of Covid-19. Importantly, African American race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with antibody positivity even after adjusting for personal Covid-19 diagnosis status, suggesting the contribution of unmeasured structural or societally factors. Notably, number of people, or children, in the home was not associated with antibody positivity. Conclusion and Relevance: The demographic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among our healthcare workers underscore the importance of exposure sources beyond the workplace. The size and diversity of our study population, combined with robust survey and modeling techniques, provide a vibrant picture of the demographic factors, exposures, and symptoms that can identify individuals with susceptibility as well as potential to mount an immune response to Covid-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Across a Diverse Cohort of Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing prevalence of Internet usage, Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment (IDPT) has become a valuable tool to develop improved treatments of mental disorders. IDPT becomes complicated and labor intensive because of overlapping emotion in mental health. To create a usable learning application for IDPT requires diverse labeled datasets containing an adequate set of linguistic properties to extract word representations and segmentations of emotions. In medical applications, it is challenging to successfully refine such datasets since emotion-aware labeling is time consuming. Other known issues include vocabulary sizes per class, data source, method of creation, and baseline for the human performance level. This paper focuses on the application of personalized mental health interventions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and attention-based in-depth entropy active learning. The objective of this research is to increase the trainable instances using a semantic clustering mechanism. For this purpose, we propose a method based on synonym expansion by semantic vectors. Semantic vectors based on semantic information derived from the context in which it appears are clustered. The resulting similarity metrics help to select the subset of unlabeled text by using semantic information. The proposed method separates unlabeled text and includes it in the next active learning mechanism cycle. Our method updates model training by using the new training points. The cycle continues until it reaches an optimal solution, and it converts all the unlabeled text into the training set. Our in-depth experimental results show that the synonym expansion semantic vectors help enhance training accuracy while not harming the results. The bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture with an attention mechanism achieved 0.85 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC curve) on the blind test set. The learned embedding is then used to visualize the activated word's contribution to each symptom and find the psychiatrist's qualitative agreement.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted assessing ED imaging volumes between March 1, 2020, and May 11, 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis. A rolling 7-day total value was used for volume tracking and comparison. Total imaging utilization in the ED was compared with new COVID-19 cases in our region. Utilization was first categorized by modality and then by plain films and computed tomography (CT) scans grouped by body part. CT imaging of the chest was specifically investigated by assessing both CT chest only exams and CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis (C/A/P) exams. Ultimately, matching pair-wise statistical analysis of exam volumes was performed to assess significance of volume change. RESULTS: Our multicenter health system experienced a 46% drop in imaging utilization (p < 0.0001) during the pandemic. Matching pair-wise analysis showed a statistically significant volume decrease by each modality and body part. The exceptions were non-contrast chest CT, which increased (p = 0.0053), and non-trauma C/A/P CT, which did not show a statistically significant volume change (p = 0.0633).

Many radiation oncology departments have adapted to this by increasing the use of hypo fractionated radiotherapy across multiple tumour sites and indications, including single-fraction Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). A UK expert group has also now recommended a 30-34Gy single fraction treatment for small lung tumours (<2cm) with limited mobility that are >1cm from the chest wall based on two Phase II clinical trials, the RTOG 0915 and the Roswell Park study. In accordance with the new guidance, we reviewed the feasibility of delivery of single-fraction lung SABR across 2 UK radiotherapy centres. Materials and Methods All patients diagnosed with an early lung tumour, fulfilling the UK expert group's single-fraction SABR criteria, were considered eligible for this study. All patients had a pre-treatment 3D cone-beam computer tomography (3DCBCT) scan for position verification, using soft tissue image matching, followed by a post-treatment 3DCBCT to confirm reproducibility and accuracy of the original match, the coverage of the tumour and intrafraction motion. A pre-correction 4DCBCT was used for 1 patient with a lower lobe tumour. Three sets of criteria was used to document and analyse the data: 1) The intra-fraction movements 2) treatment time calculated from when the patient was on the treatment couch to off the couch 3)acute treatment side effects according to CTCAE v5.0. Results Using each department's planning and treatment delivery systems,13 patients, between May 2020 and January 2021, with early stage lung cancer (T1a-T1b) were found to be treated with 34Gy single-fraction SABR. A review of the data found that in the data set, across all patient data, there was limited intra-fraction movement with sub-millimetre corrections in any axis;pre-treatment corrections were: -0.14+/-0.26, 0.16+/- 0.41 and 0.03+/-0.35 mm (mean+/-SD) for vertical, long and lateral axis respectively. While corresponding post-treatment corrections were -0.04+/-0.21, 0.10+/-0.23 and -0.04+/-0.10 mm. Within the 3 months follow-up period, no patients experienced any acute Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events. 4 patients (31%) had grade 1 fatigue, 2 patients (15%) had grade 1 cough, 2 patients (15%) had grade 1 dyspnoea and 2 patients (15%) had grade 2 pneumonitis which improved with steroid treatment. The latter 2 patients had corresponding extensive fibrotic consolidative changes at the treatment site evident on the post-treatment CT scan 2-3 months after therapy. Conclusion Our experience with the 34Gy single-fraction SABR to early lung cancers has shown that there is relatively little intra-fraction movement, it requires limited clinician support, it is fast to deliver and it is generally well tolerated. This hypo fractionated schedule is therefore an attractive and convenient treatment option for appropriately selected lung cancer patients.","output":"Two Centre Feasibility study of single fraction lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 lacks sentience and can only be spread through human behaviour. Government instructions to the general public include: (a) limiting time spent outside the home, (b) staying more than 1 m away from people outside the household at all times, and (c) maintaining hand hygiene. Current evidence suggests high rates of adherence to such instructions, but interventions to sustain adherence to government instructions in the long term can only be developed if we know why people do or do not adhere to them. The aims were to assess levels of public adherence to government instructions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but more importantly to gauge why people were or were not adhering to instructions. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 2252 adults who were representative of the UK population. Data were analysed descriptively, and using one-sample t-tests, within-participants ANOVA and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The sample reported mostly adhering to UK government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with 5% or fewer people reporting active resistance to instructions. People generally reported high levels of capability, opportunity and motivation to follow the instructions, but perceived relatively few physical and social opportunities. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that better adherence was associated with older age, being a woman, having a white ethnic background, and with perceiving greater levels of capabilities, opportunities and motivations. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions targeted at people with black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, men and younger people that focus on increasing capabilities, providing greater opportunities and boosting motivations are needed to support continued adherence to government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further research is required to track changes in people's capabilities, opportunities, motivations and behaviours in response to the ongoing emergency, any changes in government instructions, and to adapt the present procedures to other emergency situations.","output":"Identifying targets for interventions to support public adherence to government instructions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to clarify the characteristics of dysphagia and the incidence of pneumonia in Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients, and to investigate the relationship between the development of pneumonia and the DM1 patient's background, especially concerning swallowing function evaluated by endoscopy. METHODS: The subjects were 88 DM1 patients who underwent swallowing function evaluation. The severity of disease in DM1patients was assessed based on the muscular impairment rating scale (MIRS), and the number of CTG repeats. Patients were divided into two groups; those who developed aspiration pneumonia within two years after swallowing assessment and those who did not develop aspiration pneumonia. Swallowing function was assessed using the food intake level scale (FILS), repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST), the modified water swallowing test (MWST), and the Hyodo score. RESULTS: Onset of pneumonia within two years of assessment was observed in 22 cases (25%). Age, FILS, and Hyodo score were significantly different between pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups. There was a significant difference in swallowing function tests such as FILS, RSST, and Hyodo score between males and females. The Hyodo score cutoff value for predicting pneumonia within two years was determined by ROC analysis. A cutoff value of 6 was found to have a sensitivity of 0.545 and a specificity of 0.833 (area under the curve=0.722). CONCLUSION: It is important to evaluate the swallowing function of DM1 patients by endoscopy to prevent aspiration pneumonia. In addition, male patients are more likely to deteriorate in swallowing function and should be carefully monitored.","output":"The characteristics of dysphagia and the incidence of pneumonia in Myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients especially concerning swallowing function evaluated by endoscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the concerns of global data-driven disruption in marketing, this qualitative study explores the issues and challenges, which could unlock the potential of marketing analytics.

However, well-documented disparities persist in the use of digital technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe smartphone and internet use within a diverse sample, to assess the association of smartphone and internet use with markers of health literacy and health access, and to identify the mediating factors in these relationships. METHODS: Surveys were distributed to a targeted sample designed to oversample historically underserved communities from April 2017 to December 2017. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the association of internet and smartphone use with outcomes describing health care access and markers of health literacy for the total cohort and after stratifying by personal history of cancer. Health care access was captured using multiple variables, including the ability to obtain medical care when needed. Markers of health literacy included self-reported confidence in obtaining health information. RESULTS: Of the 2149 participants, 1319 (61.38%) were women, 655 (30.48%) were non-Hispanic White, and 666 (30.99%) were non-Hispanic Black. The median age was 51 years (IQR 38-65). Most respondents reported using the internet (1921/2149, 89.39%) and owning a smartphone (1800/2149, 83.76%). Compared with the respondents with smartphone or internet access, those without smartphone or internet access were more likely to report that a doctor was their most recent source of health information (344/1800, 19.11% vs 116/349, 33.2% for smartphone and 380/1921, 19.78% vs 80/228, 35.1% for internet, respectively; both P<.001). Internet use was associated with having looked for information on health topics from any source (odds ratio [OR] 3.81, 95% CI 2.53-5.75) and confidence in obtaining health information when needed (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.00-3.34) compared with noninternet users. Smartphone owners had lower odds of being unable to obtain needed medical care (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.95) than nonsmartphone owners. Among participants with a prior history of cancer, smartphone ownership was significantly associated with higher odds of confidence in ability to obtain needed health information (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.05-30.23) and lower odds of inability to obtain needed medical care (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.06-0.47), although these associations were not significant among participants without a prior history of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We describe widespread use of digital technologies in a community-based cohort, although disparities persist. In this cohort, smartphone ownership was significantly associated with ability to obtain needed medical care, suggesting that the use of smartphone technology may play a role in increasing health care access. Similarly, major illnesses such as cancer have the potential to amplify health engagement. Finally, special emphasis must be placed on reaching patient populations with limited digital access, so these patients are not further disadvantaged in the new age of telehealth.","output":"Association of Smartphone Ownership and Internet Use With Markers of Health Literacy and Access: Cross-sectional Survey Study of Perspectives From Project PLACE (Population Level Approaches to Cancer Elimination)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Bilastine is a non-sedating second-generation H(1) antihistamine with proven efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and urticaria. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of bilastine in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). METHODS In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients with symptomatic PAR (n = 650) from Argentina, Europe, and South Africa received bilastine 20 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean area under the curve (AUC) of reflective total 6-symptom scores (rT6SS) from baseline visit to day 28 (D28). Secondary outcome measures included mean AUC of instantaneous total 6-symptom scores (iT6SS), and mean AUCs of reflective and instantaneous total 4-nasal symptom scores (T4NSS) and total 2-ocular symptom scores (T2OSS) from baseline to D28. An open-label extension phase evaluated the safety of bilastine 20 mg administered to patients (n = 513) for one year. RESULTS In the overall population no significant differences in efficacy outcomes were found between active treatments and placebo. On account of the high placebo response in South Africa, a post-hoc analysis was conducted. This analysis demonstrated that statistically significant differences existed between active treatments and placebo in the mean AUC of rT6SS (p < 0.05) and T4NSS (p < 0.02), respectively, from baseline to D28 visit for the intent-to-treat population in patients from Europe and Argentina, whereas the difference was not statistically significant in South Africa. Whether this is related to differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics of South African patients (they had PAR for longer and reported more severe symptoms) and/or the disease management process compared with their European and Argentinean counterparts warrants further investigation. CONCLUSIONS A post-hoc analysis indicated that bilastine and cetirizine were similarly effective and more effective than placebo during a 4-week treatment period in patients with PAR. In addition, bilastine was shown to be safe and well-tolerated over a 1-year treatment period.

In Brazil, the rapid spread of the disease led to new challenges in the health system. Neurooncology practice was one of the most affected by the pandemic due to restricted elective procedures and new triage protocols. We aim to characterize the impact of the pandemic on neurosurgery in Brazil. METHODS: We analyzed 112 different types of neurosurgical procedures, with special detail in 11 neurooncology procedures, listed in the Brazilian Hospital Information System records in the DATASUS database between February and July 2019 and the same period in 2020. Linear regression and paired t-test analyses were performed and considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. RESULTS: There was an overall decrease of 21.5% (28,858 cases) in all neurosurgical procedures, impacting patients needing elective procedures (?42.46%) more than emergency surgery (?5.93%). Neurooncology procedures decreased by 14.89%. Nonetheless, the mortality rate during hospitalization increased by 21.26%.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed at elucidating the effect of the long lockdown on the mental health of the Czech population, and the role of exposure to COVID-19 news reports and specific forms of media news use in mental health. METHODS We conducted two consecutive surveys in the early (November 2020) and late (March/April 2021) phases of the nationwide lockdown on the same nationally representative group of Czech adults (N = 1,777) participating in a longitudinal panel study. RESULTS Our findings show that the self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression increased in the second observed period, whereby confirming the negative effect of the pandemic lockdown as it unfolded, suggesting that restrictive measures and continuous exposure to a collective stressor did not result in strengthening of resilience but rather in ongoing traumatization. The results also suggest a negative role of the media's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in mental health during the early, and particularly late phase of the lockdown. Furthermore, we found several risk and protective factors of specific media news use. The media practice in news consumption connected to social media use was the strongest predictor of exacerbated mental health symptoms, particularly in the late phase of the lockdown. Also, news media use characterized by internalization of information learned from the news, as well as negative attitudes towards media news, were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. On the other hand, the use of infotainment, together with an in-depth and contextual style of reading news articles, were related to improvement of mental health.

Immunomodulatory treatments like tocilizumab were found to improve inflammatory markers and lung injury over time. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of tocilizumab treatment on critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study of 154 adult patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15 and May 8, 2020. Data were obtained by electronic medical record (EMR) review. The primary outcome of interest was mortality. RESULTS: Of 154 patients, 34 (21.4%) received tocilizumab. Compared to the non-treated group, the treated group was significantly younger, had fewer comorbidities, lower creatinine and procalcitonin levels, and higher alanine aminotransferase levels on admission. The treated group was more likely to receive supportive measures in the context of critical illness. The overall case fatality rate was 71.4%, and it was significantly lower in the treated than the non-treated (52.9 vs. 76.7%, p = 0.007). In multivariable survival analysis, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a 2.1 times lower hazard of mortality when compared to those who were not treated (hazard ratio: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.83; p = 0.009). The prevalence of secondary infection was higher in the treated group compared to the non-treated without significant difference (p = 0.17).

Detecting and localizing humans reliably and accurately in such an environment, however, is a prerequisite to many services offered by fleets of mobile robots collaborating with human workers. Consequently, in this paper, we expand on the concept of a topological particle filter (TPF) to accurately and individually localize and track workers in a farm environment, integrating information from heterogeneous sensors and combining local active sensing (exploiting a robot's onboard sensing employing a Next-Best-Sense planning approach) and global localization (using affordable IoT GNSS devices). We validate the proposed approach in topologies created for the deployment of robotics fleets to support fruit pickers in a real farm environment. By combining multi-sensor observations on the topological level complemented by active perception through the NBS approach, we show that we can improve the accuracy of picker localization in comparison to prior work.","output":"Navigate-and-Seek: a Robotics Framework for People Localization in Agricultural Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Testing for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is important for decision making prior to surgery in otolaryngology.

OBJECTIVE To determine if use of prescribed opioid analgesics changes in the short and long term after bariatric surgery and to identify factors associated with continued and postsurgery initiated use. SETTING Ten U.S. hospitals. METHODS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study. Assessments were conducted presurgery, 6 months postsurgery, and annually postsurgery for up to 7 years until January 2015. Opioid use was defined as self-reported daily, weekly, or \\"as needed\\" use of a prescribed medication classified as an opioid analgesic. RESULTS Of 2258 participants with baseline data, 2218 completed follow-up assessment(s) (78.7% were female, median body mass index: 46; 70.6% underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Prevalence of opioid use decreased after surgery from 14.7% (95% CI: 13.3-16.2) at baseline to 12.9% (95% CI: 11.5-14.4) at month 6 but then increased to 20.3%, above baseline levels, as time progressed (95% CI: 18.2-22.5) at year 7. Among participants without baseline opioid use (n = 1892), opioid use prevalence increased from 5.8% (95% CI: 4.7-6.9) at month 6 to 14.2% (95% CI: 12.2-16.3) at year 7. Public versus private health insurance, more pain presurgery, undergoing subsequent surgeries, worsening or less improvement in pain, and starting or continuing nonopioid analgesics postsurgery were significantly associated with higher risk of postsurgery initiated opioid use.

The administration of neutral electrolyzed saline, a solution that contains reactive species of chlorine and oxygen (ROS), may be an effective therapeutic alternative due to its immunomodulating characteristics, in systemic inflammation control, as well as in immune response improvement, promoting control of the viral infection. The present study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with intravenous and/or nebulized neutral electrolyzed saline combined with usual medical care versus usual medical care alone, in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. Methods: A prospective, 2-arm, parallel group, randomized, open-label, phase I-II clinical trial included 39 patients in the control group (usual medical care alone) and 45 patients in the experimental group (usual medical care + intravenous and/or nebulized electrolyzed saline, with dose escalation). Two aspects were evaluated during the twenty-day follow-up: i) the number of patients with disease progression (hospitalization or death); and ii) the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS), a single-question outcome that determines patient well-being thresholds for pain and function. Biochemical and hematologic parameters, as well as adverse effects, were evaluated in the experimental group. Results: The experimental treatment decreased the risk for hospitalization by 92% (adjusted RR=0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.50, P=0.007), with a 43-fold increase in the probability of achieving an acceptable symptom state on day 5 (adjusted RR= 42.96, 95% CI: 9.22-200.0, P<0.001). Intravenous + nebulized administration was better than nebulized administration alone, but nebulized administration was better than usual medical care alone. Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, and aberrant monocytes and an increase of lymphocytes, and platelets. Cortisol and testosterone levels were also evaluated, observing a decrease in cortisol levels and an increment of testosterone-cortisol ratio, on days 2 and 4. Conclusions: The experimental treatment produced no serious adverse effects.

There is a need to identify effective antivirals with diverse mechanisms of action in order to accelerate preclinical development. This study focused on five of the most established drug target proteins for direct acting small molecule antivirals: Nsp5 Main Protease, Nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Nsp13 Helicase, Nsp16 2-O methyltransferase and the S2 subunit of the Spike protein. A workflow of solvent mapping and free energy calculations was used to identify and characterize favorable small-molecule binding sites for an aromatic pharmacophore (benzene). After identifying the most favorable sites, calculated ligand efficiencies were compared utilizing computational fragment screening. The most favorable sites overall were located on Nsp12 and Nsp16, whereas the most favorable sites for Nsp13 and S2 Spike had comparatively lower ligand efficiencies relative to Nsp12 and Nsp16. Utilizing fragment screening on numerous possible sites on Nsp13 helicase, we identified a favorable allosteric site on the N-terminal zinc binding domain (ZBD) that may be amenable to virtual or biophysical fragment screening efforts. Recent structural studies of the Nsp12:Nsp13 replication-transcription complex experimentally corroborates ligand binding at this site, which is revealed to be a functional Nsp8:Nsp13 protein-protein interaction site in the complex. Detailed structural analysis of Nsp13 ZBD conformations show the role of induced-fit flexibility in this ligand binding site and identify which conformational states are associated with efficient ligand binding. We hope that this map of over 200 possible small-molecule binding sites for these drug targets may be of use for ongoing discovery, design, and drug repurposing efforts. This information may be used to prioritize screening efforts or aid in the process of deciphering how a screening hit may bind to a specific target protein.","output":"Mapping major SARS-CoV-2 drug targets and assessment of druggability using computational fragment screening: Identification of an allosteric small-molecule binding site on the Nsp13 helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Persons with intellectual disability and/or low-functioning autism spectrum didorder are with high support need (ID/ASD-HSN) are among the people who are most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Italian government was forced to introduce quarantine measures quickly, and all elective health services were stopped or postponed. This emergency has dramatically changed the management of paediatric and adult patients with congenital heart disease. We analysed data from 14 Italian congenital cardiac surgery centres during lockdown, focusing on the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity, patients and healthcare providers and resource allocation. METHODS: Fourteen centres participated in this study. The period analysed was from 9 March to 4 May. We collected data on the involvement of the hospitals in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and on limitations on regular activity and on the contagion among patients and healthcare providers. RESULTS: Four hospitals (29%) remained COVID-19 free, whereas 10 had a 39% reduction in the number of beds for surgical patients, especially in the northern area. Two hundred sixty-three surgical procedures were performed: 20% elective, 62% urgent, 10% emergency and 3% life-saving. Hospital mortality was 0.4%. Compared to 2019, the reduction in surgical activity was 52%. No patients operated on had positive test results before surgery for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Three patients were infected during the postoperative period. Twenty-nine nurses and 12 doctors were infected. Overall, 80% of our infected healthcare providers were in northern centres. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the pandemic had a different impact on the various Italian congenital cardiac surgery centres based on the different patterns of spread of the virus across the country.

We measured the pressure exerted by the cuff on the walls of a test bench mimicking the laryngotracheal tract.

The experimental protocol consisted of measuring pressure values before and after applying a maneuver on two types of endotracheal tubes placed in two mock-ups resembling two different sized tracheal tracts. Increasing pressure values were used to inflate the cuff and the pressures were recorded in two different body positions. The recorded pressure increased proportionally to the input pressure. Moreover, the pressure values measured when using the non-armored (NA) tube were usually higher than those recorded when using the armored (A) tube. A periodic check of the cuff pressure upon changing the body position and/or when performing maneuvers on the tube appears to be necessary to prevent a pressure increase on the tracheal wall. In addition, in our model, the cuff of the A tube gave a more stable output pressure on the tracheal wall than that of the NA tube.","output":"Experimental Assessment of Cuff Pressures on the Walls of a Trachea-Like Model Using Force Sensing Resistors: Insights for Patient Management in Intensive Care Unit Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is relatively rare, but its incidence and mortality have been steadily climbing in marginalized populations. We explored the impact of insurance status, education, and income on survival and receipt of chemoradiation therapy. METHODS: We included patients with ASCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2016. Socioeconomic variables included insurance status, level of education, income, and unemployment rate. Cox proportional hazards and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors of survival and receipt of chemoradiation. RESULTS: We included a total of 10,868 cases of ASCC. The median age was 55, 10.4 % were black, and 65.4 % were female. Overall, 74.1 % of patients received combination chemoradiation. In multivariate analysis, poorer survival was found for Medicaid (HR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.34-1.74) and uninsured (HR 1.68, 95 % CI 1.35-2.10) patients, and for communities with the lowest rates of high school education (HR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02-1.38), lowest income (HR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.08-1.54), and highest unemployment (HR 1.21, 95 % CI 1.03-1.40).

Furthermore, PPE for the eyes and mouth, such as face shields, allow for additional protection when working with aerosols. 3-D printing enables the easy and rapid production of lightweight plastic frameworks based on open-source data. The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined. The weight, printing time, and required tools for assembly were evaluated. To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale. The filament weight (21-42 g) and printing time (1:40-3:17 h) differed significantly between the four frames. Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional PPE, and protection varied between the designs. For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Consequently, two datasets are recommended.

Total hotel sales experienced highs in the 1990s, collapsed on 9/11/2001 and recovered, and collapsed again with a global financial crisis in 2008 and recovered. For approximately the last 12 recovery years, the ascendancy of go-to-market technological sophistication and domination by USA based mega-hotel corporation mergers suggested an ebullient, but ultimately deceptive, permanent era. Then the global Covid-19 devastation struck in early 2020. Given these changes, the purpose of our study is to investigate changes in a specific segment of total hotel sales: B2B corporate group meeting sales (i.e. hotel B2B sales). Our research question is: \\"What is the next oscillating change in hotel B2B sales?\\" One approach in understanding cataclysmic changes in the fortunes of corporate hotel B2B sales may be addressed by the Hegelian dialectic: Thesis assailed by antithesis and stabilizing into synthesis. This resultant synthesis becomes the (new) thesis and the process repeats itself with a, hopefully, improving spiraling oscillation through successive cycles. The findings of our study can be summarized as: (1) Thesis (Stasis) - Pre-Covid19, hotel B2B sales boomed and had become a highly evolved collaborating and partnering process which linked primary supply and demand including complementary services. Major hotel corporations facilitated these partnerships with relatively high-paid Strategic Account Sales Executives (SASE) and their teams who managed a select key 20% of buyer accounts. The remaining targeted 80% of potential customers were addressed by a less expensive and disaggregated salesforce who were augmented by digital technologies;(2) Antithesis (Disruption) - Covid-19 fears and subsequent governmental responses forced hotel occupancies below break-even 50% while virtual meeting technologies became accepted as an economical substitute for face-to-face engagements;and (3) Synthesis (Next Normal/Regeneration of a New Thesis) - We predict a shrinking quantity of hotel B2B sales that focus on content-purposed meetings. On the other hand, we predict an ascendancy of hotel B2B sales networking-purposed meetings that emphasize quality relationship-building experiences. The value/contribution of this study is that it provides a better understanding of changing hotel B2B sales, in view of the evolving body of knowledge, which is the foundation for continued rigorous research. The limitation of the study is that it focuses on USA based hotel corporations selected by the authors due to their global dominance.

By utilizing configurable mixed-signal quadrature coherent PA detection, high sensitivity and enhanced specificity can be achieved. In-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) templates are specifically designed to accurately sense and precisely reconstruct the target PA signals coherently. By mixed-signal implementation leveraging an FPGA to generate template waveforms adaptively, accurate capturing and precise reconstruction on the target PA signal can be attained. The multiplication between the received PA signal and the templates is implemented efficiently in analog-domain by the Gilbert cell on-chip. In vivo temperature monitoring was realized based on the integrated PA sensing platform fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology. With the help of an integrated radar sensor deployed in the indoor scenario, noncontact monitoring on respiration and heartbeat rates can be attained.

RESULTS: We identified a total of 19 (38%) BSIs in the COVID-19 group and 10 (12%) BSI in the non-COVID-19 group (p=0,8). COVID-19 patients had an increased probability to develop ICU-BSI, at a median of 8 days of ICU admission as opposed to 6 in the non-COVID-19 group. Patients were comparable in terms of age, and APACHE II score. Out of 19 BSI CoVID-19 patients, 14 (73%) were male vs 5 (50%) in the non-CoVID-19 BSI patients (p=0.0007).

Design: A cross-sectional observational study. Participants: Eight hundred, high definition anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) B-scans were included, out of which 340 images (One scan per eye) were used to build the machine learning (ML) model and the rest were used for validation of ADoA. Out of 340 images, 170 scans included PCG (n=27), JOAG (n=86) and POAG (n=57) eyes and the rest were controls. The genetic validation dataset consisted of another 393 images of patients with known mutations compared with 320 images of healthy controls Methods: ADoA was defined as the absence of Schlemm's canal(SC), the presence of extensive hyper-reflectivity over the region of trabecular meshwork or a hyper-reflective membrane (HM) over the region of the trabecular meshwork. Deep learning was used to classify a given ASOCT image as either having angle dysgenesis or not. ADoA was then specifically looked for, on ASOCT images of patients with mutations in the known genes for glaucoma (MYOC, CYP1B1, FOXC1 and LTBP2). Main Outcome measures: Using Deep learning to identify ADoA in patients with known gene mutations. Results: Our three optimized deep learning models showed an accuracy > 95%, specificity >97% and sensitivity >96% in detecting angle dysgenesis on ASOCT in the internal test dataset. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, based on the external validation cohort were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.95), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.86) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.91) for the three models. Amongst the patients with known gene mutations, ADoA was observed among all the patients with MYOC mutations, as it was also observed among those with CYP1B1, FOXC1 and with LTBP2 mutations compared to only 5% of those healthy controls (with no glaucoma mutations). Conclusions: Three deep learning models were developed for a consensus-based outcome to objectively identify ADoA among glaucoma patients.

Digitalization enables smart cities such as Moscow to do more work with less resources. This article identifies and analyzes the existing waste management facilities in Moscow with respect to drawbacks and the ways forward to mitigate the bottlenecks. To improve its waste management, lessons drawn from Berlin's experiences in waste management are discussed to inspire transformation in the city's waste sector in the framewok of resource recovery. In line with the 2030 UN Agenda, this work proposes a digitalization to accelerate societal transitions through waste recycling industry. Its global relevance is elaborated by presenting perspective of digitalization in waste management practices. In this work, case-study was selected as the research method to provide a means to investigate a complex waste problem in Moscow and Berlin. It was evident from cleaner production paradigm that digital technology can minimize the amount of unrecycled MSW, while conserving raw materials and reducing operational cost and GHG emissions. Digitalization builds cities' resilience by strengthening local waste management practices to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Moscow, the transition towards the digitalization of waste recycling through informal waste sectors has created 5,000 new jobs that reduces unemployment rate. This maximizes pick up time and enhance efficiency with a lower cost of operating trucks up to 75%. A convolutional neural networkCbased identification system that classifies identified materials yields almost perfect accuracy. A single robot arm can handle four varying fractions of construction and demolition waste with 99% of purity. Robotic deployment could reduce the volume of unrecycled waste by 20%.

However, the extent to which students stigmatize their peers with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in female educational settings remains unknown. This study investigated the relationship between SAD, peer-liking and stigma in a cohort of early adolescent girls. The sample was 103 sixth and seventh graders attending three girls schools in Australia. The students, aged between 10- and 13-years, were randomly allocated to either a control (n = 52) or experimental (n = 51) group. Participants completed an online survey while at school to examine their responses to one of two age-and-gender matched vignettes: a hypothetical peer with SAD (experimental condition), or without SAD (control condition). Contrary to expectations, group comparisons revealed that students with the SAD vignette liked their peer more than students with the non-SAD vignette. Also, students endorsed higher levels of pity, lower levels of fear, but similar levels of anger when considering their SAD (versus non-SAD) peer. In the SAD group, higher levels of pity were associated with greater peer-liking. The opposite pattern was evident in response to the non-SAD peer. Importantly, students discriminated less (preferred less social distance) in response to their peer with SAD. This points to the potential benefit of adolescent peer programs that aim to promote positive peer-relationships as a protective factor for students with SAD. Future research may examine gender and socio-economically diverse students to increase the confidence with which findings can be generalized to other educational settings.","output":"Social Anxiety Disorder: Associations with Peer-Liking, Discrimination, and Prejudicial Feelings in Early Adolescent Girls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the recent advancements in treating bacterial infections, antibiotic resistance (AR) is still an emerging issue.

This study aims to investigate communicative interaction between state elites and societal stakeholders in South Korea with a focus on the anti-smoking policies of two different administrations: the Roh administration (2003C2008) and the Park administration (2013C2017). As a theoretical base, this paper proposes a stakeholder-oriented approach to legitimacy, which incorporates a policy frame analysis with the concept of a three-tier policy structure (i.e., policy goals, policy tools, and tool settings). In assessing policy legitimacy, the stakeholder-oriented approach examines whether there is congruence between the three-tier policy structure and the corresponding stakeholder framing. In the Roh administration, the policy frames among the three tiers of policy structure were centered on public health promotion, whereas in the Park administration, they expanded to the domain of tax policy. The empirical findings underscore the importance of two-way communication between the government and societal stakeholders, which can be evidenced using policy frame analysis. Ultimately, the results show that policy legitimacy is more likely to be guaranteed if there is no hidden or predetermined policy intention that can be detected by stakeholder framing analysis.","output":"Stakeholder framing, communicative interaction, and policy legitimacy: anti-smoking policy in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: According to the literature, 25% to 50% of antimicrobials prescribed in hospitals are unnecessary or inappropriate, directly impacting antimicrobial resistance. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the use of antimicrobials in a university hospital in Northeast Brazil, using days of therapy (DOT) and length of therapy (LOT) indicators in accordance with the latest national and international recommendations for monitoring the use of antimicrobials. METHODS: This is an observational, prospective analytical study conducted in a teaching hospital, with 94 active beds, distributed between the intensive care unit (ICU), the surgical clinic (SUR), the medical clinic (MED), the pneumology/infectology department (PNE/INF) and pediatrics (PED). The duration of the study was from the beginning of January to the end of December 2018. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 11,634 patient-days were followed up and 50.4% of the patients were found to have received some antimicrobial, with a significant reduction in use of 1% per month throughout the year. Patients were receiving antimicrobial therapy for 376 days in every 1000 days of hospitalization (LOT = 376/1000pd). Overall, the 1st-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were the most used in respect of the number of prescriptions and the duration of therapy. The calculated global DOT/LOT ratio showed that each patient received an average of 1.5 antimicrobials during the hospital stay. The incidence of antimicrobial resistance, globally, for both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin R), Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem R), was 1 per 1000 patient-days. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from the analyses revealed that half of the patients admitted to the hospital who took part in the study were exposed to the use of antimicrobials at some point during their stay. Although moderate, it is noteworthy that there was a decline in the use of antimicrobials throughout the year. The indicators used in this study were found to be very effective for gathering data on the use of antimicrobials, and assessing the results of the initiatives taken as part of the Stewardship program.

However, little is known about pediatricians' experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. METHODS: Data from a nationally representative survey of American Academy of Pediatrics postresidency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n = 744; response rate = 48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which nonusers would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among nonusers, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. CONCLUSION: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth.

Experiments already proved that there was a sigmoid functional relationship between virus infection probability and inoculum dose. By means of mathematical simulation of stochastic process, we theoretically demonstrate that there is a sigmoid function relationship between them. At the same time, our model found three factors that influence the severity of infection symptoms, those are virus toxicity, virus invasion dose and host immunity respectively. Therefore, the mortality rate cannot directly reflect the change of virus toxicity, but is the result of the comprehensive action of these three factors. Protective measures such as masks can effectively reduce the severity of infection while reducing the probability of infection. Based on the sigmoid function relationship between virus infection probability and initial virus invasion dose, we deduce that for highly infectious viruses, such as SARS-COV-2, the evolution of its toxicity is closely related to the host population density, and its toxicity will first increase and then decrease with the increase of host population density. That is to say, on the basis of extremely low host population density, increasing population density is beneficial to the development of virus towards strong toxicity. However, this trend is not sustainable, and there is a turning point of population density. Beyond this turning point, increasing population density will be beneficial to the development of virus towards weak toxicity. This theory can well explain the differences of mortality in Covid-19 in different countries. Countries with high population density and extremely low population density often correspond to lower mortality, while countries with population density in the range of 20-100/km2 often have higher mortality. At the same time, we propose that social distance and masks can effectively accelerate the evolution of virus towards low toxicity, so we should not give up simple and effective protection measures while emphasizing vaccination.","output":"If we cannot eliminate them, should we tame them?

In January 2021, Major League Baseball legend and Hall of Famer, Hank Aaron, passed away at the age of 86 years from natural causes, just 2 weeks after he received the COVID-19 vaccine. Antivaccination groups attempted to link his death to the Moderna vaccine, similar to other attempts misrepresenting data from the VAERS to spread COVID-19 misinformation. Objective This study assessed the spread of misinformation linked to erroneous claims about Hank Aarons death on Twitter and then characterized different vaccine misinformation and hesitancy themes generated from users who interacted with this misinformation discourse. Methods An initial sample of tweets from January 31, 2021, to February 6, 2021, was queried from the Twitter Search Application Programming Interface using the keywords Hank Aaron and vaccine. The sample was manually annotated for misinformation, reporting or news media, and public reaction. Nonmedia user accounts were also classified if they were verified by Twitter. A second sample of tweets, representing direct comments or retweets to misinformation-labeled content, was also collected. User sentiment toward misinformation, positive (agree) or negative (disagree), was recorded. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix from the World Health Organization was used to code the second sample of tweets for factors influencing vaccine confidence. Results A total of 436 tweets were initially sampled from the Twitter Search Application Programming Interface. Misinformation was the most prominent content type (n=244, 56%) detected, followed by public reaction (n=122, 28%) and media reporting (n=69, 16%). No misinformation-related content reviewed was labeled as misleading by Twitter at the time of the study. An additional 1243 comments on misinformation-labeled tweets from 973 unique users were also collected, with 779 comments deemed relevant to study aims. Most of these comments expressed positive sentiment (n=612, 78.6%) to misinformation and did not refute it. Based on the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts framework, the most common vaccine hesitancy theme was individual or group influences (n=508, 65%), followed by vaccine or vaccination-specific influences (n=110, 14%) and contextual influences (n=93, 12%). Common misinformation themes observed included linking the death of Hank Aaron to suspicious elderly deaths following vaccination, claims about vaccines being used for depopulation, death panels, federal officials targeting Black Americans, and misinterpretation of VAERS reports. Four users engaging with or posting misinformation were verified on Twitter at the time of data collection. Conclusions Our study found that the death of a high-profile ethnic minority celebrity led to the spread of misinformation on Twitter. This misinformation directly challenged the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines at a time when ensuring vaccine coverage among minority populations was paramount. Misinformation targeted at minority groups and echoed by other verified Twitter users has the potential to generate unwarranted vaccine hesitancy at the expense of people such as Hank Aaron who sought to promote public health and community immunity.","output":"Spread of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation in the Ninth Inning: Retrospective Observational Infodemic Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The squirrelfish, which live in visually complex coral reefs, have very large eyes and a special dual-system \\"day and night vision\\" retina.

However, this policy may cause parents to feel anxious and concerned about their childrens health during face-to-face learning. The previous research has focused on parents perspectives and readiness toward their childrens digital use in general, leaving their beliefs, attitudes, and readiness concerning offline learning in the COVID-19 pandemic unexplored. AIM: This study aimed to identify knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward childrens offline learning among parents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was used to collect data using Survey Monkey. The sample in this study was parents who had children aged 6C12-years-old and willing to participate in this study. A linear regression model was employed to find readiness-related factors. RESULTS: A total of 800 (response rate was 80%) participants participated in the study. The average age was 34 (SD = 12.3), 60% were female and 54% worked in the public sector. Participants had an average knowledge score of 10.3 (SD = 3.27, with a range of 0C13), parental attitudes concerning the advantages and disadvantages of offline schooling versus online learning were 3.88 (SD = 0.12), the belief was 3.78 (SD = 0.89), and the readiness score was 3.45 (SD = 0.89). Attitude ( = 3.04 and p = 0.001) and belief ( = 2.89 and p = 0.001) were the factors associated with readiness to offline learning outbreak COVID-19 pandemic.

To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of these coronaviruses, we conducted a longitudinal surveillance in fruit bats in Yunnan province, China during 2009C2016. A total of 59 (10.63%) bat samples were positive for the two betacorona-viruses, 46 (8.29%) for HKU9 and 13 (2.34%) for GCCDC1, or closely related viruses. We identified a novel HKU9 strain, tentatively designated as BatCoV HKU9-2202, by sequencing the full-length genome. The BatCoV HKU9-2202 shared 83% nucleotide identity with other BatCoV HKU9 stains based on whole genome sequences. The most divergent region is in the spike protein, which only shares 68% amino acid identity with BatCoV HKU9. Quantitative PCR revealed that the intestine was the primary infection organ of BatCoV HKU9 and GCCDC1, but some HKU9 was also detected in the heart, kidney, and lung tissues of bats.

Consistent with EC activation, increased plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) levels have been reported in COVID-19. Importantly however, studies in other microangiopathies have shown that plasma VWF propeptide (VWFpp) is a more sensitive and specific measure of acute EC activation. In the present study, we further investigated the nature of EC activation in severe COVID-19. Markedly increased plasma VWF:Ag [median (interquatile range, IQR) 6088 (531-830)iu/dl] and pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII) levels [median (IQR) 2619 (170-315) iu/dl] were seen in patients with severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Sequential testing showed that these elevated VWF-FVIII complex levels remained high for up to 3 weeks. Similarly, plasma VWFpp levels were also markedly elevated [median (IQR) 3246 (267-524) iu/dl]. Interestingly however, the VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio was reduced, demonstrating that decreased VWF clearance contributes to the elevated plasma VWF:Ag levels in severe COVID-19. Importantly, plasma VWFpp levels also correlated with clinical severity indices including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sustained fulminant EC activation is occurring in severe COVID-19, and further suggest that VWFpp may have a role as a biomarker in this setting.","output":"Von Willebrand factor propeptide in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): evidence of acute and sustained endothelial cell activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lombardy is the Region in Italy the most heavily affected by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) contagion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 213 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged or died by 15 March 2020. We retrospectively collected epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, computed tomography imaging and outcome data. Clinical characteristics were described and relative risk factors were compared. RESULTS: Most clinical characteristics of this study were similar to those from studies in Wuhan, but there were lower mortality rate and milder severity. The median time from onset of symptoms to confirmation and hospitalization was 4 and 5 days, respectively. The median virus clearance and shedding times were 10 and 15 days, respectively. When the severe/critical group was compared with the mild/moderate group, significant risk factors included: older age; dyspnea; hypertension; poor appetite; fatigue; higher white cell count, neutrophil count, prothrombin time, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein; and lower lymphocyte count and albumin (p < 0.05). In the intensive care unit (ICU) group compared with the non-ICU group, risk factors included: older age; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); dyspnea; poor appetite; higher white cell count, D-dimer, ALT, AST and LDH; and lower lymphocyte count and albumin (p < 0.05). Independent risk factors associated with the severe/critical group were dyspnea [odds ratio (OR) = 19.48], ALT (OR = 6.02) and albumin (OR = 3.36).

Private contact tracing (PCT) is one of the promising techniques for the purpose. However, the recently proposed Bluetooth-based PCT has several limitations in terms of functionality and flexibility. The existing systems are only able to detect direct contact (i.e., human-human contact), but cannot detect indirect contact (i.e., human-object, such as the disease transmission through surface). Moreover, the rule of risky contact cannot be flexibly changed with the environmental situation and the nature of the virus. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient trajectory-based PCT system using trusted hardware. We formalize trajectory-based PCT as a generalization of the well-studied Private Set Intersection (PSI), which is mostly based on cryptographic primitives and thus insufficient. We solve the problem by leveraging trusted hardware such as Intel SGX and designing a novel algorithm to achieve a secure, efficient and flexible PCT system. Our experiments on real-world data show that the proposed system can achieve high performance and scalability. Specifically, our system (one single machine with Intel SGX) can process thousands of queries on 100 million records of trajectory data in a few seconds.","output":"Secure and Efficient Trajectory-Based Contact Tracing using Trusted Hardware"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike (S) protein, a main surface antigen of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is considered to be one of the most important protective antigen candidates for targets for vaccine design against the virus.

We analyzed its impact by spatio-temporal variations in river morphology (12 channel parameters) and changes in cross-section and hydraulic parameters (flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, W/D ratio) between pre- and post-flood management periods. The research hypotheses related to decreasing geodiversity in managed river reaches, a rapid increase in flow velocity during an extreme flood in river reaches where there is no sufficient floodplain inundation due to artificially high banks built by river training works, and increasing erosive force in the channel zone thanks to river management intervention were confirmed. The intervention in the braidplain area of the Bel River resulted in an undesirable simplification of the river pattern, loss of geomorphic diversity, loss of channel-floodplain connectivity, and disturbance and restraint of hydromorphological continuity.

The aim of this work is to study resilience and adaptability to crisis in terms of economic results and innovative outcomes of the cooperative business model in the Italian third sector during the COVID pandemic. It uses new evidence from a recent survey on the Italian third sector and consists of two main parts. In the first, the institutionalist literature on contractual failures is assumed as an interpretative key in the comparison between the business model, governance, and routines in social cooperatives versus other non-profit organizations (NPOs) interpreted as third sector entities. In the second, we use the new data from a third sector survey in the Marche region, collected in the late spring of 2021 at the end of the pandemic outbreak. Empirical assumptions concern organizational resilience and adaptation to unexpected negative shocks in cooperatives and other NPOs. The results show that, in the management of the crisis, cooperatives are better able to preserve their human capital and resort to layoffs less often than other NPOs. Shared decision-making, employee involvement, and the adaptability of the work process emerge as dominant organizational characteristics that support resilience and service innovation in cooperatives. The main policy implication concerns the ability of cooperatives to play a stabilizing and a-cyclical role during the crisis and to fill the supply gaps left open by other organizational forms (private, non-profit and the public sector).

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has created serious challenges for in-person data collection. In this case study, we describe multi-modal strategies for online recruitment of U.S. Vietnamese parents, compare response rates and participant characteristics among strategies, and discuss lessons learned. METHODS: We recruited 408 participants from community-based organizations (CBOs) (n = 68), Facebook groups (n = 97), listservs (n = 4), personal network (n = 42), and snowball sampling (n = 197). Using chi-square tests and one-way analyses of variance, we compared participants recruited through different strategies regarding sociodemographic characteristics, acculturation-related characteristics, and mobile health usage. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 71.8% (range: 51.5% for Vietnamese CBOs to 86.6% for Facebook groups). Significant differences exist for all sociodemographic and almost all acculturation-related characteristics among recruitment strategies. Notably, CBO-recruited participants were the oldest, had lived in the U.S. for the longest duration, and had the lowest Vietnamese language ability. We found some similarities between Facebook-recruited participants and those referred by Facebook-recruited participants. Mobile health usage was high and did not vary based on recruitment strategies. Challenges included encountering fraudulent responses (e.g., non-Vietnamese). Perceived benefits and trust appeared to facilitate recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: Facebook and snowball sampling may be feasible strategies to recruit U.S. Vietnamese.

Patients in an age group of 0-17 years with acute neurological signs (including ascending weakness with areflexia, diminished visual acuity, encephalopathy, ataxia, stroke, or weakness with plasma creatinine kinase (CK) elevation) were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 23 patients with neurological manifestations, 10 (43%) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the infected patients, 5 (50%) were males aged 2-16 years old (median age 11.8 years old). Four (40%) patients confirmed a close contact with a relative positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 6 (60%) cases had a history of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms over the previous 2 weeks. The following diagnoses were established: 3 cases of GBS, 2 of ON, 2 of AIS, one of myositis with rhabdomyolysis, one ACA, and one of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were noticed in the pediatric population even without respiratory symptoms. In this study, 2 of 6 symptomatic patients had mild respiratory symptoms and 4 had unspecific symptoms.

METHODS: HINARI, PubMed, and advanced Google Scholar databases were searched for eligible articles. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. RESULTS: A total of 1,809 articles were identified and screened at two stages. Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 were country-specific, seven covered the SSA region, and three covered 3C4 countries. Twenty-six studies assessed the IDSR core functions, 43 the support functions, while 24 addressed both functions. Most of the studies involved Tanzania (9), Ghana (6) and Uganda (5). The routine Health Management Information System (HMIS), which collects data from health care facilities, has remained the primary source of IDSR data. However, the system is characterised by inadequate data completeness, timeliness, quality, analysis and utilisation, and lack of integration of data from other sources. Under-use of advanced and big data analytical technologies in performing disease surveillance and relating multiple indicators minimises the optimisation of clinical and practice evidence-based decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that most countries in SSA rely mainly on traditional indicator-based disease surveillance utilising data from healthcare facilities with limited use of data from other sources. It is high time that SSA countries consider and adopt multi-sectoral, multi-disease and multi-indicator platforms that integrate other sources of health information to provide support to effective detection and prompt response to public health threats.","output":"Twenty years of integrated disease surveillance and response in Sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and opportunities for effective management of infectious disease epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dexamethasone provides benefits in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although data regarding immunological profiles and viral clearance are limited. This study aimed to evaluate for differences in biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19 who did and did not receive dexamethasone. We measured plasma biomarkers of lung epithelial/endothelial injury and inflammation in 31 patients with severe COVID-19 and in 13 controls. Changes in biomarkers and clinical parameters were compared during the 7-day period among COVID-19 patients, and also according to dexamethasone use. Thirty-two patients with severe COVID-19 who received mechanical ventilation (n = 6), high-flow nasal cannula (n = 11), and supplemental oxygen (n = 15) were analyzed. Relative to controls, patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher concentrations of biomarkers related to glycocalyx shedding (endocan and syndecan-1), endothelial injury (von Willebrand factor), and inflammation (soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products [sRAGE] and interleukin-6). The 7-day decreases in biomarkers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2] and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]) and sRAGE, but not in the biomarker of lung epithelial injury (surfactant protein D), were correlated with decreases in C-reactive protein and radiologic score at day 7. Twenty patients (63%) received dexamethasone, and the dexamethasone and non-dexamethasone groups differed in terms of disease severity. However, dexamethasone was associated marginally with increased SpO(2)/FiO(2) and significantly with decreases in C-reactive protein and radiologic score after adjusting for baseline imbalances. Furthermore, the dexamethasone group exhibited a significant decrease in the concentrations of Ang-2, ICAM-1, soluble form of the Tie2 receptor (a biomarker of glycocalyx shedding), and sRAGE. Both groups exhibited a clinically insignificant increase in the cycle threshold value. Severe COVID-19 may be characterized by more severe endothelial injury and inflammation, and less severe lung epithelial injury. There is a possibility that dexamethasone improved severe COVID-19 and related endothelial injury without delaying viral clearance.","output":"Dexamethasone may improve severe COVID-19 via ameliorating endothelial injury and inflammation: A preliminary pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, surface glycoproteins with an essential role in viral pathogenesis, are important antigen determinants and essential markers for epidemiological surveillance. Neuraminidase is also a suitable target for designing antiviral drugs. The introduction into clinical practice of neuraminidase inhibitors and the development of random point mutations have increased the emergence of drug\\\\resistant viruses. A universal RT nested PCR\\\\based system has been developed for subtyping H1, H3, N1 and N2, in influenza A viruses of human or animal origin. The subsequent sequencing and analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase templates reveal antigenic and receptor binding changes in the HA1 subunit and mutations of clinical relevance concerning resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. The specificity and sensitivity of the method were evaluated using 113 influenza A isolates, 105 influenza A positive respiratory samples obtained from patients and 29 prototype strains of both human and animal origin. The resulting analytical sensitivity of the subtyping techniques is one to at least 100 molecules of cloned DNA product in a final reaction volume of 50 l. In the course of implementing the method, two H1N1 isolates with the H274Y mutation in the neuraminidase segment have been detected and their molecular features analyzed.

However, recent publications highlight the existence of abundant viral small interference and micro RNAs (VsiRNAs and VmiRNAs) in both cell-line and whole organism based experiments, indicating a contribution of these molecules in host responses and/or viral replication. We explore the theoretical possibility that RNAi triggered by SARS-CoV-2 might degrade some host transcripts in the opposite direction, although this hypothesis seems counterintuitive. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was therefore computationally searched for exact intrapairing within the viral RNA and exact hybrid pairing with the human transcriptome over a minimum of 20 bases in length. Minimal segments of 20-base lengths of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found based on the theoretical matching with existing complementary strands in the human host transcriptome. Few human genes potentially annealing with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30, the subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 and two long noncoding RNAs, were retrieved. The hypothesis that viral-originated RNAi might mediate degradation of host transcriptome messages was corroborated by published high throughput sequencing of RNA from infected tissues and cultured cells, clinical observation and phylogenetic comparative analysis, indicating a strong specificity of these SARS-CoV-2 hybrid pairing sequences for human genomes.","output":"Computational search of hybrid human/SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA reveals unique viral sequences that diverge from those of other coronavirus strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: People with mental disorders might be differentially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, little is known about it and no effective drug is available for its treatment. While many drugs are being evaluated, an effective therapeutic measure is still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on human cells. SARS-CoV has been found to downregulate ACE2 and SARS- CoV-2 infection has been found to be associated with increased level of Angiotensin II. Based on these facts, we presume that SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV downregulates ACE2, and in absence/reduced activity of ACE2, level of angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9) is decreased while that of angiotensin II is increased and increased level of angiotensin II has been found to correlate with lung injury and viral load. We presume that restoration of normal functioning of renin-angiotensin system with recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9) may be an effective therapeutic measure but studies will be required to test this hypothesis and explore its possible role in treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Treatment Options Available for COVID-19 and an Analysis on Possible Role of Combination of rhACE2, Angiotensin (1-7) and Angiotensin (1-9) as Effective Therapeutic Measure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clozapine is the only licensed pharmacotherapy for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), but its use is limited due to adverse effects. Clozapine treatment has been recently associated with reductions in immunoglobulin (Ig) levels cross-sectionally, however prospective studies are required to establish longitudinal effects. This study aimed to determine whether reductions in immunoglobulin levels occur over 6 months after initiating clozapine treatment. An exploratory aim was to investigate relationships between immunoglobulin levels and symptom severity over the course of clozapine treatment. Methods: In 56 participants with TRS, Ig A, M and G levels were measured in serum using a sandwich immunoassay. Samples for analysis were acquired prior to starting clozapine and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks after initiating clozapine treatment. Clinical symptoms were measured using the positive and negative syndrome scale for schizophrenia (PANSS). Results: All three classes of Ig decreased during clozapine treatment. For IgA and IgG the reduction was significant at 24 weeks (IgA: B - 32.7, 95% CI = -61.19, -4.2, p = 0.04; IgG: B - 55.94, 95% CI = -111.03, -0.844, p = 0.05). For IgM the reduction was significant at 12 and 24 weeks (12 weeks: B = -21.73, 95% CI = -37.10, -6.35, p = 0.006; 24 weeks: B = -32.54, 95% CI = -48.89, 16.18, p = 0.0001). Changes in both IgA and IgG were correlated with the percentage change in PANSS total scores over 12 weeks, such that greater reductions in IgA and IgG during clozapine treatment were associated with greater reductions in symptom severity (n = 32, IgA r = 0.59, p = 0.005; IgG r = 0.50, p = 0.02) Conclusions: The observed reductions in immunoglobulin levels over six months of clozapine treatment add further evidence linking clozapine to secondary antibody deficiency.

Accordingly, hospitals had to implement strategies to profoundly reshape both non-COVID-19 medical care and surgical activities. Knowledge about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgery practice is pivotal. The goal of the present study was to describe the changes in cardiac surgery practices during the health emergency at the national level. METHODS: A 26-question web-enabled survey including all adult cardiac surgery units in Italy was conducted to assess how their clinical practice changed during the national lockdown. Data were compared to data from the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: All but 2 centres (94.9%) adopted specific protocols to screen patients and personnel. A significant reduction in the number of dedicated cardiac intensive care unit beds (?35.4%) and operating rooms (?29.2%), along with healthcare personnel reallocation to COVID departments (nurses ?15.4%, anaesthesiologists ?7.7%), was noted. Overall adult cardiac surgery volumes were dramatically reduced (1734 procedures vs 3447; P < 0.001), with a significant drop in elective procedures [580 (33.4%) vs 2420 (70.2%)].

In the past decade, during Songkran festival, the traditional Thai new year, the number of road traffic accidents (RTAs) was markedly higher than normal day life, but few studies have yet investigated this issue as the effect of festivity. The objective of this study was to investigate factors contributing to RAF using various count regression models. Methods Data of 20,229 accidents in 2015 were collected from the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, Thailand. Poisson, Conway-Maxwell-Poisson, and their Zero-Inflated versions were applied to analyze factors associated with the number of fatalities in an accident. Results The RAFs in Thailand follow a count distribution with underdispersion and excessive zeros which is rare. The best fitting model, the ZICMP regression model returns significant predictors (road characteristics, weather conditions, environmental conditions, and month) on the number of fatalities in an accident. The model consists of the count part encapsulating both non-excess zeros and death counts and the zero-part representing the considerable number of zeros during the festival months. The estimated proportion of the zero-part is 0.275 accounting for 5,563 non-fatal accidents. More specifically, the excessive number of no deaths can be explained by the month factor. The mean number of fatalities was lower in the festive periods than other months, with the highest in November. Conclusion For long, Thai authorities have put a lot of efforts and resources into improving road safety over the festival weeks, often they failed.

Thus, we aimed to develop and validate a reliable prognostic signature that can estimate the prognosis for HCC. METHODS: Gene expression profiling and clinical information of 374 HCC patients were derived from the TCGA data portal. The survival-related RBP pairs were determined using univariate cox-regression analysis and the signature was built based on LASSO analysis. All patients were divided patients into high-and low-risk groups according to the optimal cut off of the signature score determined by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The predictive value of the signature was further validated in an independent cohort. RESULTS: A 37-RBP pairs signature consisting of 61 unique genes was constructed which was significantly associated with the survival. The RBP-related signature accurately predicted the prognosis of HCC patients, and patients in high-risk groups showed poor survival in two cohorts. The novel signature was an independent prognostic factor of HCC in two cohorts (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, the C-index of the prognostic model was 0.799, which was higher than that of many established risk models. Pathway and process enrichment analysis showed that the 61 unique genes were mainly enriched in translation, ncRNA metabolic process, RNA splicing, RNA modification, and translational termination.

Two types of photocurable resins are reinforced by titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) or zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles with average diameters in the 10C30 nm range to provide antimicrobial properties. The developed nanocomposites can be additively manufactured using the digital light processing method with an outstanding surface quality and precise geometrical accuracy. Experimental characterizations are conducted to investigate key mechanical properties of the 3D printed nanocomposites, including Youngs Modulus, tensile strength, and abrasion resistance. Specimens produced were observed to demonstrate the following characteristics during testing. Tensile strength increased by 42.2% at a maximum value of 29.53 MPa. The modulus of elasticity increased by 14.3%, and abrasion resistance increased by 15.8%. The proper dispersion of the nanoparticles within the cured resin is validated by scanning electron images. The wettability and water absorption testing results indicate that the developed nanocomposites have an outstanding water resistance capability. The pairing of digital light processing with these novel nanocomposites allows for the creation of complex composite geometries that are not capable through other manufacturing processes. Therefore, they have the potential for long-term usage to improve general public health with antimicrobial functionality. The pairing of an unmodified photocurable resin with a 1% ZnO concentration demonstrated the most promise for commercial applications.","output":"Utilization of Antibacterial Nanoparticles in Photocurable Additive Manufacturing of Advanced Composites for Improved Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs of medical faculty students about the covid-19 pandemic Methods: Between 29/03/2020 and 04/13/2020 a total of 1,332 students had been questioned in three Turkish speaking countries (Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) Results: The average age of the students were 20 1 +/- 1 6 Among all 895 (67 7%) of them were female and 427 (32 3%) were male 1020 (77 2%) of the studens were in Turkey, 195 (14 8%) were in Azerbaijan and 107 (8 1%) were in the TRNC 104 of the students (7 9%) had a chronic disease It was found that number of alcohol and cigarette users decreased significantly during the pandemic (p &lt;0 001, p &lt;0 001) Anxiety levels of those who quit or reduced smoking were found to be higher than those who increased or did not change their amount of smoking (p=0 034) It was found that the most benefited sources were \\"their faculty lecturers\\" (n=453, 34 3%), \\"Worldometer (R) website\\" (n= 449, 34%) and \\"Youtube videos\\" (n=396, 30%) Conclusion: Longitudinal studies are needed on the effects of pandemic on alcohol and tobacco use It is important to educate future physicians in social media literacy, interpretation and responsibilities for social media posts In this way, perhaps we can contribute to minimize the public's erroneous beliefs and maladaptive behaviors regarding the pandemic and reduce stigmatizing attitudes towards physicians, elders and Asians","output":"Medical Faculty Students' Attitudes, Behaviors and Beliefs About Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected opportunities available to psychology interns and postdoctoral fellows completing capstone training experiences during culminating training years.

METHODS: The fluorescence immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Shenzhen, China) was evaluated using universal transport medium with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from suspected COVID-19 cases. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 real-time (RT)-PCR. RESULTS: A total of 127 samples were included; 82 were RT-PCR-positive. The median patient age was 38 years, 53.5% were male, and 93.7% were from the first week after symptom onset. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (95% confidence interval 86.5-97.4%) and 100% (95% confidence interval 92.1-100%), respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96.1% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9.

This strategy serves a salient role to help them recover from the relevant hazardous impacts. Disaster risk has been a major concern among hazards for the increasing likelihood of exposure and vulnerability, especially in the process of poverty alleviation in China. However, few studies have discussed the factors and mechanisms that influence peasants to adopt livelihood recovery strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Based on a case study of Ningqiang County, China, this study explores the mechanisms that catalyze the proactive recovery of peasants from the COVID-19 pandemic from a livelihood perspective. Methodologically, the study proposes a framework that integrates the modified pressure-state-response (PSR) framework and the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA), and it employs structure equation modeling (SEM) approach to examine how specific factors affect peasants to proactively adopt livelihood strategies to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that the COVID-19 pressure significantly increases the risk perception of peasants and decreases their livelihood capital. Further, the decreased livelihood capital, the improvement of risk perception and supportive policy will promote peasants to adopt livelihood recovery strategies. Moreover, the results specify that risk perception and supportive policy mediate the relation between livelihood capital and recovery strategy. The findings will be beneficial for policymakers and researchers to understand the mechanisms that peasants adopt livelihood strategies to recover from disasters, and can serve as references for formulating disaster risk reduction and resilience policies.","output":"What catalyzes the proactive recovery of peasants from the COVID-19 pandemic?

Cleaning rates of four ultrasound machines used by hospital medicine and critical care medicine services were evaluated using fluorescent marking. Interventions targeted physicians knowledge of best practices and improved access to cleaning supplies. Pre- and post-intervention cleaning rates were compared using a generalized linear model. The impact of the corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on baseline cleaning rates was also evaluated. Physicians attitudes and knowledge of cleaning practices were evaluated via unpaired pre/post surveys. RESULTS: There was significant improvement in thoroughness of cleaning following intervention (pre 0.62, SE 0.05; post 0.89, SE 0.07), p < 0.0001).

Recent work on the spread of interacting contagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can have counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one of these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of awareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered, cliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the awareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing its transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to be infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the awareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected individual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to the disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network clustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to sustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This counter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that random networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts. To further investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on a two-step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary infections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net effect of clustering and co-infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight once again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and illustrate the type of analysis that is possible even in complex models of interacting contagions.","output":"Spread of infectious disease and social awareness as parasitic contagions on clustered networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I engage with the impact of disruptions on my work life, and consider the transformative potential that these disruptions offer.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are an effective way of gathering patient feedback and can facilitate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis to improve decision making and service improvement. The PROMs, PREMs & Effectiveness Programme was initiated in 2016 and aimed to develop an electronic platform to facilitate collection of PROMs and Patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) from secondary care patients across Wales. METHODS: We worked with all Health Boards in Wales, the NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS), and Cedar (a healthcare technology research centre) to identify and meet technical requirements to develop a platform which is fit for purpose. Patient groups were included throughout the development to gather feedback and for extensive testing. Clinical teams helped identify the most appropriate tools, with licences, translations and electronic formatting issues being managed centrally. RESULTS: The developed platform is integrated with patient administration systems minimising the need for manual input, with processes in place to allow automatic collection triggers according to nationally agreed schedules. We have over 30 nationally agreed PROMs pathways with over 110,000 PROMs collected to date. Responses are fed back to clinicians via the electronic patient record and to each health board via feeds to the national data warehouse, making data easily accessible to different teams, maximising use and application. DISCUSSION: The national platform has provided a co-ordinated approach to PROMs collection in Wales, offering an effective means of communicating with patients outside the traditional clinic visit.","output":"First steps in PROMs and PREMs collection in Wales as part of the prudent and value-based healthcare agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: A variety of social and economic changes are happening worldwide due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, which has produced new problems and challenges for the population as a whole.

Both gases enable quantitative measurement of terminal airway morphology, while 129 Xe uniquely enables imaging the transfer of inhaled gas across the alveolar-capillary tissue barrier to the red blood cells. In patients with asthma, PfMRI abnormalities have been shown to reflect airway smooth muscle dysfunction, airway inflammation and remodelling, luminal occlusions and airway pruning. The method is rapid (8-15 s), cost-effective (~$300/scan) and very well tolerated in patients, even in those who are very young or very ill, because unlike computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography and single-photon emission CT, there is no ionizing radiation and the examination takes only a few seconds. However, PfMRI is not without limitations, which include the requirement of complex image analysis, specialized equipment and additional training and quality control. We provide an overview of the three main applications of hyperpolarized noble gas MRI in asthma research including: (1) inhaled gas distribution or ventilation imaging, (2) alveolar microstructure and finally (3) gas transfer into the alveolar-capillary tissue space and from the tissue barrier into red blood cells in the pulmonary microvasculature.

Apert syndrome and other syndromic craniofacial dysostoses are often characterized by hypertelorism, with a negative canthal axis and counterrotated orbits. Central midface hypoplasia can result in a biconcave face in both midsagittal and axial planes. Bipartition distraction can correct these facial abnormalities. METHODS Twenty patients (19 Apert syndrome patients and one Pfeiffer syndrome patient, aged 1.6 to 21 years) underwent bipartition distraction. Severity of appearance was graded preoperatively and postoperatively as mild, moderate, or severe. Functional problems were documented by a multidisciplinary team. Central and lateral midface skeletal advancement were measured. Follow-up ranged from 15 months to 7 years. RESULTS Bipartition distraction consistently produced more central than lateral facial advancement. Mean central advancement was 13.2  5.9 mm at sella-nasion and 11.7  5.4 mm at sella-A point. Lateral advancement was 4.7  2.8 mm. Unbending the face improved aesthetic appearance. Airway function, eye exposure, and elevated intracranial pressure were improved. Complications included six temporary cerebrospinal fluid leaks (four needing a lumbar drain), five patients with postoperative seizures, five patients requiring Rigid External Distraction frame repositioning, one palatal fistula, one velopharyngeal incompetence, five pin-site infections, one abscess under frontal bone, three cases of sepsis, nine patients with worsened strabismus, two patients with enophthalmos, one patient with partial visual field loss, and three patients who required reintubation because of aspiration.

Pure Machine Learning (ML) approaches often fail in the small sample regime and cannot provide actionable insights beyond predictions. A promising modification has been to incorporate expert domain knowledge into ML models. The application we consider is predicting the progression of disease under medications, where a plethora of domain knowledge is available from pharmacology. Pharmacological models describe the dynamics of carefully-chosen medically meaningful variables in terms of systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). However, these models only describe a limited collection of variables, and these variables are often not observable in clinical environments. To close this gap, we propose the latent hybridisation model (LHM) that integrates a system of expert-designed ODEs with machine-learned Neural ODEs to fully describe the dynamics of the system and to link the expert and latent variables to observable quantities. We evaluated LHM on synthetic data as well as real-world intensive care data of COVID-19 patients.

Are online studies with infants a suitable stand-in for laboratory-based studies? Across two unmonitored online experiments using a change-detection looking-time paradigm with 96 7-month-old infants, we found that infants did not exhibit measurable sensitivities to the basic shape information that distinguishes between 2D geometric forms, as had been observed in previous laboratory experiments. Moreover, while infants were distracted in our online experiments, such distraction was nevertheless not a reliable predictor of their ability to discriminate shape information. Our findings suggest that the change-detection paradigm may not elicit infants shape discrimination abilities when stimuli are presented on small, personal computer screens because infants may not perceive two discrete events with only one event displaying uniquely changing information that draws their attention. Some developmental paradigms used with infants, even those that seem well-suited to the constraints and goals of online data collection, may thus not yield results consistent with the laboratory results that rely on highly controlled settings and specialized equipment, such as large screens.

Experimentally measured structure factors have been used to determine and characterize charge density via the multipole model (MM) and the maximum entropy method (MEM). Theoretical investigation of the electron density and the electronic structure has been performed in the finite basis set density functional theory (DFT) framework. Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM), deformation densities and Laplacians maps have been used to compare theoretical and experimental results. MM experimental results and predictions from theory differ with respect to the sign and/or magnitude of the Laplacian at the N-O bond critical point (BCP), depending on the treatment of n values of the MM radial functions. Such Laplacian differences in the N-O bond case are discussed with respect to a lack of flexibility in the MM radial functions also reported by Rykounov et al. [Acta Cryst. (2011), B67, 425-436].

Using critical document analysis, the study found that the aviation sector was brought to a halt, costing billions of dollars in losses around the world. COVID-19 also resulted in job losses along the entire aviation industrys value chain and in related sectors; these were due to losses in passenger revenue, cargo revenue, air ticket refunds, fixed costs and increased parking fees for grounded aircraft, among other things.

Unlike coil embolization, often there remains residual post-procedural filling within the aneurysm with flow diverters, the curative reconstruction presumably occurring over a period of weeks. Thus, conventional grading scales for post-procedural aneurysm occlusion and recanalization are inadequate. The aim of this paper is to propose a new angiographic grading scale that addresses this fundamentally new treatment option. METHOD A five-point grading scale describes the location of residual flow within the aneurysm in the venous phase [grade 1: patent aneurysm with diffuse inflow; grade 2: residual filling of the aneurysm dome (saccular) or wall (fusiform); grade 3: only residual neck (saccular) or only intra-aneurysmal filling with former boundaries covered (fusiform); grade 4: complete occlusion]. FINDINGS Grade 0 represents any aneurysm, regardless of occlusion rate with early phase, coherent inflow jet. Intra-aneurysmal flow stagnation is categorized into: (a) none, (b) capillary phase, and (c) venous phase. Prevailing parent vessel hemodynamics with in-stent stenosis (ISS) are divided into none (ISS0), mild (ISS1), moderate (ISS2), severe (ISS3), and total (ISS4) occlusion. The proposed grading scales allow assessment of the hemodynamic consequences of stent placement on endosaccular in-flow, stasis, and location of stasis as well as parent vessel hemodynamics.

South Carolina (SC) is one of the states which reopened early and then suffered from a sharp increase of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility to predict daily new cases at both state- and county- levels in SC. METHODS: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020 in SC and its top five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases. Daily new case was calculated by subtracting the cumulative confirmed cases of previous day from the total cases. Population mobility was assessed using the number of users with travel distance larger than 0.5 mile which was calculated based on their geotagged twitters. Poisson count time series model was employed to carry out the research goals. RESULTS: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence and those of the top five counties (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, Richland). At the state-level, final model with time window within the last 7-day had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6%for the next 3-, 7-, 14- days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9-, 14-, 28-, 20-, and 9- days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3% to 74.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Population mobility was positively associated with COVID-19 incidences at both state- and county- levels in SC.

Among the different technologies to achieve air sanification, the ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is a trending technique, also due to the fast development of more and more effective ultra-violet LED sources, that are expected to replace the mercury vapor lamps in the next few years. The positioning of LEDs inside cavities with highly reflective surfaces permits an enhancement of the internal irradiance and the development of compact devices. Optical simulations, by means of ray tracing, are fundamental, since an accurate irradiance estimation in presence of multiple internal reflections, scattering, light leaks outside the cav-ity and the sources angular emission distribution is not possible with only analytical calculations. Ray tracing permits to model the spatial irradiance inside the cavity by varying the components parameters to maximize the inactivation rate as a function of the air flow field.

The pandemic period compared to pre-pandemic had fewer overall admissions (27,349 vs 36,578, P < 0.001), fewer with AUD (17.6% vs 18.4%, P = 0.008) but a higher proportion of alcohol dependents (3.7% vs 3.0%, P < 0.0001). In the pandemic those with AUD were more likely to be male (P = 0.003), white (P < 0.001), in relationship (P < 0.001), of higher socioeconomic background (P < 0.001), have alcohol-related mental disorders (P = 0.002), emergency admission (P < 0.001), medical speciality admission (P < 0.001) and shorter length of stay (P < 0.033) compared to pre-pandemic AUD. Covid-19 positive patients with concomitant AUD died at younger age (P < 0.05) than Covid-19 positive patients at low risk for AUD. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic changed the characteristics of inpatients with AUD. There was a higher proportion of alcohol-dependent admissions with evidence that a younger, less deprived group have been significantly impacted. UAS provides a useful tool to screen for AUD and to identify the change when facing sudden health crises.","output":"The Effect of Covid-19 on Alcohol Use Disorder and the Role of Universal Alcohol Screening in an Inpatient Setting: A Retrospective Cohort Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the implementation of social distancing and home confinement measures may elevate the risk of vitamin D deficiency particularly for infants.

METHODS: We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. FINDINGS: Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days. INTERPRETATION: The consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.

Procedures involving the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) are routinely non-aerosolizing but have the potential for rapid patient deterioration, creating the need for aerosolizing generating procedures. Multiple societal and governmental guidelines on the use of PPE during medical procedures are available on Internet websites; however, there is limited literature available in peer-reviewed formats in this context. This study aims to provide an overview of current PPE donning and doffing protocols specific to the catheterization laboratory. Methods: A series of internet searches regarding donning and doffing of PPE in the CCL including published articles and internet protocols were compiled and compared using Pubmed.gov, Google.com, www.twitter.com, and www.youtube.com. Results: Most institutions used N95 masks, shoe covers, at least one head covering, face shield or goggles, two pairs of gloves, and inner and outer gowns. Doffing variation was greater than donning. Doffing has the potential to contaminate the healthcare worker (HCW), and therefore, this step of PPE management requires further study. Common steps in temporal priority included cleaning of gloved hands, removal of outer (or only) gown, removal of outer gloves, repeat gloved hand cleaning, removal of facial PPE last, and a final non-gloved hand cleaning. Conclusions: This analysis provides a summary of commonly used practices that may be considered when designing CCL-specific PPE protocols. Analysis of consistent steps from the literature led the authors to formulate a suggested protocol for CCL HCWs when performing procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected/unknown COVID-19.","output":"Personal Protective Equipment and Donning and Doffing Techniques in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights From an Internet Search for Protocols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major public health threat. This study aims to evaluate the effect of virus mutation activities and policy interventions on COVID-19 transmissibility in Hong Kong. METHODS: In this study, we integrated the genetic activities of multiple proteins, and quantified the effect of government interventions and mutation activities against the time-varying effective reproduction number R(t). FINDINGS: We found a significantly positive relationship between R(t) and mutation activities and a significantly negative relationship between R(t) and government interventions. The results showed that the mutations that contributed most to the increase of R(t) were from the spike, nucleocapsid and ORF1b genes. Policy of prohibition on group gathering was estimated to have the largest impact on mitigating virus transmissibility. The model explained 63.2% of the R(t) variability with the R(2). CONCLUSION: Our study provided a convenient framework to estimate the effect of genetic contribution and government interventions on pathogen transmissibility. We showed that the S, N and ORF1b protein had significant contribution to the increase of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong, while restrictions of public gathering and suspension of face-to-face class are the most effective government interventions strategies.","output":"Quantifying the effect of government interventions and virus mutations on transmission advantage during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Interferon alpha (IFN-) is an approved medication for chronic hepatitis B therapy. Besides acting as an immunomodulator, IFN- elicits a pleiotropic antiviral state in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected hepatocytes, but whether or not IFN- impedes the late steps of the HBV life cycle, such as HBV secretion, remains elusive. Here we report that IFN- treatment of HepAD38 cells with established HBV replication selectively reduced HBV virion release without altering intracellular viral replication or the secretion of HBV subviral particles and nonenveloped capsids. In search of the interferon-stimulated gene(s) that is responsible for the reduction of HBV virion release, we found that tetherin, a broad-spectrum antiviral transmembrane protein that inhibits the egress of a variety of enveloped viruses, was highly induced by IFN- in HepAD38 cells and in primary human hepatocytes. We further demonstrated that the expression of full-length tetherin, but not the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor-truncated form, inhibited HBV virion egress from HepAD38 cells. In addition, GPI anchor-truncated tetherin exhibited a dominant-negative effect and was incorporated into the liberated virions. We also found colocalization of tetherin and HBV L protein at the intracellular multivesicular body, where the budding of HBV virions takes place. In line with this, electron microscopy demonstrated that HBV virions were tethered in the lumen of the cisterna membrane under tetherin expression. Finally, knockdown of tetherin or overexpression of dominant negative tetherin attenuated the IFN--mediated reduction of HBV virion release. Taken together, our study suggests that IFN- inhibits HBV virion egress from hepatocytes through the induction of tetherin. IMPORTANCE Tetherin is a host restriction factor that blocks the egress of a variety of enveloped viruses through tethering the budding virions on the cell surface with its membrane anchor domains. Here we report that interferon directly and selectively inhibits the secretion of HBV virions, but not subviral particles or nonenveloped capsids, through the induction of tetherin in hepatocyte-derived cells. The antiviral function of tetherin requires the carboxyl-terminal GPI anchor, while the GPI anchor deletion mutant exhibits dominant negative activity and attaches to liberated HBV virions. Consistent with the fact that HBV is an intracellular budding virus, microscopy analyses demonstrated that the tethering of HBV virions occurs in the intracellular cisterna and that tetherin colocalizes with HBV virions on the multivesicular body, which is the HBV virion budding site. Our study not only expands the antiviral spectrum of tetherin but also sheds light on the mechanisms of interferon-elicited anti-HBV responses.","output":"The Interferon-Inducible Protein Tetherin Inhibits Hepatitis B Virus Virion Secretion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS) is a delayed infrequent potentially life-threatening idiosyncratic drug reaction. Aromatic anticonvulsants and allopurinol are the most frequent causative agents. However, various reports of antibiotic-induced DRESS are available. In this review, we try to summarize reports of antibacterial antibiotic-induced DRESS focusing on characteristics of DRESS induced by each antibiotic group. METHODS: The data were collected by searching PubMed/MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. The keywords used as search terms were DRESS syndrome, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), antibiotics, antimicrobial, and names of various antimicrobial groups. Finally, 254 relevant cases with a definite or probable diagnosis of DRESS based on RegiSCAR criteria were found until 30 May 2020 and reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Totally, 254 cases of antibacterial antibiotic-induced DRESS are reported. Most of them are related to antituberculosis drugs, vancomycin, and sulfonamides, respectively. Rash and fever were most frequent clinical findings. Eosinophilia and liver injury were the most reported hematologic and visceral organ involvement, respectively.

The best ARIMA models are Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results show that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to stabilize; ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19 infections in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively; and iii) Russia and the USA will require much more time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near zero. This may suggest the importance of the application of quick and effective lockdown measures, which have been relatively stricter in Italy.

Methods: We designed a prospective Italian multicentric study to assess humoral and T-cell response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients (n=378) with solid tumors (ST), hematological malignancies (HM), neurological (ND) and immuno-rheumatological diseases (ID). The immunogenicity of primary vaccination schedule and of the booster dose were analyzed. Results: Overall, patient seroconversion rate after two doses was 62.1%. A significant lower rate was observed in HM (52.4%) and ID (51.9%) patients compared to ST (95.6%) and ND (70.7%); a lower median level of antibodies was detected in HM and ID versus the others (p<0.0001). A similar rate of patients with a positive SARS-CoV2 T-cell response was observed in all disease groups, with a higher level observed in the ND group. The booster dose improved humoral responses in all disease groups, although with a lower response in HM patients, while the T-cell response increased similarly in all groups. In the multivariable logistic model, the independent predictors for seroconversion were disease subgroups, type of therapies and age. Notably, the ongoing treatment known to affect the immune system was associated with the worst humoral response to vaccination (p<0.0001), but had no effects on the T-cell responses. Conclusions: Immunosuppressive treatment more than disease type per se is a risk factor for low humoral response after vaccination.

A decrease of approximately 0.8-fold in amino acids (L-glutamic acid, D-glutamine and L-tyrosine) and an increase of 2-fold in phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were observed in hepatic disease patients with HBV replication. Moreover, downregulation of arachidonic acid, PC 34:2, sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoylglycerophosphoinositol and 1-oleoylglycerophosphoinositol by 0.6-fold was also found in the serum of patients with HBV replication. In addition, liver function was significantly different between cirrhosis patients with or without HBV replication (p < 0.05). In summary, this is the first study to focus on the metabolic changes induced by HBV replication in patients and to compare metabolic alterations in the progression of hepatic disease induced by HBV infection. High levels of amino acid depletion and PC and LPC biosynthesis were primarily observed, which may shed new light on the pathogenesis and treatment of HBV infection.","output":"Significant metabolic alterations in patients with hepatitis B virus replication observed via serum untargeted metabolomics shed new light on hepatitis B virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prediction of the COVID-19 incidence rate is a matter of global importance, particularly in the United States. As of 4 June 2020, more than 1.8 million confirmed cases and over 108 thousand deaths have been reported in this country. Few studies have examined nationwide modeling of COVID-19 incidence in the United States particularly using machine-learning algorithms. Thus, we collected and prepared a database of 57 candidate explanatory variables to examine the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network in predicting the cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates across the continental United States. Our results indicated that a single-hidden-layer MLP could explain almost 65% of the correlation with ground truth for the holdout samples. Sensitivity analysis conducted on this model showed that the age-adjusted mortality rates of ischemic heart disease, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia, together with two socioeconomic and environmental factors (median household income and total precipitation), are among the most substantial factors for predicting COVID-19 incidence rates. Moreover, results of the logistic regression model indicated that these variables could explain the presence/absence of the hotspots of disease incidence that were identified by Getis-Ord Gi* (p < 0.05) in a geographic information system environment.

Since the accuracy may have altered by changes in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, indications for testing, sampling and testing procedures, and roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination, we evaluated the performance of three prevailing SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we consecutively enrolled individuals aged >16 years presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing at three Dutch public health service COVID-19 test sites. In the first phase, participants underwent either BD-Veritor System (Becton Dickinson), PanBio (Abbott), or SD-Biosensor (Roche Diagnostics) testing with routine sampling procedures. In a subsequent phase, participants underwent SD-Biosensor testing with a less invasive sampling method (combined oropharyngeal-nasal [OP-N] swab). Diagnostic accuracies were assessed against molecular testing. RESULTS: Six thousand nine hundred fifty-five of 7005 participants (99%) with results from both an Ag-RDT and a molecular reference test were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and overall sensitivities were 13% (188/1441) and 69% (129/188, 95% CI 62C75) for BD-Veritor, 8% (173/2056) and 69% (119/173, 61C76) for PanBio, and 12% (215/1769) and 74% (160/215, 68C80) for SD-Biosensor with routine sampling and 10% (164/1689) and 75% (123/164, 68C81) for SD-Biosensor with OP-N sampling. In those symptomatic or asymptomatic at sampling, sensitivities were 72C83% and 54C56%, respectively. Above a viral load cut-off (5.2 log(10) SARS-CoV-2 E-gene copies/mL), sensitivities were 86% (125/146, 79C91) for BD-Veritor, 89% (108/121, 82C94) for PanBio, and 88% (160/182, 82C92) for SD-Biosensor with routine sampling and 84% (118/141, 77C89) with OP-N sampling. Specificities were >99% for all tests in most analyses. Sixty-one per cent of false-negative Ag-RDT participants returned for testing within 14 days (median: 3 days, interquartile range 3) of whom 90% tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: Overall sensitivities of three SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs were 69C75%, increasing to 86% above a viral load cut-off. The decreased sensitivity among asymptomatic participants and high positivity rate during follow-up in false-negative Ag-RDT participants emphasise the need for education of the public about the importance of re-testing after an initial negative Ag-RDT should symptoms develop. For SD-Biosensor, the diagnostic accuracy with OP-N and deep nasopharyngeal sampling was similar; adopting the more convenient sampling method might reduce the threshold for professional testing.

However, the risks of physical activity are less well documented. The fear of exacerbating symptoms and causing adverse events is a persuasive barrier to physical activity in this population. This work aimed to agree clear statements for use by healthcare professionals about medical risks of physical activity for people living with LTCs through expert consensus. These statements addressed the following questions: (1) Is increasing physical activity safe for people living with one or more LTC? (2) Are the symptoms and clinical syndromes associated with common LTCs aggravated in the short or long term by increasing physical activity levels? (3) What specific risks should healthcare professionals consider when advising symptomatic people with one or more LTCs to increase their physical activity levels? METHODS: Statements were developed in a multistage process, guided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool. A patient and clinician involvement process, a rapid literature review and a steering group workshop informed the development of draft symptom and syndrome-based statements. We then tested and refined the draft statements and supporting evidence using a three-stage modified online Delphi study, incorporating a multidisciplinary expert panel with a broad range of clinical specialties. RESULTS: Twenty-eight experts completed the Delphi process. All statements achieved consensus with a final agreement between 88.5%C96.5%. Five impact statements conclude that (1) for people living with LTCs, the benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks, (2) despite the risks being very low, perceived risk is high, (3) person-centred conversations are essential for addressing perceived risk, (4) everybody has their own starting point and (5) people should stop and seek medical attention if they experience a dramatic increase in symptoms. In addition, eight symptom/syndrome-based statements discuss specific risks for musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, cardiac chest pain, palpitations, dysglycaemia, cognitive impairment and falls and frailty. CONCLUSION: Clear, consistent messaging on risk across healthcare will improve people living with LTCs confidence to be physically active. Addressing the fear of adverse events on an individual level will help healthcare professionals affect meaningful behavioural change in day-to-day practice. Evidence does not support routine preparticipation medical clearance for people with stable LTCs if they build up gradually from their current level. The need for medical guidance, as opposed to clearance, should be determined by individuals with specific concerns about active symptoms. As part of a system-wide approach, consistent messaging from healthcare professionals around risk will also help reduce cross-sector barriers to engagement for this population.","output":"Benefits outweigh the risks: a consensus statement on the risks of physical activity for people living with long-term conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSIONS COVERED Tuesday Sessions Impact of the Election on the Capital Markets State of the Market Keynote: Global Megatrends Leveraged Loan Sector Trends Housing Market Trends Private-label RMBS Including Non-QM LIBOR Cessation: Is the Loan Market Ready?

Upon PAMP detection, diverse defensive responses are induced by the host, including those that promote inflammation and cell-intrinsic antimicrobial activities. Host-encoded molecules released from dying or damaged cells, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), also induce defensive responses. Both DAMPs and PAMPs are recognized for their inflammatory potential, but only the latter are well established to stimulate cell-intrinsic host defense. Here, we report a class of DAMPs that engender an antiviral state in human epithelial cells. These DAMPs include oxPAPC (oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), PGPC (1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl phosphatidylcholine), and POVPC [1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine], oxidized lipids that are naturally released from dead or dying cells. Exposing cells to these DAMPs prior to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection limits viral replication. Mechanistically, these DAMPs prevent viral entry, thereby limiting the percentage of cells that are productively infected and consequently restricting viral load. We found that the antiviral actions of oxidized lipids are distinct from those mediated by the PAMP Poly I:C, in that the former induces a more rapid antiviral response without the induction of the interferon response. These data support a model whereby interferon-independent defensive activities can be induced by DAMPs, which may limit viral replication before PAMP-mediated interferon responses are induced. This antiviral activity may impact viruses that disrupt interferon responses in the oxygenated environment of the lung, such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE In this work, we explored how a class of oxidized lipids, spontaneously created during tissue damage and unprogrammed cell lysis, block the earliest events in RNA virus infection in the human epithelium. This gives us novel insight into the ways that we view infection models, unveiling a built-in mechanism to slow viral growth that neither engages the interferon response nor is subject to known viral antagonism. These oxidized phospholipids act prior to infection, allowing time for other, better-known innate immune mechanisms to take effect. This discovery broadens our understanding of host defenses, introducing a soluble factor that alters the cellular environment to protect from RNA virus infection.","output":"Interferon-Independent Restriction of RNA Virus Entry and Replication by a Class of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Subway station emergencies are gradually increasing in China.

Secondly, the heterogeneity of passengers decision preference is quantified by the random parameter logit model. Finally, personality traits and influencing factors are used as abscissa and ordinate respectively, to study the relationship between personality traits and preference heterogeneity. The results show that the coefficients of Dist, Pedestrian flow and Crowd density are ?0.101, 0.236 and ?0.442 respectively, which are statistically significant. The proportion of extroverted passengers of the exit is 9% higher than that of introverted passengers when Pedestrian flow of the exit is greater than the average value, while the proportion of introverted passengers is 7% higher than that of extroverted passengers when Crowd density is smaller than the average value. The conclusion is that the three influence factors are random variables, and Dist shows the lowest level of heterogeneity.

Unlike previous methods that assume a shared changepoint at all spatial locations or ignore spatial correlation, our method treats changepoints as a spatial process. This allows our model to respect spatial heterogeneity and exploit spatial correlations to improve estimation. Our method is derived from the ubiquitous cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic that dominates changepoint detection in functional time series. However, instead of directly searching for the maximum of the CUSUM based processes, we build spatially correlated two-piece linear models with appropriate variance structure to locate all changepoints at once. The proposed linear model approach increases the robustness of our method to variability in the CUSUM process, which, combined with our spatial correlation model, improves changepoint estimation near the edges. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies that our method outperforms existing functional changepoint estimators in terms of both estimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification, under either weak and strong spatial correlation, and weak and strong change signals. Finally, we demonstrate our method using a temperature data set and a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) study.","output":"Bayesian Changepoint Estimation for Spatially Indexed Functional Time Series (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A retrospective multicentric study gathered 1439 CT chest studies with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affection.

The purpose of the study is to assess COVID-19 standardized assessment schemes (CO-RADS and COVID-RADS lexicons) applicability and diagnostic efficacy. RESULTS: This study included 991 RT-PCR-confirmed CT studies. An almost perfect agreement was found in COVID-RADS among the three observers (Fleiss Kappa = 0.82), opposed by a substantial agreement in CO-RADS ( = 0.78). The preference records favor COVID-RADS/CO-RADS in 78.5%/12.5%, 75.5%/24.5%, and 73.4%/24.5% regarding the three radiologists records, respectively. The distinguishability between positive and negative RT-PCR cases was 0.92 for COVID-RADS, while it was 0.85 for CO-RADS. On the other hand, both lexicons performance regarding clinical diagnosis and clinical suspicion index was 0.93 for COVID-RADS and 0.94 for CO-RADS.

Recent works have utilized sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) pipelines which include rule-based or machine learning analytics to uncover patterns from text to inform clinical endpoints and biomarker information. While deep learning methods have come to the forefront of NLP, there have been limited comparisons with the performance of other machine learning methods in extracting key insights for prediction of medical procedure information (Current Procedural Terminology; CPT codes), that informs insurance claims, medical research, and healthcare policy and utilization. Additionally, the utility of combining and ranking information from multiple report subfields as compared to exclusively using the diagnostic field for the prediction of CPT codes and signing pathologist remains unclear. Methods: After passing pathology reports through a preprocessing pipeline, we utilized advanced topic modeling techniques such as UMAP and LDA to identify topics with diagnostic relevance in order to characterize a cohort of 93,039 pathology reports at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (DPLM). We separately compared XGBoost, SVM, and BERT methodologies for prediction of 38 different CPT codes using 5-fold cross validation, using both the diagnostic text only as well as text from all subfields. We performed similar analyses for characterizing text from a group of the twenty pathologists with the most pathology report sign-outs. Finally, we interpreted report and cohort level important words using TF-IDF, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), attention, and integrated gradients. Results: We identified 10 topics for both the diagnostic-only and all-fields text, which pertained to diagnostic and procedural information respectively. The topics were associated with select CPT codes, pathologists and report clusters. Operating on the diagnostic text alone, XGBoost performed similarly to BERT for prediction of CPT codes. When utilizing all report subfields, XGBoost outperformed BERT for prediction of CPT codes, though XGBoost and BERT performed similarly for prediction of signing pathologist. Both XGBoost and BERT outperformed SVM. Utilizing additional subfields of the pathology report increased prediction accuracy for the CPT code and pathologist classification tasks. Misclassification of pathologist was largely subspecialty related. We identified text that is CPT and pathologist specific. Conclusions: Our approach generated CPT code predictions with an accuracy higher than that reported in previous literature. While diagnostic text is an important information source for NLP pipelines in pathology, additional insights may be extracted from other report subfields. Although deep learning approaches did not outperform XGBoost approaches, they may lend valuable information to pipelines that combine image, text and -omics information.

Severe LUTS was associated with a greater odds of individual frailty components exhaustion and low physical activity. CONCLUSION The prevalence of phenotypic frailty is higher among older community-dwelling men with moderate or severe LUTS compared with those with mild or no LUTS. The positive association between LUTS severity and frailty among older men appears independent of age and known frailty risk factors. Although the temporal direction of this association and the utility of LUTS or frailty interventions in this population remain unclear, the high co-occurrence of these conditions could lead to earlier identification of frailty when clinically appropriate.","output":"Co-Occurrence of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Frailty among Community-Dwelling Older Men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The number of people actively participating in society has decreased following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a result of the measures taken to reduce the risk of transmission, such as interruption to education, social isolation, and curfews. Accordingly, change in the etiology of emergency surgery and characteristics of patients may be expected. The current study aimed to compare emergency surgery between the COVID-19 pre-pandemic and pandemic periods and to present the data and emergency anesthesia management of patients with suspected COVID-19. METHODS Patients who underwent emergency surgery in our hospital between January 22 and April 29, 2020, were examined retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: Those operated before March 11, 2020 (Group 1) and those operated from this date April 29, 2020 (Group 2). The data of the two groups were compared. Routine emergency anesthesia and surgical approach were applied to all patients in Group 1 and those without suspected COVID-19 in Group 2. Patients with suspected COVID-19 in Group 2 were treated with an algorithm created in accordance with the guidelines of official institutions and scientific associations. RESULTS Age, gender, chronic medical diseases, ASA classification, Mallampati score, surgical department, surgical procedures, surgical etiology, duration of surgery, and length of hospital stay were similar in both groups. The number of patients undergoing general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia was 198 (82.5%) and 42 (17.5%) for Group 1 while it was 161 (73.9%) and 57 (26.1%), respectively, for Group 2 (p=0.025). CONCLUSION The clinical data and surgical features of emergency patients during the pandemic were similar to those before the pandemic; however, the rate of spinal anesthesia was higher in the former. Personal protective equipment standards should be followed to prevent cross-infection among the anesthesiology team during anesthesia procedures for emergency operations. We consider that necessary emergency interventions can be safely performed and COVID-19 nosocomial infection can be prevented in the operating room by following the Ministry of Health recommendations and guidelines that are updated regularly.","output":"Evaluation of emergency operations and anesthesia procedures used in surgical emergencies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to increased bacterial multi-drug resistance (MDR), there is an antibiotic depletion to treat infectious diseases. Consequently, other promising options have emerged, such as the antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation therapy (aPDI) based in photosensitizer (PS) compounds to produce light-activated local oxidative stress (photooxidative stress). However, there are scarce studies regarding the mode of action of PSs compound to induce photooxidative stress on pathogenic ?3-proteobacteria such as MDR-Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODOLOGY: The mode of action exerted by the cationic Ir(III)-based PS (PSIR-3) to inhibit the growth of K. pneumoniae was analyzed. RT-qPCR determined the transcriptional response induced by PSIR-3 on bacteria treated with aPDI. The expression levels of genes associated with a bacterial oxidative response, such as oxyR and sodA, and the extracytoplasmic, regulators rpoE and hfq were determined. Also, were determined the transcriptional response of the extracytoplasmic factors mrkD, acrB, magA, and rmpA. RESULTS: At 17 W/cm2 photon flux and 4 g/mL of the PSIR-3 compound, the K. pneumoniae growth was inhibited in 3 log10. Compared with untreated bacteria, the transcriptional response induced by PSIR-3 occurs via the extracytoplasmic sigma factor rpoE and hfq. In contrast, no participation in the oxyR pathway or induction of the sodA gene was observed. This response was accompanied by the upregulation of the extracytoplasmic virulence factors mrkD, magA, and rmpA. CONCLUSIONS: APDI produced by PSIR-3 kills K. pneumoniae and may induce damage to the bacterial envelope that the bacterium tries to avoid by activation of extracytoplasmic factors mediated through the rpoE regulon.","output":"The mode of action of the PSIR-3 photosensitizer in the photodynamic inactivation of Klebsiella pneumoniae by the production of type II ROS activates RpoE-regulated extracytoplasmic factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanisms of interaction between Bordetella pertussis and other viral agents are yet to be fully explored.

At the same time, with the recovery of social production activities, China has become the only country which achieves positive growth in 2020 in the major economies. It entered the post pandemic period. These measures improved the local environmental quality. However, whether this improvement can be sustained is also a problem that needs to be solved. So, this study investigated the changes of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and CO) in the nine cities most severely affected by the pandemic in China during the lockdown and post pandemic period. We emphasized that when analyzing the changes of environmental quality during the epidemic, we must consider not only the impact of the day and short-term changesbut also the cumulative lag effect and sustainable development. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, it is found that the concentration of pollutants decreased significantly during the lockdown compared to the situation before the epidemic. PM10 and [Formula: see text] are falling most, which downs 39% and 46% respectively. During the lockdown period, the pollutant concentrations response to the pandemic has a lag of 3C7 days. More specifically, in the cities related to single pollutants, the impact on the pollutant shows a significant correlation when the measures are delayed for seven days. In the cities that are related to multiple pollutants, the correlation is usually highest in 3C5 days. This means that the impact of policy measures on the environment lasted for 3C5 days. Besides, Wuhan, Jingmen and Jingzhou have seen the most obvious improvement. However, this improvement did not last. In the post pandemic period, the pollutants rebounded, the growth rates of PM10 and [Formula: see text] reached 44% and 87% in September. When compared with the changes of pollutants concentration in the same period from 2017 to 2019, the decline rate has also been significantly slower, even higher than the average concentration of previous years. The research not only contributes to China's economic green recovery plan during the post epidemic period, but also provides references for environmental governance during economic recovery in other countries.","output":"How do pollutants change post-pandemic?

Buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is associated with improved pregnancy and fetal outcomes, but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were multiple barriers to accessing buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy. Care disruptions during the pandemic may have further exacerbated these already existing barriers. To quantify these changes, we examined trends in the number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We estimated an interrupted time series model using linked national pharmacy claims and medical claims data from May 2019 to December 2020. We estimated changes in the level and trend in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then stratified our analyses by payer. Results: We identified 2,947 pregnant patients filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions. Before the pandemic, there was positive growth in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone (4.83% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.40% to 6.26%). During the pandemic, the monthly growth rate in individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone declined for both patients on commercial insurance and patients on Medicaid (all payers: -5.53% (95% CI: -7.28% to -3.78%); Medicaid: -7.66% (95% CI: -10.42% to -4.90%); Commercial: -3.59% (95% CI: -5.53% to -1.66%)).

This study analyses the temporal dynamic of detected vs. undetected cases to provide guidance for the interpretation of prevalence studies performed with PCR or antibody tests to estimate the detection rate. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to evaluate assumptions on the detection probability ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. For each general detection probability, we derived age-dependent detection probabilities and calibrated the model to reproduce the epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Austria from March 2020 to June 2020. We categorized infected individuals into presymptomatic, symptomatic unconfirmed, confirmed and never detected to observe the simulated dynamic of the detected and undetected cases. RESULTS: The calculation of the age-dependent detection probability ruled values lower than 0.4 as most likely. Furthermore, the proportion of undetected cases depends strongly on the dynamic of the epidemic wave: during the initial upswing, the undetected cases account for a major part of all infected individuals, whereas their share decreases around the peak of the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of prevalence studies performed to determine the detection rate of COVID-19 patients should always be interpreted with regard to the current dynamic of the epidemic wave. Applying the method proposed in our analysis, the prevalence study performed in Austria in April 2020 could indicate a detection rate of 0.13, instead of the prevalent ratio of 0.29 between detected and estimated undetected cases at that time.","output":"Evaluation of undetected cases during the COVID-19 epidemic in Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While Republican states have been criticized for their limited efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, it is important to consider that political orientation can modify human behaviour via complex effects that are still poorly understood.

First, republicanism was associated with increased mobility when the stringency of anti-COVID measures increased. Second, republicanism was associated with decreased mobility when COVID-related deaths increased. Third, republicanism was associated with increased mobility over time, i.e. as time went by, citizens living in Republican states were more mobile than those in Democratic states. These findings raise caution on any over-interpretation of the impact of polarization in US politics on COVID-related behaviour.

Monitoring Cardiac Output (CO) and Stroke volume (SV) trends over the course of treatment may provide insight into cardiac function and may be used to predict patient outcome. The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between the change in stroke volume and outcome in critically ill patients. METHODS: The Starling Registry study is an observational registry study evaluating trends in CO and SV over time as related to patient outcome (NCT04648293). Patients that exhibited an overall improvement in SV (first SV measurement compared to last SV measurement) were compared to those who did not exhibit improvement. RESULTS: 127 critical care patients received hemodynamic monitoring during their ICU stay across two different hospitals. 51 % were female, and the average age was 64 years. 64% of the patients had sepsis, and 15% of patients were positive for COVID. The average time between first and last SV measurement was approximately 7 hours. Notably, patients who exhibited an overall improvement in SV exhibited a decrease in mortality (14.9%) compared to those who did not improve (35.0%, p=0.018) CONCLUSIONS: We have previously shown that patients who show an improvement in SV in response to the resuscitation exhibited improved outcome.

Immunochemistry in the live lobules indicated that the pancreatic immune cells most likely are macrophages. In the normal pancreas the density of these cells is very low, but induction of acute pancreatitis (AP), by a combination of ethanol and fatty acids, markedly increased the number of the immune cells. The principal agent eliciting Ca(2+) signals in the pancreatic immune cells was ATP, but these cells also frequently produced Ca(2+) signals in response to acetylcholine and to high concentrations of bradykinin. Pharmacological studies, using specific purinergic agonists and antagonists, indicated that the ATP-elicited Ca(2+) signals were mediated by both P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptors. The pancreatic immune cells were not electrically excitable and the Ca(2+) signals generated by ATP were primarily due to release of Ca(2+) from internal stores followed by store-operated Ca(2+) entry through Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channels. The ATP-induced intracellular Ca(2+) liberation was dependent on both IP(3) generation and IP(3) receptors.

Here, we investigated the effect of renal tubular Hnrnpf deletion on hyperfiltration and kidney injury in Akita mice, a model of type 1 diabetes. METHODS Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice were generated through crossbreeding tubule-specific (Pax8)-Cre mice with Akita floxed-Hnrnpf mice on a C57BL/6 background. Male non-diabetic control (Ctrl), Akita, and Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice were studied up to the age of 24 weeks (n = 8/group). RESULTS Akita mice exhibited elevated systolic blood pressure as compared with Ctrl mice, which was significantly higher in Akita HnrnpfRT KO mice than Akita mice.

METHODS: We used a model to manage the PWEs during the outbreak. Questionnaire survey and hospital data were used to explore whether PWEs under our management were affected by the virus. RESULTS: A total of 118 (78.7%) PWEs completed the survey. During the \\"model period,\\" 22.9% (27/118) of the respondents reported antiepileptic drug (AEDs) discontinuity, including six (22.2%) PWEs who failed to purchase AEDs. Of the patients, 40.7% (22/54) failed to attend ordinary clinic, which was higher than that during the \\"period before model\\" (7.9%, 5/63). The common causes were movement limits (77.3%) and appointment failure (54.5%). A shift from ordinary clinic toward remote consultation was observed. Of the PWEs, 15.7% (13/83) referred to online pharmacy. 87.5% (14/16) of emergencies related to epilepsy were timely treated. 48.3%of PWEs thought that the epidemic had an impact on accessing medical services. Hospital data indicated that a decline in ordinary clinic visit, inpatient, surgery, and emergency attendance was observed in January and February 2020 and an increase in March 2020, as the epidemic mitigated. By contrast, online clinic visit soared in February, when the outbreak hit hard. In addition, we found no cross-infection of COVID-19 in our hospital and respondents.

It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19.

MIM apps typically come with a myriad of features that educators may leverage to increase student learning. However, it remains poorly understood to what extent and in what aspect MIM can facilitate student engagement. We address the gap by comparing the effects of using MIM and asynchronous online discussion (AOD) on student online engagement, using a quasi-experimental study involving a historical cohort control group. Understanding which communication mode can better promote student online engagement is particularly important during the current widespread use of online learning. Specifically, we examined engagement from the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions. The results showed that the MIM group was more behaviorally engaged in discussion activities, producing more messages, more words, and higher rates of participation, task completion, and interaction. Emotionally, no statistically significant difference was found in students affective evaluation of course interaction and satisfaction between the two groups. However, MIM appeared to help students with improved intimacy and interpersonal relationships. Cognitively, the MIM group was more engaged than the AOD group.

However, Wikidata may not always have the right schema for the urgent questions. In this paper, we address this problem by showing how a data schema required for the integration can be modeled with entity schemas represented by Shape Expressions.

The computed tomographic angiography (CTA) spot sign is a promising predictor of expansion; however, frequency and predictive values are variable across studies, possibly because of differences in onset-to-CTA time. We performed a patient-level meta-analysis to define the relationship between onset-to-CTA time and frequency and predictive ability of the spot sign. METHODS We completed a systematic review for studies of CTA spot sign and hematoma expansion. We subsequently pooled patient-level data on the frequency and predictive values for significant hematoma expansion according to 5 predefined categorized onset-to-CTA times. We calculated spot-sign frequency both as raw and frequency-adjusted rates. RESULTS Among 2051 studies identified, 12 met our inclusion criteria. Baseline hematoma volume, spot-sign status, and time-to-CTA were available for 1176 patients, and 1039 patients had follow-up computed tomographies for hematoma expansion analysis. The overall spot sign frequency was 26%, decreasing from 39% within 2 hours of onset to 13% beyond 8 hours (P<0.001). There was a significant decrease in hematoma expansion in spot-positive patients as onset-to-CTA time increased (P=0.004), with positive predictive values decreasing from 53% to 33%. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of the CTA spot sign is inversely related to intracerebral hemorrhage onset-to-CTA time. Furthermore, the positive predictive value of the spot sign for significant hematoma expansion decreases as time-to-CTA increases.

It is a growing concern amongst doctors, particularly in oncology, who face the added stress of delivering life changing results to patients and managing end of life care. This has potential for negatively impacting mental health, job satisfaction and ultimately patient care. This has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty around complex oncological treatment decisions, longer working hours, redeployment, and constant changes to working patterns to meet the evolving clinical need. In response to this, a novel wellbeing intervention was designed by the educational lead consultant and psychologists to prevent burnout during the pandemic. Methods: Junior doctors working at a single UK cancer centre during the COVID-19 pandemic were invited to attend weekly 30 minute wellbeing sessions facilitated by a clinical psychologist throughout their oncology placement (average 4-6 months). Sessions had an average attendance of 3-6 doctors and began with a 5 minute breathing and relaxation exercise followed by a mixture of clinical debriefing, reflective practice, and mindfulness strategies. Trainees were invited to have individual sessions if required. Surveys based on the 14 point Warwick Edinburgh Well Being Scale (WEMWBS) were conducted at the start and end of placement. Additional qualitative feedback was collated. Results:Throughout a 6 month period, 10 doctors participated in this study. Baseline WEMWBS scores revealed average mental wellbeing (n = 8), high mental wellbeing (n = 1) and probable depression (n = 1). Median baseline WEMWBS score was 52(41-62). Median number of sessions attended was 11(3-14). Post intervention, there was no significant deterioration in baseline WEMWBS score (mean change +2.2;p= 0.34). When doctors were asked about their optimism for the future, there was a significant increase by +0.4 points (p= 0.037). With respect to participant feedback, 100% were either 'satisfied' (n = 1) or 'very satisfied' (n = 9) with the group facilitation and 100% found the group sessions either 'helpful' (n = 7) or 'very helpful' (n = 3). Trainee feedback described the benefits of reflecting in a structured and safe environment, breathing exercises, and learning mindfulness strategies. Conclusions: Burnout is a serious concern amongst junior oncologists and is rising as a result of COVID-19. We present a novel intervention that promoted psychological flexibility and importantly maintained mental wellbeing throughout the pandemic.

COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal;while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods: I examine two factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread and the risks of basing strategy on untested claims, such as potential protective value of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine. Results: Differences in disease progression as well as the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase or damping it down later can be elucidated by a study of asymptomatic infection. An early study to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but how contagious they are would have informed policy on nonpharmaceutical interventions but could still be of value to understand containment during vaccine roll out. Conclusions: When a COVID-19 outbreak is at a level that makes accurate trace-and test possible, investigation of asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to enhance understanding of spread and variability in the disease as well as policy options for slowing the spread.

There are approximately 900 anesthesiologists in Israel, working in non-private hospitals. This nationwide cross-sectional study evaluated the readiness and involvement of anesthesia departments in Israel in management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on anesthesiologists' health, workload, and clinical practices were also evaluated. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to all of anesthesia department chairs in Israel on April 14th. Each response was identifiable on the hospital level only. Informed consent was waived since no patient data were collected. RESULTS: Response rate was 100%. A decrease of at least 40% in operating-room activity was reported by two-thirds of the departments. Anesthesiologists are leading the treatment of COVID-19 patients in 19/28 (68%) Israeli hospitals. Israel Society of Anesthesiologists' recommendations regarding intubation of COVID-19 patients were strictly followed (intubations performed by the most experienced available physician, by rapid-sequence induction utilizing video-laryngoscopy, while minimizing the number of people in the room - about 90% compliance for each). Anesthesiologists in most departments use standard personal protective equipment when caring for COVID-19 patients, including N95 masks, face shields, and water-proof gowns. Only one anesthesiologist across Israel was diagnosed with COVID-19 (unknown source of transmission). All department chairs reported emerging opportunities that advance the anesthesia profession: implementation of new technologies and improvement in caregivers' clinical capabilities (68% each), purchase of new equipment (96%), and increase in research activity (36%). CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cross-sectional study had a complete response rate and therefore well-represents the anesthesia practice in Israel. We found that Israeli anesthesia departments are generally highly involved in the health system efforts to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Anesthesia and airway management are performed in a remarkably comparable manner and with proper protection of caregivers.

Water quality data based upon the real-time water monitoring for four locations (Below Tawi Bridge, Bhagwati Nagar, Belicharana and Surajpur) have been obtained from the web link of Jammu and Kashmir Pollution Control Board. The important parameters used in the present study include pH, alkalinity, hardness, conductivity, BOD and COD. The river was designated fit for bathing in all the monitoring locations except Bhagwati Nagar which recorded a BOD value >5 mg/L because of domestic sewage and municipal waste dumping.

METHODS: Two hundred and seventy adults receiving SUD outpatient treatment were eligible to complete a 23\\\\item online survey distributed by clinicians; 58 patients completed/partially completed the survey. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Participants were predominately male, White, and well\\\\educated. The majority (86.2%) were very satisfied or satisfied with the quality of telehealth care. Very satisfied ratings were highest for individual therapy (90%), followed by medication management (75%) and group therapy (58%). Top reasons for liking telehealth included the ability to do it from home (90%) and not needing to spend time commuting (83%). Top reasons for disliking telehealth were not connecting as well with other members in group therapy (28%) and the ability for telehealth to be interrupted at home or work (26%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth visits were a satisfactory treatment modality for most respondents receiving outpatient SUD care, especially those engaging in individual therapy. Challenges remain for telehealth group therapy. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study examining patients' perceptions of telehealth for outpatient SUD treatment during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic by treatment service type. Importantly, while many participants found telehealth more accessible than in\\\\person treatment, there was variability with respect to the preferred mode of treatment delivery.","output":"Patients' perceptions of telehealth services for outpatient treatment of substance use disorders during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is an infective respiratory illness caused by a novel virus, which might present different degrees of severity: from mild or even asymptomatic carriers to severe pneumonia, requiring intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) management.

Heparin (delivered systemically) is currently used to treat anticoagulant anomalies in COVID-19 patients. In addition, in the UK, Brazil and Australia, nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) is being trialled in COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment. A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild-type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry, and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using ELISA assays was examined. KEY RESULTS All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25-41 g ml-1 whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4 - 7.8 mg ml-1 ). Mechanistically we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein, and furthermore we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor. Overall the data strongly support further clinical investigation of UFH as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Unfractionated heparin inhibits live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity at therapeutically relevant concentrations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on the risk assessment methods of novel coronavirus pneumonia virus (COVID-19) pneumonia virus spreading in closed marine environment.

However, the application of SfM-MVS in active underground mining has received less attention as there are unique challenges that need to be overcome, especially if a procedure is to be applied daily in active mining. Unique challenges include preparation time, camera positioning, illumination and useability. The faces of active development drives are generally only available for a short period before prepared and blasted, thus information is lost if not mapped immediately. Furthermore, due to safety concerns, unsupported faces cannot be approached for physical mapping. SfM-MVS allows these faces to be viewed and mapped in the form of a virtual outcrop, thus, allowing for remote mapping of underground development, which at the Dugald River mine, located in Queensland, Australia, allowed for mapping continuity as staff worked remotely during COVID-19.

METHODS: This paper proposes a local region-based variational region growing algorithm, which integrates local region and shape prior to segment the mandible accurately. Firstly, we select initial seeds in the CBCT image and then calculate candidate point sets and the local region energy function of each point. If a point reduces the energy, it is selected to be a pixel of the foreground region. By multiple iterations, the mandible segmentation of the slice can be obtained. Secondly, the segmented result of the previous slice is adopted as the shape prior to the next slice until all of the slices in CBCT are segmented. At last, the final mandible model is reconstructed by the Marching Cubes algorithm. RESULTS: The experimental results on CBCT datasets illustrate the LRVRG algorithm can obtain satisfied 3D mandible models from CBCT images and it can solve the fuzzy problem effectively. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons with other methods demonstrate the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in mandible segmentation.

We use a combination of sequence analysis, functional assays, and selection experiments to examine an overlapped region in HIV-1 that encodes helical regions in both Env and Rev. We find that functional segregation occurs even in this overlap, with each protein spacing its functional residues in a manner that allows a mutable non-binding face of one helix to encode important functional residues on a charged face in the other helix.

Poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases the risk of viral drug resistance and reduces treatment effectiveness towards viral suppression leading to disease progression, greater risk of death and increased risk of viral transmission. The study sought to assess current adherence levels to ART among patients in Ghana, exploring barriers and enablers of adherence to it, to provide future guidance to all key stakeholder groups. METHOD A mixed method approach was used comprising of a cross-sectional survey of patients followed by a focused group discussion with patients and an in-depth interview of four key health professionals working in the ART clinic of Atua Government Hospital, a primary care health facility in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A structured questionnaire was used to assess current adherence levels and their determinants among 231 randomly selected patients attending the clinic between July to September, 2019. Quantitative data were analysed using bivariate and multivariate methods while qualitative data were analysed using thematic framework approach. RESULTS Adherence levels was found to be 42.9% among our study population. Lower adherence to ART was associated with patients' belief in herbal medicine (aOR =0.34 CI: 0.19-0.61). Other barriers identified from the qualitative analysis included low motivation arising from pill fatigue, forgetfulness, frequent stock out of medicines, long waiting times and worrying side-effects; while enablers, on the other hand, included measures that ensure improved assessment of adherence and health facility-related activities that improve patient satisfaction with ART services. Conclusion: Adherence to ART among patients living with HIV was sub-optimal in our study population.

This system can non-invasively and quantitatively assess middle ear effusions and identify the presence of bacterial biofilms in the middle ear cavity during ear infections. Furthermore, the complete OCT system is housed in a standard briefcase to maximize its portability as a diagnostic device.

Regulatory frameworks are needed to secure these diverse benefits of sustainable wildlife trade. However, regulations limiting trade can backfire, sparking illegal trade if demand is not met by legal trade alone. Assessing how regulations affect wildlife markets participants' incentives is key to controlling illegal trade. While much research has assessed how incentives at both the harvester and consumer ends of markets are affected by regulations, little has been done to understand the incentives of traders (sometimes referred to as middlemen or intermediaries). Here, we present a dynamic simulation model to support reduction in illegal wildlife trade within legal markets by focusing on the incentives to trade legal or illegal products faced by traders. We use an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to infer illegal trading dynamics and parameters that might be unknown (e.g., price of illegal products). We showcase the utility of the approach with a small-scale fishery case study in Chile, where we disentangle within-year dynamics of legal and illegal trading and show that the majority of traded fish is illegal. Moreover, we utilized the model to assess the effect of policy interventions to improve the fishery's sustainability, and explore the trade-offs between ecological, economic and social goals. Scenario simulations show that even significant increases (over 200%) in parameters proxying for policy levers enable only moderate improvements in ecological and social sustainability, at substantial economic cost, exposing how unbalanced trader's incentives are towards trading illegal over legal products in this fishery. Our model is a novel tool for promoting sustainable wildlife trade in data-limited settings, which explicitly considers traders as critical players in wildlife markets.

RESULTS The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 4 of 115 patients in the rivaroxaban group (3.5%) versus 16 of 113 patients in the enoxaparin group (14.2%) (hazard ratio 0.207, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.069 to 0.621, P=0.005). Adverse events developed in 4.3% of patients in the study group and 12.4% in the enoxaparin group (hazard ratio 0.328; 95% CI, 0.118 to 0.910; P=0.032). Major bleeding was seen in 1 patient (0.9%) in the rivaroxaban group and 3 patients (2.7%) in the enoxaparin group. CONCLUSIONS Rivaroxaban alone was superior to enoxaparin for the prophylactic management of coagulopathy associated with mild to moderate SARS CoV-2 infection.","output":"Oral Rivaroxaban in the Prophylaxis of COVID-19 Induced Coagulopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: After burns, social reintegration is a primary long-term objective. At the same time, substance-abuse disorders are more common in burn patients. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of substance abuse pre- and postburn as well as living situation and relationship status relative to patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients and Methods: Burn survivors treated as inpatients between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2019 were retrospectively identified. Collected clinical data included: age, gender, time since injury, burn extent (%TBSA), and substance abuse. Patient-reported living situation, relationship status, smoking habits, alcohol and drug consumption pre- and postburn as well as the SF-36 study were ascertained via telephone survey. Inductive statistical analysis comprised uni- and multivariate testing. A p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: A total of 128 patients, 93 (72.7%) men, with a mean age of 40.0  15.7 years were included. Mean TBSA was 9.2  11.0% and significantly lower in women (p = 0.005). General health SF-36 scores were significantly lower in women (67.6  29.8) than men (86.0  20.8, p = 0.002). Smoking decreased from 38.8% pre- to 31.1% postburn. A significant reduction in alcohol consumption was noted over time (p = 0.019). The rate of never-drinkers was 18.0% pre- and 27.3% postburn. Drug abuse was rare both pre- (7.8%) and postburn (5.3%). Living situation remained stable. None of the participants depended on assisted living or lived in a care facility postburn. In total, 75.8% and 67.2% were in a relationship pre- and postburn. Patients with higher alcohol consumption postburn were significantly more often male (p = 0.013) and had higher SF-36 general health scores (p < 0.001). Conclusions: HRQoL is better in men than in women after burn injury. A slight decrease in substance abuse postburn was noted.

However, there are few reports on these biological activities in fish. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of baicalin on growth performance, antioxidative status and hepatoprotection in tilapia. The fish were fed on different doses of baicalin (0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/kg diet). After feeding 60 days, parts of fishes were netted, and the blood, liver, gills and muscle tissues were collected to analyze the antioxidative effect. The remaining fishes were injected with saline or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for challenge test. The results showed that the specific growth rate of fish was slightly increased in three baicalin treatments, and the feed efficiency was clearly improved in 0.4 g/kg baicalin treatment. Meanwhile, the antioxidative capacity in blood, liver and/or gill was enhanced in treatments with 0.4, 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin. After challenge test, the pre-treatments with baicalin effectively alleviated H2O2-induced liver injury. In serum and liver, pre-treatments with 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin suppressed the oxidative damage induced by H2O2, as evidenced by improvement of the levels of SOD, T-AOC and GSH and the decline of MDA level. More important, pre-treatments with 0.4, 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin blocked the upregulation of mRNA levels of tlr1, myd88, irak4, rela, tnf- and il-1 in H2O2-induced liver injury.

These plants act as protein factories that can synthesize a variety of proteins free from pathogens such as plasma proteins, growth factors, and vaccines. This method provides a novel, tempting, inexpensive, easy, and safe alternative to other techniques of protein or antigen production. With the advent of transgenic plants, it is possible to produce unlimited amounts of subunit vaccines (for oral use/edible and of parenteral use), protein used for pharmaceutical/medicinal purpose, recombinant proteins, antibodies, and industrial enzymes. Plants have numerous advantages over the production systems on account of scalability, safety, and are economic; for example, less cost of production is involved for Hepatitis B nucleocapsid antigen using transgenic tobacco. Biopharming or molecular farming provides an important resource for cheaper drug production used in the treatment of cancer, heart diseases, and infectious diseases. The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by genetically engineered plants that are extracted and purified, also known as pharmaceuticals produced by plants. Edible vaccines are cheaper in cost, easy to administer mostly by oral route, fail-safe, and are acceptable by society especially in developing countries. These vaccines are targeted to provide systemic as well as mucosal types of immunity. It has been predicted that in future children may get their immunization by munching on foods instead of getting enduring shots. The production of edible vaccines consists of the process of introducing the selected genes of desired quality into plant to induce these altered or transgenic plants to produce the encoded proteins in a natural way. These vaccines provide safer alternatives and help in reduction of cost of production and shipping and also decrease the potential hazards associated with conventional vaccines. However, becoming a reality and readily availability of edible vaccine is challenged by many problems of technical, regulatory, and nonscientific issues, which should be ruled out and rectified.

Methods ICC patients (n=58) undergoing percutaneous CT-guided ablation with or without pre-ablation TACE at our institute from 2009 to 2013 were enrolled in the primary cohort. All treatments were performed under conscious sedation and local anesthesia. Prognostic factors for OS were identified to establish the nomogram. The nomogram was accessed by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve, and compared with 11 currently available prognostic systems. The nomogram was further evaluated in a validation cohort (n=19) of patients with ICC who underwent thermal ablation and TACE from 2014 to 2016. Results In the primary cohort, the median OS was 17.9 months and the 1-, 3-, 5-year OS rates were 69.6%, 29.5%, 23.6%, respectively. Three single independent predictors (number of tumors, vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis) for OS were identified by multivariate analysis and used to formulate the nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.834 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.765 to 0.904], significantly higher than that of ten current prognostic systems for ICC, and similar with that of the Wang nomogram. The performance of the proposed nomogram was also confirmed in the validation cohort (C-index, 0.839). Conclusions Thermal ablation appears to be effective for ICC patients.

While the studies in the former context are intensively expanded, the latter remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the pattern formation of an interacting contagion, where two infections, A and B, interact with each other and diffuse simultaneously in space. The contagion process for each follows the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible kinetics, and their interaction introduces a potential change in the secondary infection propensity compared to the baseline reproduction number [Formula: see text]. We show that the nontrivial spatial infection patterns arise when the susceptible individuals move faster than the infected and the interaction between the two infections is neither too competitive nor too cooperative. Interestingly, the system exhibits pattern hysteresis phenomena, i.e., quite different parameter regions for patterns exist in the direction of increasing or decreasing [Formula: see text]. Decreasing [Formula: see text] reveals remarkable enhancement in contagion prevalence, meaning that the eradication becomes difficult compared to the single-infection or coinfection without space. Linearization analysis supports our observations, and we have identified the required elements and dynamical mechanism, which suggests that these patterns are essentially Turing patterns.

The effects were also studied in keratinocytes as a prototype for somatic cells. METHODS HESC (H1) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT, human) were exposed to (125)I-dU (5  10(-5) - 5 MBq/ml) and (131)I-iodide (5  10(-5) - 12.5 MBq/ml) and apoptosis was measured by DNA-fragmentation. Cell morphology was studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Transcriptional profiling was done on the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray platform. RESULTS Auger-process induced no apoptosis but a strong transcriptional response in hESC. In contrast, HaCaT cells showed a pronounced induction of apoptosis but only a moderate transcriptional response. Transcriptional response of hESC was similar after (125)I-dU and (131)I treatments, whereas HaCaT cells expressed a much more pronounced response to (125)I-dU than to (131)I. A striking radiation-induced down-regulation of pluripotency genes was observed in hESC whereas in keratinocytes the enriched gene annotations were related primarily to apoptosis, cell division and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS Human embryonic stem cells respond to ionizing radiation by (125)I-dU and (131)I in a different way compared to keratinocytes.

In BEAS-2B cells, cytotoxicity (CCK-8), membrane integrity (LDH), and ACE2 protein expression (immunofluorescence) were measured for both 4- and 24 h treatments in BEAS-2B cells and 4 h in SAECs; ACE2 gene expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 4 h treatment in BEAS-2B cells. Nicotine-free condensates and higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates were cytotoxic to BEAS-2B cells.

RESULTS: The workshop was completed by 134 learners between October 2018 and October 2019. The short workshop duration and premade simulation allowed a small number of faculty to train a wide variety of learners in various educational settings. Participants presurvey (124 out of 134, 92%) versus postsurvey (113 out of 134, 84%) responses showed that attitudes about RCA were statistically improved across all domains queried, with an average effect size of 0.6 (moderate effect); 91% of participants would recommend this course to a colleague. DISCUSSION: A 90-minute, gamified, simulated RCA workshop was taught to medical students and multiple GME specialties with subjective improvements in patient safety attitudes and knowledge while alleviating faculty time constraints in case development.","output":"The Mystery Dinner RCA: Using Gamification and Simulation to Teach Root Cause Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS- CoV- 2 in health care workers (HCWs) challenges employee health services.

Dexamethasone and possibly aspirin, which directly/indirectly target the biosynthesis/effects of numerous lipid mediators are among those options. Our objective was to define if severe COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased bioactive lipids modulating lung inflammation. A targeted lipidomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) by tandem mass spectrometry was done on 25 healthy controls and 33 COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. BALs from severe COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased fatty acids and inflammatory lipid mediators. There was a predominance of thromboxane and prostaglandins.

Monohydroxylated 15-lipoxygenase metabolites derived from linoleate, arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate were also increased. Finally yet importantly, specialized pro-resolving mediators, notably lipoxin A4 and the D-series resolvins, were also increased, underscoring that the lipid mediator storm occurring in severe COVID-19 involves pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids. Our data unmask the lipid mediator storm occurring in the lungs of patients afflicted with severe COVID-19.

Although the COVID-19 crisis has a significant negative impact on air travel and thus on the further development of airport infrastructure, the demand for air travel will continue to rise as the crisis nears the end. The aim of this paper is to analyse and highlight the climate change associated hazards for the airport infrastructure as well as for the safety of passengers and goods in the Western part of Romania, mainly Traian Vuia International Airport from Timi?oara. Throughout this analysis, aviation related severe weather events, such as thunderstorms, hail events, fog, icing, squalls, low level wind shear, snow falls and heavy precipitation, which affect airport infrastructure and thus air travel, are highlighted. By analysing meteorological parameters from the time scale 1980-2010 together with climate change scenarios, and thus developing weather hazard maps, a better perspective of area-related hazards and therefore customized mitigation measures and adaptation strategies are to be developed. The implementation of modern forecasting equipment such as dual polarization Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) is thus necessary in order to prevent loss of human lives, to reduce financial losses and to protect the airport infrastructure and the aeronautical navigation and communication facilities. Long term changes in meteorological parameters include an increase in air temperature, an increase in speed for both horizontal and vertical windshear during severe weather events, an increasing number of air mass thunderstorms and an increase of situations with limited visibility especially during the late autumn and early spring time.","output":"Considerations Regarding the Climate Change Induced Hazards on Airports in Romania C A Case Study of Timi?oara International Airport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To review the safety and efficacy of percutaneous cryoablation for the treatment of chondroblastoma and osteoblastoma in the pediatric and adolescent population.

Technical success (correct needle placement and potential full coverage of the tumor with the planned ablation zone) and clinical success (relief of the symptoms) were evaluated. The primary objective was to alleviate pain related to the lesion(s). Immediate and late complications were recorded. Patients were followed in clinic and with imaging studies such as MRI or CT for a minimum of 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients were included (mean 14 years, age range 9C17; male n = 8). Diagnoses were osteoblastoma (n = 4) and chondroblastoma (n = 7). Locations were proximal humerus (n = 1), femur condyle (n = 1), and proximal femur (n = 1) tibia (n = 3), acetabulum (n = 3), thoracic vertebra (n = 1) and lumbar vertebra (n = 1).

The present tools to detect COVID-19 experience numerous shortcomings. Therefore, novel diagnostic tools are to be examined to enhance diagnostic accuracy and avoid the limitations of these tools. Earlier studies indicated multiple structures of cardiovascular alterations in COVID-19 cases which motivated the realization of using ECG data as a tool for diagnosing the novel coronavirus. This study introduced a novel automated diagnostic tool based on ECG data to diagnose COVID-19. The introduced tool utilizes ten deep learning (DL) models of various architectures. It obtains significant features from the last fully connected layer of each DL model and then combines them. Afterward, the tool presents a hybrid feature selection based on the chi-square test and sequential search to select significant features. Finally, it employs several machine learning classifiers to perform two classification levels. A binary level to differentiate between normal and COVID-19 cases, and a multiclass to discriminate COVID-19 cases from normal and other cardiac complications. The proposed tool reached an accuracy of 98.2% and 91.6% for binary and multiclass levels, respectively.

Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19.

The objectives of this study were to (a) use an extended protection motivation theory (PMT) with an added trust component to identify predictors of vaccine hesitancy and (b) explore the predictive ability of vaccine hesitancy on vaccination behavior. METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire from February 9 to April 9, 2021, in China. The target population was Chinese residents aged 18 and over. A total of 14,236 responses were received. Structural equation modeling was used to test the extended PMT model hypotheses. RESULTS: A total of 10,379 participants were finally included in this study, of whom 52.0% showed hesitancy toward vaccination. 2854 (27.5%) participants reported that they got flu shots in the past year, and 2561 (24.7%) participants were vaccinated against COVID-19. 2857 (27.5%) participants engaged in healthcare occupation. The model explained 85.7% variance of vaccine hesitancy. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor, negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy ( = ?0.584; p < .001). Response efficacy had a negative effect on vaccine hesitancy ( = ?0.372; p < .001), while threat appraisal showed a positive effect ( = 0.104; p < .001).

Our objective was to evaluate the role of OAC in the early prevention of NEC and late-onset sepsis in preterm infants with gestational age (GA)  32 weeks. METHODS: A pilot, single-center, 1:1 parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 40-bed tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in China from 1 January 2019 to 30 September 2020. Preterm infants were randomly divided into two groups with GA  32 weeks. The OAC group included preterm infants who received 0.4 ml of maternal colostrum via the oropharyngeal route every 3 h for 10 days beginning within the first 48 h after birth, and the control group included preterm infants who received normal saline instead. Data from the two groups were collected and compared. RESULTS: A total of 127 infants in the OAC group and 125 infants in the control group were enrolled. The incidence of NEC (Bell stage 2 or 3) and late-onset sepsis were lower in the OAC group [2.36% vs. 10.40%, relative risk (RR) 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07, 0.78), adjusted RR 0.23 (95% CI 0.06, 0.84); 4.72% vs. 13.60%, RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.14, 0.85), adjusted RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.14, 0.95)]. In addition, the incidence of proven sepsis and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (stage 3 or 4) were lower in the OAC group [2.36% vs. 8.80%, RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.08, 0.94); 1.57% vs. 7.20%, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.05, 0.99)], and the time to achieve full enteral feeding was shorter (23.13  9.45 days vs. 28.50  14.80 days).

Respondents (N = 940) completed validated self-report questionnaires related to depression and anxiety, financial motivation, financial impacts due to the pandemic, online gambling behaviors, and problem gambling symptomatology. A cluster analysis identified three subgroups: no online gambling (subgroup 1), engagement in a range of gambling games online and change in gambling involvement (i.e., some increased and some decreased gambling; subgroup 2), and predominantly online lottery play with no change in online gambling (subgroup 3). Respondents who reported increased anxiety and depression symptom severity between the two waves and those who experienced greater symptoms of problem gambling and negative impacts on household income due to COVID-19 were most likely to be found in subgroup 2. Greater financial focus was also noted in this group. Results indicate a link between change in online gambling involvement during COVID-19 and increased mental health problems, elevated problem gambling severity, negative impacts on household income, and a greater financially focused self-concept.

The purpose of the current study was to help build a theory for how early repeating patterning knowledge contributes to early math development, focusing on development in children aged 4-6 years. The current study examined the relation between 65 preschool children's repeating patterning knowledge (via a fast, teacher-friendly measure) and their end-of-kindergarten broad math and numeracy knowledge, controlling for verbal and visual-spatial working memory (WM) skills as well as end-of-pre-K (pre-kindergarten) broad math knowledge. Relations were also examined between repeating patterning and specific aspects of numeracy knowledge-knowledge of the count sequence to 100 and the successor principle. Children's repeating patterning knowledge was significantly predictive of their broad math and general numeracy knowledge, as well as one specific aspect of their numeracy knowledge (counting to 100), even after controlling for verbal and visual-spatial WM skills. Further, repeating patterning knowledge remained a unique predictor of general numeracy knowledge and counting to 100 after controlling for end-of-pre-K broad math knowledge. The relation between repeating patterning and mathematics may be explained by the central role that identifying predictable sequences based on underlying rules plays in both.

In response to rising cases, these were supplemented by national restrictions on contacts (the Rule of Six), then 10 pm closing for bars and restaurants, and encouragement to work from home. These were quickly followed by a 3-tier system applying different restrictions in different localities. As cases continued to rise, a second national lockdown was declared. We used a national survey to quantify the impact of these restrictions on epidemiologically relevant contacts. METHODS: We compared paired measures on setting-specific contacts before and after each restriction started and tested for differences using paired permutation tests on the mean change in contacts and the proportion of individuals decreasing their contacts. RESULTS: Following the imposition of each measure, individuals tended to report fewer contacts than they had before. However, the magnitude of the changes was relatively small and variable. For instance, although early closure of bars and restaurants appeared to have no measurable effect on contacts, the work from home directive reduced mean daily work contacts by 0.99 (95% confidence interval CI] 0.03C1.94), and the Rule of Six reduced non-work and school contacts by a mean of 0.25 (0.01C0.5) per day. Whilst Tier 3 appeared to also reduce non-work and school contacts, the evidence for an effect of the lesser restrictions (Tiers 1 and 2) was much weaker. There may also have been some evidence of saturation of effects, with those who were in Tier 1 (least restrictive) reducing their contacts markedly when they entered lockdown, which was not reflected in similar changes in those who were already under tighter restrictions (Tiers 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The imposition of various local and national measures in England during the summer and autumn of 2020 has gradually reduced contacts. However, these changes are smaller than the initial lockdown in March. This may partly be because many individuals were already starting from a lower number of contacts.

It describes the roles of intestinal enzymes, focussing on complementarity with salivary, gastric, and pancreatic digestive enzymes and their hydrolytic function in the process of absorption. Gene expression of the enzymes and nutritional regulation of their expression appear during postnatal development up to maturity. After translation of the specific mRNA, a single precursor of maltaseglucoamylase (pro-MG), rich in mannose, is produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In contrast to the relatively small number of carbohydrases, the number of peptidases found in enterocytes in the small intestine is large, because of the large number of different peptide bonds in oligopeptides produced by the action of pancreatic proteases. The digestive function (disaccharidase and peptidase activities) of the enterocytes and their microvilli begins when structural differentiation is complete, that is, during the period of migration over the cryptvillus junction. Modern techniques and investigations are expected to yield relevant data for elaborating feeding strategies that take into account the complex interactions between the diet, the microflora, the luminal milieu and the physiology of the small intestine, including the optimal functioning of the immunological and endocrine systems.","output":"Chapter 16 Production and gene expression of brush border disaccharidases and peptidases during development in pigs and calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with sex practice under the effect of drugs (chemsex) among men who have sex with men (MSM) during the period of social isolation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
