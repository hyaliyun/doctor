We aimed to investigate the prevalence of infection among HCW in medical disciplines with AGP. Design: A nationwide questionnaire-based study in in- and outpatient settings was conducted between 12/16/2020 and 01/24/2021. Data on SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCW and potential risk factors were investigated. Results: 2,070 healthcare facilities with 25,113 employees were included in the study. Despite a higher rate of pre-interventional testing, clinics treated three times more confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases than private practices (28.8% vs. 88.4%, p<0.001). Overall infection rate among HCW accounted for 4.7%. Multivariate analysis revealed that ZIP-regions having comparably higher incidences were significantly associated with increased risk of infection. Furthermore, clinical setting and the GIE specialty have more than double the risk of infection (OR 2.63; 95% CI 2.501-2.817, p<0.01 and OR 2.35; 95% CI 2.245-2.498, p<0.01). The number of procedures performed per day was also significantly associated with an increased risk of infection (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.007-1.014), p<0.01). No treatment of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was tending to lower the risk of infection (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.507-1.025, p=0.068). Conclusion: HCW in GIE seem to be at higher risk of infection than those in other AGP, especially in the clinical setting.

Moreover, all types of coping served as a buffer against the negative impact of stressors on perceived general health. These findings hold implications for university counseling services during times of acute, large-scale stressors. In particular, effective screening procedures should be developed to identify students who experience a large number of stressors and thus are at high risk for developing mental health problems.

In this study, an in-house library of 117 steroidal plant-derived pregnanes (PDPs) was docked in the active regions of human glucocorticoid receptors (hGRs) in a comparative molecular docking analysis. Based on the minimal binding energy and a comparative dexamethasone binding mode analysis, a list of top twenty ranked PDPs docked in the agonist conformation of hGR, with binding energies ranging between ?9.8 and ?11.2 kcal/mol, was obtained and analyzed for possible interactions with the human Janus kinases 1 and Interleukins-6 and SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, Papain-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For each target protein, the top three ranked PDPs were selected. Eight PDPs (bregenin, hirundigenin, anhydroholantogenin, atratogenin A, atratogenin B, glaucogenin A, glaucogenin C and glaucogenin D) with high binding tendencies to the catalytic residues of multiple targets were identified. A high degree of structural stability was observed from the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation analyses of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin complexes of hGR.

Here, we analyse an ethnically diverse cohort of National Health Service (NHS) patients in the United Kingdom (UK) to assess the association between variants in the ACE2 locus and COVID-19 risk. Methods We analysed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 6,274 participants who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from the UK's 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) for the presence of ACE2 variants and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Findings We identified a splice site variant (rs2285666) associated with increased ACE2 expression with an overrepresentation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients relative to 100KGP controls (p = .015), and in hospitalised European patients relative to outpatients in intra-ethnic comparisons (p = .029). We also compared the prevalence of 288 eQTLs, of which 23 were enriched in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. The eQTL rs12006793 had the largest effect size (d = 0.91), which decreases ACE2 expression and is more prevalent in controls, thus potentially reducing risk of COVID-19. We identified three novel nonsynonymous variants predicted to alter ACE2 function, and showed that three variants (p.K26R, p.H378R, p.Y515N) alter receptor affinity for the viral Spike (S) protein. Variants p.K26R and p.N720D are more prevalent in the European population (p < .001), but Y497H is less prevalent compared to East Asians (p = .020). Interpretation Our results demonstrate that the spectrum of genetic variants in ACE2 may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and could partially explain the differences in disease susceptibility and severity among different ethnic groups.

Depending on the underlying pathology, molecular defect(s), and the cytokine- and mediator-cascades involved, peripheral blood and tissue hypereosinophilia (HE) may develop and may lead to organ dysfunction or even organ damage which usually leads to the diagnosis of a HE syndrome (HES). In some of these patients, the etiology and impact of HE remain unclear. These patients are diagnosed with idiopathic HE. In other patients, HES is diagnosed but the etiology remains unknown  these patients are classified as idiopathic HES. For patients with HES, early therapeutic application of agents reducing eosinophil counts is usually effective in avoiding irreversible organ damage. Therefore, it is important to systematically explore various diagnostic markers and to correctly identify the disease elicitors and etiology. Depending on the presence and type of underlying disease, HES are classified into primary (clonal) HES, reactive HES, and idiopathic HES. In most of these patients, effective therapies can be administered. The current article provides an overview of the pathogenesis of eosinophil-associated disorders, with special emphasis on the molecular, immunological, and clinical complexity of HE and HES.

We aimed to develop a new classification and structured reporting system on CT imaging (COVID-19 S) that would facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the most accurate way. METHODS Our retrospective cohort included 803 patients with a chest CT scan upon suspicion of COVID 19. The patients' history, physical examination, CT findings, RT PCR, and other laboratory test results were reviewed, and a final diagnosis was made as COVID 19 or non-COVID 19. Chest CT scans were classified according to the COVID 19 S CT diagnosis criteria. Cohen's kappa analysis was used. RESULTS Final clinical diagnosis was COVID-19 in 98 patients (12%). According to the COVID-19 S CT diagnosis criteria, the number of patients in the normal, compatible with COVID 19, indeterminate and alternative diagnosis groups were 581 (72.3%), 97 (12.1%), 16 (2.0%) and 109 (13.6%). When the indeterminate group was combined with the group compatible with COVID 19, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 99.0% and 87.1%, with 85.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99.1% negative predictive value (NPV). When the indeterminate group was combined with the alternative diagnosis group, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 93.9% and 96.0%, with 94.8% PPV and 95.2% NPV.

Children with T1D who attended the ED between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 were compared with those who attended the ED between March 1, 2019 and May 31, 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 150 and 154 children with T1D attended the EDs during the 3-month study periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Among patients with established T1D, DKA rates significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2019 [38/64 (59.3%) vs 31/74 (41.9%); p < 0.043]. There was a non-statistically significant trend toward a higher rate of DKA in patients with newly diagnosed T1D [46/86 (53.4%) vs 31/80 (38.7%); p = 0.063]. No differences were observed in the rates of severe DKA in 2020 compared to 2019 among patients with established T1D [10/64 (15.6%) vs 6/74 (8.1%); p = 0.184], and newly diagnosed T1D [16/86 (18.6%) vs 14/80 (17.5%); p = 0.858].

Existing studies of the brain's reward system in individuals with ASD report varied findings for anticipation of and response to social rewards. Given discrepant findings, the anticipation of and response to social rewards should be further evaluated, particularly in the context of intervention outcome. We hypothesized that individual characteristics may help predict neural changes from pre- to post-intervention. Methods: Thirteen adolescents with ASD received the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) intervention for 16 weeks; reward-related EEG was collected before and after intervention. Fourteen TD adolescents were tested at two timepoints but did not receive intervention. Event-related potentials were calculated to measure anticipation of (stimulus-preceding negativity; SPN) and response to (reward-related positivity; RewP) social and non-social rewards. Additionally, measures of social responsiveness, social skills, and intervention-engagement were collected. Group differences were analyzed as well as individual differences using prediction models. Result: Parent-reported social responsiveness and social skills improved in adolescents with ASD after participation in PEERS. ASD adolescents displayed marginally decreased anticipation of social rewards at post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. Regression models demonstrated that older adolescents and those with lower parent-reported social motivation prior to participation in PEERS displayed marginally increased social reward anticipation (more robust SPN) from pre- to post-intervention. Participants who displayed more parent-reported social motivation before intervention and were more actively engaged in the PEERS intervention evidenced increased social reward processing (more robust RewP) from pre- to post-intervention. Conclusion: Findings suggest that there may be differences in saliency between wanting/anticipating social rewards vs. liking/responding to social rewards in individuals with ASD. Our findings support the hypothesis that identification of individual differences may predict which adolescents are poised to benefit the most from particular interventions. As such, reported findings set the stage for the advancement of precision medicine.

A notable feature of the 2003 global SARS outbreak was the relative paucity of cases reported among children. We reviewed the epidemiologic and clinical features of SARS in children and discuss implications of these findings for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of SARS. METHODS We performed a literature search to identify reports of pediatric (younger than 18 years of age) patients meeting the World Health Organization case definitions for SARS and abstracted relevant clinical and epidemiologic information. RESULTS We identified 6 case series reporting 135 pediatric SARS patients (80 laboratory-confirmed, 27 probable and 28 suspect) from Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Among laboratory-confirmed and probable SARS cases, the most common symptoms included fever (98%), cough (60%) and nausea or vomiting (41%); 97% had radiographic abnormalities. The clinical presentation of SARS in patients older than 12 years of age was similar to that in adults. However, patients 12 years of age or younger had milder disease and were less likely than older children to be admitted to an intensive care unit, receive supplemental oxygen or be treated with methylprednisolone. No deaths were reported among children or adolescents with SARS, and at 6 months after illness only mild residual changes were reported in exercise tolerance and pulmonary function.

In Ethiopia where the burden of tuberculosis (TB) remains unacceptably high, reliable VA data are needed to guide intervention strategies. This study aimed to validate the InterVA model against the physician VA in tracking TB-related mortality in Ethiopia. METHODS: From a sample of deaths in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, VAs were conducted on TB-related mortality, physician-certified verbal autopsy (PCVA) through multiple steps to ascertain the causes of death. InterVA model was used to interpret the causes of death. Estimates of TB-related deaths between physician reviews and the InterVA model were compared using Cohens Kappa (k), Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, sensitivity, and specificity to compare agreement between PCVA and InterVA. RESULTS: A total of 8952 completed PCVA were used. The InterVA model had an optimal likelihood cut-off point sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI: 59.0C69.0) and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI: 94.9C95.8). The area under the ROC curve was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.78C0.81).

JEV circulates in wild ardeid birds and domestic pig reservoirs, both of which generate sufficiently high viraemias to infect vector mosquitoes, which can then subsequently infect humans. The landscapes of these hosts, particularly in the context of anthropogenic ecotones and resulting wildlife-livestock interfaces, are poorly understood and thus significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology of JEV persist. This study sought to investigate the landscape epidemiology of JEV outbreaks in India over the period 2010-2020 to determine the influence of shared wetland and rain-fed agricultural landscapes and animal hosts on outbreak risk. METHODS Using surveillance data from India's National Centre for Disease Control Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, JEV outbreaks were modelled as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process and externally validated against independently sourced data. RESULTS Outbreak risk was strongly associated with the habitat suitability of ardeid birds, both pig and chicken density, and the shared landscapes between fragmented rain-fed agriculture and both river and freshwater marsh wetlands. CONCLUSION The results from this work provide the most complete understanding of the landscape epidemiology of JEV in India to date and suggest important One Health priorities for control and prevention across fragmented terrain comprising a wildlife-livestock interface that favours spillover to humans.","output":"High-risk landscapes of Japanese encephalitis virus outbreaks in India converge on wetlands, rain-fed agriculture, wild Ardeidae, and domestic pigs and chickens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canine parvovirus (CPV) and its relative feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) bind the transferrin receptor type 1 (TfR) to infect their host cells but show differences in the interactions with the feline and canine TfRs that determine viral host range and tissue tropism. We changed apical and protease-like domain residues by introducing point mutations and adding or removing glycosylation signals, and we then examined the interactions of those mutant TfRs with the capsids. Most substitutions had little effect on virus binding and uptake. However, mutations of several sites in the apical domain of the receptor either prevented binding to the capsids or reduced the affinity of receptor binding to various degrees. Glycans within the virus binding face of the apical domain also controlled capsid binding. CPV, but not the related feline parvovirus, could use receptors containing a canine TfR-specific glycosylation to mediate efficient infection, while addition of other N-linked glycosylation sites into the virus binding face of the feline apical domain reduced or eliminated both binding and infection. Replacement of critical feline TfR residue 221 with every amino acid had effects on binding and infection which were significantly associated with the biochemical properties of the residue replaced. Receptors with reduced affinities mostly showed proportional changes in their ability to mediate infection. Testing feline TfR variants for their binding and uptake patterns in cells showed that low-affinity versions bound fewer capsids and also differed in attachment to the cell surface and filopodia, but transport to the perinuclear endosome was similar.","output":"Binding site on the transferrin receptor for the parvovirus capsid and effects of altered affinity on cell uptake and infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Use of anesthesia machines as improvised intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators may occur in locations where waste anesthesia gas suction (WAGS) is unavailable. Anecdotal reports suggest as much as 18 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) being inadvertently applied under these circumstances, accompanied by inaccurate pressure readings by the anesthesia machine. We hypothesized that resistance within closed anesthesia gas scavenging systems (AGSS) disconnected from WAGS may inadvertently increase circuit pressures. METHODS: An anesthesia machine was connected to an anesthesia breathing circuit, a reference manometer, and a standard bag reservoir to simulate a lung. Ventilation was initiated as follows: volume control, tidal volume (TV) 500 mL, respiratory rate 12, ratio of inspiration to expiration times (I:E) 1:1.9, fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) 1.0, fresh gas flow (FGF) rate 2.0 liters per minute (LPM), and PEEP 0 cm H2O. After engaging the ventilator, PEEP and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) were measured by the reference manometer and the anesthesia machine display simultaneously. The process was repeated using prescribed PEEP levels of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm H2O. Measurements were repeated with the WAGS disconnected and then were performed again at FGF of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 LPM. This process was completed on 3 anesthesia machines: Dr?ger Perseus A500, Dr?ger Apollo, and the GE Avance CS2. Simple linear regression was used to assess differences. RESULTS: Utilizing nonparametric Bland-Altman analysis, the reference and machine manometer measurements of PIP demonstrated median differences of -0.40 cm H2O (95% limits of agreement [LOA], -1.00 to 0.55) for the Dr?ger Apollo, -0.40 cm H2O (95% LOA, -1.10 to 0.41) for the Dr?ger Perseus, and 1.70 cm H2O (95% LOA, 0.80-3.00) for the GE Avance CS2. At FGF 2 LPM and PEEP 0 cm H2O with the WAGS disconnected, the Dr?ger Apollo had a difference in PEEP of 0.02 cm H2O (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.04 to 0.08; P = .53); the Dr?ger Perseus A500, <0.0001 cm H2O (95% CI, -0.11 to 0.11; P = 1.00); and the GE Avance CS2, 8.62 cm H2O (95% CI, 8.55-8.69; P < .0001). After removing the hose connected to the AGSS and the visual indicator bag on the GE Avance CS2, the PEEP difference was 0.12 cm H2O (95% CI, 0.059-0.181; P = .0002). CONCLUSIONS: Displayed airway pressure measurements are clinically accurate in the setting of disconnected WAGS. The Dr?ger Perseus A500 and Apollo with open scavenging systems do not deliver inadvertent continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with WAGS disconnected, but the GE Avance CS2 with a closed AGSS does. This increase in airway pressure can be mitigated by the manufacturer's recommended alterations. Anesthesiologists should be aware of the potential clinically important increases in pressure that may be inadvertently delivered on some anesthesia machines, should the WAGS not be properly connected.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019: Anesthesia Machine Circuit Pressure During Use as an Improvised Intensive Care Unit Ventilator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant implications for society, with the introduction of restrictive social measures.

Sixty cases of SARS CoV-2 infection (25 severe, 35 mild) and ten healthy subjects without SARS CoV-2 IgG were included. Disease-duration based analysis of immune profile was explored for early events differentiating the two disease forms. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by PRNT. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Disease severity was found to be associated with impaired maturation of mDCs and hyperactivation of NK, follicular T helper cells, and CD8 T cells. Lower IL-21 receptor expression on memory B cells indicated an imbalance in IL-21/IL-21 R ratio. Lower BCMA positive plasmablast cells in severe cases did suggest a probable absence of long-term humoral immunity.

Purpose. Analysis of the activities of the sanitary and epidemiological service of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the context of the spread of especially dangerous infections, including coronavirus infection for the period from 1991 to 2020, according to the literature. Search strategy. A search for scientific publications was carried out in the search engines PubMed, BMC, Medline, GoogleScholar, e-Library. The depth is 30 years. Inclusion criteria: publications corresponding to the depth of search (1991-2020), in Kazakh, Russian and English;full-text epidemiological studies. Exclusion criteria: publications with fuzzy conclusions, recurring publications, abstracts and conference proceedings, articles with paid access. A total of 144 publications were analyzed, of which 70 are included in this review. Results. The analysis of literary sources showed that the anti-epidemiological service of Kazakhstan needs to further improve its structure with the introduction of new strategies based on a clear vision of promising goals, based on the use of modern scientific and institutional development technologies. The results of the analysis also showed that in recent years there has been a positive trend in the state of the sanitary and epidemiological situation for especially dangerous infections - a decrease has been registered in a number of significant dangerous diseases, and for some vaccine-controlled diseases, the priority goal is to completely eliminate or eliminate them. Conclusions. Based on the analysis carried out, it can be concluded that the system of the anti-epidemic service in Kazakhstan, as a whole, is at a good level, has a high sensitivity, is sufficiently timely and representative. However, against the background of massive human disease with coronavirus infection, there is a need to continue to modify the surveillance system. Therefore, further scientific developments in this direction will be of particular relevance and will allow identifying priority areas for improving the sanitary and epidemiological system.","output":"Improving the epidemiological surveillance of especially dangerous infectious diseases in independent Kazakhstan: a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a WHO priority pathogen and vaccine target which causes infections in low-income and middle-income countries, travelers visiting endemic regions. The global urgent demand for an effective preventive intervention has become more pressing as ETEC strains have become increasingly multiple antibiotic resistant. However, the vaccine development pipeline has been slow to address this urgent need. To date, vaccine development has focused mainly on canonical antigens such as colonization factors and expressed toxins but due to genomic plasticity of this enteric pathogen, it has proven difficult to develop effective vaccines. In this study, we investigated the highly conserved non-canonical vaccine candidate YghJ/SsLE. Using the mass spectrometry-based method BEMAP, we demonstrate that YghJ is hyperglycosylated in ETEC and identify 54 O-linked Set/Thr residues within the 1519 amino acid primary sequence. The glycosylation sites are evenly distributed throughout the sequence and do not appear to affect the folding of the overall protein structure. Although the glycosylation sites only constitute a minor subpopulation of the available epitopes, we observed a notable difference in the immunogenicity of the glycosylated YghJ and the non-glycosylated protein variant. We can demonstrate by ELISA that serum from patients enrolled in an ETEC H10407 controlled infection study are significantly more reactive with glycosylated YghJ compared to the non-glycosylated variant. This study provides an important link between O-linked glycosylation and the relative immunogenicity of bacterial proteins and further highlights the importance of this observation in considering ETEC proteins for inclusion in future broad coverage subunit vaccine candidates.","output":"Linking inherent O-Linked Protein Glycosylation of YghJ to Increased Antigen Potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We document here that intensive care COVID-19 patients suffer a profound decline in hemoglobin levels but show an increase of circulating nucleated red cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection either directly or indirectly induces stress erythropoiesis.

We sought to determine the proportion of patients with an index diagnosis of nephrolithiasis that have serum calcium levels measured, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels measured if hypercalcemic, and time to referral for definitive management if PHP is diagnosed. METHODS A single-institution retrospective review was performed of adult patients presenting with nephrolithiasis between July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. Exclusion criteria included currently admitted patients, prior nephrolithiasis, congenital or acquired urinary tract anomalies, and patients on calciuretics. Records were assessed for serum calcium and PTH measurement, as well as referrals. Univariate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS Of 1782 patients with nephrolithiasis screened, 968 met inclusion criteria. Patients were 49.8% female, 88.9% white. Mean age was 53 y. Within this cohort, 620 (64.0%) patients had a calcium measured, with a mean elapsed time from presentation of 27 d (interquartile range [IQR] 0-8). Twelve patients (1.58%) with calcium measured were hypercalcemic and eight (66.7%) had PTH measured with a mean elapsed time from presentation of 183 d (IQR 72-310), all had elevated or non-suppressed PTH. Five (62.5%) were referred to surgeons with mean elapsed referral time of 270 d (IQR 95-492). CONCLUSIONS Many with index nephrolithiasis are not assessed for hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism.

Results Of the 23 patients tested, the proportions of those with positive test results at first specimen collection (the median number of days to first specimen collection after symptom onset was 10) on RT-qPCR and viral culture tests were 957% and 304%, respectively. All six patients with positive viral culture test results who were followed-up tested negative 24 days after symptom onset but remained positive on RT-qPCR. Viral loads based on PCR testing did not decrease over time, but those determined via culture tests decreased over time. The longest negative conversion time was observed in a dialysis patient on immunosuppressive drugs. Conclusions This study indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 remain culture positive for  10 days after symptom onset. Additionally, immunosuppressed patients with severe COVID-19 could consider isolation for  20 days.","output":"Duration of infectious virus shedding in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 who required mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We assessed outcome of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 following treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) and the association with IgG levels in transfused CP. METHODS: A prospective cohort study. Primary outcome was improvement at day 14 defined as alive, not on mechanical ventilation, and moderate, mild, or recovered from COVID-19. Antibody levels in CP units were unknown at the time of treatment. IgG against the spike protein S1 was subsequently measured by ELISA. Neutralizing antibodies titers were determined in a subset. Outcome was assessed in relation to the mean antibody level transfused to the patients (4.0 versus >4.0). FINDINGS: Of 49 patients, 11 (22.4%) had moderate, 38 (77.6%) had severe disease, 28 were ventilated. At day 14, 24 (49.0%) patients improved, 9 (18.4%) died, and 13 (26.5%) were ventilated. In 14/98 (14.3%) CP units IgG was < 1.1 (cutoff calibration) and in 60 (61.2%) 4.0. IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer were correlated (0.85 p < 0.001). In patients receiving 4.0 antibody levels, 11/30 improved (36.7%) versus 13/19 (68.4%) in patients receiving >4.0 odds ratio (OR) 0.267 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.079C0.905], P = 0.030.

This virus has become one of the most dangerous in recent times with a very high rate of transmission. At present, several publications show the typical crown-shape of the novel coronavirus grown in cell cultures. However, an integral ultramicroscopy study done directly from clinical specimens has not been published. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 12 Cuban individuals, six asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative (negative control) and six others from a COVID-19 symptomatic and RT-PCR positive for SARS CoV-2. Samples were treated with an aldehyde solution and processed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal microscopy (CM) and, atomic force microscopy. Improvement and segmentation of coronavirus images were performed by a novel mathematical image enhancement algorithm. RESULTS: The images of the negative control sample showed the characteristic healthy microvilli morphology at the apical region of the nasal epithelial cells. As expected, they do not display virus-like structures. The images of the positive sample showed characteristic coronavirus-like particles and evident destruction of microvilli. In some regions, virions budding through the cell membrane were observed. Microvilli destruction could explain the anosmia reported by some patients. Virus-particles emerging from the cell-surface with a variable size ranging from 80 to 400 nm were observed by SEM. Viral antigen was identified in the apical cells zone by CM. CONCLUSIONS: The integral microscopy study showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image to SARS-CoV. The application of several high-resolution microscopy techniques to nasopharyngeal samples awaits future use.

As only few reports have described their prognosis more than 6 months later, the main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of OD and GD 11 months after COVID-19. We also aimed to determine test-retest reliability of subjective chemosensory ratings for the follow-up of chemosensory sensitivity, as this measure is often used for remote follow-up. MethodsInclusion criteria included a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; exclusion criteria were the presence of other respiratory infections and chronic sinusitis. To assess whether OD and GD had changed compared to pre-pandemic levels, we designed an observational study and distributed an online questionnaire assessing quantitative chemosensory function to healthcare workers 5 and 11 months after COVID-19. Specifically, we assessed olfaction, gustation, and trigeminal sensitivity (10-point visual analog scale) and function (4-point Likert scale) separately. We further assessed clinically relevant OD using the Chemosensory Perception Test, a psychophysical test designed to provide a reliable remote olfactory evaluation. Qualitative chemosensory dysfunction was also assessed. ResultsWe included a total of 366 participants (mean age of 44.8 years old (SD: 11.7)). They completed the last online questionnaire 10.6 months (SD: 0.7) after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Of all participants, 307 (83.9%) and 301 (82.2%) individuals retrospectively reported lower olfactory or gustatory sensitivity during the acute phase of COVID-19. Eleven months later, 184 (50.3%) and 163 (44.5%) indicated reduced chemosensory sensitivity, 32.2% reported impairment of olfactory function while 24.9% exhibited clinically relevant OD. Three variables predicted OD at follow-up, namely chest pain and GD during COVID-19 and presence of phantosmia at 5 months. Olfactory sensitivity ratings had a high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.818 (95% CI: 0.760 - 0.860)) DiscussionThis study suggests that chemosensory dysfunctions persist in a third of COVID-19 patients 11 months after COVID-19. Subjective measures have a high test-retest reliability and thus can be used to monitor post-COVID-19 OD.

The Royal Wolverhampton hospital followed both protocols. Here, we investigate the evidence behind this decision within the context of surgical admissions during the COVID-19 peak in our hospital. Methods Retrospective data collection and analysis of all surgical admissions between the 1st of March to the 31st of May. Data was collected from the radiology and electronic portal looking into patients undergoing CT chest to diagnose the presence of C-19 as well as swab results. Results 78 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The scan either confirmed the presence or absence (4, 63 patients) of C-19 but was sometimes inconclusive (11 patients). Comparing these to the results of the swabs;CT showed sensitivity 42.86 %, Specificity 97.92%, and accuracy 90.91 %. In the inconclusive CT report group, chances of having a positive swab result were 45%: None of the scan results changed any of the surgical planning. Lymphocyte count in the context of surgical presentation did not have any statistical significance to predict the presence of C-19 (P=0.7). Cost implications on our cohort of patients for adding the chest CT is estimated to be around 31,000. Conclusion CT Thorax during the pandemic was a good negative predictor but had limited diagnostic value and did not change patient management.

However, the mortality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 is unclear. Here, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis, in line with PRISMA guidelines, to assess the reported ICU mortality for patients with confirmed COVID-19. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane databases up to 31 May 2020 for studies reporting ICU mortality for adult patients admitted with COVID-19. The primary outcome measure was death in intensive care as a proportion of completed ICU admissions, either through discharge from the ICU or death. The definition thus did not include patients still alive on ICU. Twenty-four observational studies including 10,150 patients were identified from centres across Asia, Europe and North America. In-ICU mortality in reported studies ranged from 0 to 84.6%. Seven studies reported outcome data for all patients. In the remaining studies, the proportion of patients discharged from ICU at the point of reporting varied from 24.5 to 97.2%. In patients with completed ICU admissions with COVID-19 infection, combined ICU mortality (95%CI) was 41.6% (34.0-49.7%), I2 = 93.2%). Sub-group analysis by continent showed that mortality is broadly consistent across the globe. As the pandemic has progressed, the reported mortality rates have fallen from above 50% to close to 40%. The in-ICU mortality from COVID-19 is higher than usually seen in ICU admissions with other viral pneumonias.

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections. Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue, has inhibitory effects on animal and human highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, in in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. It is also inhibitory against the COVID-19 virus in-vitro. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in adult patients with severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19 virus infection. Methods: The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Adults (18 years) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 virus infection, and severe pneumonia signs or symptoms, and radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir or placebo for 10 days.

The primary objective of this study was to examine the association between PIF status and COPD exacerbations among outpatients with moderate to very severe COPD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of patients from 7 US outpatient centers. PIF was measured using an inspiratory flow meter (In-Check? DIAL G16) set to medium low resistance. Patients were classified by suboptimal (<60 L/min) or optimal PIF (60 L/min). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with moderate/severe COPD exacerbations collected by medical record review over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were time to first exacerbation and mortality. RESULTS: Of 474 patients screened, 38.8% had suboptimal PIF, and 71 patients with optimal PIF were excluded from the study. The enrolled sample included 184 and 219 patients with suboptimal and optimal PIF, respectively. Suboptimal PIF was associated with shorter stature (66.64.1 vs 67.83.8 inches, P = 0.002), female sex (45.1 vs 34.7%, P = 0.033), Black race (27.2 vs 11.0%, P < 0.001), and greater symptom burden (CAT: 22.37.7 vs 19.07.0, P < 0.001; mMRC: 2.01.1 vs 1.71.1, P = 0.003). The proportion of patients with COPD exacerbations at 12 months was not significantly different (29.3 vs 27.9%, P = 0.751).

However, an increasing number of reports currently support videolaryngoscopy, particularly for novice users. The widespread use of videolaryngoscopy may be limited due to financial limitations, especially in low-income countries. Therefore, affordable single-use scopes are now becoming increasingly popular. We sought to compare these new scopes with direct laryngoscopes and the previously tested videolaryngoscopes in mannequins by novices. METHODS Fifty medical students were recruited to serve as novice users. Following brief, standardized training, students were asked to execute endotracheal intubation with each of the devices, including the Airtraq?, a custom-made videolaryngoscope, the King Vision?, the Macintosh laryngoscope and the VividTrac?, on an airway trainer (Laerdal Airway Management Trainer?) in normal and difficult airway scenarios. We evaluated the time to and the proportion of successful intubation, the best view of the glottis, esophageal intubation, dental trauma and user satisfaction. RESULTS We observed no differences in esophageal intubation. However, intubation-related times, the view of the glottis and operator satisfaction were significantly better throughout the study with the commercial videolaryngoscopes. In comparison, the custom-made videolaryngoscope performance proved to be similar to that of the Macintosh laryngoscope. The VividTrac? performance was similar (P > 0.05) or significantly better than that of the King Vision? in both scenarios.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was utilized to collect data early on during the outbreak in Jordan. All medical students in Jordan were eligible to complete an online questionnaire assessing self-reported emotional reactions to COVID-19 that covered four main domains: negative emotion (anxiety, worry, depression, panic, loneliness, and nervousness), positive emotion (happiness, joy, and excitement), sleep disorders (insomnia, shallow sleep, nightmares, and insufficient sleep), and aggression (verbal argument and physical fighting). The frequency of social media utilization as a main source of COVID-19 information was also assessed. Results: 59.9% of participants were females, 64.9% were enrolled at the two major medical schools in Jordan, and 59.6% were in the pre-clinical stage (years). A significant proportion of participants self-reported increased negative emotional levels of anxiety (49.2%), worry (72.4%), depression (23.1%), panic (22.6%), and nervousness (38.2%) and decreased positive emotional levels of happiness (44.8%), joy (47.3%), and feelings of excitement (45.1%).

METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases and the World Health Organization Novel Coronavirus website to identify studies that reported mortality and characteristics of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The primary study outcome was mortality, defined as all-cause mortality or in-hospital mortality within 30 days of initial COVID-19 diagnosis. The pooled proportion of mortality was estimated using a random-effects model, and study-level moderators of heterogeneity were assessed through subgroup analysis and metaregression. RESULTS: Among 2922 patients from 13 primarily inpatient studies of individuals with COVID-19 and cancer, the pooled 30-day mortality rate was 30% (95% CI, 25%-35%). The overall pooled 30-day mortality rate among 624 patients from 5 studies that included a mixture of inpatient and outpatient populations was 15% (95% CI, 9%-22%).

Combined with the fact that 40% of patients admitted to hospital are malnourished to some degree, we are looking at a huge population of potential COVID-19 patients facing a further decline in nutritional status and higher mortality as a result of this, making attention to nutrition more important than ever.As junior doctors, we have a role in the nutritional assessment of and support for our patients by ensuring that all patients are suitably assessed using a scoring tool with the appropriate ensuing actions taken. We must also ensure that our knowledge regarding nutritional assessment and support is adequate and aim to supplement this via additional learning to meet the minimum requirements for our curriculum.","output":"'Food for thought': The importance of nutrition to patient care and the role of the junior doctor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the inadequacy of the Philippine governments scientific response against the COVID-19 pandemic, given the societal dimension of the virus.

In many areas in Latin America where T.cruzi is endemic, this cycle is poorly known, and its main reservoirs have not been identified. In this study we analyzed T.cruzi infection in bats and other small mammals from an Ecological Reserve in southeastern Mexico. From January through March 2021, we captured wild individuals to extract cardiac and peripheral blood, and infection was detected by PCR of the mini-exon gene. In bats, the prevalence of infection was 16.36%, while in small mammals the prevalence was 28.57%. All of the samples that were positive for T.cruzi were identified as the TCI genotype. Our findings suggest that this zone, situated at the periphery of urban zones might have epidemiological relevance in the sylvatic cycle of T.cruzi and needs to be monitored. The infection of bats in this area is particularly concerning since the flight pattern of this populations overlaps with human settlements.

Stopping the relatively small number of parasites injected by the mosquito before they can migrate from the skin to the liver is an attractive goal. Antibody-eliciting vaccines have been used to pursue this objective by targeting the major parasite surface protein present during this stage, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). While CSP-based vaccines have recently had encouraging success in disease reduction, this was only achieved with extremely high antibody titers and appeared less effective for a complete block of infection. While such disease reduction is important, these results also indicate that further improvements to vaccines based solely on CSP will likely yield diminishing benefits towards the goal of durable, infection-blocking immunity. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the sporozoite protein TRAP/SSP2 across the major protein domains exhibit a range of inhibitory capacity and that these mAbs can augment CSP-based protection despite delivering no sterile protection on their own. Therefore, pursuing a multivalent subunit vaccine immunization is a promising strategy for improving infection-blocking malaria vaccines.","output":"Anti-TRAP/SSP2 monoclonal antibodies can inhibit sporozoite infection and enhance protection of anti-CSP monoclonal antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of probiotics for farm animals has increased considerably over the last 15 years.

We present a series of 10 patients with lower cranial nerve involvement after severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study of patients admitted to the post-intensive care unit (p-ICU) of Besan?on University Hospital (France) between March 16 and May 22, 2020. We included patients with confirmed COVID-19 and cranial neuropathy at admission to the p-ICU. All these patients were treated by orotracheal intubation, and all but one underwent prone-position ventilation therapy. RESULTS: Of the 88 patients admitted to the p-ICU, 10 patients (11%) presented at least 1 cranial nerve palsy. Of these 10 patients, 9 had a hypoglossal nerve palsy and 8 of these also had a deficit in another cranial nerve. The most frequent association was between hypoglossal and vagal palsies (5 patients). None of the patients developed neurological signs related to a global neuropathy. We found no correlation between the intensity of the motor limb weakness and the occurrence of lower cranial nerve palsies. All but 2 of the patients recovered within less than a month. CONCLUSION: The mechanical compressive hypothesis, linked to the prone-position ventilation therapy, appears to be the major factor.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the safety of CQ and HCQ from malarial and non-malarial randomized clinical trials (RCTs). METHODS: The primary outcomes were the frequencies of serious adverse events (SAEs), retinopathy, and cardiac complications. Search strategies were applied to MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Trip databases. We used a random-effects model to pool results across studies and Petos one-step odds ratio (OR) for event rates below 1%. Both-armed zero-event studies were excluded from the meta-analyses. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: One hundred and six RCTs were included. We found no significant difference between CQ/HCQ and control (placebo or non-CQ/HCQ) in the frequency of SAEs (OR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76C1.26, 33 trials, 15,942 participants, moderate certainty of evidence). However, there was a moderate certainty of evidence that CQ/HCQ increases the incidence of cardiac complications (RR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.10C2.38, 16 trials, 9908 participants). No clear relationship was observed between CQ/HCQ and retinopathy (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: ? 0.4C6.57, 5 trials, 344 participants, very low certainty of evidence). CONCLUSIONS: CQ and HCQ probably do not increase SAEs, with low frequency of these adverse events on malarial and non-malarial conditions.

The virus, which first appeared as a sign of pneumonia, was later called the SARS-COV-2 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by the World Health Organization. The SARS-COV-2 virus is triggered by binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) inhibitor, which is vital in cardiovascular diseases and the immune system, especially in conditions such as cerebrovascular, hypertension, and diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the prediction performance of death status based on the demographic/clinical factors (including COVID-19 severity) by data mining methods. METHODS: The dataset consists of 1603 SARS-COV-2 patients and 13 variables obtained from an open-source web address. The current dataset contains age, gender, chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, renal, cardiovascular, etc.), some enzymes (ACE, angiotensin II receptor blockers), and COVID-19 severity, which are used to predict death status using deep learning and machine learning approaches (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). A grid search algorithm tunes hyperparameters of the models, and predictions are assessed through performance metrics. Steps of knowledge discovery in databases are applied to obtain the relevant information. RESULTS: The accuracy rate of deep learning (97.15%) was more successful than the accuracy rate based on classical machine learning (92.15% for RF and 93.4% for k-NN), but the ensemble classifier XGBoost method gave the highest accuracy (99.7%). While COVID-19 severity and age calculated from XGBoost were the two most important factors associated with death status, the most determining variables for death status estimated from deep learning were COVID-19 severity and hypertension.

We show that clonotypes within each CET respond to the same epitope, and that protein antigens stimulate multiple CETs reactive to constituent peptides. Finally, we demonstrate the personalized assignment of antigen-specificity to rare clones within fully-diverse unexpanded repertoires. The method presented here may be used to monitor T cell responses to vaccination and immunotherapy with high fidelity.","output":"A framework to identify antigen-expanded T Cell Receptor (TCR) clusters within complex repertoires"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Grab is a startup company engaged in the online transportation service business.

Depending on the state of the national economy, and especially in times of economic recession, different population groups may consider agriculture as either a sector of departure or a sector of arrival. In Greece, migrant labour has become a major component of agricultural production and rural development, especially in areas where intensive agricultural systems prevail. The aim of this paper is to critically discuss the contribution of migrant employment to Greek agriculture in recent decades. First, the paper provides an overview of the academic discussion concerning migrants in rural Greece, offering a framework for interpreting migrant employment in Greek agriculture. This is followed by an analytical account of the structural characteristics of the Greek agricultural sector. Next, the focus turns to the changing features of migrant labour in Greek agriculture since the early 1990s. Methodologically, the paper synthesizes secondary data from various sources. The paper concludes with reflections on the prospects for migrant labour in Greek agriculture, particularly in an era of changing migration flows and restricted mobility due to COVID-19. ? 2021 Apostolos G.

We aimed to evaluate the quantity of family meetings by telephone, video and in-person during the COVID-19 pandemic by manual chart review. Secondary outcomes included rate of change in patient goals of care between video and in-person meetings, the timing of family meetings, and variability in meetings by race and ethnicity. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study evaluated patients admitted to the intensive care unit at an urban academic hospital between March and June 2020. Patients lacking decision-making capacity and receiving a referral for a video meeting were included in this study. RESULTS: Most patients meeting inclusion criteria (N = 61/481, 13%) had COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 57/61, 93%). A total of 650 documented family meetings occurred. Few occurred in-person (n = 70/650, 11%) or discussed goals of care (n = 233/650, 36%). For meetings discussing goals of care, changes in patient goals of care occurred more often for in-person meetings rather than by video (36% vs. 11%, p = 0.0006). The average time to the first goals of care family meeting was 11.4 days from admission. More documented telephone meetings per admission were observed for White (10.5, SD 9.5) and Black/African-American (7.1, SD 6.6) patients compared to Hispanic or Latino patients (4.9, SD 4.9) (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: During this period of strict visitor restrictions, few family meetings occurred in-person. Statistically significant fewer changes in patient goals of care occurred following video meetings compared to in-person meetings, providing support limiting in-person meetings may affect patient care.","output":"Family Meetings in the Intensive Care Unit During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Like many places in Nigeria, Niger, a predominantly rural and poor state in the north of the country, has high fertility, low contraceptive prevalence, and high maternal mortality. This paper presents a descriptive, contextualized case study of a social accountability campaign run by the nongovernmental organization White Ribbon Alliance Nigeria to strategically mobilize collective action to demand quality maternal health care and improve government responsiveness to those demands. We treat maternal health as a component of reproductive health, while recognizing it as a less contested area. METHODS Data come from more than 40 interviews with relevant actors in Niger State in 2017 and 2018 during the initial phase of the campaign, and follow-up interviews with White Ribbon Alliance Nigeria staff in 2019 and 2021. Other data include White Ribbon Alliance Nigeria's monthly reports. We analyzed these data both deductively and inductively using qualitative techniques. RESULTS During its first phase, the campaign used advocacy techniques to convince the previously reticent state government to engage with citizens, and worked to amplify citizen voice by hosting community dialogues and town halls, training a cadre of citizen journalists, and shoring up ward health development committees. Many of these efforts were unsustainable, however, so during the campaign's second phase, White Ribbon Alliance Nigeria worked to solidify state commitment to durable accountability structures intended to survive beyond the campaign's involvement. Key challenges have included a nontransparent state budget release process and the continued need for significant support from White Ribbon Alliance Nigeria. CONCLUSION These findings reveal the significant time and resource inputs associated with implementing a strategic social accountability campaign, important compromises around the terminology used to describe \\"accountability,\\" and the constraints on government responsiveness posed by unrealistic budgeting procedures. The campaign's contributions towards increased social accountability for maternal health should, however, also benefit accountability for reproductive health, as informed and empowered woman are better prepared to demand health services in any sector.","output":"Building social accountability to improve reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health in Nigeria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bayesian inference in biological modeling commonly relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of a multidimensional and non-Gaussian posterior distribution that is not analytically tractable. Here, we present the implementation of a practical MCMC method in the open-source software package PyBioNetFit (PyBNF), which is designed to support parameterization of mathematical models for biological systems. The new MCMC method, am, incorporates an adaptive move proposal distribution. For warm starts, sampling can be initiated at a specified location in parameter space and with a multivariate Gaussian proposal distribution defined initially by a specified covariance matrix. Multiple chains can be generated in parallel using a computer cluster. We demonstrate that am can be used to successfully solve real-world Bayesian inference problems, including forecasting of new Coronavirus Disease 2019 case detection with Bayesian quantification of forecast uncertainty. PyBNF version 1.1.9, the first stable release with am, is available at PyPI and can be installed using the pip package-management system on platforms that have a working installation of Python 3.

Massive data is a fundamental aspect of the most powerful AI-based algorithms. However, for AI-based healthcare solutions, there are several socioeconomic, technical/infrastructural, and most importantly, legal restrictions, which limit the large collection and access of biomedical data, especially medical imaging. To overcome this important limitation, several alternative solutions have been suggested, including transfer learning approaches, generation of artificial data, adoption of blockchain technology, and creation of an infrastructure composed of anonymous and abstract data. However, none of these strategies is currently able to completely solve this challenge. The need to build large datasets that can be used to develop healthcare solutions deserves special attention from the scientific community, clinicians, all the healthcare players, engineers, ethicists, legislators, and society in general. This paper offers an overview of the data limitation in medical predictive models; its impact on the development of healthcare solutions; benefits and barriers of sharing data; and finally, suggests future directions to overcome data limitations in the medical field and enable AI to enhance healthcare.

An appreciation of the differences in the complication rates between different surgical techniques and timing of repair is essential in optimizing cleft palate management. METHOD A comprehensive electronic database search will be conducted on the complication rates associated with cleft palate repair using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Two independent reviewers with expertise in cleft pathology will screen all appropriate titles, abstracts, and full-text publications prior to deciding whether each meet the predetermined inclusion criteria. The study findings will be tabulated and summarized. The primary outcomes will be the rate of palatal fistula, the incidence and severity of velopharyngeal insufficiency, and the rate of maxillary hypoplasia with different techniques and also the timing of the repair. A meta-analysis will be conducted using a random effects model. DISCUSSION The evidence behind the optimal surgical approach to cleft palate repair is minimal, with no gold standard technique identified to date for a certain type of cleft palate. It is essential to appreciate how the complication rates differ between each surgical technique and each time point of repair, in order to optimize the management of these patients.

We investigated the influence of stem 1 length on the frameshift process by measuring the frameshift efficiency in vitro of a series of IBV-based pseudoknots whose stem 1 length was varied from 4 to 13 bp in single base-pair increments. Efficient frameshifting depended upon the presence of a minimum of 11 bp; pseudoknots with a shorter stem 1 were either non-functional or had reduced frameshift efficiency, despite the fact that a number of them had a stem 1 with a predicted stability equal to or greater than that of the wild-type IBV pseudoknot. An upper limit for stem 1 length was not determined, but pseudoknots containing a 12 or 13 bp stem 1 were fully functional. Structure probing analysis was carried out on RNAs containing either a ten or 11 bp stem 1; these experiments confirmed that both RNAs formed pseudoknots and appeared to be indistinguishable in conformation. Thus the difference in frameshifting efficiency seen with the two structures was not simply due to an inability of the 10 bp stem 1 construct to fold into a pseudoknot. In an attempt to identify other parameters which could account for the poor functionality of the shorter stem 1-containing pseudoknots, we investigated, in the context of the 10 bp stem 1 construct, the influence on frameshifting of altering the slippery sequence-pseudoknot spacing distance, loop 2 length, and the number of G residues at the bottom of the 5-arm of stem 1. For each parameter, it was possible to find a condition where a modest stimulation of frameshifting was observable (about twofold, from seven to a maximal 17 %), but we were unable to find a situation where frameshifting approached the levels seen with 11 bp stem 1 constructs (48-57 %). Furthermore, in the next smaller construct (9 bp stem 1), changing the bottom four base-pairs to GC (the optimal base composition) only stimulated frameshifting from 3 to 6 %, an efficiency about tenfold lower than seen with the 11 bp construct. Thus stem 1 length is a major factor in determining the functionality of this class of pseudoknot and this has implications for models of the frameshift process.","output":"The role of RNA pseudoknot stem 1 length in the promotion of efficient ?1 ribosomal frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, a vaccine is urgently needed. BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel). METHODS: We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18C55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, or 6 g with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519). FINDINGS: Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 105C261) participants in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 138C305) in the 6 g with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 81C227) in the 6 g with Algel group, and ten (10%; 69C236) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 g with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 879, 919, and 828 in the 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel groups, respectively. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups. INTERPRETATION: BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are warranted.

Appropriate behavioral tests were performed to assess anxiety levels, while oxidative status and apoptosis parameters were determined in the hippocampus samples.

On 18 September, the Ethiopian Minister of Health advised the Parliament the possibility of reopening schools provided certain conditions were met. Schools are currently reopening in the country for the first time since March 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the knowledge and preventive health behaviours toward COVID-19 and associated factors among secondary school students. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 370 secondary school students were included. Bivariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression model were fitted to identify the predictors of knowledge about COVID-19. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis were done to identify factors associated with preventive behaviour. A p<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: Only one-fourth (23.5%, 95% CI 19.5% to 28.1%) of the participants had a good knowledge about COVID-19. The mean score of preventive behaviour was 22.8SD 6.2. Marital status, religion, father education, living arrangement and sources of information were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Being female and using health professionals as source of information increased the engagement in preventive behaviours. On the other hand, student whose father employed in non-governmental organisation and other jobs had decreased engagement in preventive health behaviours. CONCLUSION: Significant number of the students had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and poorly engaged in COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Thus, it is suggested to include and disseminate about COVID-19 in related academic sessions, using school clubs and minimedias.

A total of 43 WFPs were recorded, most of which were used as cooked vegetables and raw snacks. Leaves were the most frequently used plant part. A remarkable proportion (81%) of use reports for the recorded wild plant taxa were quoted as foodCmedicines or medicinal foods, while very few were reported as either food or medicines, without any relationship between uses in these two domains. Previous ethnomedicinal studies from nearby regions have shown that most of the recorded wild plants have been used as medicines, thus supporting the findings of the current study. A literature survey revealed that many of the reported medicinal uses (33%) for the quoted WFPs were not verifiable on PubMed as they have not been studied for their respective medicinal actions. We observed that most of the plants quoted here have disappeared from the traditional food and medicinal system, which may be attributed to the invasion of the food market and the prevalence of allopathic medicine. However, knowledge of these wild plants is still alive in memory, and women are the main holders of cultural knowledge as they use it to manage the cooking and processing of WFPs. Therefore, in this context, we strongly recommend the preservation of local biocultural heritage, promoted through future development and educational programs, which could represent a timely response to the loss of cultural and traditional knowledge.","output":"The Fading Wild Plant FoodCMedicines in Upper Chitral, NW Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polyethylene (PE) is one the most used plastics worldwide for a wide range of applications due to its good mechanical and chemical resistance, low density, cost efficiency, ease of processability, non-reactivity, low toxicity, good electric insulation, and good functionality. However, its high flammability and rapid flame spread pose dangers for certain applications. Therefore, different flame-retardant (FR) additives are incorporated into PE to increase its flame retardancy. In this review article, research papers from the past 10 years on the flame retardancy of PE systems are comprehensively reviewed and classified based on the additive sources. The FR additives are classified in well-known FR families, including phosphorous, melamine, nitrogen, inorganic hydroxides, boron, and silicon. The mechanism of fire retardance in each family is pinpointed. In addition to the efficiency of each FR in increasing the flame retardancy, its impact on the mechanical properties of the PE system is also discussed. Most of the FRs can decrease the heat release rate (HRR) of the PE products and simultaneously maintains the mechanical properties in appropriate ratios. Based on the literature, inorganic hydroxide seems to be used more in PE systems compared to other families. Finally, the role of nanotechnology for more efficient FR-PE systems is discussed and recommendations are given on implementing strategies that could help incorporate flame retardancy in the circular economy model.","output":"The Flame Retardancy of Polyethylene Composites: From Fundamental Concepts to Nanocomposites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine-hesitancy and political populism are positively associated across Europe: those countries in which their citizens present higher populist attitudes are those that also have higher vaccine-hesitancy rates.

This method is able to retain the lignin in EFB and manifest the properties of lignin. The proposed synthesis process is simpler than the conventional method of producing lignin-coated CNC by first removing the lignin to synthesize CNC followed by the re-coating of lignin on the structure. The samples of LCNC were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and water contact angle analysis. In addition, by altering the acid concentration during acid hydrolysis process (53% - 60% H2SO4), both surface hydrophobicity (66.0 - 75.1) and length of LCNC (467 nm-177 nm) can be altered wherein a higher concentration of acid resulted in a greater contact angle and a shorter length of LCNC.

After an initial phase of viral replication, some patients develop a second illness phase in which the host thrombotic and inflammatory responses seem to drive complications. Severe COVID-19 disease is linked to high mortality, hyperinflammation, and a remarkably high incidence of thrombotic events. We hypothesize a crucial pathophysiological role for the contact pathway of coagulation and the kallikrein-bradykinin pathway. Therefore, drugs that modulate this excessive thromboinflammatory response should be investigated in severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this adaptive, open-label multicenter randomized clinical trial, we compare low molecular weight heparins at 50 IU anti-Xa/kg twice dailyor 75 IU anti-Xa twice daily for intensive care (ICU) patientsin combination with aprotinin to standard thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In the case of hyperinflammation, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra will be added on top of the drugs in the interventional arm. In a pilot phase, the effect of the intervention on thrombotic markers (D-dimer) will be assessed. In the full trial, the primary outcome is defined as the effect of the interventional drugs on clinical status as defined by the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: In this trial, we target the thromboinflammatory response at multiple levels. We intensify the dose of low molecular weight heparins to reduce thrombotic complications. Aprotinin is a potent kallikrein pathway inhibitor that reduces fibrinolysis, activation of the contact pathway of coagulation, and local inflammatory response. Additionally, aprotinin has shown in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Because the excessive thromboinflammatory response is one of the most adverse prognostic factors in COVID-19, we will add anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, to the regimen in case of severely increased inflammatory parameters. This way, we hope to modulate the systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 and avoid disease progressions with a potentially fatal outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The EU Clinical Trials Register 2020-001739-28.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the incidence and outcomes of COVID- 19 in hemodialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study on the incidence and mortality of COVID- 19 in hemodialysis patients as compared with the general adult population in the period from the beginning of the pandemic until the commencement of the SARS- CoV 2 vaccination program. The study population included all patients who were receiving hemodialysis in any of the 14 dialysis units of Pomerania Province, Poland on December 31, 2019 and all individuals who were starting long- term hemodialysis between January 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021, amounting to a total of 1567 patients. Data on the general population were obtained from reports of the health authorities. RESULTS: The absolute cumulative incidence of SARS- CoV 2 infection in hemodialysis patients was 22.4%, and after standardization for age it was 3.98-fold higher compared with the general population (P <0.001). The epidemic trajectory of both groups ran in parallel, but the increase and decline in the number of new cases occurred earlier in hemodialysis patients.

As there is currently no randomized controlled trial (RCT) reporting long-term patient-reported outcomes between CTEP and STEP, we reviewed patients who were randomized to CTEP or STEP 5 years after surgery. METHODS Telephone interviews were administered to patients with primary unilateral inguinal hernia recruited for the RCT comparing CTEP and STEP in 2011. The modified Body Image Questionnaire was used to measure long-term patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS Forty-two out of forty-nine of the STEP group and forty-one out of fifty of the CTEP group responded to phone interviews. Median follow-up time, demographic data and clinical outcomes were comparable between both groups. The Body Image Score (5-20: 5-least dissatisfied, 20-most dissatisfied; BIS score  SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 5.33  0.90 vs. 7.17  1.87, p < 0.001) and Cosmetic Score (2-20: 2-least satisfied, 20-most satisfied; CS score  SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 19.05  1.31 vs. 15.87  1.57, p < 0.001) were superior in the STEP group. Similarly, self-reported scar perception (1-cannot be seen, 2-can barely be seen, 3-visible; scar perception score  SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 1.29  0.51 vs. 2.55  0.64, p < 0.001) and overall experience score (1-least satisfied, 10-most satisfied; overall satisfaction score  SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 9.57  0.67 vs. 8.22  0.94, p < 0.001) were superior in the STEP group. CONCLUSION Patients who underwent STEP reported superior cosmetic and satisfaction scores and comparable surgical outcomes 5 years after surgery compared to the CTEP group.

Associated growth in production increases dependency on natural resources in countries that attempt to meet part or all of the new demand locally. This study assesses the impact of changing meat and milk production on natural resource use in Kenya under three plausible scenarios of socio-economic development, namely Business-As-Usual (BAU), Sustainable Development (SDP) and Kenya Vision 2030 (V2030) scenarios. The IMPACT model is used to estimate projected cattle, sheep, goats and camel production parameters for meat and milk. The BAU and SDP represent standard scenarios for Kenya of a global economic model, IMPACT, while V2030 incorporates in the model features specific to Kenya's medium-term national development plan. We use calculations of water footprint and land footprint as resource use indicators to quantify the anticipated appropriation of water and land resources for meat and milk production and trade by 2040. Though camel dairy production numbers increase the most by quadrupling between 2005 and 2040, it is cattle dairy production that significantly determined gains in production between the scenarios. Productivity gains under the SDP scenario does not match the investments made thereby leading to only slightly better values for water and land productivity than those achieved under the BAU scenario. Relative to the BAU scenario, improvement in land productivity under the V2030 scenario is the most dramatic for shoat milk production in the arid and semi-arid systems but the least marked for cattle milk production in the humid system. By quantifying water and land productivity across heterogenous production systems, our findings can aid decision-makers in Kenya and other developing countries to understand the implications of strategies aimed at increasing domestic agricultural and livestock production on water and land resources both locally and through trade with other countries.","output":"Livestock water and land productivity in Kenya and their implications for future resource use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article entitled Enhancing Moon Crescent Visibility using Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization and Bilateral Filtering Techniques has automated the determination of the religious festivals date based on the analysis of digital images.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated our democratic processes. Voters and poll workers feel threatened by the potential dangers of voting in business-as-usual polling stations. Indeed, significant problems were encountered in the recent 2020 primary elections in Wisconsin, where the National Guard had to be mobilized because so few poll workers reported to work, and more than 90% of polling places had to remain closed. METHOD: We describe a number of possible user-centered solutions that would help protect voters and poll workers in times of pandemic, and also report the results of a survey that asked voters and poll workers about what kinds of systems might make them willing to vote. RESULTS: Political as well as safety considerations will need to be considered as these safer voting solutions are designed since, surprisingly, the kinds of solutions preferred depend on the political affiliation of the voters. CONCLUSION: Human factors professionals have a large role to play in realizing the safe, successful implementation of these user-centered systems. Good human factors analysis can help minimize the risk to voters and poll workers. Moreover, human factors methods can help safeguard democracy by creating safe and well-engineered environments that are conducive to voting in the age of pandemics.

Fitusiran is a subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational siRNA therapeutic targeting antithrombin to restore thrombin generation and rebalance hemostasis in people with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors. Here, we present the safety and efficacy of fitusiran prophylaxis for PwHI in a phase 3 study (ATLAS-INH;NCT03417102). Methods The ATLAS-INH study is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in PwHI. Eligible males 12 years receiving on-demand treatment with bypassing agents (BPA) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive once monthly 80 mg SC fitusiran prophylaxis or continue with on-demand BPA. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in PwHI on fitusiran prophylaxis compared to those on BPA on-demand in the efficacy period. The secondary endpoints include spontaneous ABR, joint ABR, and quality of life (QoL) measured by Haem-A-QoL. Results 57 subjects were randomized into the study. Mean (range) age of the study participants at screening was 28.4 (13-63) yrs. Statistical significance was achieved for primary and all secondary endpoints with significant reduction in ABRs of treated bleeds: all, spontaneous and joint bleeds for fitusiran vs on-demand BPA arm (Table 1). A total of 25 patients in fitusiran arm (65.8%) had zero treated bleeding events. Efficacy of fitusiran prophylaxis treatment was seen in both hemophilia A and hemophilia B patients with inhibitors. Statistical significance was also achieved for improvement in physical health domain score, with a difference (95% CI) of -28.72 (-39.07 to -18.37, p-value <0.0001) as well as overall HRQoL and between fitusiran and on-demand BPA arms. Overall, 38 patients (92.7%) in the fitusiran arm and 11 patients (57.9%) in the on-demand BPA arm experienced at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). A total of 13 treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were reported in 7 patients (17.1%) in the fitusiran arm and 8 TESAEs were reported in 5 patients (26.3%) in the on-demand BPA arm. All TESAEs were reported in 1 patient each;in the fitusiran prophylaxis arm these included events of device related infection, hematuria, spinal vascular disorder, subclavian vein thrombosis, thrombosis, acute cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis and asymptomatic COVID-19. One patient (2.4%) in the fitusiran arm experienced TEAEs that resulted in study drug discontinuation (spinal vascular disorder and thrombosis). There were no fatal TEAEs reported. Conclusions This Phase 3 study demonstrated the efficacy of the 80 mg monthly subcutaneous prophylaxis dose of fitusiran in people with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Specifically, fitusiran significantly reduced bleeding with a median ABR of zero and significant proportion of people with zero bleeds, resulting in a meaningful improvement in health-related quality of life. Reported TESAEs were generally consistent with what is anticipated in an adult and adolescent population with severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, or with the previously identified risks of fitusiran. A revised fitusiran dosing regimen with reduced dose and dose frequency is currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical studies.

Previous studies have shown that different risk perceptions and sociodemographic characteristics may lead to vastly different prevention behaviors. This paper applies a temporal perspective in examining the changing patterns of prevention practices over time and their dynamic relationships with the perceived risk towards COVID-19 and its individual characteristics. Three key timelines (February, April, and June of 2020) were identified to represent the early, lockdown, and reopening stages of the first wave. Data were drawn from an online survey conducted in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) of Canada (n = 470). Chi-square tests and logistic regression models revealed important temporal patterns in practicing different hygienic and mobility-related prevention measures and the respondents risk perceptions during the three timelines. The factors predicting the level of prevention practices vary across the three timelines, based on the specific type of prevention, and within the changing public health contexts. This study contributes to the literature on COVID-19 by incorporating a temporal perspective in conceptualizing prevention predictors.

METHODS: We analyzed COVID-19-positive patients who presented to the MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, DC, and Maryland) during the pandemic (March 1-September 30, 2020). We compared renal function and subsequent in-hospital clinical outcomes based on the presence or absence of troponin elevation. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients with troponin elevation. We also evaluated in-hospital mortality, overall and based on the presence and absence of both troponin elevation and renal dysfunction. RESULTS: The cohort included 3386 COVID-19-positive admitted patients for whom troponin was drawn. Of these patients, 195 had troponin elevation (defined as &#8805;1.0 ng/mL), mean age was 61  16 years, and 51% were men. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (53.8%) in COVID-19-positive patients with concomitant troponin elevation than in those without troponin elevation (14.5%; p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients with troponin elevation had a higher prevalence of renal dysfunction (58.5%) than those without troponin elevation (23.4%; p < 0.001). Further analysis demonstrated that having both troponin elevation and renal dysfunction carried the worst in-hospital prognosis (in-hospital mortality 57.9%; intensive-care-unit admission 76.8%; ventilation requirement 63.2%), as compared to the absence or presence of either.

Notwithstanding ethical considerations, the prioritization of patients with better prognoses may support a more effective use of available capacity in maximizing aggregate outcomes. This has prompted various proposed triage criteria, although in none of these has an objective assessment been made in terms of impact on number of lives and life-years saved. DESIGN: An open-source computer simulation model was constructed for approximating the intensive care admission and discharge dynamics under triage. The model was calibrated from observational data for 9505 patient admissions to UK intensive care units. To explore triage efficacy under various conditions, scenario analysis was performed using a range of demand trajectories corresponding to differing nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: Triaging patients at the point of expressed demand had negligible effect on deaths but reduces life-years lost by up to 8.4% (95% confidence interval: 2.6% to 18.7%). Greater value may be possible through \\"reverse triage\\", that is, promptly discharging any patient not meeting the criteria if admission cannot otherwise be guaranteed for one who does. Under such policy, life-years lost can be reduced by 11.7% (2.8% to 25.8%), which represents 23.0% (5.4% to 50.1%) of what is operationally feasible with no limit on capacity and in the absence of improved clinical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of simple triage is limited by a tradeoff between reduced deaths within intensive care (due to improved outcomes) and increased deaths resulting from declined admission (due to lower throughput given the longer lengths of stay of survivors). Improvements can be found through reverse triage, at the expense of potentially complex ethical considerations.","output":"The Value of Triage during Periods of Intense COVID-19 Demand: Simulation Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Source plasma is essential to support the growing demand for plasma\\\\derived medicinal products.

RESULTS: At discharge 69.4% of infants were exclusively breastfed during lockdown versus 97.7% of control group, 54.3% at 30 days vs 76.3 and 31.8% vs 70.5% at 90 days (p < 0.001). The proportion of breastfeeding remaining exclusive from discharge to 30-day was similar between groups (about 80%), but it was lower in lockdown group than in control cohort (58.5% vs 92.4%, p < 0.001) from 30- to 90-days. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown and home confinement led to a decrease of exclusively breastfeeding in the studied population. Considering the timing to shift from exclusive to non-exclusive breastfeeding, differences between study groups were concentrated during hospital stay and from 30- to 90 days of a newborn's life, confirming that the hospital stay period is crucial in continuing exclusive breastfeeding at least for the first 30 days, but no longer relevant at 90 days of life.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on exclusive breastfeeding in non-infected mothers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between 2008 and 2010, 19 strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from the vaccinated chicken flocks in Sichuan province, China.

Objective To assess AT1R and ETAR auto-antibodies in COVID19 patients and controls, and explore their association with disease course. Methods: 65 hospitalized patients with COVID19 infection were included. Clinical and laboratory findings were retrospectively assessed. Patients with unfavorable disease course, admitted at the intensive care unit and/or deceased during hospital admission (n=33) were compared to admitted COVID19 patients with favorable disease course (n=32). The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and auto-antibodies against AT1R or ETAR in peripheral blood were compared between COVID19 with unfavorable and favorable disease course and age matched controls (n=20).

SEARCH METHODS: Relevant trials were identified by searching literature until 24 April 2021 using the following terms: anakinra, interleukin 1, coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials evaluating the effect of anakinra on the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized non-intubated patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies (n = 1,119) were eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. Their bias risk with reference to the assessed parameters was high. In pooled analyses, anakinra reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, OR: 038, 95% confidence interval, CI: 017-085, p= 0.02, I2=67%; 6 studies, n = 587) and mortality risk (OR: 032, 95% CI: 023-045, p< 000001, I2=0%; 9 studies, n = 1,119) compared with standard of care therapy.

Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by 3C4 different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced co-assembly with nucleic acids. This suggests that the sequence variability of N-protein is mirrored by high plasticity of N-protein biophysical properties, which we hypothesize can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to achieve greater efficiency of viral assembly, and thereby enhanced infectivity.","output":"Plasticity in structure and assembly of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The glycoprotein spike (S) on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a determinant for viral invasion and host immune response.

Our study indicate that the S protein N-glycosylation occurs regularly at each site, albeit the occupied N-glycans were diverse and heterogenous.

The gradual dumping of plastic wastes, inadequate standard detection methods with specific removal techniques, and slow disposal rate of microplastics make it ubiquitous in the environment. Evidence shows that microplastics act as a potential vector by adsorbing different heavy metals, pathogens, and other chemical additives widely used in different raw plastic production. Microplastics are ingested by aquatic creatures such as fish and different crustaceans, and finally, people ingest them at the tertiary level of the food chain. This phenomenon is responsible for blocking the digestion tracts, disturbing the digestive behavior, finally decreasing the reproductive growth of entire living organisms. Because of these consequences, microplastics have become an increasing concern as a newly emerging potential threat, and therefore, the control of microplastics in aquatic media is required. This paper provides a critical analysis of existing and newly developed methods for detecting and separating microplastics from discharged wastewater, which are the ultimate challenges in the microplastic treatment systems.

In our study we correlated the CT severity score (CT-SS) and the ABO blood group in patients with COVID-19 infection. This study involved 547 symptomatic patients with pathologically proven COVID-19 infection (positive PCR); non contrast CT chest was done for all cases and CT severity score (CT-SS) was calculated followed by its correlation with the patients ABO blood group. Aim of the work was to evaluate the relation between CT-SS and the ABO blood groups in Egyptian patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The mean CT-SS in patients with blood group A patients (n = 153; 28%) was 13.7 (moderate severity), while in patients with blood group O (n = 227; 41.5%) the mean CT-SS was 6.7 (mild severity).

Since the virus is novel, pre-existing CoV2-specific immunity is not expected to exist in humans, although studies have shown presence of CoV2 cross-reactive T cells in unexposed individuals. Lack of effective immunity in most individuals along with high infectiousness of the virus has resulted in massive global public health emergency. Intense efforts are on to study viral pathogenesis and immune response to help guide prophylactic and therapeutic interventions as well as epidemiological assessments like transmission modeling. To develop an effective vaccine or biologic therapeutic, it is critical to understand the immune correlates of COVID-19 control. At the same time, whether immunity in recovered individuals is effective for preventing re-infection will be important for informing interventions like social distancing. Key questions that are being investigated regarding immune response in COVID-19 which will help these efforts include, investigations of immune response that distinguishes patients with severe versus mild infection or those that recover relative to those that succumb, durability of immunity in recovered patients and relevance of developed immunity in a cured patient for protection against re-infection as well as value of convalescent plasma from recovered patients as a potential therapeutic modality. This is a broad and rapidly evolving area and multiple reports on status of innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV2 are emerging on a daily basis. While many questions remain unanswered for now, the purpose of this focused review is to summarize the current understanding regarding immune correlates of COVID-19 severity and resolution in order to assist researchers in the field to pursue new directions in prevention and control.","output":"Immune Correlates of COVID-19 Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the causes of death by diseases of the respiratory system in Spain in 2020, with special interest in COVID-19; also its trends and determinants, and compare them with 2019.

Dozens of airline representatives from around the world spoke about how fundamental changes in passenger demand and booking patterns are reshaping the airline industry and driving innovation and research needs. Customers are booking much closer to departure and are canceling or exchanging their tickets more frequently than before COVID-19. Volatility in demand has increased as travel restrictions change and borders reopen. Consequently, greater uncertainty in demand forecasts used as inputs to optimization algorithms is motivating the need for new approaches. Revenue management and scheduling departments are innovating how they predict market sizes and exploring ways to use new data sources or historic bookings in forecasting models. Scheduling and operations departments are making many more flight-cancellation and equipment-swap decisions one to three days from flight departure, which is changing the role of recovery planning. New urgency exists within crew to design duties and rosters that are robust to ever-evolving schedules. Across functional areas, the increasing emphasis is to develop integrated solutions that jointly optimize schedules, crew pairings, and crew rosters for demand forecasts that are uncertain at the time rosters are published. This paper describes how these changes are reshaping the airline industry during COVID-19, explains why short lead times for bookings and uncertainty in demand volumes are expected to remain after COVID-19, and describes how the airline industry is innovating and developing new operations research approaches for handling uncertain and volatile demand.","output":"Airline OR Innovations Soar During COVID-19 Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic causes a huge burden for affected countries. Several public health interventions were applied to contain the infection. However, the pandemic itself and the lockdown measure negatively influence people's lifestyles and psychological health. Purpose: To explore determinants of healthy dietary intake and depression, and examine the interaction between healthy dietary intake and COVID-19 lockdown on depression. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 18 hospitals and health centers from February 14 to May 31, 2020. Data of 8,291 outpatients were collected including patients' characteristics, clinical parameters, health literacy, healthy dietary intake (using the healthy eating score, HES), other health-related behaviors, and depression (using the patient health questionnaire, PHQ). Depression was defined as PHQ score &#8805; 10. Results: Protective factors of healthy dietary intake and depression were higher education, better medication payment ability, higher social status, more physical activity, and higher health literacy, whereas older age, ever married, own business or other types of occupation, lockdown, suspected COVID-19 symptoms, and comorbidity were associated with lower HES scores and a higher depression likelihood. Besides, overweight/obesity and alcohol drinking were associated with lower HES scores. As compared with patients not under lockdown and with lowest HES score, those who were under lockdown and with lowest HES score had 10.6 times higher depression likelihood (odds ratio, OR, 10.60; 95% CI 6.88, 16.32; p < 0.001), whereas people with higher HES score had 15% lower depression likelihood (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82, 0.89; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Healthy dietary intake and depression were determined by several sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors.

Here we show that while frequent testing can drastically reduce spread if mask wearing and social distancing are not widely adopted, testing has limited impact if they are ubiquitous. Furthermore, even moderate levels of immunity can significantly reduce new infections, especially when combined with other interventions. Our findings suggest that while testing and isolation are powerful tools, they have limited benefit if other interventions are widely adopted.

DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: U.S. ICUs participating in STOP-COVID. PATIENTS: Consecutive adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating ICUs between March 4 and July 1, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. To assess the association between admission to an ICU during a surge period and mortality, we used two different strategies: (1) an inverse probability weighted difference-in-differences model limited to appropriately matched surge and non-surge patients and (2) a meta-regression of 50 multivariable difference-in-differences models (each based on sets of randomly matched surge- and non-surge hospitals). In the first analysis, we considered a single surge period for the cohort (March 23 C May 6). In the second, each surge hospital had its own surge period (which was compared to the same time periods in matched non-surge hospitals). Our cohort consisted of 4342 ICU patients (average age 60.8 [sd 14.8], 63.5% men) in 53 U.S. hospitals. Of these, 13 hospitals encountered surge conditions. In analysis 1, the increase in mortality seen during surge was not statistically significant (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.30 [0.47-3.58], p = .6). In analysis 2, surge was associated with an increased odds of death (odds ratio 1.39 [95% CI, 1.34-1.43], p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission to an ICU with COVID-19 in a hospital that is experiencing surge conditions may be associated with an increased odds of death.

This study aimed to determine if prevalence of informal caring changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine longitudinal trends in quality of life, stress, and depressive symptoms in carers.MethodsWe analysed the COVID-19 self-completion questionnaire (SCQ) sub-study (June-November 2020) of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a nationally representative study of people aged 50 years ongoing since 2009. A total of 3,043 participants aged 60 years were included. Participants were asked if they cared for someone during the COVID-19 pandemic, their relationship to the recipient, and number of hours/week. Outcome measures collected were CES-D8, Perceived stress Scale (PSS) and CASP12. Change in prevalence of caring from previous waves was examined. Multi-level regression analyses examined longitudinal trends in CED-D8, PSS and CASP12 scores by caring status since Wave 3 (2014), adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Analyses were conducted in Stata 14.ResultsPrevalence of informal caring tripled during the COVID-19 pandemic (15% compared to 5% in 2018). While 26% of carers reported they had stopped caring since the pandemic, most of those providing care were new carers (68% of men and 66% of women carers). Becoming a new carer during the pandemic was associated with lower CASP12 scores (=-0.582, 95% CI -1.018,-0.146) and higher PSS (=0.541, 95% CI 0.316,0.765) compared to no caring. Caring for 50 hours in the past week was associated with lower CASP12 (=-0.878, 95%CI -1.345,-0.412), higher PSS scores (=0.383, 95%CI 0.066,0.700) and higher depressive symptoms (=0.371, 95% CI 0.251,0.490). This association was moderated by carer status;new carers with increased hours had higher CES-D8 compared to non-carers, with no difference for those who stopped or continued caring.DiscussionThis study demonstrated that the reduction of availability of both formal and informal care for older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, led to increased caring by older household members and was associated with lower wellbeing and mental health. This study provides further evidence of the detrimental indirect effects of the pandemic for older people and emphasizes for policymakers the importance of prioritising formal and informal care arrangements for the older population.","output":"Caring in the time of COVID-19, longitudinal trends in wellbeing and mental health in carers in Ireland: evidence from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA)*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reduced GHG and air pollutant emissions during the COVID-19 lockdowns resulted in declines in NO(x)emissions of up to 30%, causing short-term cooling, while similar to 20% SO(2)emissions decline countered this for overall minimal temperature effect The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sudden reduction of both GHG emissions and air pollutants Here, using national mobility data, we estimate global emission reductions for ten species during the period February to June 2020 We estimate that global NO(x)emissions declined by as much as 30% in April, contributing a short-term cooling since the start of the year This cooling trend is offset by similar to 20% reduction in global SO(2)emissions that weakens the aerosol cooling effect, causing short-term warming As a result, we estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0 01 +/- 0 005 degrees C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0 3 degrees C by 2050","output":"Current and future global climate impacts resulting from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a class of viruses that cause respiratory tract infections in birds and mammals.

Cytopathicity was attributed to different amino acid substitutions at the same critical env residue involved in receptor interaction: S82F in the Moloney variant Spl574, and S84A in the Friend mouse leukemia virus F-S MLV. Because M. dunni cells carry a variant CAT-1 cell surface virus receptor (dCAT-1), we examined the role of this receptor variant in cytopathicity and host range. RESULTS: We expressed dCAT-1 or mCAT-1 of NIH 3T3 origin in cells that are not normally infectible with ecotropic MLVs and evaluated the transfectants for susceptibility to virus infection and to virus-induced syncytium formation. The dCAT-1 transfectants, but not the mCAT-1 transfectants, were susceptible to virus-induced cytopathicity, and this cytopathic response was accompanied by the accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA. The dCAT-1 transfectants, however, did not also reproduce the relative resistance of M. dunni cells to Moloney MLV, and the mCAT-1 transfectants did not show the relative resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Spl574. Western analysis, use of glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove receptor glycosylation sites identified a possible role for cell-specific glycosylation in the modulation of virus entry.

For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species. We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these viruses, to construct reproducible animal models, and ultimately develop countermeasures to conquer not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also these emerging coronaviral diseases.","output":"From SARS to MERS, Thrusting Coronaviruses into the Spotlight"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Closure of facial lacerations in young children can be difficult under local anaesthetic in an emergency department setting. Sedation or general anaesthetic are often required to close lacerations safely and to a good surgical standard. Our hospital introduced the use of local anaesthetic gel (LAT) following an audit, to reduce the need for paediatric admissions. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, this can be a valuable tool to help avoid admissions. OBJECTIVES To ascertain the usefulness of LAT gel in reducing paediatric admissions. METHODS Data was collected prospectively of all children presenting to the paediatric emergency department for input by the oral and maxillofacial team after the introduction of LAT gel. Data collected included age, aetiology, length and position of laceration, associated injuries and management. Use of LAT gel and other anaesthetics was recorded. FINDINGS Over a 12 month period, 536 children attended the paediatric ED. Paediatric lacerations accounted for 45% of the reasons for attendance. LAT gel was used in management of 33% of patients with facial lacerations. The use of the gel was successful in 76% of occasions. Ninety children (16.8% of all attendances) were admitted to hospital during this time, of which 49 were paediatric lacerations. CONCLUSION LAT gel is an effective adjunct to management of laceration in the paediatric population.","output":"Use of topical local anaesthetics for paediatric facial lacerations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes how longer and shorter period of national lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19 can affect public health and economy of nations.

Herein, we show that a consequence of RNase L-mediated decay of cytoplasmic host RNAs is the widespread re-localization of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, due to the presence of nuclear RNA. Concurrently, we observe global alterations to host RNA processing in the nucleus, including alterations of splicing and 3 end formation, with the latter leading to downstream of gene (DoG) transcripts. While affecting many host mRNAs, these alterations are pronounced in mRNAs encoding type I and type III interferons and coincide with the retention of their mRNAs in the nucleus. Similar RNA processing defects also occur during infection with either dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2 when RNase L is activated. These findings reveal that the distribution of RBPs between the nucleus and cytosol is fundamentally dictated by the availability of RNA in each compartment and thus viral infections that trigger cytoplasmic RNA degradation alter RNA processing due to the nuclear influx of RNA binding proteins.","output":"RNase L-mediated RNA decay alters 3 end formation and splicing of host mRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives.- Nirmatrelvir in association with ritonavir (PAXLOVID?, Pfizer) is an antiviral agent targeting the 3-chymotrypsinClike cysteine protease enzyme (3C-like protease or Mpro) which is a key enzyme of the viral cycle of the SARS-CoV-2. This combination with a well-known pharmacokinetic enhancer leads to a high risk for drug-drug interactions in a polymedicated elected population for treatment. The aim of this work was to provide recommendations on behalf of the national French society of pharmacology (French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics; SFPT), by suggesting optimal and pragmatic therapeutic strategies if nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is to be given together with drugs commonly used, in order to ensure secured physicians prescription. .- Six clinical pharmacologists search the scientific literature to provide a first draft of recommendations. Thereafter, twelve other clinical pharmacologists verified the recommendations and proposed modifications. The final draft was then validated by all 18 participants. Results.- Five distinct recommendations were issued: i) contra-indications, ii) \\" PAXLOVID? not recommended with the comedication\\", iii) \\" PAXLOVID? possible whether the comedication is discontinued\\", iv) PAXLOVID? possible only after an expert advice and v) \\" PAXLOVID? possible without modification of the associated treatment\\". The final document comprises recommendations for 171 drugs/therapeutic classes aiming to secure prescription. In complex situations, clinicians are advised to contact their pharmacology department to obtain specific recommendations on the management of drug-drug interactions with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Conclusion.- These recommendations intend to be a help for clinicians willing to prescribe nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and to prevent drug-drug interactions leading to adverse drug reactions or loss of efficacy.

Most studies suggest an increase in the severity of OCD in people with pre-existing OCD, whereas some do not. AIM: Given the conflicting evidence globally and lack of data from the Arab world, we aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in adults with pre-existing OCD. METHODS: A telephonic questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among adults with pre-existing OCD and specifically with fear of contamination and washing compulsions being major symptom dimensions of OCD. The severity of OCD during the pandemic was compared with their pre-pandemic scores. The severity of OCD was assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). RESULTS: Those with the duration of diagnosis of OCD of<10 years showed a statistically significant increase in the mean YBOCS score of 5.54 from pre-pandemic to during pandemic, which was significant at p = 0.006. This significance was maintained across the Compulsive and Obsessive subsets of the scale. CONCLUSION: Adults with pre-existing OCD with fear of contamination reported a statistically significant increase in severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms only if the duration of their OCD diagnosis was relatively shorter (<10 years). In the context of the conflicting evidence regarding the worsening of OCD symptoms due to the unique infection control measures of this pandemic, this study highlights the importance of the impact of the duration of the disorder and the subtype of the disorder. Such classification might help public health resources to be directed better at those most at risk and also help us understand the very nature of this disorder better.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Individuals With Pre-existing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in the State of Qatar: An Exploratory Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite increasing rates of co-morbid depression and obesity, few interventions target both conditions simultaneously, particularly in men.

The Alternative Pre-Hospital Pathway (APP) Team is one such Community Emergency Medicine (CEM) initiative developed in Cork, Ireland to target low acuity emergency calls. In this paper the inception of the APP Team is described, and an observational descriptive analysis of the APP Teams service data presented for the first 12 months of operation. The aim of this study is to describe and analyse the APP team service. METHODS: The APP Team, consisting of a Specialist Registrar (SpR) in Emergency Medicine (EM) and an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) based in Cork, covers a mixed urban and rural population of approximately 300,000 people located within a 40-min drive time of Cork University Hospital. The team are dispatched to low acuity 112/999 calls, aiming to provide definitive care or referring patients to the appropriate community or specialist service. A retrospective analysis was performed of the teams first 12 months of operation using the prospectively maintained service database. RESULTS: Two thousand and one patients were attended to with a 67.8% non-conveyance rate. The median age was 62 years, with 33.0% of patients aged over 75 years. For patients over 75 years, the non-conveyance rate was 62.0%. The average number of patients treated per shift was 7. Medical complaints (319), falls (194), drug and alcohol related presentations (193), urological (131), and respiratory complaints (119) were the most common presentations. CONCLUSION: Increased demand for emergency care and an aging population is necessitating a re-design of traditional models of emergency care delivery. We describe the Alternative Pre-Hospital Pathway service, delivered by an EMT and an Emergency Medicine SpR responding to low acuity calls. This service achieved a 68% non-conveyance rate; our data demonstrates that a community emergency medicine outreach team in collaboration with the National Ambulance Service offering Alternative Pre-Hospital Pathways is an effective model for reducing conveyances to hospital.

The most commonly reported spirometric measures (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity assess function in the larger airways.

Moreover, there are new inhaled therapies with ultrafine particles that are specifically designed to target the small airways. Potentially, tests of small airways may more accurately diagnose early or mild asthma and assess the response to treatment than spirometry.

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. METHODS: Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. RESULTS: We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%?90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%?69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77C3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.","output":"Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic and researchers have built phylogenetic trees to trace the spread of the virus.

We analyzed clinical data (e.g., seizures frequency, life quality) and neuropsychological assessment through Somatic Symptom ScaleC8 (SSS-8), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The BDI-2 and STAI-Y scores were compared to those acquired in the same patients before the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Comparing our MTLE population before and after COVID-19 outbreak, we found a significant worsening in life quality (p=0.03), SSS-8 (p=0.001), BDI-2 (p=0.032), and STAI-Y scores (p <0.001). After one year of pandemic, 88.2% of patients obtained pathological scores at PSQI, 19.6% at SHAPS, 29.4% at IES-R. Reduction of life quality correlated with anxiety, depression, stress, and somatization. Higher levels of anhedonia correlated with stress, depression, and anxiety. Somatization correlated with depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Distress levels correlated with anxiety, somatization, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a significant worsening of depression, anxiety, life quality, and somatization in MTLE patients after one year of COVID-19 beginning. Concomitantly, results suggest that the pandemic had a negative impact on sleep quality, psychological distress, and anhedonia, but not on epilepsy itself.","output":"The impact of one-year COVID-19 containment measures in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: a longitudinal survey-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan, China.

In China, diagnostic tests and laboratory tests of specimens from persons under investigation are usually performed in a biosafety level 2 environment. Laboratory staff may be at greater risk of exposure due to a higher concentration and invasiveness of emerging pathogens. Current infection prevention strategies are based on lessons learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome, expert judgments, and related regulations.

After activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a series of cellular events occurs, including caspase 1-mediated proteolytic cleavage and maturation of the IL-1 and IL-18, followed by pyroptotic cell death. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome has become a prime target for the resolution of many inflammatory disorders. Since NLRP3 inflammasome activation can be triggered by a wide range of stimuli and the activation process occurs in a complex, it is difficult to target the NLRP3 inflammasome. During the activation process, various post-translational modifications (PTM) of the NLRP3 protein are required to form a complex with other components. The regulation of ubiquitination and deubiquitination of NLRP3 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammatory disorders. In this review, we discuss the ubiquitination and deubiquitination system for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the inhibitors that can be used as potential therapeutic agents to modulate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.","output":"NLRP3 UbiquitinationA New Approach to Target NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDAMENTO: N?o h estudos avaliando o intervalo T(pico)-T(fim) (Tpe), a rela??o Tpe/QT e a rela??o Tpe/QTc para avaliar arritmias cardacas em pacientes com COVID-19.

Public Transport Authorities (PTA), providers of mobility services, and commuters have faced various challenges that require from them a change or adaptation of their practices and behavior. In the framework of the European project PE4Trans, which concerns citizens engagement in the planning of sustainable mobility policies, a multidisciplinary three-session virtual event took place. Its aim was to address all challenges posed by the pandemic related to mobility and transport by involving researchers, executive officers, decision-makers, and policymakers in an organized dialogue. This paper systematizes and synthesizes the findings of this discussion, covering aspects related to the nature of the pandemic, the measures of personal protection along the whole mobility chain, the structural business changes for the case of mobility providers, the exploitation of technology, the people with disability, and the role of the local authorities.

This paper investigates the impact of using historical data of school and high-stakes exams results to train a model to predict high-stakes exams given the available data in the Spring. The most transparent and accurate model turns out to be a linear regression model with high school GPA as the main predictor. Further analysis of the predictions reflect how high-stakes exams relate to GPA in high school for different subgroups in the population. Predicted scores slightly advantage females and low SES individuals, who perform relatively worse in high-stakes exams than in high school. Our preferred model accounts for about 50% of the out-of-sample variation in the high-stakes exam. On average, the student rank using predicted scores differs from the actual rank by almost 17 percentiles. This suggests that either high-stakes exams capture individual skills that are not measured by high school grades or that high-stakes exams are a noisy measure of the same skill.","output":"What is at stake without high-stakes exams?

We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on infections and antibiotic prescribing in Dutch primary care. All patients included in the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners' Network were followed from March through May 2019 (n = 389,708) and March through May 2020 (n = 405,688). We extracted data on consultations for respiratory/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal and skin infections using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. These consultations were combined in disease episodes and linked to antibiotic prescriptions. The numbers of infectious disease episodes (total and those treated with antibiotics), complications, and antibiotic prescription rates (i.e., proportion of episodes treated with antibiotics) were calculated and compared between the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Fewer episodes were observed during the pandemic months than in the same months in 2019 for both the four infectious disease entities and complications such as pneumonia, mastoiditis and pyelonephritis. The largest decline was seen for gastrointestinal infections (relative risk (RR), 0.54; confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 0.58) and skin infections (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.67 to 0.75). The number of episodes treated with antibiotics declined as well, with the largest decrease seen for respiratory/ear infections (RR, 0.54; CI, 0.52 to 0.58). The antibiotic prescription rate for respiratory/ear infections declined from 21% to 13% (difference -8.0% (CI, -8.8 to -7.2)), yet the prescription rates for other infectious disease entities remained similar or increased slightly. The decreases in primary care infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use were most pronounced in weeks 15-19, mid-COVID-19 wave, after an initial peak in respiratory/ear infection presentation in week 11, the first week of lock-down. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the presentation of infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use in primary care in the Netherlands. Consequently, the number of infectious disease episodes treated with antibiotics decreased.

However, the clinical impact after AE in those patients is still unclear. METHODS: A retrospective review of 174 consecutive first-episodes with AE of ILD in our institution from 2002 to 2016 was performed. AE was defined according to the revised definition and diagnostic criteria proposed by an international working group in 2016. Clinical characteristics, 90-day survival, and the requirement of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) after AE were evaluated in each underlying ILD. RESULTS: There were 102 patients with AE of IPF (AE-IPF) and 72 with AE of ILD other than IPF, including non-IPF IIPs (n=29) and secondary ILD (n=43) [CVD-ILD (n=39), CHP (n=4)]. In CVD-ILD, rheumatoid arthritis (n=17) was most common. The 90-day mortality after AE was 57% in IPF, 29% in non-IPF IIPs, and 33% in secondary ILD. After AE, ILD other than IPF had a significantly better survival rate than IPF (P<0.001). Among survivors, the rates of patients requiring LTOT after AE were 63% in IPF, 35% in non-IPF IIPs, and 46% in secondary ILD, respectively.

If different memories are reactivated each night, how much do they interfere with one another? We examined whether reactivating multiple memories incurs a cost to sleep-related benefits by contrasting reactivation of multiple memories versus single memories during sleep. First, participants learned the on-screen location of different objects. Each object was part of a semantically coherent group comprised of either one, two, or six items (e.g., six different cats). During sleep, sounds were unobtrusively presented to reactivate memories for half of the groups (e.g., \\"meow\\"). Memory benefits for cued versus non-cued items were independent of the number of items in the group, suggesting that reactivation occurs in a simultaneous and promiscuous manner. Intriguingly, sleep spindles and delta-theta power modulations were sensitive to group size, reflecting the extent of previous learning. Our results demonstrate that multiple memories may be consolidated in parallel without compromising each memory's sleep-related benefit. These findings highlight alternative models for parallel consolidation that should be considered in future studies.","output":"Multiple memories can be simultaneously reactivated during sleep as effectively as a single memory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the respiratory disease COVID-19.

Unstructured text as PGHD (eg, medical diary notes and transcriptions) may encapsulate rich information through narratives which can be critical to better understand a patients condition. We propose a natural language processing (NLP) supported data synthesis pipeline for unstructured PGHD, focusing on children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN), and demonstrate it with a case study on cystic fibrosis (CF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed unstructured data synthesis and information extraction pipeline extract a broad range of health information by combining rule-based approaches with pretrained deep-learning models. Particularly, we build upon the scispaCy biomedical model suite, leveraging its named entity recognition capabilities to identify and link clinically relevant entities to established ontologies such as Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) and RXNORM. We then use scispaCys syntax (grammar) parsing tools to retrieve phrases associated with the entities in medication, dose, therapies, symptoms, bowel movements, and nutrition ontological categories. The pipeline is illustrated and tested with simulated CF patient notes. RESULTS: The proposed hybrid deep-learning rule-based approach can operate over a variety of natural language note types and allow customization for a given patient or cohort. Viable information was successfully extracted from simulated CF notes. This hybrid pipeline is robust to misspellings and varied word representations and can be tailored to accommodate the needs of a specific patient, cohort, or clinician. DISCUSSION: The NLP pipeline can extract predefined or ontology-based entities from free-text PGHD, aiming to facilitate remote care and improve chronic disease management. Our implementation makes use of open source models, allowing for this solution to be easily replicated and integrated in different health systems. Outside of the clinic, the use of the NLP pipeline may increase the amount of clinical data recorded by families of CSHCN and ease the process to identify health events from the notes. Similarly, care coordinators, nurses and clinicians would be able to track adherence with medications, identify symptoms, and effectively intervene to improve clinical care. Furthermore, visualization tools can be applied to digest the structured data produced by the pipeline in support of the decision-making process for a patient, caregiver, or provider. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that an NLP pipeline can be used to create an automated analysis and reporting mechanism for unstructured PGHD.

METHODS: Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients admitted to Salford Royal NHS Foundation (SRFT) Trust between 27th February and 28th April 2020 (wave 1), and 1st October to 10th November 2020 (wave 2) with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Patient demographics, co-morbidities, admission level disease severity (estimated with CRP) and frailty (using the Clinical Frailty Scale, score 1C3 = not frail, score 4C9 = frail) were collected. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the time to mortality.

A theoretical framework derived from the health belief model (HBM) was used for this research. Data was collected from a sample of 444 adult individuals split across Morocco (n = 215) and India (n = 229). Data analysis was carried out using two-stage multiple-analytic techniques. First, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Second, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to rank the significant independent variables obtained from SEM analysis. The results of SEM showed that perceived benefit is the key predictor of the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by self-efficacy, and then perceived severity. By contrast, ANN analysis showed that perceived severity was the most vital factor for predicting the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by perceived benefits, and then self-efficacy. For the Indian sample, both SEM analysis and the ANN model revealed that the impact of perceived susceptibility on the adoption of the protective measure is stronger than that of cues to action.

For example, there was inconsistent evidence regarding the role of parental characteristics and transition stages and insufficient evidence regarding personal income on smoking. CONCLUSION Despite its importance, studies have disproportionally examined inequalities among young adults using traditional indicators. The mismatch between young adults' life transitions and measurement strategies may attenuate evidence of inequalities. We suggest strategies to improve future measurement.","output":"Methodological systematic review of studies on social inequalities in smoking among young adults: A field coming of age?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plus\\\\stranded RNA viruses replicate in the cytosol of infected cells, in membrane\\\\bound replication complexes containing the replicase proteins, the viral RNA and host proteins.

The multi-agent Observer system proposed in our paper supports students engaged in learning by monitoring their work and making suggestions based on the prediction of their final course success, using indicators of engagement and machine-learning algorithms. A novelty is that Observer collects data independently of the Moodle database, autonomously creates a training set, and learns from gathered data. Since the data are anonymized, researchers and lecturers can freely use them for purposes broader than that specified for Observer.

In addition to acute illness, there is an increasing appreciation of the long-term consequences of enteric infections, including ETEC, on childhood growth and development. Provision of potable water and sanitation and appropriate clinical care for acute illness are critical to reduce the ETEC burden. However, these interventions are not always practical and may not achieve equitable and sustainable coverage. Vaccination may be the most cost-effective and equitable means of primary prevention; however, additional data are needed to accelerate the investment and guide the decision-making process for ETEC vaccines. First, to understand and quantify the ETEC disease burden, additional data are needed on the association between ETEC infection and physical and cognitive stunting as well as delayed educational attainment. Furthermore, the role of inappropriate or inadequate antibiotic treatment of ETEC-attributable diarrhoea may contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and needs further elucidation. An ETEC vaccine that mitigates acute diarrhoeal illness and minimizes the longer-term disease manifestations could have significant public health impact and be a cost-effective countermeasure. Herein we review the ETEC vaccine pipeline, led by candidates compatible with the general parameters of the Preferred Product Characteristics (PPC) recently developed by the World Health Organization. Additionally, we have developed an ETEC Vaccine Development Strategy to provide a framework to underpin priority activities for researchers, funders and vaccine manufacturers, with the goal of addressing globally unmet data needs in the areas of research, product development, and policy, as well as commercialization and delivery.

The aim of this study was to unveil novel biological features to explain COVID-19 severity and prognosis (death and disease progression). METHODS: A predictive model for COVID-19 severity in 121 patients was constructed by ordinal logistic regression calculating odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for a set of clinical, immunological, metabolomic, and other biological traits. The accuracy and calibration of the model was tested with the area under the curve (AUC), Somers D, and calibration plot. Hazard ratios with 95% CI for adverse outcomes were calculated with a Cox proportional-hazards model. RESULTS: The explanatory variables for COVID-19 severity were the body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin, albumin, 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid, CD8+ effector memory T cells, Th1 cells, low-density granulocytes, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasma TRIM63, and circulating neutrophil extracellular traps. The model showed an outstanding performance with an optimism-adjusted AUC of 0.999, and Somers D of 0.999.

Here, we describe a combined simulation and experimental approach to predict the spatial and temporal concentration profile of a drug under continuous dosing in a PDMS Organ Chip containing two parallel channels separated by a porous membrane that is lined with cultured cells, without prior knowledge of its log P value. First, a three-dimensional finite element simulation of drug loss into the chip was developed that incorporates absorption, adsorption, convection, and diffusion, which predicts changes in drug levels over time and space as a function of potential PDMS diffusion coefficients and log P values. By then experimentally measuring the diffusivity of the compound in PDMS and determining its partition coefficient through mass spectrometric analysis of the drug concentration in the channel outflow, it is possible to estimate the effective log P range of the compound. The diffusion and partition coefficients were experimentally derived for the antimalarial drug and potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic, amodiaquine, and incorporated into the model to quantitatively predict the drug-specific concentration profile over time measured in human Lung Airway Chips lined with bronchial epithelium interfaced with pulmonary microvascular endothelium. The same strategy can be applied to any device geometry, surface treatment, or in vitro microfluidic model to predict the spatial and temporal gradient of a drug in 3D without prior knowledge of the partition coefficient or the rate of diffusion in PDMS.

Group-LR patients were treated with single antiviral drug of lopinavir-ritonavir. Group-LR+Ar patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol for antiviral therapy at least 3 days. Patients were assessed for different clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 34 and 39 patients were identified for Group-LR and Group-LR+Ar, respectively. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir alone was not difference from lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol in overall cure rate of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (92.3% and 97.1%, respectively).

A continuous laser with wavelength &#955; = 662 nm in doses of 16 J/cm2 and 40 J/cm2 laser irradiation was used for PDT of a viral suspension and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. The direct cytopathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated via light microscopy to calculate the TCID50 in the samples and perform statistical analysis. RESULTS: Viral suspensions of SARS-CoV-2 that had a TCID50 greater than 103 were inactivated by PDT in the presence of MB and Radahlorin. Vero E6 cells were protected from 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by PDT post infection. The range of protective concentrations was 1.0-10.0 g/ml and 0.5-5.0 g/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively. Additionally, it was found that MB and Radahlorin also possess significant antiviral activity even without PDT.

A key limitation of 3D CNNs on voxelised data is that the memory consumption grows cubically with the training data resolution. Occupancy networks (O-Nets) are an alternative for which the data is represented continuously in a function space and 3D shapes are learned as a continuous decision boundary. While O-Nets are significantly more memory efficient than 3D CNNs, they are limited to simple shapes, are relatively slow at inference, and have not yet been adapted for 3D semantic segmentation of medical data.

We build upon the original O-Net with modifications for increased expressiveness leading to improved segmentation performance comparable to 3D CNNs, as well as modifications for faster inference. We leverage local observations to represent complex shapes and prior encoder predictions to expedite inference. We showcase OSS-Net's performance on 3D brain tumour and liver segmentation against a function space baseline (O-Net), a performance baseline (3D residual U-Net), and an efficiency baseline (2D residual U-Net). OSS-Net yields segmentation results similar to the performance baseline and superior to the function space and efficiency baselines. In terms of memory efficiency, OSS-Net consumes comparable amounts of memory as the function space baseline, somewhat more memory than the efficiency baseline and significantly less than the performance baseline.

The clinical benefits of laparoscopic surgery are well established; however, many patients are still not offered a laparoscopic procedure. Our objective was to compare the modern clinical and financial outcomes of laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery. METHODS The Premier Perspective database identified patients undergoing elective colorectal resections from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Cases were stratified by operative approach into laparoscopic and open cohorts. Groups were controlled on all demographics, diagnosis, procedural, hospital characteristics, surgeon volume, and surgeon specialty and then compared for clinical and financial outcomes. The main outcome measures were length of stay (LOS), complications, readmission rates, and cost by surgical approach. RESULTS A total of 6343 patients were matched and analyzed in each cohort. The most common diagnosis was diverticulitis (p = 0.0835) and the most common procedure a sigmoidectomy (p = 0.0962). The LOS was significantly shorter in laparoscopic compared to open (mean 5.78 vs. 7.80 days, p < 0.0001). The laparoscopic group had significantly lower readmission (5.82 vs. 7.68 %, p < 0.0001), complication (32.60 vs. 42.28 %, p < 0.0001), and mortality rates (0.52 vs. 1.28 %, p < 0.0001). The total cost was significantly lower in laparoscopic than in open (mean $17,269 vs. $20,552, p < 0.0001). By category, laparoscopy was significantly more cost-effective for pharmacy (p < 0.0001), room and board (p < 0.0001), recovery room (p = 0.0058), ICU (p < 0.0001), and laboratory and imaging services (both p < 0.0001).

These include (a) almost constant and low daily case rates over extended periods of time, (b) sudden waves emerging from the above solution despite no or minimal change in the level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and (c) reduction or flattening of case counts following relaxation of NPI. To explain these phenomena, we add contact tracing to our recently developed cluster seeding and transmission (CST) model. We find no fewer than four effects which make prediction of epidemic trajectories uncertain. These are (a) cryptogenic instability, where a small increase in population-averaged contact rate causes a large increase in cases, (b) critical mass effect, where a wave manifests after weeks of quiescence with no change in parameter values, (c) knife-edge effect, where a small change in parameter across a critical value causes a huge change in the response of the system, and (d) hysteresis effect, where the timing and not just the strength of a particular NPI determines the subsequent behaviour. Despite these effects however, some non-obvious conclusions regarding NPI appear to be robust. In particular, (a) narrowing the circle of one's social interactions can be as effective a measure as reducing interactions altogether, and (b) a good contact tracing program can effectively substitute for much more invasive measures. Finally, we propose the contact tracing capacity ratio - a metric of the load to which the tracers are subject - as a reliable early warning indicator of an imminent epidemic wave.","output":"Counter-intuitive COVID-19 Trajectories - Explanations, Early Warning Indicator and Mitigation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had harmful effects on the opioid epidemic.

Pristane is a non-immunogenic synthetic oil that, after a single subcutaneous injection into DA rats, induces arthritis restricted to peripheral joints with a chronic relapsing disease course(6). To identify genes involved in the control of chronic arthritis, we made crosses between susceptible DA rats and resistant E3 rats and analysed the progeny with microsatellite markers covering the entire rat genome. Our results show that different arthritis phenotypes are associated with different chromosomal loci. Loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 ( Pia2 and Pia3 ) influence arthritis onset, whereas a locus on chromosome 12 ( Pia4 ) is associated with severity and joint erosion. We found that chronicity is associated with a different set of loci, one on chromosome 4 and the other on chromosome 14 ( Pia5, Pia6 ).

Identifying patients with a dysregulated inflammatory response and at high risk for severe respiratory failure, organ dysfunction, and death is clinically relevant, as they could benefit from the specific therapies, such as cytokine removal by hemoadsorption. This study aimed to evaluate cytokine hemoadsorption as rescue therapy in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, severe respiratory failure refractory to prone positioning, and hypercytokinemia. Methods: In this single center, observational and retrospective study, critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, severe acute respiratory failure, and hypercytokinemia were analyzed. All the patients underwent cytokine hemoadsorption using CytoSorb(?) (Cytosorbents Europe, Berlin, Germany). The indication for treatment was acute respiratory failure, inadequate clinical response to the prone position, and hypercytokinemia. Results: Among a total of 343 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 3, 2020 and June 22, 2020, six patients received rescue therapy with cytokine hemoadsorption. All the patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation and prone positioning.

This lack of knowledge impedes the ability of the profession to prepare and support physiotherapists in all world regions in their ethical practice. The purpose of the study was to answer the following research questions: What types of ethical issues are experienced by physiotherapists internationally? How frequently are ethical issues experienced by physiotherapists internationally? Can the frequency and type of ethical issue experienced by physiotherapists be predicted by sociodemographic, educational or vocational variables? METHODS: An observational study was conducted in English using an online survey from October 2018 to May 2019. Participants were 1212 physiotherapists and physiotherapy students located internationally which represented less than 1% of estimated number of physiotherapists worldwide at that time. The survey questionnaire contained 13 items requesting demographic detail and knowledge of ethical codes and decision-making, and 46 items asking what frequency participants experienced specific ethical issues in four categories: (A) Physiotherapist and patient interaction (19 items), (B) Physiotherapist and other health professionals including other physiotherapists (10 items), (C) Physiotherapists and the system (5 items) and (D) Professional and economic ethical situations (12 items). RESULTS: The two most frequently experienced ethical issues were Scarce resources and time affecting quality of physiotherapy treatment and Physiotherapy not accessible to all people in society who need it. These items were experienced, on average, more often than monthly. Interprofessional practice also presented frequent ethical issues for participants. Ethical issues related to the context of Physiotherapists and the system were most frequently experienced for all world regions. Working longer years in physiotherapy and learning about ethics in basic physiotherapy education was associated with participants reporting lower frequencies of ethical issues across all contexts. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first global profile of ethical issues experienced by physiotherapists. Societal and cultural systems are key influences on physiotherapists ethical practice. Physiotherapists globally need support from their work organisations, academic institutions and professional associations, and robust ethical training, to assist them to be active moral agents in their practice.

Breaking through these history-making headlines, though, was something incredibly bizarre: QAnon. QAnon is a viral, convoluted, and constantly evolving web of conspiracy theories. Its core claim is that a shadowy cabal of satanic pedophiles is plotting to take down President Donald Trump as it runs a global child sex-trafficking ring.

Since cancer patients as a group have been shown to be at higher risk of severe COVID-19, the development of safe and effective vaccines is crucial. However, cancer patients may be underrepresented in ongoing phase 3 randomized clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines.

That said, data extrapolation from other vaccines trials (e.g. anti-influenza virus), showed a favorable safety and efficacy profile for cancer patients.

The latter is characterized by rapid proliferation and increased activity of T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells releasing various inflammatory cytokines and chemical mediators by protective cells. This pathological condition can be treated by recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against monofunctional cytokine human interleukin-6 receptor. The effect of IL-6 blockers is to selectively bind and inhibit both soluble and membrane IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R). There are studies demonstrating a positive effect and increased survival rate while using drugs that block the production of interleukin-6. The new coronavirus infection causes inflammation of the artery wall with intravascular thrombogenesis, which justifies the high efficiency of anticoagulant and hormone therapy. The standards of drug treatment of the studied infection include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, mucolytic, symptomatic, intravenous infusion and oxygen therapy. Methodological recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection, issued by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, are regularly updated in accordance with the accumulation of positive treatment results by global and local medical communities. In addition to drug therapy, there are other methods of body detoxification. One of the additional methods for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia along with viral vasculitis and correction of the immune response can be provided by ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI). It is well known that ultraviolet radiation has a disinfecting effect. The wavelengths used in UBI affect the efficiency of UV absorption by DNA molecules of the pathogen. Bactericidal UV radiation at certain wavelengths causes thymine dimerization in DNA molecules. The accumulation of such changes in the DNA of microorganisms leads to a slowdown in the rate of their reproduction and extinction. The photohemocorrection method is characterized by immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypoxic, membrane stabilizing, antioxidant and detoxifying effects. In the current study we obtained data on a significant decrease in the systemic inflammatory response, marked and fast decrease of the C-reactive protein in blood tests of patients while receiving ultraviolet blood irradiation. The relief of the systemic inflammatory reaction had a positive effect on the reduction of infiltrative changes in the lung tissue, as well as the timing of discharge from hospital. ? 2021 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a system that combined telehealth applications with local psychosocial support teams. Materials and Methods: A mobile application-based approach supported by the conventional local units was used. A three-step approach including contacting live operators followed by video calls from psychiatrists or child and adolescent psychiatrists and if necessary local unit support was used to provide support. Results: In addition to system records covering sociodemographic variables and initial complaints, a telephone survey, questioning the effectiveness and satisfaction of the system, was used as the main outcome. The number of individuals who asked for a psychiatrist appointment from operators after downloading the application was 1,076 (n = 879 [81.6%] support for self) (n = 197 [18.4%] support for child).

OBJECTIVES: Assessing the effect of early tracheostomy on mortality and decannulation; elucidating changes in ventilation parameters, vasopressors and sedatives dosages immediately following the procedure. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 38 ventilated COVID-19 patients, 19 of them (50%) underwent tracheostomy within 7 days of intubation (early tracheostomy group) and the rest underwent tracheostomy after 8 days or more (late tracheostomy group). RESULTS: Decannulation rates were significantly higher while mortality rates were non-significantly lower in the early tracheostomy group compared with the late tracheostomy group (58% vs 21% p < 0.05; 42% vs 74% p = 0.1, respectively). Tidal volume increased (446 ml vs 483 ml; p = 0.02) while PEEP (13 cmH(2)0 vs 11.6 cmH(2)O, p = 0.04) decreased at the immediate time following the procedure. No staff member participating in the procedures was infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. CONCLUSION: Early tracheostomy might offer improved outcomes with higher decannulation rates and lower mortality rates in ventilated COVID-19 patients, yet larger scale studies are needed.

The use of the V4 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences for taxonomic classification (barcoding) and phylogenetic analyses of human postmortem microbiota has recently emerged as a possible tool in forensic microbiology. The goal of this study was to apply a 16S rRNA barcoding approach to investigate variation among different organs, as well as the extent to which microbial associations among different body organs in human cadavers can be used to predict forensically important determinations, such as cause and time of death. We assessed microbiota of organ tissues including brain, heart, liver, spleen, prostate, and uterus collected at autopsy from criminal casework of 40 Italian cadavers with times of death ranging from 24 to 432 h. Both the uterus and prostate had a significantly higher alpha diversity compared to other anatomical sites, and exhibited a significantly different microbial community composition from non-reproductive organs, which we found to be dominated by the bacterial orders MLE1-12, Saprospirales, and Burkholderiales. In contrast, reproductive organs were dominated by Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, and showed a marked decrease in relative abundance of MLE1-12. These results provide insight into the observation that the uterus and prostate are the last internal organs to decay during human decomposition.

No data is available on HFNC use in the general pediatric ward. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of HFNC oxygen therapy in infants hospitalized in a pediatric ward for moderateCsevere bronchiolitis and to assess the changes in ventilatory parameters before and after starting HFNC support. This prospective observational pilot study was carried out during the bronchiolitis season 2011C2012 in a pediatric tertiary care academic center in Italy. Interruptions of HFNC therapy and possible side effects or escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), and respiratory rate (RR), measured for a baseline period of 1 h before and at specific time intervals in 48 h after the start of HFNC were recorded. Twenty-seven infants were included (median age 1.3 months; absolute range 0.3C8.5). No adverse events, no premature HFNC therapy termination, and no escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Median SpO(2) significantly increased by 1C2 points after changing from standard oxygen to HFNC (p <0.001). Median ETCO(2) and RR rapidly decreased by 6C8 mmHg and 13C20 breaths per minute, respectively, in the first 3 h of HFNC therapy (p <0.001) and remained steady thereafter.

Proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and protein N of SARS-CoV-1 and common cold Coronaviruses (ccCoVs) were recombinantly expressed in E. coli or HEK293 cells. Assay performance was assessed in a COVID-19 case cohort (n = 48 hospitalized patients from Heidelberg) as well as n = 85 age- and sex-matched pre-pandemic controls from the ESTHER study. Assay validation included comparison with home-made immunofluorescence and commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. A sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86C100%) was achieved in COVID-19 patients 14 days post symptom onset with dual sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 N and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The specificity obtained with this algorithm was 100% (95% CI: 96C100%). Antibody responses to ccCoVs N were abundantly high and did not correlate with those to SARS-CoV-2 N.

The aim of this study was to analyze psychological stressors predicting increased drinking during the COVID-19 crisis. Also, individual and socio-demographic differences were analyzed. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before the crisis in SeptemberCOctober 2019 and 82.02% of them responded to a follow-up survey conducted in MarchCApril 2020. Increased drinking was the outcome variable and it was measured with the AUDIT-C before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Predictors measured before the crisis included cyberbullying victimization at work, psychological distress, burnout and work climate. Additional measures included personality factors, socio-demographic factors and occupational information. RESULTS: One-fourth of Finnish workers (25.37%) reported increased drinking during the COVID-19 crisis. Cyberbullying victimization at work and psychological distress before the crisis predicted increased drinking during the crisis. Conscientious workers and those working in educational and health and welfare sectors were less likely to increase drinking, while increased drinking was most common among workers under 30 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological stressors are risk factors for increased drinking in unusual times such as the COVID-19 crisis.

Odds ratio (ORs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were computed by multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex and other confounding factors, including total energy intake.BCAA intake was inversely related to CRC risk (OR for the highest versus the lowest quintile, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97), but the association was attenuated after adjustment for calcium intake (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.65-1.25). A linear inverse association with sigmoid colon cancer risk remained also after adjustment for other dietary factors, including calcium intake (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.87).This study provides supporting evidence that higher levels of dietary BCAA intake are not associated with an increase of CRC risk, but confirms that they may be related to a reduced risk of sigmoid colon cancer.","output":"Dietary intake of branched-chain amino acids and colorectal cancer risk."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous products have emerged with claims to prevent, treat, mitigate, or cure coronavirus. Some claims are often false or misleading. Using the economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes (ECHO) model, this study aimed to review warning letters (WLs) issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manufacturers selling products with fraudulent claims. Methods: A content-analysis approach was used to review WLs obtained from the FDA website. With seven WLs issued in March 2020, a data collection form (DCF) was developed using relevant literature and FDA guidance document on promotional materials from manufacturers. This DCF was then pilot tested on the other six WLs issued in March 2020. Using this DCF, two researchers reviewed WLs issued from April 2020 to December 2020. If there were disagreements between the two researchers, the third and fourth reviewers arbitrated on the disagreements;or the letters were reviewed together to determine a final classification. Results: A total of 141 WLs were analyzed. The products cited in the letters used online media (e.g., company website, Facebook, and Twitter) more commonly as promotional tools than print or broadcast. The products were predominantly drugs (79%), followed by medical device (11%) and food & beverages (6%). The average number of violations reported in each WL was 5.0  3.4. Almost all products (93%) targeted consumers, three products (2%) targeted health providers, and three products (2%) targeted both consumers and health providers. Out of 151 fraudulent claims in 141 letters, 118 claims (78%) were related to clinical outcomes, 22 (15%) were humanistic, and 11 (7%) were related to economic outcomes. Conclusions: This study revealed COVID-19 related fraudulent and unproven claims included in the WLs issued by the FDA. Protecting consumers from products with such claims is crucial to promote consumer safety during COVID-19.","output":"PIN56 Content Analysis of FDA Warning Letters for Fraudulent COVID-19 Claims Using the Economic, Clinical, Humanistic Outcomes (ECHO) MODEL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging COVID-19 pandemic poses many difficulties to medical professionals.

METHOD: An e-questionnaire (Google Forms? ) was administered to identify specific DE activities after social isolation and included the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-Bref questionnaire. The e-questionnaire was sent 14 days after the initiation of social isolation, remaining available for 48 hours. Cronbach's alpha and the means of the quality-of-life domains were calculated and analysed using the Friedman/Dunn and Spearman's correlation tests. After ranking, chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests plus multinomial logistic regression were performed (SPSS, P < .05). RESULT: There was an excellent internal consistency of WHOQOL-Bref (&#945; = 0.916), and the mean quality of life (0-100) was 70.66  12.61. The psychological domain was the most affected (P < .001). The social domain exhibited the weakest correlation with overall quality of life (P < .001, r = 0.688).

However, changes in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and HIV-related behaviors, and their associations with medication adherence among men who have sex with men (MSM) PrEP users remain unclear since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A Retrospective Cohort Study of HIV-negative MSM PrEP users was conducted in four Chinese metropolises from December 2018 to March 2020, assessing the changes in PrEP adherence and HIV-related behaviors before and during the COVID-19. The primary outcome was poor PrEP adherence determined from self-reported missing at least one PrEP dose in the previous month. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine factors correlated with poor adherence during COVID-19. RESULTS: We enrolled 791 eligible participants (418 [52.8%] in daily PrEP and 373 [47.2%] in event-driven PrEP). Compared with the data conducted before the COVID-19, the proportion of PrEP users decreased from 97.9 to 64.3%, and the proportion of poor PrEP adherence increased from 23.6 to 50.1% during the COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR) 3.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62C4.02]. While the percentage of condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with regular partners (11.8 vs. 25.7%) and with casual partners (4.4 vs. 9.0%) both significantly increased. The proportion of those who were tested for HIV decreased from 50.1 to 25.9%. Factors correlated with poor PrEP adherence during the COVID-19 included not being tested for HIV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.38 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.91]), using condoms consistently with regular partners (vs. never, aOR = 2.19 [95% CI: 1.16, 4.13]), and being married or cohabitating with a woman (vs. not married, aOR = 3.08 [95% CI: 1.60, 5.95]).

Accordingly, academics have to engage in both research and teaching activities. The multiple and fragmented identities of academics can sometimes be contested, leading to identity tensions, and impeding their professional development. This raises the issue of how, and whether at all, academics integrate their professional identities in a culture of performativity. Against this backdrop, this qualitative study explored how a specific group of Chinese academics negotiate identity tensions as teachers and researchers through an emotional resilience lens. The narrative frames and interviews with 10 college English teachers yielded four types of identity negotiation in the continuum from identity conflicts to identity integration mediated by emotional resilience, including the disheartened performer, the miserable follower, the strenuous accommodator, and the fulfilled integrator. Emotional resilience as a mediator in professional identity tensions is discussed. Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of the complexity of academics developing an integrated professional identity. Policymakers should recognize the potential of emotional resilience in integrating academic professional identities and jointly support academics to cope with their identity tensions. However, if identity tensions are too complex for academics to solve, the policymakers should consider tensions as signals that the existing institutional policies may be counterproductive and need to be revised, rather than merely calling on academics resilience.","output":"Teaching, my passion; publishing, my pain: unpacking academics professional identity tensions through the lens of emotional resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Brazil is witnessing a massive increase of corona virus disease (COVID-19). Its peculiar primary health care (PHC) system faces a burden due to the contagion occurring in the community environment. Then, the aim is to estimate the effect of the coverage of primary health care and social isolation on the evolution of confirmed cases and deaths by COVID-19, controlling sociodemographic, economic and health system aspects. METHODS: A time series design was designed with data on diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and their deaths as outcomes in the capital cities of the Northeast region of Brazil. Independent variables such as PHC coverage, hospital beds, social isolation, demographic density, Gini index and other indicators were analyzed. A Autoregressive Generalized Linear Model method was applied for model the relationship. RESULTS: We identified an exponential growth of cases (y = 0.00250.71x; p-value<0,001). However, there is a high variability in the occurrence of outcomes. PHC coverage&#8805;75% (&#967;2 = 9.27; p-value = 0.01) and social isolation rate (&#967;2 = 365.99; p-value<0.001) proved to be mitigating factors for the spread of COVID-19 and its deaths.

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged &#8805;30 years were enrolled and medical claims data were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Hospitalization, oxygen treatment, ventilator application, and mortality were assessed as severity outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Of 5,307 COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 56.014.4 years, 2,043 (38.5%) were male, and 770 (14.5%) had diabetes. The number of patients who were hospitalized, who received oxygen, who required ventilator support, and who died was 4,986 (94.0%), 884 (16.7%), 121 (2.3%), and 211 (4.0%), respectively. The proportion of patients with diabetes in the abovementioned outcome groups was 14.7%, 28.1%, 41.3%, 44.6%, showing an increasing trend according to outcome severity.

The clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia, making diagnosis difficult. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities, particularly lymphopenia, are common in patients with SARS. Methods. With the use of 2 databases, we compared the ability of the absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, lactate dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and serum calcium level at hospital admission to discriminate between cases of SARS and cases of community-acquired pneumonia. The SARS database contained data for 144 patients with SARS from the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak. The community-acquired pneumonia database contained data for 8044 patients with community-acquired pneumonia from Edmonton, Canada. Patients from the SARS database were matched to patients from the community-acquired pneumonia database according to age, and receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each laboratory variable. Results. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) demonstrated fair to poor discriminatory ability for all laboratory variables tested except absolute neutrophil count, which had an AUC of 0.80, indicating good discriminatory ability (although there was no cutoff value of the absolute neutrophil count at which reasonable sensitivity or specificity could be obtained). Combinations of any 2 tests did not perform significantly better than did the absolute neutrophil count alone. Conclusions.

This conversion, and ultimately disease development, depends on the molecular switch protein, ZEBRA, a viral bZIP transcription factor that initiates transcription from promoters of viral lytic genes. By binding to the origin of viral replication ZEBRA is also an essential replication protein. Here, we identified a novel DNA-binding motif of ZEBRA, N-terminal to the canonical bZIP domain. This RRTRK motif is important for high-affinity binding to DNA and is essential for recognizing the methylation state of viral promoters. Mutations in this motif lead to deficiencies in DNA-binding, recognition of DNA methylation, lytic cycle DNA replication and viral late gene expression. This work advances our understanding of ZEBRA-dependent activation of viral lytic cascade.IMPORTANCE The binding of ZEBRA to methylated and unmethylated viral DNA triggers activation of the EBV lytic cycle, leading to viral replication and, in some patients, cancer development.

Treatments included 1) a control, 2) PRRS virus infected, 3) PED virus infected, and 4) PRRS+PED coinfection (PRP). Pigs in treatments 2 and 4 were inoculated with a live field strain of PRRS virus via intramuscular and intranasal routes at 0 d after inoculation (dpi). Treatments 3 and 4 were orally inoculated with a cloned PED virus at 15 dpi. Infection with PRRS virus was confirmed by quantitative PCR and seroconversion. Infection with PED virus was confirmed with PCR. Control pigs remained PRRS and PED virus negative throughout the study. All pigs were offered, ad libitum, a standard diet with free access to water. During the test period, PRRS reduced ADG and ADFI by 30 and 26%, respectively (P < 0.05), compared with control pigs, whereas PRP decreased ADG, ADFI, and G:F by 45, 30, and 23%, respectively (P < 0.05).

Among other things, this will entail devoting more attention to the evaluation of upstream intervention strategies. However, merely increasing the supply of such studies is not enough. The pivotal link between research and policy or practice should be the cumulation of insight from multiple studies. If conventional evidence synthesis can be thought of as analogous to building a wall, then we can increase the supply of bricks (the number of studies), their similarity (statistical commensurability) or the strength of the mortar (the statistical methods for holding them together). However, many contemporary public health challenges seem akin to herding sheep in mountainous terrain, where ordinary walls are of limited use and a more flexible way of combining dissimilar stones (pieces of evidence) may be required. This would entail shifting towards generalising the functions of interventions, rather than their effects; towards inference to the best explanation, rather than relying on binary hypothesis-testing; and towards embracing divergent findings, to be resolved by testing theories across a cumulated body of work. In this way we might channel a spirit of pragmatic pluralism into making sense of complex sets of evidence, robust enough to support more plausible causal inference to guide action, while accepting and adapting to the reality of the public health landscape rather than wishing it were otherwise.

Methods: This analysis compared health outcomes (cumulative death rates from COVID-19 and excess death rates) and economic measures (quarterly GDP and unemployment levels) across OECD countries. Results: NZ had the lowest cumulative COVID-19 death rate in the OECD at 242 times lower than the 38-OECD-country average: 5.2 vs 1256 per million population. When considering excess deaths, NZ had the largest negative value in the OECD, equivalent to around 2000 fewer deaths than expected.

The average viral shedding time in severe/critical patients was more than 50 days, and up to 100 days in some patients, after symptom onset. However, chest computed tomography gradually improved and complete absorption occurred when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was still positive, but specific antibodies appeared. Furthermore, the viral shedding time significantly decreased when the A1,430G or C12,473T mutation occurred (P<0.01 and FDR<0.01) and increased when G227A occurred (P<0.05 and FDR<0.05). High IL1R1, IL1R2, and TNFRSF21 expression in the host positively correlated with viral shedding time (P<0.05 and false discovery rate <0.05). Prolonged viral RNA shedding often occurs but may not increase disease damage. Prolonged viral RNA shedding is associated with viral mutations and host factors.","output":"Longitudinal virological changes and underlying pathogenesis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The provision of care to pregnant persons and neonates must continue through pandemics. To maintain quality of care, while minimizing physical contact during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic, hospitals and international organizations issued recommendations on maternity and neonatal care delivery and restructuring of clinical and academic services. Early in the pandemic, recommendations relied on expert opinion, and offered a one-size-fits-all set of guidelines. Our aim was to examine these recommendations and provide the rationale and context to guide clinicians, administrators, educators, and researchers, on how to adapt maternity and neonatal services during the pandemic, regardless of jurisdiction. METHOD: Our initial database search used Medical subject headings and free-text search terms related to coronavirus infections, pregnancy and neonatology, and summarized relevant recommendations from international society guidelines. Subsequent targeted searches to December 30, 2020, included relevant publications in general medical and obstetric journals, and updated society recommendations. RESULTS: We identified 846 titles and abstracts, of which 105 English-language publications fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included in our study. A multidisciplinary team representing clinicians from various disciplines, academics, administrators and training program directors critically appraised the literature to collate recommendations by multiple jurisdictions, including a quaternary care Canadian hospital, to provide context and rationale for viable options. INTERPRETATION: There are different schools of thought regarding effective practices in obstetric and neonatal services. Our critical review presents the rationale to effectively modify services, based on the phase of the pandemic, the prevalence of infection in the population, and resource availability.

Studies show the adaptive response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is ineffective for complete viral elimination. Other studies describe the kinetics of the adaptive response to PRRSV, but have not investigated the early response by DCs. We hypothesize that there is an aberrant activation of DCs early in PRRSV infection; consequently, the adaptive response is triggered inadequately. The current study characterized a subtype of porcine lung DCs (L-DCs) and investigated the ability of PRRSV to infect and replicate in L-DCs and monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). Furthermore, the type I interferon anti-viral response to PRRSV with and without the addition of recombinant porcine IFN- (rpIFN-), an important cytokine that signals for anti-viral mediator activation, was analysed. Results show that PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, providing evidence that these cells have followed distinct differentiation pathways. Although both cell types responded to PRRSV with an induction of IFN- mRNA, the magnitude and duration of the response differed between cell types. The addition of rpIFN- was protective in MDDCs, and mRNA synthesis of Mx (myxovirus resistant) and PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase) was observed in both cell types after rpIFN- addition. Overall, PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, and rpIFN- was required for the transcription of protective anti-viral mediators. DC response to PRRSV was limited to IFN- transcription, which may be inadequate in triggering the adaptive immune response.","output":"Differential type I interferon activation and susceptibility of dendritic cell populations to porcine arterivirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To investigate the mechanism by which apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) enhances the resistance of cervical squamous carcinoma to platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Two cervical squamous carcinoma cell lines (SiHa and Caski) overexpressing APOA1 were constructed, treated with carboplatin, and compared to normal control cells. RESULTS: In both SiHa and Caski cell lines, the clone-forming ability of CBP-treated cells was lower than that of untreated cells, and the change in the number of clones of overexpressing cells was lower than that of normal control cells (p < 0.05), indicating that APOA1 overexpression enhanced chemoresistance. A screen for APOA1 downstream proteins affecting platinum-based chemoresistance using Tandem Mass Tag revealed 64 differentially expressed proteins in SiHa cells, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, subcellular localization, structural domain annotation and enrichment, clustering, and interaction network analyses. Sixty-four differentially expressed proteins matching cancer-relavent association terms were screened and parallel response monitoring identified 29 proteins as possibly involved in the mechanism of platinum-based chemoresistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested that the mechanism may involve numerous regulatory pathways, including promoting tumor growth via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway through STAT1, promoting tumor progression via the PI3K signaling pathway through CD81 and C3, and promoting resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy resistance through TOP2A. The present study aimed to preliminarily explore the function and mechanism of APOA1 in platinum-based chemoresistance in cervical cancer, and the detailed mechanism needs to be further studied.","output":"Role of APOA1 in the resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in squamous cervical cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Health systems function in an ecosystem that is turbulent and competitive because of demographic, economic, political, technological and lifestyle changes and sociopolitical influences, requiring hospitals to adopt comprehensive business strategies. Failure to do so may result in duplication, waste and deficits. This original article uses the prism of agency theory to examine differences in approach at two levels of hospital management and the consequent problems in the incorporation of necessary changes. Agency theory posits an inherent conflict of interest in organizations, including health organizations: the managers (agents) always aim to maximize their profit or personal interest instead of that of the owner or organization (principal), potentially causing difficulty in managing the organization. The aim is to generate recommendations for policymakers. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The study is based on 30 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with key figures in the health system and on two levels of hospital management: senior managers and heads of selected departments. The analysis used a categorical qualitative methodology. FINDINGS The main findings are five key themes: views of business behavior, asymmetry of interests, asymmetry of information, transparency and cooperation between various levels of management and ambivalence toward business in hospitals. The two levels of management are clearly divided in terms of interests, information and activity, leading to difficulty in cooperation, efficiency and achievement of organizational goals. ORIGINALITY/VALUE Using agency theory, this study provides a systemic and organizational view of hospitals' management and environmental adaptation. Understanding the processes and increasing cooperation at various managerial levels can help make the system more efficient and ensure its survival in a dynamic market.","output":"Intraorganization conflicts of interest in hospitals adapting to a changing ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the harm caused by coronaviruses to the world cannot be underestimated.

In this paper, we apply satisfiability solving not only for circuit evaluation but also for its minimisation. We consider and evaluate several approaches to this task, both inspired by existing works as well as novel ones. Our experiments show that a combined strategy, integrating evolutionary search and SMT-based sub-circuit minimisation (using quantified theory of arrays) that we propose, is able to find complex approximate circuits (e.g. 16-bit multipliers) with considerably better trade-offs between the circuit precision and size than existing approaches.","output":"Satisfiability Solving Meets Evolutionary Optimisation in Designing Approximate Circuits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical consequences of co-infection with two or more respiratory viruses are poorly understood. We sought to determine if co-infection with pandemic 2009C2010 influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1) and another respiratory virus was associated with worse clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of all hospitalized patients with a positive respiratory viral panel (RVP) for two or more viruses within 72 hours of admission at our institution from October 2009 to December 2009. We compared patients infected with one respiratory virus to those with respiratory viral co-infection. RESULTS: We identified 617 inpatients with a positive RVP sample with a single virus and 49 inpatients with a positive RVP sample for two viruses (i.e. co-infection). Co-infected patients were significantly younger, more often had fever/chills, tachypnea, and they more often demonstrated interstitial opacities suggestive of viral pneumonia on the presenting chest radiograph (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.4C16.5). The likelihood of death, length of stay, and requirement for intensive care unit level of care were similar in both groups, but patients with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to experience complications, particularly treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 6.8, 95% CI 3.3C14.2). Patients co-infected with pH1N1 and another respiratory virus were more likely to present with chest radiograph changes suggestive of a viral pneumonia, compared to mono-infection with pH1N1 (OR 16.9, 95% CI 4.5C62.7). By logistic regression using mono-infection with non-PH1N1 viruses as the reference group, co-infection with pH1N1 was the strongest independent predictor of treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 17.8, 95% CI 6.7C47.1). CONCLUSION: Patients with viral co-infection, particularly with pH1N1, were more likely to have chest radiograph features compatible with a viral pneumonia and complications during their hospital course, particularly treatment for secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Preventing in-hospital infections is crucial to protect patients and hospital staff. Methods: At the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German Heart Center initiated obligatory wearing of surgical face masks for patients and employees, SARS-CoV-2 screening for all patients, and symptom-based testing for employees. In addition, access restriction, closure of outpatient departments, and postponing non-urgent procedures were implemented with community-initiated regulations. Results: During the observation period (03/16/2020C04/27/2020), 1,128 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed in 983 persons (1.1 tests/person; 589 in patients and 394 in hospital employees). Up to 60% of the clinical workforce was tested based on symptoms and risk (62.5% symptoms, 19.3% direct or indirect contact to known COVID-19, 4.5% returnee from risk area, 13.7% without specific reason). Patient testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obligatory (100% tested). The overall prevalence of positive tests during the observation period was 0.4% (n = 5 out of 1,128 tests performed). The incidence of new infections with SARS-CoV-2 was 0.5% (n = 5 out of 983 individuals; three healthcare workers, two patients). No nosocominal infections occurred, despite a mean number of 14.8 in-hospital contacts.

Clearly, one can see the need to develop new, more effective, antimicrobial agents that go beyond the explored 'chemical space'. In this regard, their unique modes of action (e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, redox activation, ligand exchange, depletion of substrates involved in vital cellular processes) render metal complexes as promising drug candidates. Several Ru (II/III) complexes have been included in, or are currently undergoing, clinical trials as anticancer agents. Based on the in-depth knowledge of their chemical properties and biological behavior, the interest in developing new ruthenium compounds as antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral drugs has risen. This review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Ru (II/III) frameworks as antimicrobial agents. Some aspects regarding the relationship between their chemical structure and mechanism of action, cellular localization, and/or metabolism of the ruthenium complexes in bacterial and eukaryotic cells are discussed as well.

Commonly, consumer wearable devices assessing HR are based on photoplethysmography (PPG), where HR is determined by absorption and reflection of emitted light by the blood. However, methodological differences and shortcomings in the validation process hamper the comparability of the validity of various wearable devices assessing HR. Towards Intelligent Health and Well-Being: Network of Physical Activity Assessment (INTERLIVE) is a joint European initiative of six universities and one industrial partner. The consortium was founded in 2019 and strives towards developing best-practice recommendations for evaluating the validity of consumer wearables and smartphones. This expert statement presents a best-practice validation protocol for consumer wearables assessing HR by PPG. The recommendations were developed through the following multi-stage process: (1) a systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, (2) an unstructured review of the wider literature pertaining to factors that may introduce bias during the validation of these devices and (3) evidence-informed expert opinions of the INTERLIVE Network. A total of 44 articles were deemed eligible and retrieved through our systematic literature review. Based on these studies, a wider literature review and our evidence-informed expert opinions, we propose a validation framework with standardised recommendations using six domains: considerations for the target population, criterion measure, index measure, testing conditions, data processing and the statistical analysis. As such, this paper presents recommendations to standardise the validity testing and reporting of PPG-based HR wearables used by consumers. Moreover, checklists are provided to guide the validation protocol development and reporting. This will ensure that manufacturers, consumers, healthcare providers and researchers use wearables safely and to its full potential.","output":"Recommendations for determining the validity of consumer wearable heart rate devices: expert statement and checklist of the INTERLIVE Network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synopses of a selection of recently published research articles of relevance to palliative care.","output":"Research Roundup"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisations of elderly patients with acute respiratory infection have increased, yet the long-term effects of ICU admission among elderly individuals remain unknown.

METHODS: We used 2009-2017 data from 39 hospital discharge databases. Patients &#8805; 80 years old discharged alive from ICU hospitalisation for acute respiratory infection were propensity score-matched with controls (cataract surgery) discharged from the hospital at the same time and adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities present before hospitalisation. We reported 2-year mortality and compared healthcare utilisation and frailty scores in the 2-year periods before and after ICU hospitalisation. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and twenty elderly survivors of acute respiratory infection in the ICU were discharged, and 988 were successfully matched with controls. After discharge, patients had a 10.1-fold [95% CI, 6.1-17.3] higher risk of death at 6 months and 3.6-fold [95% CI, 2.9-4.6] higher risk of death at 2 years compared with controls. They also had a 2-fold increase in both healthcare utilisation and frailty score in the 2 years after hospital discharge, whereas healthcare utilisation and frailty scores among controls were stable before and after hospitalisation.

The primary outcome was 28-day hospitalization or all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was hospitalization or emergency department visit without hospitalization. The risk-adjusted odds of study outcomes comparing bamlanivimab treated and untreated patients was determined using 1:5 propensity matching and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 232 patients receiving bamlanivimab matched with 1,160 comparator patients, the mean age was 67 years, 56% were female, and 196 (14%) of patients experienced hospitalization or mortality. After adjustment for propensity to receive treatment, bamlanivimab treatment was associated with a significantly reduced risk-adjusted odds of hospitalization or mortality within 28 days (OR 0.40, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.24 to 0.69; p<.001).

The immediate suggested solution to prevent the spread of this virus was to avoid traveling around. Unfortunately, on many occasions, this restriction was not enforced or respected by the citizens. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of traveling on the COVID-19 prevalence by measuring the correlation between traveling data and new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran. The data consists of the daily traffic between Iran's provinces, air traffic, and daily COVID-19 new confirmed cases. In the first step, the importance analysis was used to determine the impact of different kinds of traveling on the COVID-19 spread. In the second step, KNN, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict the effect of traveling on the number of new COVID-19 cases. Although the available data was very coarse and there were no details of inner-cities commute, an R-squared of 0.89 and 0.86 on the train and test datasets was achieved respectively, showing a positive correlation between the number of travels between states and the new confirmed cases of COVID-19. It was also shown that there was an 8-day incubation period. Consequently, by considering this period the voting regressor model reached 0.92 and 0.98 R2 scores for test and train datasets respectively.

When compared to normality ranges, post-COVID patients were significantly more distant from normality in the OE condition compared to the CE condition. These results suggest that independently from the severity of the disease experienced, post-COVID syndrome makes the elastic balance test performances more distant from the normality when the subject integrates vision, somatosensory information, and vestibular information. In the absence of visual feedback, patients seem to implement compensatory strategies, presumably seeking more significant feedback from the lower limbs, which improve their performance.

Although there has so far been no evidence of transmission through transfusion, pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) have been applied to CCP to mitigate risk of infectious disease. This study aims to assess the impact of methylene blue (MB) plus visible light PRT on the virus-neutralising activity of the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to MB plus visible light PRT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD S1 epitope IgGs antibodies were quantified by ELISA. Titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (NtAbs) were measured before and after the PRT process. A Spearman's correlation was run to determine the relationship between antibody neutralisation ability and SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA ratio. Pre- and post-inactivation neutralising antibody titres were evaluated using a Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The plasma pathogen reduction procedure did not diminish NtAbS titres and so did not cause a change in the viral neutralisation capacity of CCP. There was a strong correlation between pre-and post-PRT NtAbs and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs titres. DISCUSSION: Our results showed PRT with MB did not impair the CCP passive immunity preserving its potential therapeutic potency. Therefore, PRT of CCP should be recommended to mitigate the risk for transmission of transfusion-associated infectious disease. There is a good correlation between SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres determined by ELISA and the neutralising capacity.

Many immunomodulatory therapies for COVID-19 are currently being investigated, and preliminary results support the premise of targeting the immune response. However, because suppressing immune mechanisms could also impact the clearance of the virus in the early stages of infection, therapeutic success is likely to depend on timing with respect to the disease course.

RESULTS: Fifteen infants with RB-CDH were identified. Most of the patients were full term (74%). The mean birth weight was 2.90 0.72 kg. The ratio of male to female was 2:1. The mean APGAR score at 1 min was 5.312.34, and 7.301.59 at 5 min. Ten patients (67%) were imaged by antenatal ultrasound. Eleven patients (73.33%) survived to go for surgical repair. The hernia sac was found in 5 patients (45%). Most hernial defects were closed in a primary fashion. The mean age at the operative repair was 8.119.90 days. The average NICU stay for all patients was 40.4750.38 days. The mean follow-up period was 20.459.34 months. Three patients had postoperative complications. The total survival rate in neonates with RB-CDH was 9/15 (60%). Nine out of 11 (82%) neonates survived after surgical repair. Four patients (27%) died before surgical repair.

In this study, an in silico strategy involving ADMET property screening, receptor-ligand docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was employed to screen potential tea bio-active inhibitors against three selected targets (RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 70 tea bioactives screened, theaflavin 3,3'-di-gallate (TF3), Procyanidin B2 and Theaflavin 3-gallate (TF2a) exhibited highest binding affinities towards RdRp, 3CLpro/Mpro and PLpro targets of SARS-CoV-2 with low docking scores of -14.92, -11.68 and -10.90 kcal/mol, respectively. All of them showed a substantial number of hydrogen bonds along with other interactions in and around the active sites. Interestingly, the top bioactives in our study showed higher binding affinities compared with known antiviral drugs.

Typical refrigerated transport containers can provide a temperature-controlled environment down to ?30 C.

One way to provide the required temperature is to pack the vaccine vials into small packages containing dry ice. Dry ice sublimates from a solid to a gas, which limits the allowable transport duration. This can be mitigated by transporting in a ? 30 C refrigerated container. Moreover, because the dry ice will sublimate and thereby release CO2 gas into the transport container, monitoring the CO2 concentration within the refrigerated container is also essential. In the present work, a 3D computational fluid dynamics model was developed based on a commercially available refrigerated container and validated with experimental data.

This study examines outcomes for beneficiaries undergoing hospital outpatient department (HOPD) procedures using liposomal bupivacaine (LB) for control of post-surgical pain. As a non-opioid surgical analgesic, LB may afford beneficial outcomes for reducing subsequent opioid use and improving post-surgical service use outcomes. METHODS This retrospective cohort comparison study analyzed 100% Medicare claims data from 2014-2019. HOPD claims were matched to 102 of the most common surgical procedures where LB was utilized. Within these procedures, a one-to-many, optimal with replacement propensity score matching model was used to control for possible selection bias. By procedure, those claims which were identified as using LB for control of post-surgical pain were matched to those not receiving LB. Outcomes were the probability of a subsequent Part D opioid prescription fill, emergency department (ED) visit, and short- term acute care hospital admission. RESULTS Higher provider use rates of LB are significantly correlated with a decrease in post-HOPD opioid use and a reduction in post-operative ED visits. For each 10% increase in LB use rate by a given provider, Part D opioid events by Day 30 decreased by 2.6 percentage points and by 2.1 percentage points by Day 90 (p < 0.01). Similarly, for each 10% increase in provider LB use rate, there is a 0.4 percentage point reduction in post-operative ED use by Day 30 (p < 0.01) and a 0.3 percentage point reduction by Day 90 (p < 0.05). LIMITATIONS Part D data only indicate that a prescription was filled, not whether the drug was taken. CONCLUSIONS Increased provider use of LB is correlated with improved patient outcomes in real-world provider experience with the Medicare population for many outpatient procedures.

The social distancing conditions imposed by COVID-19 presented an opportunity to assess the value of conducting virtual TBs compared to traditional in-person TBs. Methods: A retrospective analysis of multispecialty attendance data from a NCI designated cancer center's Gastrointestinal TB participants from September 2019 to October 2020 was performed. An online survey, containing 21 questions, assessing the virtual TB experience was sent to participants of all TBs across multiple specialties. Interrupted time series analysis was performed to evaluate the transition from in-person to virtual TBs. Results: The overall mean attendance for Gastrointestinal TB was 30 participants;this value increased from 23 to 34 attendees after instituting virtual TBs (p < 0.001). Increased attendance was observed among all participant categories: Attending physicians (11 to 15 attendees, p < 0.001), fellows and residents (8 to 11, p < 0.001), supporting staff (3 to 6, p < 0.001).

SARS-CoV PLpro dose- and time-dependently up-regulates TGF-1 and vimentin in A549 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assays with TGF-1 promoter plasmids indicated that TGF-1 promoter region between ?175 to ?60, the Egr-1 binding site, was responsible for TGF-1 promoter activation induced by SARS-CoV PLpro. Subcellular localization analysis of transcription factors showed PLpro triggering nuclear translocation of Egr-1, but not NF-B and Sp-1. Meanwhile, Egr-1 silencing by siRNA significantly reduced PLpro-induced up-regulation of TGF-1, TSP-1 and pro-fibrotic genes. Furthermore, the inhibitors for ROS (YCG063), p38 MAPK (SB203580), and STAT3 (Stattic) revealed ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway involving in Egr-1 dependent activation of TGF-1 promoter induced by PLpro. In a mouse model with a direct pulmonary injection, PLpro stimulated macrophage infiltration into lung, up-regulating Egr-1, TSP-1, TGF-1 and vimentin expression in lung tissues.

Men may not realize a change in their thinking and behaviors, which makes it more difficult to seek and get help, thereby interrupting a downward spiral. Stoicism often prevents men from admitting to their personal struggle. The lack of quality connections and non-tailored therapies has led to a high number of men walking out on traditional clinical approaches.

A significant number of elderly and frail people and those with underlying serious illness will continue to develop severe forms of the COVID-19 infection. Most of them are not eligible for intensive care treatment but can still expect palliative care - in many cases provided by a Hospital Palliative Care Team (HPCT). Several teams have already gained experience in caring for these patients and their families, others are preparing for it. METHOD: We report on a COVID-19 patient with pre-existing acute myeloid leukemia who was looked after by a HPCT until death. We discuss the challenges and difficulties while caring for COVID-19-positive palliative patients in a non-ICU setting. RESULTS: Hospitalization of the patient in an isolation ward caused an enormous burden for the dying patient and his family. Symptom control was particularly difficult because of rapid deteriorating dyspnea and the scarce presence of medical staff in the patient's room. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for ICU treatment may have a particularly high need for palliative care. Since beds in specialist palliative care units are limited, the HPCT should be prepared to care for these patients. They may offer support in decision-making, optimize symptom control, and provide psychosocial care for patients and their families.

We compared the clinical data with colorectal cancer during the same 4-month period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer underwent elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was 66% of the number of patients that underwent the procedure during the same period in 2018 and 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of patients without any digestive system symptoms decreased to 3% and severe clinical symptoms decreased by 20.9%. The proportion of right colon cancer decreased by 17.9%, while the proportion of rectal cancer increased by 52.2%, as compared with 2018 and 2019.

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800 mg day on day 1 followed by 600 mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION: Our results were clear, indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19. Dosing optimization for HCQ in COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Efforts in this sense are a prerequisite for best benefit/risk balance.","output":"Model informed dosing of hydroxycholoroquine in COVID-19 patients: Learnings from the recent experience, remaining uncertainties and gaps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Attacks on health care in armed conflict, including those on health workers, facilities, patients and transports, represent serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. Information about these incidents and their characteristics are available in myriad forms: as published research or commentary, investigative reports, and within online data collection initiatives. We review the research on attacks on health to understand what data they rely on, what subjects they cover and what gaps exist in order to develop a research agenda going forward. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study utilizes a systematic review of peer-reviewed to identify and understand relevant data about attacks on health in situations of conflict. We identified 1479 papers published before January 1, 2020 using systematic and hand-searching and chose 45 articles for review that matched our inclusion criteria. We extracted data on geographical and conflict foci, methodology, objectives and major themes. Among the included articles, 26 focused on assessment of evidence of attacks, 15 on analyzing their impacts, three on the legal and human rights principles and one on the methods of documentation. We analyzed article data to answer questions about where and when attacks occur and are investigated, what types of attacks occur, who is perpetrating them, and how and why they are studied. We synthesized cross-cutting themes on the impacts of these attacks, mitigation efforts, and gaps in existing data. CONCLUSION: Recognizing limitations in the review, we find there have been comparatively few studies over the past four decades but the literature is growing. To deepen the discussions of the scope of attacks and to enable cross-context comparisons, documentation of attacks on health must be enhanced to make the data more consistent, more thorough, more accessible, include diverse perspectives, and clarify taxonomy. As the research on attacks on health expands, practical questions on how the data is utilized for advocacy, protection and accountability must be prioritized.

To date, dexamethasone is the first and an important therapeutic to significantly reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Due to powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, dexamethasone could attenuate SARS-CoV-2-induced uncontrolled cytokine storm, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. Nevertheless, dexamethasone treatment is a double-edged sword, as numerous studies have revealed that it has significant adverse impacts later in life. In this article, we reviewed the literature regarding the adverse effects of dexamethasone administration on different organ systems as well as related disease pathogenesis in an attempt to clarify the potential harms that may arise in COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone treatment. Overall, taking the threat of COVID-19 pandemic into account, we think it is necessary to apply dexamethasone as a pharmaceutical therapy in critical patients. However, its adverse side effects cannot be ignored. Our review will help medical professionals in the prognosis and follow-up of patients treated with dexamethasone. In addition, given that a considerable amount of uncertainty, confusion and even controversy still exist, further studies and more clinical trials are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the parameters and the effects of dexamethasone on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Potential Adverse Effects of Dexamethasone Therapy on COVID-19 Patients: Review and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the world topsy turvy since its emergence and has claimed innumerable lives worldwide. Neurological manifestations of the disease have raised several eyebrows around the world among which Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) deserve special mention. Although majority of the cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present with respiratory symptoms, extrapulmonary manifestations are being increasingly reported. We conducted this study to analyze detailed clinical presentations and outcome in a series of eight cases (n = 8) with COVID-19 associated GBS. METHODS: An observational prospective study was conducted among patients with post-infectious/para-infectious GBS. 8 patients were subclassified into acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) as per electrodiagnostic criteria and were followed up from admission to 6 months post discharge, to obtain a comprehensive clinical profile and outcome in these patients. RESULTS: The diagnosis of GBS was confirmed as per Asbury criteria, supported by electrodiagnostic features in nerve conduction velocity test. Among the series of 8 patients, 3 were diagnosed as AIDP, 3 had AMAN and the remaining 2 patients had AMSAN. 3 patients of GBS were afebrile and were diagnosed as COVID-19 after a positive assay on routine screening. Cerebro-spinal fluid analysis for SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR and serum anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative in all the patients. CONCLUSION: GBS in patients with COVID-19 should be differentiated from critical illness neuropathy and myopathy.

In addition to being a two-way barrier to protect against virions droplets both in terms of \\"source control\\" (for the benefits of the community) and \\"physical protection\\" (for wearer), face masks also allow maintaining physiological temperatures and humidity of the nasal cavity and mouth, independently from the external environmental conditions. Beyond compromising the viral transmission speed, exposure to cold environments could have a detrimental effect on the host's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The innate human immune system becomes in fact weaker with cooler nose temperatures and thus more vulnerable to viral replication. Furthermore, there is evidence that warm, humid climates are associated with reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2, while cold dry conditions favor its stability and transmissibility. In the early stage of a viral infection, a physiological body temperature in the upper airways supports the innate immune system, endorsing the muco-ciliary clearance, inhibiting, or deactivating any first settlement of viruses. Face masks are therefore strongly recommended also outdoors, especially under cold weather conditions, not only as a physical barrier against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but also to prevent the rapid cooling of the nasal mucosa and the inhibition of the human innate defense of the upper airways.","output":"Community Use of Face Masks against the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we review the psychometric literature on mating effort and find that extant instruments (1) have not been adequately evaluated in terms of internal structure and measurement invariance, and (2) disproportionately focus on mate retention and intrasexual competition tactics designed to repel competitors, relative to attraction and investment effort. To address these gaps in the literature, we carried out two studies to develop and validate a new Mating Effort Questionnaire (MEQ). In Study 1, we report a pilot study in which participants' responses to an item pool were submitted to exploratory factor analysis. In Study 2, we replicated the structure found in Study 1 using confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample. A three-factor solution yielded the best fit. The three factors reflected respondents' allocation of energy to attracting high mate value partners when already mated, seeking out romantic partners when single, and investing in their current romantic partner and relationships. Strong partial measurement invariance held across the sexes, implying that observed scores may be used to compare them. We also found evidence of concurrent validity via associations between the MEQ and constructs such as sociosexual orientation, K-factor, mate retention behaviors, and respondents' sexual behavior.

As of April 15, 2020 FDA recommendations only allowed for the use of nasopharyngeal, flocked mid turbinate, or foam nasal swabs, all of which are in very low supply. Polyester swabs are more readily available and mass producible. We compare the performance of polyester and foam swabs stored in different transport media. Methods: Both polyester and foam nasal swabs were collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients at a single visit. Using the foam nasal swabs as the comparator, sensitivity of the polyester swabs in each media were calculated, three by three tables were constructed to measure concordance, and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. Findings: 126 visits had polyester and foam swabs stored in viral transport media (VTM), 51 had polyester and foam swabs stored in saline, and 63 had a foam swab in VTM and a polyester swab stored in a dry tube. Using nasal foam swabs as a comparator, polyester nasal swabs had a sensitivity of 86*5% when both samples were stored in VTM, 86*7% when both samples were stored in saline, and 72*4% when the polyester swab was stored dry and the foam swab was stored in VTM. Polyester and foam Ct values from the same visit were correlated, but polyester swabs showed decreased performance for cases with a viral load near the detection threshold and higher Ct values on average.

Materials and Methods: Forty-four validated questions in the Google survey form were distributed among the MBBS students of different medical colleges of West Bengal in this cross-sectional study, and analysed. Results: The responses from 416 participants show that internet-based teaching has been adopted by 96.4% of colleges. Practical class and classes regarding clinical exposure are the two most neglected section of the MBBS curriculum during this pandemic. Total teaching hours per day also drastically reduced from mean of 5.56 h/ day in pre-pandemic time to 1.95 h/ day during this pandemic. Out of 69.7% of the participants who faced difficulty in following online classes, majority (56.25%) was due to technical problems including issues related to internet connectivity and software. Participants were of opinion that current session should be extended on an average of 3 months as the practical and clinical classes are way behind in syllabus completion. According to 72.35% of participants, online classes are less effective than the offline classes. Conclusions: In nutshell, online teaching activities cannot replace the classical classroom teaching, though it is a cost-effective and viable method during this pandemic period.

We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and The Lancet for published articles evaluating the relative reduction in COVID-19 risk after vaccination. Selected literatures were published between December 15, 2019 and May 15, 2021 on the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines. This meta-analysis included studies that confirmed cases of COVID-19 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. This study detected 8,926 eligible research articles published on COVID-19 vaccines. Of these, 25 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among the selected articles, 19 randomized clinical trials, 2 non-randomized clinical trials, and 3 observational studies were analyzed. Seven (28%) studies were included in the meta-analysis. The efficacy of the adenovirus vector vaccine was 73% (95% CI = 69C77) and that of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine was 85% (95% CI = 82C88) in participants aged 18 years. There are no reports of clinical trials in participants aged under 16 years. The production of neutralizing antibodies against receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in >90% of the vaccinated samples was reported within 0C30 days of the first or the second dose of the vaccine.

Moreover, to investigate the association between lifestyle changes during the pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics. DESIGN: epidemiological investigation based on a cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: between April 21st and June 7th 2020, an electronic questionnaire to collect information on physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits during the period of home containment was made available on the web. Respondents were recruited through non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The link to the electronic questionnaire was disseminated through institutional websites, social networks (Facebook, Twitter), and messaging systems such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS. A total of 10,758 interviews were collected, of which 7,847 (73%) were complete for a minimum set of indicators (age, gender, and area of residence). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: reduction of physical activity, increase in alcohol consumption, increase in cigarette smoking, increase in consumption of unhealthy foods (processed meat, red meat or desserts) without increasing healthy foods (vegetables, legumes or whole grains) and, vice versa, increase in consumption of healthy foods without increasing unhealthy foods. RESULTS: the population under study consists of 7,847 people with a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation: 13.9). Most of respondents are women (71.3%), 92.5% have a high school or university degree and 91% live in Northern Italy. During home containment, 56% of interviewees reported they had reduced the time devoted to physical activity. In particular, this happened among older people and those living in large cities. More than 17% of respondents increased their alcohol consumption, especially men, those highly educated and those living in large urban centres. Older age and residence in the Southern Italy represent, instead, protective factors for this outcome. Among smokers, 30% increased cigarette consumption during the period of home containment, on average of 5.6 cigarettes per day. A small proportion of former smokers (0.6%) resumed smoking. With regard to eating habits, 3 out of 10 respondents (29.9%) reported an inappropriate eating behaviour (increasing unhealthy food without increasing healthy ones). This behaviour was less frequent among men (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 0.80, p=0.005). A lower percentage of respondents (24.5%) increased the consumption of healthy foods without increasing the consumption of unhealthy ones. CONCLUSIONS: the results of this survey show that social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an impact on citizens' behaviours. In particular, it was found a noteworthy increase in sedentariness, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A meaningful proportion of respondents reported a worsening of eating habits, especially among women. However, for each of the behavioural risk factors investigated, small proportions of respondents with resilient attitudes were also found, namely, capable of taking advantage of social isolation for improving their daily habits. Studying changes in lifestyles during a pandemic, identifying population groups most at risk of adopting unfavourable behaviours, is a useful tool for policy makers to plan targeted and effective public health interventions.","output":"[Did social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic have an impact on the lifestyles of citizens?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic appendectomy via the three-trocar technique is widely used for appendectomy.

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether a peripherally implanted polymer drug depot can deliver a dose of etanercept sufficient to reduce thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in a rat model of neuropathic pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA TNF-alpha inhibitors reduce pain-associated behavior in experimental models of neuropathic pain. Moreover, systemic injections of TNF-alpha inhibitors have suggested some efficacy in treating sciatic pain in limited, off-label clinical studies. Improvements in these results may be obtained by optimal dosing via targeted, sustained delivery at the site of disc-induced inflammation. METHODS Unilateral chronic constriction injury was applied to the sciatic nerve of 56 male, Wistar rats. Four groups of animals (n = 7) received 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline every 3 days, 0.3 or 3 mg/kg etanercept every 3 days, or gabapentin (60 mg/kg) 1 hour before each behavioral test all via subcutaneous injection. Two groups of animals received 1.5 or 3.0 microg/h etanercept delivered by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) millicylinders (1 mm diameter x 10 mm long) implanted near the injured sciatic nerve. One group received a PLGA millicylinder implanted near the injured sciatic nerve. The final group received 3.0 microg/h etanercept via PLGA millicylinder implanted next to the uninjured, contralateral sciatic nerve. RESULTS A low, local dose of etanercept (approximately 3 microg/h) delivered by a polymer depot significantly reduced (P < 0.05) thermal hyperalgesia for 57 days as compared to polymer depot without drug or an etanercept-loaded depot implanted near the contralateral sciatic nerve, and equivalent to a 10-fold higher dose delivered by repeat subcutaneous injection.

Due to the high infectivity, countries make calls to stay at home or take measures such as lockdowns to ensure that people are least affected by the virus. Meanwhile, infected people are getting treatments: people who are slightly affected are quarantined at home, and those who are heavily affected are treated in hospitals. Hence there is an excessive increase in the hospital workload. This causes physical fatigue in healthcare professionals. Along with the increasing workload, the fear of being infected and infecting the environment causes psychological problems in healthcare professionals. It is important to protect healthcare professionals and provide them with suitable working conditions. For this reason, besides the provision of protective equipment such as gloves, overalls, mask, and glasses that are necessary for the protection of healthcare workers from the virus, healthcare services should also be planned very carefully.

The results suggest that most students still manage to complete assignments on time during the pandemic, while the design of online learning modules might have provided the flexibility and support for them to do so.","output":"Measuring the Impact of COVID-19 Induced Campus Closure on Student Self-Regulated Learning in Physics Online Learning Modules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to investigate the aerosol and spatter mitigation quality of 13 dry-field isolation methods in a simulated setup that replicates real-life work scenarios encountered in dental practices. METHODS: A crown preparation on a manikin was performed on tooth number 30 and repeated five times for each setup to simulate a patient under care. Aerosol, environmental, and operator face shield spatter, and sound intensity was measured. Generalized linear mixed models were used, and posthoc pairwise comparisons were performed to compare least-squares means when appropriate using a Tukey adjustment. RESULTS: All tested setups showed some environmental spatter formation; however, these were able to control most (and in some cases all) spatter on the operator face shield. All methods resulted in excellent aerosol mitigation when a second line of high-volume evacuation (HVE) was added to the device setup. However, in most setups, total sound levels exceeded 85 dB, posing a concern for prolonged noise exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The Prototype device and four other tested setups with secondary HVE addition completely eliminated aerosol creation as tested. Spatter of the Face Shield was best eliminated using the Prototype device. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the dental community has at its disposal equipment that can effectively mitigate aerosol and spatter.","output":"Aerosol and spatter mitigation in dentistry: Analysis of the effectiveness of 13 setups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: To report a case of ribavirin-associated severe hyperuricemia in an immunocompromised patient treated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. SUMMARY: A 21-year-old male with a past medical history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was in full remission after allogenic bone marrow transplantation complicated with chronic graft-versus-host disease. He was hospitalized due to fever, malaise, and respiratory syndromes. A diagnosis of RSV upper respiratory tract infection complicated by secondary pneumonia was made, and oral ribavirin (600 mg in 3 divided doses daily) and intravenous levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) were initiated. On day 2 of the hospital admission, the patients uric acid levels had increased from a baseline of 4 to 6 mg/dL to values of 19.3 and 22.2 mg/dL after the fourth and fifth doses of ribavirin, respectively, and his serum creatinine steadily had increased from a baseline of 0.7 to 0.8 mg/dL to a value of 1.6 mg/dL. Ribavirin was discontinued after the sixth dose, and a single dose of intravenous rasburicase (7.5 mg) was administered. On day 3, the patients serum uric and creatinine concentrations had decreased to 4.7 mg/dL and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. He continued to recover on antibiotics and was discharged with normal uric acid and serum creatinine levels. CONCLUSION: We report a case of severe hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury that developed early after initiation of ribavirin for RSV infection and suspected bacterial pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient without hepatitis C, requiring ribavirin discontinuation and rasburicase administration. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe hyperuricemia in a patient treated with ribavirin for RSV infection rather than chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute and severe hyperuricemia following ribavirin administration.","output":"Acute and severe ribavirin-associated hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury: An underrecognized adverse effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A large problem of histamine receptor research is data heterogeneity. Various experimental approaches, the complex signaling pathways of mammalian cells, and the use of different species orthologues render it difficult to compare and interpret the published results. Thus, the four human histamine receptor subtypes were analyzed side-by-side in the Sf9 insect cell expression system, using radioligand binding assays as well as functional readouts proximal to the receptor activation event (steady-state GTPase assays and [(35)S]GTPS assays). The human H(1)R was co-expressed with the regulators of G protein signaling RGS4 or GAIP, which unmasked a productive interaction between hH(1)R and insect cell G(q). By contrast, functional expression of the hH(2)R required the generation of an hH(2)R-Gs fusion protein to ensure close proximity of G protein and receptor. Fusion of hH(2)R to the long (Gs(L)) or short (Gs(S)) splice variant of G(s) resulted in comparable constitutive hH(2)R activity, although both G protein variants show different GDP affinities. Medicinal chemistry studies revealed profound species differences between hH(1)R/hH(2)R and their guinea pig orthologues gpH(1)R/gpH(2)R. The causes for these differences were analyzed by molecular modeling in combination with mutational studies. Co-expression of the hH(3)R with G(i1), G(i2), G(i3), and G(i/o) in Sf9 cells revealed high constitutive activity and comparable interaction efficiency with all G protein isoforms. A comparison of various cations (Li(+), Na(+), K(+)) and anions (Cl(?), Br(?), I(?)) revealed that anions with large radii most efficiently stabilize the inactive hH(3)R state. Potential sodium binding sites in the hH(3)R protein were analyzed by expressing specific hH(3)R mutants in Sf9 cells. In contrast to the hH(3)R, the hH(4)R preferentially couples to co-expressed G(i2) in Sf9 cells. Its high constitutive activity is resistant to NaCl or GTPS. The hH(4)R shows structural instability and adopts a G protein-independent high-affinity state. A detailed characterization of affinity and activity of a series of hH(4)R antagonists/inverse agonists allowed first conclusions about structure/activity relationships for inverse agonists at hH(4)R. In summary, the Sf9 cell system permitted a successful side-by-side comparison of all four human histamine receptor subtypes. This chapter summarizes the results of pharmacological as well as medicinal chemistry/molecular modeling approaches and demonstrates that these data are not only important for a deeper understanding of H(x)R pharmacology, but also have significant implications for the molecular pharmacology of GPCRs in general.","output":"Pharmacological Characterization of Human Histamine Receptors and Histamine Receptor Mutants in the Sf9 Cell Expression System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic having no therapy and pharmacists being a part of the healthcare system had a vital role in the management of COVID-19.

In part, this is secondary to difficulty in isolating viruses. Although traditional detection methods for respiratory viruses have had little clinical utility, modern viral screening techniques that use molecular sequencing are now both rapid and feasible, which makes analysis of the paranasal sinus microbiome more accessible. OBJECTIVE To detect respiratory viruses in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CRS and of healthy controls as well as to correlate clinical and radiographic measures of CRS with viral presence. METHODS In this prospective study, 13 patients with CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and 8 patients without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) were enrolled and compared with 14 healthy controls. Samples were obtained from the paranasal sinuses and were screened for viral DNA with polymerase chain reaction--based sequencing techniques. Typical symptoms of CRS, the Sinonasal Questionnaire, and objective measures, including the modified Lund-Mackay and modified Lund-Kennedy scores were obtained. RESULTS Eighty percent of the positive screens (4/5) were found in patients with CRSsNP, whereas 20% of the positive tests (1/5) were in the CRSwNP group, and none of the controls tested positive (p = 0.0029). Coronavirus was the most common virus detected. Sinonasal Questionnaire scores of the patients with CRS who tested positive for viruses were higher but not statistically different than those without a positive screen (p = 0.31). Radiographic and endoscopic measures of disease were not significantly different in the setting of a positive viral screen (p = 0.12 and 0.11 respectively). CONCLUSION Although traditionally difficult, advances in molecular sequencing enhance detection of viruses in the sinonasal tract. In this study, respiratory viruses were more commonly isolated from patients with CRS compared with healthy controls. Moreover, viral infection may play a greater role in symptom exacerbation in CRSsNP than in CRSwNP. These findings warrant further investigation into the role of the viral microbiome in CRS.","output":"The role of viruses in the clinical presentation of chronic rhinosinusitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of diagnosis, investigation and management in patients who had undergone laryngectomy secondary to previous squamous cell carcinoma, who were subsequently infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

Radiotherapy (RT) is effective in providing pain relief from MM bone lesions in over 80% of patients. There is no consensus as to the most effective dose or fractionation for palliation. Shorter courses of RT are not only more convenient for patients and their families, but they also have less impact on timing of systemic therapies. There is precedent for using 2 Gy x 2 for palliation of lymphomas, which have similar radiosensitivity to myeloma. The primary objective is to determine whether treatment with 2 Gy x 2 to painful myeloma bone lesions achieves patient-reported pain reduction comparable to historical controls at 4 weeks. Secondary objectives will assess QOL endpoints, use of analgesia and time to pain relief, and duration of pain relief. MATERIALS/METHODS Patients who consent to participation will complete quality of life and pain questionnaires (Brief Pain Index, EORTC QLQ-BM22, and EORTC QLQ-C30) prior to treatment and at 2,4,8 weeks and 6 months following treatment. Pain response, as defined by the international consensus on palliative RT for bone metastases, will be measured based on BPI and daily oral morphine equivalent. Reirradiation at standard dose can be considered at 4 weeks following initial treatment for indeterminate pain response or pain progression. Cytogenetics and International Myeloma Working Group risk stratification and response criteria are recorded, when available, but are not required for patient participation. RESULTS This trial, supported by ILROG, has opened at 7 institutions with one more in process of opening. Prior to COVID, accrual was 1.5 patients per month. Since COVID, enrollment has been at 0.7 patients per month. A total of 18 patients have been accrued. The median age of patients accrued is 65.5 years with 7/18 female patients. Fourteen patients are Caucasian. Twelve patients have an ECOG performance score of 1-2. Thirteen patients had pain response captured at 4 weeks following RT. Of the 5 patients that did not complete questionnaires at 4 weeks post-RT, 2 expired, 1 was lost to follow-up, 1 had a missed evaluation and 1 had pain progression). The most common site of treatment was the shoulder (4/18).

It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as it is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when. METHODS: We inferred transmission onset time from 72 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea, either with known or inferred contact dates, utilizing the incubation period. Combining this data with known information of the infector's symptom onset, we could generate the transmission onset distribution of COVID-19, using Bayesian methods. Serial interval distribution could be automatically estimated from our data. RESULTS: We estimated the median transmission onset to be 1.31 days (standard deviation, 2.64 days) after symptom onset with a peak at 0.72 days before symptom onset. The pre-symptomatic transmission proportion was 37% (95% credible interval [CI], 16-52%).

Type 2 diabetes model was established in mice with high-fat diet feeding combined with streptozocin intraperitoneal administration. The diabetic mice were then treated with AB38b (10, 20, 40 mg kg(?1) d(?1), ig) or a positive control drug resveratrol (40 mg kg(?1) d(?1), ig) for 8 weeks. We showed that administration of AB38b or resveratrol prevented the increases in malondialdehyde level, lactate dehydrogenase release, and laminin and type IV collagen deposition in the diabetic kidney. Simultaneously, AB38b or resveratrol markedly lowered the level of Keap1, accompanied by evident activation of Nrf2 signaling in the diabetic kidney. The underlying mechanisms of antioxidant effect of AB38b were explored in HG-treated mouse GMCs. AB38b (2.5?10 M) or resveratrol (10 M) significantly alleviated OS and ECM accumulation in HG-treated GMCs. Furthermore, AB38b or resveratrol treatment effectively activated Nrf2 signaling by inhibiting Keap1 expression without affecting the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2. Besides, AB38b treatment effectively suppressed the ubiquitination of Nrf2. Taken together, this study demonstrates that AB38b ameliorates experimental DN through antioxidation and modulation of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.","output":"A novel compound AB38b attenuates oxidative stress and ECM protein accumulation in kidneys of diabetic mice through modulation of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges for adolescents because of disruptions in school and social life.

These unpaired -globin chains form unstable -hemichromes that trigger cascades of events to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and haemolysis in patients with -thalassaemia. The clinical genetic data reported over several decades have demonstrated how the coinheritance of -thalassaemia ameliorates the disease phenotype of -thalassaemia. Thus, it is evident that down-regulation of the -globin gene expression in patients with -thalassaemia could ameliorate or even cure -thalassaemia.

In particular, H5 and H7 haemagglutinin subtypes can evolve from low to highly pathogenic strains in gallinaceous poultry. Ducks on the other hand are a natural reservoir for these viruses and are able to withstand most avian influenza strains. RESULTS: Transcriptomic sequencing of lung and ileum tissue samples from birds infected with high (H5N1) and low (H5N2) pathogenic influenza viruses has allowed us to compare the early host response to these infections in both these species. Chickens (but not ducks) lack the intracellular receptor for viral ssRNA, RIG-I and the gene for an important RIG-I binding protein, RNF135. These differences in gene content partly explain the differences in host responses to low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in chicken and ducks. We reveal very different patterns of expression of members of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) gene family in ducks and chickens. In ducks, IFITM1, 2 and 3 are strongly up regulated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza, where little response is seen in chickens. Clustering of gene expression profiles suggests IFITM1 and 2 have an anti-viral response and IFITM3 may restrict avian influenza virus through cell membrane fusion. We also show, through molecular phylogenetic analyses, that avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. In particular, avian IFITM1 showed evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at sites known to restrict influenza virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results support a model where the IFITM123 protein family and RIG-I all play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken.

Data were collected by multiple rounds of city wide PCR test with detailed contact tracing, where each patient was monitored for symptoms through the whole course of infection.

Using an age-stratified compartment model, we show that this age-dependent asymptomatic pattern together with the age distribution of overall cases can explain most of the geographic differences in reported asymptomatic proportions. Combined with demography and contact matrices from other countries worldwide, we estimate that a maximum of 22%~55% of SARS CoV 2 infections would come from asymptomatic cases in an uncontrolled epidemic based on asymptomatic proportions in China.

Seven of these publications focused on midwives views of eHealth, and five on their perspectives of mHealth interventions. The studies included demonstrate that midwives generally hold ambivalent views towards the use of eHealth and mHealth technologies in antenatal care. Often, midwives acknowledged the potential benefits of such technologies, such as their ability to modernise antenatal care and to help women make more informed decisions about their pregnancy. However, midwives were quick to point out the risks and limitations of these, such as the accuracy of conveyed information, and negative impacts on the patient-professional relationship.

Genome completeness was assessed using the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) tool, which identified 96.55% of the 280 Fungi BUSCO genes. Furthermore, differences in functional genes of secondary metabolites (terpenoids) were analyzed between G. leucocontextum and G. lucidum. G. leucocontextum has more genes related to terpenoids synthesis compared to G. lucidum, which may be one of the reasons why they exhibit different biological activities. This is the first genome assembly and annotation for G. leucocontextum, which would enrich the toolbox for biological and genetic studies in G. leucocontextum.","output":"Whole-genome assembly of Ganoderma leucocontextum (Ganodermataceae, Fungi) discovered from the Tibetan Plateau of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of both using curcumin and microencapsulation method on in vitro release behaivour of chia seed oil and its antioxidant potential during simulated gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

In fact, a prompt diagnosis and management of lifestyle behaviors are fundamental steps to reach the fourth 90. To achieve an early diagnosis of these comorbidities, clinicians have at their disposal algorithms such as the Framingham Score to assess cardiovascular risk; transient elastography and liver biopsy to detect NAFLD and NASH; and markers such as the oral glucose tolerance test and GFR to identify glucose impairment and renal failure, respectively. Furthermore, maintenance of ideal body weight is the goal for reducing cardiovascular risk and to improve diabetes, steatosis and fibrosis; while Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets are the dietetic approaches proposed for cardioprotective effects and for glycemic control, respectively.

In the earlier phases of the emergence of COVID-19, China was the first to impose strict restrictions on movement (lockdown) on January 23rd, 2020. A strategy whose effectiveness in curtailing COVID-19 was yet to be determined. We, therefore, sought to study the impact of the lockdown in reducing the incidence of COVID-19. METHODS: Daily cases of COVID-19 that occurred in China which were registered between January 12th and March 30th, 2020, were extracted from the Johns Hopkins CSSE team COVID-19 ArcGIS? dashboards. Daily cases reported were used as data points in the series. Two interrupted series models were run: one with an interruption point of 23 January 2020 (model 1) and the other with a 14-day deferred interruption point of 6th February (model 2). For both models, the magnitude of change (before and after) and linear trend analyses were measured, and -coefficients reported with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the precision. RESULTS: Seventy-eight data points were used in the analysis. There was an 11% versus a 163% increase in daily cases in models 1 and 2, respectively, in the preintervention periods (p  0.001). Comparing the period immediately following the intervention points to the counterfactual, there was a daily increase of 2,746% (p < 0.001) versus a decline of 207% (p = 0.802) in model 2. However, in both scenarios, there was a statistically significant drop in the daily cases predicted for this data and beyond when comparing the preintervention periods and postintervention periods (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a significant decrease the COVID-19 daily cases reported in China following the institution of a lockdown, and therefore, lockdown may be used to curtail the burden of COVID-19.","output":"The Impact of China's Lockdown Policy on the Incidence of COVID-19: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The health impact of COVID-19 may differ in African settings as compared to countries in Europe or China due to demographic, epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic factors. We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. METHODS: We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing and shielding (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. We also present sensitivity analyses for key model parameters subject to uncertainty. RESULTS: We predicted median symptomatic attack rates over the first 12 months of 23% (Niger) to 42% (Mauritius), peaking at 2C4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R(0). The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Mitigation strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand and mortality by around 50%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature, and assumptions on transmissibility, infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and risk of severe disease or death by age. CONCLUSIONS: In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding could achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","output":"Response strategies for COVID-19 epidemics in African settings: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite improvements in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV outcomes, there remain unacceptably high numbers of mother-to-child transmissions (MTCT) of HIV. Programmes and research collect multiple sources of PMTCT data, yet this data is rarely integrated in a systematic way. We conducted a data integration exercise to evaluate the Zimbabwe national PMTCT programme and derive lessons for strengthening implementation and documentation. METHODS: We used data from four sources: research, Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) programme, Implementer - Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development, and modelling. Research data came from serial population representative cross-sectional surveys that evaluated the national PMTCT programme in 2012, 2014 and 2017/2018. MOHCC and Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development collected data with similar indicators for the period 2018 to 2019. Modelling data from 2017/18 UNAIDS Spectrum was used. We systematically integrated data from the different sources to explore PMTCT programme performance at each step of the cascade. We also conducted spatial analysis to identify hotspots of MTCT. RESULTS: We developed cascades for HIV-positive and negative-mothers, and HIV exposed and infected infants to 24 months post-partum. Most data were available on HIV positive mothers. Few data were available 6-8 weeks post-delivery for HIV exposed/infected infants and none were available post-delivery for HIV-negative mothers. The different data sources largely concurred. Antenatal care (ANC) registration was high, although women often presented late. There was variable implementation of PMTCT services, MTCT hotspots were identified. Factors positively associated with MTCT included delayed ANC registration and mobility (use of more than one health facility) during pregnancy/breastfeeding. There was reduced MTCT among women whose partners accompanied them to ANC, and infants receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis. Notably, the largest contribution to MTCT was from postnatal women who had previously tested negative (12/25 in survey data, 17.6% estimated by Spectrum modelling). Data integration enabled formulation of interventions to improve programmes. CONCLUSIONS: Data integration was feasible and identified gaps in programme implementation/documentation leading to corrective interventions. Incident infections among mothers are the largest contributors to MTCT: there is need to strengthen the prevention cascade among HIV-negative women.","output":"Use of data from various sources to evaluate and improve the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programme in Zimbabwe: a data integration exercise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compare the levels of physical activity in university athletes before and during the confinement due to pandemic associated with COVID-19 Method: thirty-two university student athletes enrolled in the Sports Faculty of the Autonomous University of Baja California The average age of the participating subjects was 21 4  3 6 years (17 men and 15 women) To assess the physical activity level, the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) was used;measurements were carried out before and during confinement by COVID-19 Results: To determine equality of variance, the Students t-test for independent samples was applied, with less physical activity (-33 6 ?%), MET-minutes/week during confinement by COVID-19 (p= 005) Conclusions: Despite decreasing physical activity, the university athlete performed physical activity at home during confinement by COVID-19, harmonizing the time in the learning processes in their future profession ?

Although frailty and comorbidity are key determinants of mortality, it is less clear which specific manifestations of frailty and comorbidity are associated with the poorest outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify the key comorbidities and functional manifestations of frailty that were associated with in-hospital mortality in older patients with COVID-19.Methods: This was a retrospective study that used the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset from 1st March 2020 to 28th February 2021 for hospital patients in England aged 65 years and over. Frailty was assessed using the Dr Foster Global Frailty Scale (GFS) and comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Exploratory analysis techniques were used to determine mortality according to the demographic, frailty and comorbidity profile of patients. Features were selected, pre-processed and inputted into a random forest classification algorithm to predict in-hospital mortality.Results: In total 215,831 patients were included. The frailty and comorbidity measures significantly improved the models ability to predict mortality in patients. The most important frailty items in the GFS were dementia/delirium, falls/fractures and pressure ulcers/weight loss. The most-important comorbidity items in the CCI were diabetes (without complications), pulmonary disease, heart failure and renal failure. The best-performing model had a predictive accuracy of 70% as well as an area under the curve of 0.78.Discussion: Frailty and comorbidity are associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes in older adults, even after adjusting for chronological age.

Recent evidence shows that lipid involvement in viral infection goes much further. During replication, many viruses rearrange internal lipid membranes to create niches where they replicate and assemble. Because of the close connection between lipids and inflammation, the derangement of lipid metabolism also results in the production of inflammatory stimuli. Due to its pivotal function in the viral life cycle, lipid metabolism has become an area of intense research to understand how viruses seize lipids and to design antiviral drugs targeting lipid pathways. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a lipid-derived peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR-) agonist that also counteracts SARS-CoV-2 entry and its replication. Our work highlights for the first time the antiviral potency of PEA against SARS-CoV-2, exerting its activity by two different mechanisms. First, its binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein causes a drop in viral infection of ~70%. We show that this activity is specific for SARS-CoV-2, as it does not prevent infection by VSV or HSV-2, other enveloped viruses that use different glycoproteins and entry receptors to mediate their entry. Second, we show that in infected Huh-7 cells, treatment with PEA dismantles lipid droplets, preventing the usage of these vesicular bodies by SARS-CoV-2 as a source of energy and protection against innate cellular defenses. This is not surprising since PEA activates PPAR-, a transcription factor that, once activated, generates a cascade of events that leads to the disruption of fatty acid droplets, thereby bringing about lipid droplet degradation through -oxidation. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates a novel mechanism of action for PEA as a direct and indirect antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. This evidence reinforces the notion that treatment with this compound might significantly impact the course of COVID-19. Indeed, considering that the protective effects of PEA in COVID-19 are the current objectives of two clinical trials (NCT04619706 and NCT04568876) and given the relative lack of toxicity of PEA in humans, further preclinical and clinical tests will be needed to fully consider PEA as a promising adjuvant therapy in the current COVID-19 pandemic or against emerging RNA viruses that share the same route of replication as coronaviruses.","output":"Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Entry by Interacting with S Protein and ACE-2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intensive care unit (ICU) is a critical resource in a hospital, especially in developing countries such as India.

Mean comparison and regression analysis were performed to assess the influence of injection rate on BPE. RESULTS: Groups were homogeneous in terms of age and final BI-RADS score. The mean BPE score was significantly lower among patients in group A (mean of two readers: 1.36 vs. 1.90; P < 0.01) with 70%-72% of patients assigned a BPE score of 1, compared with 36%-38% of patients in group B. Lower BPE scores were noted with the higher flow rate in subgroup analyses of both pre- and postmenopausal women, although the effect was more evident in premenopausal women. Regression analysis confirmed that the likelihood of a BPE 1 score was significantly increased with a higher flow rate (P < 0.01). The inter-reader agreement was excellent (0.83). CONCLUSION: A higher contrast agent injection flow rate (3 mL/s) during breast MRI significantly reduces the degree of BPE, potentially allowing improved diagnostic accuracy by reducing false-positive and false-negative findings.","output":"Gadoteridol-enhanced MRI of the breast: can contrast agent injection rate impact background parenchymal enhancement?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has already been declared as modern history's gravest health emergency by many countries(1-3).

METHODS: All patients admitted in the intensive care unit in a 629-bed tertiary referral hospital in Japan from August 2016 to February 2019 were enrolled. During the study period, PX-UV disinfection was added to manual terminal cleaning after every patient transfer/discharge. For microbiological evaluation, surfaces were selected for sampling by contact plates before/after manual cleaning and after PX-UV. After overnight incubation, colonies on the plates were counted. RESULTS: The incidence of newly acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) declined significantly (13.8 to 9.9 per 10,000 patient days, incidence rate ratio 0.71, p = 0.002), as well as that of newly acquired drug-resistant Acinetobacter (48.5 to 18.1, 0.37, p < 0.001).

The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore the clinical impacts of mobile mood-monitoring in youth with mental health problems, using a publicly accessible app. Methods: Twenty-three patients with mental health problems and 24 young people without mental health problems participated in the quantitative study. Participants monitored their mood using a mood-monitoring app twice a day for 3 weeks, which was preceded by a 3-week baseline period. Outcome measures included momentary and retrospective assessments of affect regulation (all participants) and therapeutic engagement (patients only). Following the quantitative study, patients (n = 7) and their clinicians (n = 6) participated in individual interviews. Interview data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Use of the mood-monitoring app significantly reduced momentary negative mood (p < 0.001) and retrospectively assessed impulsivity across all 47 participants (p = 0.001). All other outcomes showed no significant difference. Qualitative feedback similarly indicated the potential of apps to improve problems with impulsivity in patients. Furthermore, apps may aid communication, promote empowerment, and ameliorate memory difficulties in clinical appointments. Conclusions: This mixed methods study demonstrated the potential utility of apps for clinical practice. Apps may potentially be an interventional tool, or at a minimum, an adjunct to existing treatments.

However, vaccine hesitation is increasing and hindering efforts targeting to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 disease. Hence, determining COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and identifying determinants that would hinder people to vaccinate against COVID-19 is crucial to effectively improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake. In Ethiopia, the pooled proportion of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its determinants is not well known. Thus, the aim of this study is to estimate the pooled proportion of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its determinants in Ethiopia. METHODS: A systematic search of articles was conducted from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Science Direct and Cochrane Library. Data were extracted using a data extraction tool which was adapted from the Joanna Briggs Institute. The quality of each included primary studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale tool. Data analysis was performed using STATA 14. Heterogeneity in studies was assessed using Cochrane Q and I(2) test. Publication bias was assessed using visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger's test. A random effects model was applied to determine the pooled estimates if heterogeneity was exhibited; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies involving 6373 participants were included for the final analysis. The pooled proportion of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia was 56.02% (95% CI: 47.84, 64.20). The likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was higher among participants who had history of chronic disease (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.97), good knowledge (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.59, 4.97), positive attitude (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.21, 4.66), good COVID-19 preventive practice (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.82, 2.12), and high perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI: 2.32, 5.98). CONCLUSION: More than half participants were willing to accept COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, awareness creation battles about the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccine should be provided to the community.

Subsequently, data from various countries have revealed obesity as an independent and significant factor, with people who are overweight/have obesity significantly more likely to be hospitalized, require ICU treatment, and to die. Notably, this additional risk applies to younger people relative to the general COVID-19 risk profile. This paper sets out the evidence of greater risk of poor COVID outcomes for people who are overweight/have obesity, indication of reduced treatment and support for obesity self-management where it existed prior to COVID-19, and highlights the dearth of specific guidance and measures to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 upon people with obesity.

Causal evidence on this issue is limited in the U.S. Given the prominent role of child allowances and other forms of cash assistance in the 2021 American Rescue Plan and proposed Build Back Better legislation, evidence on the extent to which a monthly unconditional cash gift changes substance use patterns among low-income mothers with infants warrants attention, particularly in the context of economic supports that can help improve early environments of children. METHOD: We employ a multi-site, parallel-group, randomized control trial in which 1,000 low-income mothers in the U.S. with newborns were recruited from hospitals shortly after the infants birth and randomly assigned to receive either a substantial ($333) or a nominal ($20) monthly cash gift during the early years of the infants life. We estimate the effect of the unconditional cash transfer on self-report measures of maternal substance use (i.e., alcohol, cigarette, or opioid use) and household expenditures on alcohol and cigarettes after one year of cash gifts. RESULTS: The cash gift difference of $313 per month had small and statistically nonsignificant impacts on group differences in maternal reports of substance use and household expenditures on alcohol or cigarettes. Effect sizes ranged between ? 0.067 standard deviations and + 0.072 standard deviations. The estimated share of the $313 group difference spent on alcohol and tobacco was less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Our randomized control trial of monthly cash gifts to mothers with newborn infants finds that a cash gift difference of $313 per month did not significantly change maternal use of alcohol, cigarettes, or opioids or household expenditures on alcohol or cigarettes. Although the structure of our cash gifts differs somewhat from that of a government-provided child allowance, our null effect findings suggest that unconditional cash transfers aimed at families living in poverty are unlikely to induce large changes in substance use and expenditures by recipients.

We hypothesized that in more severely injured patients (GCS 3C4), there would be a decreased mortality associated with invasive monitoring devices. METHODS: The pediatric Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) was queried for patients aged  16 years meeting criteria for invasive monitors. Our primary outcome was mortality. Patients with ICP monitoring were compared to those without. A logistic regression was used to examine the risk of mortality. RESULTS: Of 3,808 patients, 685 (18.0%) underwent ICP monitoring. ICP monitors were associated with increased risk of mortality (OR 1.82, CI 1.36C2.44, p < 0.001). A secondary analysis including type of invasive ICP monitor and dividing GCS into 3 categories revealed both intraventricular drain (OR 1.89, CI 1.3C2.7, p = 0.001) and intraparenchymal pressure monitor (OR 1.86, CI 1.32C2.6, p < 0.001) to be independently associated with an increased likelihood of mortality regardless of GCS, while intraparenchymal oxygen monitoring was not (OR 0.47, CI 0.11C2.05, p = 0.316).

Various environmental factors, such as toxins, chemical pollutants, detergents, viruses, bacteria, microbial dysbiosis, and allergens, contribute to the development of respiratory disorders. Exposure to these factors activates stress responses in host cells and disrupt lung homeostasis, therefore leading to dysfunctional epithelial barriers. Despite significant advances in therapeutic treatments for lung diseases in the last two decades, novel interventional targets are imperative, considering the side effects and limited efficacy in patients treated with currently available drugs. Nutrients, such as amino acids (e.g., arginine, glutamine, glycine, proline, taurine, and tryptophan), peptides, and bioactive molecules, have attracted more and more attention due to their abilities to reduce oxidative stress, inhibit apoptosis, and regulate immune responses, thereby improving epithelial barriers. In this review, we summarize recent advances in amino acid metabolism in the lungs, as well as multifaceted functions of amino acids in attenuating inflammatory lung diseases based on data from studies with both human patients and animal models. The underlying mechanisms for the effects of physiological amino acids are likely complex and involve cell signaling, gene expression, and anti-oxidative reactions. The beneficial effects of amino acids are expected to improve the respiratory health and well-being of humans and other animals. Because viruses (e.g., coronavirus) and environmental pollutants (e.g., PM2.5 particles) induce severe damage to the lungs, it is important to determine whether dietary supplementation or intravenous administration of individual functional amino acids (e.g., arginine-HCl, citrulline, N-acetylcysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tryptophan) or their combinations to affected subjects may alleviate injury and dysfunction in this vital organ.","output":"Epithelial Dysfunction in Lung Diseases: Effects of Amino Acids and Potential Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of masks as a means of reducing transmission of COVID-19 outside healthcare settings has proved controversial. Masks are thought to have two modes of effect: they prevent infection with COVID-19 in wearers; and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection. We used a simple next-generation matrix approach to estimate the conditions under which masks would reduce the reproduction number of COVID-19 under a threshold of 1. Our model takes into account the possibility of assortative mixing, where mask users interact preferentially with other mask users. We make 3 key observations: 1. Masks, even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection, could substantially decrease the reproduction number for COVID-19 if widely used. 2. Widespread masking may be sufficient to suppress epidemics where R has been brought close to 1 via other measures (e.g., distancing). 3. Assortment within populations (the tendency for interactions between masked individuals to be more likely than interactions between masked and unmasked individuals) would rapidly erode the impact of masks. As such, mask uptake needs to be fairly universal to have an effect. This simple model suggests that widespread uptake of masking could be determinative in suppressing COVID-19 epidemics in regions with R(t) at or near 1.","output":"Bidirectional impact of imperfect mask use on reproduction number of COVID-19: A next generation matrix approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universities are the key players in generating knowledge as well as transmitting knowledge, helping economic and social development through higher education and research excellence. Universities must now equip their students not only with a strong technical and scientific training, but also with tacit knowledge and skills that have the special feature of being transferable to any area of knowledge and whose centrality to the success of graduates in the labour market. Individuals with a high level of tacit knowledge and skills are more likely to bring to a position that makes them more employable. These skills are more intangible, which is why they can be difficult to define. Examples of tacit knowledge and skills are teamwork, critical thinking, creativity, leadership, and problem-solving but these skills are not easy to teach, especially in online distance learning environments. In response to the current novel coronavirus, many universities around the world have moved their teaching online and this makes teaching tacit knowledge and skills more crucial than ever before but, at the same time, even more difficult to teach the skills especially in online distance learning environments. A game-based learning approach often requires students to work in groups, share knowledge and skills and give encouragement. The knowledge and understanding gained in a gamified activity translate into essential intangible skills that are transferrable to real-life situations. This helps to hone tacit knowledge and skills, inspire students to continue learning and ease the transition between education and the world of work. Previous research has argued that game-based learning as a learning approach can have a positive effect on employability. This paper argues that universities are more likely to improve online students' tacit knowledge and skills through a game-based learning approach, particularly when the global shift from traditional face-to-face teaching to online learning due to the recent global pandemic has already changed the way how universities are operating and this shift is likely to stay for a significant period of time. The paper will discuss how a carefully designed game-based learning approach will not only enhance online students' experience by supporting their higher-order thinking, individual and collective learning, and social presence online, but also increase students' tacit knowledge and skills that help to contribute to their future employability.","output":"Developing Tacit Knowledge and Skills Through a Game-Based Learning Approach in Online Distance Learning Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared the risk of severe COVID-19 during two periods 2021 and 2022 when Delta and Omicron, respectively, were the dominating virus variants in Scania county, Sweden.

The question that may arise here is, How can the performance of the construction suppliers be determined under uncertainties considering the post-COVID-19 era? Organizations need eligible suppliers for the rapid recovery of the supply chain and construction sector at this critical stage. Given the importance of the issue, this study aims to propose a novel approach for measuring the performance of construction suppliers using the fuzzy ordinal priority approach (OPA-F).

However, the mechanisms promoting platelet activation by SARS-CoV-2 are not well understood. This may be due to inherent challenges at discriminating the contribution of viral versus host components produced by infected cells. This is particularly true for enveloped viruses and extracellular vesicles, as they are concomitantly released during infection and share biophysical properties. To study this, we evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 itself, or components derived from SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung epithelial cells, could activate isolated platelets from healthy donors. Activation was measured by the surface expression of P-selectin and the activated conformation of integrin IIb3, degranulation, aggregation under flow conditions and the release of extracellular vesicles. We find that neither SARS-CoV-2 nor purified Spike activate platelets. In contrast, TF produced by infected cells was highly potent at activating platelets. This required trace amounts of plasma containing the coagulation factors FX, FII and FVII. Robust platelet activation involved thrombin and the activation of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 and -4 expressed by platelets. Virions and extracellular vesicles were identified by electron microscopy. Through size-exclusion chromatography, TF activity was found to be associated with virus or extracellular vesicles, which were indistinguishable. Increased TF mRNA expression and activity were also found in lungs in a murine model of COVID-19 and in plasma of severe COVID-19 patients, respectively. In summary, TF activity from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells activates thrombin, which signals to PARs on platelets.

We hypothesized that in organs, such as the intestine, which co-express 11betaHSD2, MR and ACE2, the expression of ACE2 would be suppressed. We studied organ tissues from an experiment originally designed to address the effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra extract on the stress response. Male Sprague Dawley rats were left undisturbed or exposed to chronic mild stress for five weeks. For the last two weeks, animals continued with a placebo diet or received a diet containing extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra root at a dose of 150 mg/kg of body weight/day. Quantitative PCR measurements showed a significant decrease in gene expression of ACE2 in the small intestine of rats fed with diet containing Glycyrrhiza glabra extract. This effect was independent of the stress condition and failed to be observed in non-target tissues, namely the heart and the brain cortex. In the small intestine we confirmed the reduction of ACE2 also at the protein level. Present findings provide first evidence to support the hypothesis that Glycyrrhiza glabra extract may reduce an entry point of SARS-CoV-2.

Though a previous study conducted in Nepal identified positive attitudes among medical and nursing students, so far there are no studies assessing the health professional students readiness toward IPE. The aim of the study was to assess the readiness for IPE among medical and dental students. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study explored the readiness of conveniently selected first-year medical and dental students towards IPE and compared readiness among subgroups of respondents. The readiness was assessed through an online survey using the standard Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) during June 2021. The nineteen questions in RIPLS were categorized under four domains: teamwork and collaboration (items 1C9), negative professional identity (items 10C12), positive professional identity (items 13C16), and roles and responsibilities (items 17C19). The individual statements were scored and assessed as per the study objectives. The scores were not normally distributed, so non-parametric tests (MannCWhitney U-test and Kruskal Wallis test) were used. RESULTS: A total of 83 students (69 medical and 14 dental) students responded. The median total score was 75, IQR 6 with the maximum score being 95. The median (IQR) scores for the domains teamwork and collaboration were 38 (IQR 3), negative professional identity 11 (IQR 2), positive professional identity 16 (IQR 3), roles and responsibilities 10 (3). The scores were different between students aged 20 years and below = 37, and above 20 years = 38; (p =< 0.001) in the negative professional identity domain and the total score (p = 0.001). The scores were also different among those with and without previous learning exposure with other discipline students in the same class (p = 0.046). A high median score of 5 was achieved for 8 out of 19 statements in the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The findings showed a high level of readiness for IPE among student respondents.

Infection of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy is associated with complications like preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes;a proportion of neonates born to the infected mothers are also positive for the virus. During pregnancy, the placental barrier protects the fetus from pathogens and ensures healthy development. However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 can infect the placenta is unknown. Herein, utilizing single-cell RNA-seq data, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 are co-expressed by a subset of syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) in the first trimester and extra villous trophoblasts (EVT) in the second trimester human placenta. The ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive (ACE2+TMPRSS2+) placental subsets express mRNA for proteins involved in viral budding and replication. These cells also express mRNA for proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins in the host cells. We also discovered unique signatures of genes in ACE2+TMPRSS2+ STBs and EVTs. The ACE2+TMPRSS2+ STBs are highly differentiated cells and express genes involved mitochondrial metabolism and glucose transport. The second trimester ACE2+TMPRSS2+ EVTs are enriched for markers of endovascular trophoblasts. Further, both these subtypes abundantly expressed genes in Toll like receptor pathway, the second trimester EVTs (but not first trimester STBs) are also enriched for component of the JAK-STAT pathway that drive inflammation. To conclude, herein we uncovered the cellular targets for SARS-CoV-2 entry and show that these cells can potentially drive viremia in the developing human placenta.

Results From the analysis of potential transmission chains, we estimated that, on average, 55.1%, 17.3% and 27.6% infection episodes were linked to household, school, and community contacts, respectively. Clusters originated from students or school personnel showed a larger average cluster size (3.32 vs 1.15), a larger average number of generations in the transmission chain (1.56 vs 1.17) and a larger set of associated close contacts (11.3 vs 3.15, on average). We found substantial transmission heterogeneities, with 20% positive individuals seeding 75-80 of all transmission. A higher proportion of infected individuals causing onward transmission was found among students (48.8% vs 29.9%, on average), who also caused a markedly higher number of secondary cases (mean: 1.3 vs 0.5).

Detection of irreversibly damaged tissue on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) is often necessary to determine eligibility for late-time-window thrombectomy. Therefore, the aim of ISLES-2018 was to segment infarcted tissue on CTP based on diffusion-weighted imaging as a reference standard. METHODS: The data, from 4 centers, consisted of 103 cases of acute anterior circulation large artery occlusion stroke who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging rapidly after CTP. Diffusion-weighted imaging lesion segmentation was performed manually and acted as a reference standard. The data were separated into 63 cases for training and 40 for testing, upon which quality metrics (dice score coefficient, Hausdorff distance, absolute lesion volume difference, etc) were computed to rank methods based on their overall performance. RESULTS: Twenty-four different teams participated in the challenge. Median time to CTP was 185 minutes (interquartile range, 180C238), the time between CTP and magnetic resonance imaging was 36 minutes (interquartile range, 25C79), and the median infarct lesion size was 15.2 mL (interquartile range, 5.7C45). The best performance for Dice score coefficient and absolute volume difference were 0.51 and 10.1 mL, respectively, from different teams. Based on the ranking criteria, the top teams algorithm demonstrated for average Dice score coefficient and average absolute volume difference 0.51 and 10.2 mL, respectively, outperforming the conventional threshold-based method (dice score coefficient, 0.3; volume difference, 15.3). Diverse algorithms were used, almost all based on deep learning, with top-ranked approaches making use of the raw perfusion data as well as methods to synthetically generate complementary information to boost prediction performance. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning methods may predict infarcted tissue from CTP with improved accuracy compared with threshold-based methods used in clinical routine.

We also reviewed the impact of lead on raptors and the likely main source of exposure. We examined 114 studies that were unevenly distributed in terms of time of publication and the countries in which studies were performed. Peer-reviewed articles reported data for 39 raptor species but very few species were widely monitored across Europe. Obligate (vultures) and facultative scavengers (golden eagle, common buzzard and white-tailed sea eagle) accumulated the highest lead concentrations in tissues and generally were the species most at risk of lead poisoning. We found no evidence of a spatial or decadal trend in lead residues, but we demonstrated that high lead blood levels relate to hunting season. Exposure at levels associated with both subclinical and lethal effects is common and lead from rifle bullets and shot is often the likely source of exposure. Overall, our review illustrates the high incidence and ubiquity of lead contamination in raptors in Europe. However, we did not find studies that related exposure to quantitative impacts on European raptor populations nor detailed studies on the impact of mitigation measures.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted from April 21 to May 10, 2020, using an online survey among the Bangladeshi physicians living in the country. Both univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of the willingness of the physicians to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: More than 69% physicians reported that they were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 8.9% reported that they were not willing, while 21.4% of participants were not sure about their willingness. Younger age, having experience of treating patients during previous pandemics, working in the emergency departments and high self-reported compliance to the recommended PPE were important predictors of being willing to work during COVID-19 pandemic. Concern for family and risk of transmitting the infection to family members were most commonly reported as major barriers of working during the pandemic (30%) followed by having comorbidities (25%), lack of adequate safety measures (25%), fear of being infected (12.2%), not involved in clinical practice (12.5%) etc. CONCLUSIONS: Though the majority of the physicians were willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, sufficient supply of PPE, support to maintain recommended quarantine and isolation policy after risky hospital duty along with adequate and effective training can increase their willingness to continue their sacred duty during this crucial pandemic.","output":"Willingness to work during initial lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic: Study based on an online survey among physicians of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growth in poultry sector is being challenged due to increased incidence and re-emergence of diseases caused due to evolution of several viral pathogens and use of live vaccines.

Significant predictors of MCTI use were identified retrospectively to go on to fit a multivariable analysis. Then, patients undergoing additional CT angiography (CTA) or CTA and perfusion CT (CTP) were compared with non-contrast CT only patients with regard to 3-month favourable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 2), 12-month mortality, stroke mechanism, short-term renal failure, use of ancillary diagnostic tests, duration of hospitalization and 12-month stroke recurrence. RESULTS Of the 1994 included patients, 273 had only non-contrast CT, 411 had both non-contrast CT and CTA and 1310 had all three examinations. Factors independently associated with MCTI were younger age, low pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score, low creatinine value, known stroke onset, anterior circulation stroke, anticoagulation or antihypertensive therapy (CTA only) and higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (CTP only). After adjustment, MCTI was associated with a 50% reduction of 12-month mortality and a lower likelihood of unknown stroke mechanism.

Thus, prophylaxis against vaccine-preventable diseases is crucial, yet the responsiveness to several vaccines is unclear under obesity. In order to assess the responsiveness to tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine, we revaccinated 37 obese individuals and 36 normal-weight controls with a licensed TBE vaccine. Metabolic, hormonal, and immunologic profiles along with vaccine-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 months after TBE booster. Obese adults had significantly increased metabolic (triglycerides, cholesterol ratios, leptin, insulin) and proinflammatory (C-reactive protein) parameters. They showed stronger initial increase of TBE-specific Ab titers (d7_d28) followed by a significantly faster decline after 6 months, which correlated with high body mass index and leptin and insulin levels. The fold increase of Ab-titer levels was significantly higher in obese compared to control males and linked to reduced testosterone levels. Obesity also affected cellular responses: PBMCs of the obese vaccinees had elevated interleukin 2 and interferon ?3 levels upon antigen stimulation, indicating a leptin-dependent proinflammatory TH1 polarization. The expansion of total and naive B cells in obese might explain the initial increase of Ab titers, whereas the reduced B-memory cell and plasma blast generation could be related to fast Ab decline with a limited maintenance of titers. Among T follicular helper cell (Tfh) cells, the Tfh17 subset was significantly expanded particularly in obese males, where we observed a strong initial Ab increase. Systemic but not local vaccine side effects were more frequent in obese subjects as a possible consequence of their low-grade proinflammatory state. In summary, TBE booster vaccination was effective in obese individuals, yet the faster Ab decline could result in a reduced long-term protection. The sex-based differences in vaccine responses indicate a complex interplay of the endocrine, metabolic, and immune system during obesity. Further studies on the long-term protection after vaccination are ongoing, and also evaluation of primary vaccination against TBE in obese individuals is planned.

The basic reproduction number (R0 ) of infection is variable in different populations and periods. This study aimed to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in Qom, Iran, and compare it with that in other countries. For estimation of the serial interval, we used data of the 51 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their 318 close contacts in Qom, Iran. The number of confirmed cases daily in the early phase of the outbreak and estimated serial interval were used for R0 estimation. We used the time-varying method as a method with the least bias to estimate R0 in Qom, Iran, and in China, Italy and South Korea. The serial interval was estimated with a gamma distribution, a mean of 4.55 days and a standard deviation of 3.30 days for the COVID-19 epidemic based on Qom data. The R0 in this study was estimated to be between 2 and 3 in Qom. Of the four countries studied, the lowest R0 was estimated in South Korea (1.5-2) and the highest in Iran (4-5). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R0 is sensitive to the applied mean generation time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to estimate R0 in Qom. To control the epidemic, the reproduction number should be reduced by decreasing the contact rate, decreasing the transmission probability and decreasing the duration of the infectious period.","output":"Estimation of the serial interval and basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Qom, Iran, and three other countries: A data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10 1371/journal pone 0248080 ]","output":"Correction: Angiotensin II receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use and COVID-19-related outcomes among US Veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been more and less effective in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished empirical studies, either observational or interventional, analysing the comparative effectiveness of NPIs against the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched Embase/Medline and medRxiv to identify the relevant literature. RESULTS: We identified 34 studies. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, school closing was the most effective NPI, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans. Public information campaigns and mask wearing requirements were also effective in controlling the pandemic while being less disruptive for the population than other NPIs. There was no evidence on the effectiveness of public transport closure, testing and contact tracing strategies and quarantining or isolation of individuals. Early implementation was associated with a higher effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths, while general stringency of the NPIs was not. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we found that school closing, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans were the most effective NPIs in controlling the spread of COVID-19.

SARS CoV-2 caused the third global pandemic and by applying quarantine / isolation / lockdown, the movement was restricted, the physical contact between people was reduced, the physical activity was low, but the activities using electronic devices at home were frequent. The aim of the study was to assess the physical and emotional health in relation to the physical activities done during quarantine/isolation during the pandemic. Material and method. The study was cross-sectional and consisted of completing an online questionnaire. It was conducted in a period of 6 months and it included 334 students. In order to point out the symptoms caused by quarantine / isolation/ lockdown, we considered it useful for students to participate by completing an online questionnaire about physical activities, physical health and emotional state, related to the implications of participating in online courses. Results. The questions in this questionnaire were grouped on the following aspects: physical activity, physical health, emotional state, all in the context of the pandemic period, including the period in which the academic activity was online. Thus, in the first year, there is a positive correlation between physical condition, physical activity, emotional signs and cognitive ones. In the second year, the positive correlation is present between the physical and the affective signs, whereas the negative correlation is between the affective signs, the cognitive ones and the physical activity. In the third year, the positive correlation is obvious between the affective signs, the cognitive ones and the physical activity, whereas the negative one between the physical and cognitive signs, as well as between the physical activity and the cognitive and physical signs. Discussions. There is a link between emotional and cognitive symptoms and physical health. Fear, anxiety, behavioral disorders, and limited physical activity among students during this period can be a public health issue. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the physical and mental state, with a greater resonance for youth, especially pupils and students. Many of them had emotional, behavioral, physical and cognitive symptoms. These symptoms are found to a greater extent in students in the final years, due to the social impact, social and professional integration.","output":"Assessment of the physical and emotional health concerning the students' physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book delivers new conceptual and empirical studies surrounding the design and evaluation of land governance, focusing on land management approaches, land policy issues, advances in pro-poor land tenure and land-based gender concerns.

Following the first outbreak, more than half of the population of the Bergamo province had been infected. We aimed to describe the patients admitted to our unit shortly after the first outbreak. Methods: we retrospectively reviewed the notes of all pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We enrolled patients with positive swabs or serology and classified them based on the pattern and the timing of presentation after the first outbreak. This setting was considered a reliable reflection of the consequences of unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Results: We diagnosed 35 patients over a 3-month period and we identified six patterns presenting in two temporal phases: Early phase, Group 1 (median of 20 days from epidemic start, IQR: 15C27): neonatal sepsis (n.7), pneumonia (n.5), flu-like symptoms (n.2).

HSR has brought impacts which have been widely studied in different countries in relation to the different socioeconomic, territorial and transport characteristics. This paper analyses the economic growth, the transport accessibility and the social impacts observed in Italy after ten years of HSR operation, as well as the estimated impacts of the system completion. The Italian case study is of particular interest since along the 1,467 km of new high speed line (300 km/h), a combination of major cities distances and a unique HSR competitive market, producing prices reductions and more daily trains, brought a 200% increase of HSR demand (from 15 to 45 millions of passengers/year). Estimations results show that, on average, HSR in Italy contributed to a significant increase in transport accessibility (+32%) for the zones along the HSR network, while only marginal for the others (+6%). Impacts on the economic growth show that HSR has contributed to an extra growth of per capita GDP of + 2.6% in 10 years and would have contributed to a further increase of 3.6% if the final project scenario (HSR_N) would had been completed by 2018. Regional (horizontal) equity impacts were evaluated in terms of the Gini indexes variations with respect to the distribution of the transport accessibility. It results that HSR in Italy has decreased equity in terms of users travel time accessibility of 11%, increasing the differences between the zones served by HSR and those not. If the HSR_N scenario would have been completed equity indices would have increased of 29% with respect to the pre-HSR 2008 scenario, thus reducing regional inequalities in the country. Results show that the HSR project was a country-level game changer in Italy, suggesting that the wider economic benefits, the assumptions on market regulation, the effects on regional disparities and the compensatory measures should be included in the ex ante and ex post evaluation of similar projects.","output":"Economic growth, transport accessibility and regional equity impacts of high-speed railways in Italy: ten years ex post evaluation and future perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Less economic integration would make it difficult for the ECB to stabilise the euro area economies.

These symptoms are unrelated to organ damage in most patients after mild acute COVID infection. Hyperventilation has been identified as a cause of exercise-induced dyspnea in PCS. Since there is a broad overlap in symptomatology with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), causes for dyspnea and potential consequences can be deduced by a stringent application of assumptions made for ME/CFS in our recent review papers. One of the first stimuli of respiration in exercise is caused by metabolic feedback via skeletal muscle afferents. Hyperventilation in PCS, which occurs early on during exercise, can arise from a combined disturbance of a poor skeletal muscle energetic situation and autonomic dysfunction (overshooting respiratory response), both found in ME/CFS. The exaggerated respiratory response aggravating dyspnea does not only limit the ability to exercise but further impairs the muscular energetic situation: one of the buffering mechanisms to respiratory alkalosis is a proton shift from intracellular to extracellular space via the sodiumCproton-exchanger subtype 1 (NHE1), thereby loading cells with sodium. This adds to two other sodium loading mechanisms already operative, namely glycolytic metabolism (intracellular acidosis) and impaired Na(+)/K(+)ATPase activity. High intracellular sodium has unfavorable effects on mitochondrial calcium and metabolism via sodiumCcalcium-exchangers (NCX). Mitochondrial calcium overload by high intracellular sodium reversing the transport mode of NCX to import calcium is a key driver for fatigue and chronification. Prevention of hyperventilation has a therapeutic potential by keeping intracellular sodium below the threshold where calcium overload occurs.","output":"Dyspnea in Post-COVID Syndrome following Mild Acute COVID-19 Infections: Potential Causes and Consequences for a Therapeutic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes the Covid-19 pandemic impact of the global process of automation on employment in a developing economy.

However, few studies have examined small geographic units such as census tracts, examined geographic regions with large numbers of Hispanic and Black populations, controlled for testing rates, and incorporated stay-at-home measures into their analyses. Understanding the relationship between social vulnerability and SARS-CoV-2 incidence is critical to understanding the interplay between social determinants and implementing risk mitigation guidelines to curtail the spread of infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and SARS-CoV-2 incidence while controlling for testing rates and the proportion of those who stayed completely at home among 783 Harris County, Texas census tracts. SARS-CoV-2 incidence data were collected between May 15 and October 1, 2020. The SVI and its themes were the primary exposures. Median percent time at home was used as a covariate to measure the effect of staying at home on the association between social vulnerability and SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Data were analyzed using Kruskal Wallis and negative binomial regressions (NBR) controlling for testing rates and staying at home. Results showed that a unit increase in the SVI score and the SVI themes were associated with significant increases in SARS-CoV-2 incidence. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was 1.090 (95% CI, 1.082, 1.098) for the overall SVI; 1.107 (95% CI, 1.098, 1.115) for minority status/language; 1.090 (95% CI, 1.083, 1.098) for socioeconomic; 1.060 (95% CI, 1.050, 1.071) for household composition/disability, and 1.057 (95% CI, 1.047, 1.066) for housing type/transportation. When controlling for stay-at-home, the association between SVI themes and SARS-CoV-2 incidence remained significant. In the NBR model that included all four SVI themes, only the socioeconomic and minority status/language themes remained significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Community-level infections were not explained by a communities' inability to stay at home. These findings suggest that community-level social vulnerability, such as socioeconomic status, language barriers, use of public transportation, and housing density may play a role in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the ability of some communities to stay at home because of the need to work or other reasons.","output":"Examining Social Vulnerability and the Association With COVID-19 Incidence in Harris County, Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding extreme events attracts scientists due to substantial impacts.

With the development of volume-EM techniques such as serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and Focussed Ion Beam-SEM, correlation in three dimensions has become more efficient. Volume electron microscopy allows automated acquisition of serial section imaging data that can be reconstructed in three dimensions (3D) to provide a detailed, geometrically accurate view of cellular ultra-structure.

Using this approach, we were able to make accurate 3D-CLEM overlays of liver tissue and correlate the fluorescent signal to the ultra-structural detail provided by the electron microscope.

We gathered information from a range of governmental documents, published studies, and global databases. For all available national cancer-related plans and immunization plans, we examined the description of HPV vaccination. We found that, as of July 2021, only four countries (24%) had a mature HPV vaccination program with a high first-dose coverage; three (18%) had introduced HPV vaccination, but needed further efforts to scale it up, seven (41%) had not been able to introduce it after conducting demonstration projects, and three (18%) did not have any experience in HPV vaccination. In the national plans, most of the countries recognized the importance of HPV vaccination, but only 10 (59%) provided an implementation strategy on how it would be introduced or scaled up. Countries with a mature program were more likely to have their implementation strategy detailed in their national cancer control plan.

Herein, we applied a bioinformatics approach to identify possible potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. A library of FDA-approved compounds and five natural compounds was screened using Smina docking. Top-docking compounds are then applied in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to assess the stability of ACE2-inhibitor complexes. Results indicate that Luteolin and Chrysin represent high conformation stability with ACE2 during 120 ns of Molecular Dynamics simulation. The binding free energies of Luteolin and Chrysin were calculated by the Molecular Mechanics/PoissonCBoltzmann Surface Area method (MM/PBSA) which confirmed the relative binding free energy of these drugs to ACE2 in favor of the effective binding. So, Luteolin and Chrysin could sufficiently interact with ACE2 and block the Spike binding pocket of ACE2 and can be a potential inhibitor against the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor which is an early stage of infection. Luteolin and Chrysin could be suggestive as beneficial compounds for preventing or reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection which need experimental work to prove.

Design and usability issues may however hinder user acceptance of Web-based interventions. iSupport is an online program developed by World Health Organization (WHO) to support informal dementia carers. PURPOSE: This study gathers user-feedback and evaluates the usability of the European-Portuguese version of iSupport. METHODS: A mixed-methods study was conducted. Two focus groups discussions (n = 15) and 15 usability test sessions were conducted with carers and health/social support professionals to collect data on user satisfaction and requirements on the program's contents and Web interface. The usability testing protocol comprised pre/post-test surveys, a structured interview and observation of task performance in the Web platform. Content analysis of text data was performed by two independent coders. RESULTS: Success rates were superior to 80% for most tasks. An average score of 89.5 on the System Usability Scale demonstrated an excellent perception of the program's usability. The program was perceived as trustworthy, and participants were globally satisfied with its aesthetics and easiness of use. Feedback and personalization were valued functional requirements, while no consensus was found for mood self-assessment or professional/peer interaction features. Lessons were considered culturally fit, thematically pertinent, and comprehensive. Suggestions for improvement were wide-ranging from program's layout to accessibility, usability, functional requirements, content format and lessons' themes. CONCLUSIONS: This study derives user requirements for an evidence-based program for dementia carers.

For older adults receiving formal care in a range of settings, reminiscing with care staff may provide frequent opportunities for recalling autobiographical memories with a supportive conversational partner. Importantly, prior research suggests that some reminiscing conversations are more supportive than others. In the developmental literature, a long tradition of sociocultural memory research has shown how childrens autobiographical memory is scaffolded and supported by parents during reminiscing, when parents use a particular kind of conversational technique, known as elaborative reminiscing. In the current project, we aimed to examine whether we could enhance conversations between staff and older people receiving aged care by teaching care staff about these beneficial conversational techniques and supporting them to reminisce more often with residents/clients. We also aimed to determine whether staff members use of elaborative reminiscing techniques was associated with autobiographical memory details recalled by residents/clients during routine conversations. We conducted a workshop with 16 staff within a residential aged care and community care setting. We followed this with a 4-week training-and-feedback period during which staff recorded their conversations with residents and clients. Staff feedback indicated successful use of the scaffolding techniques overall, and benefits as well as barriers to their use in day-to-day practice. Analysis of the conversations demonstrated that the use of particular elaborative reminiscing techniques by staff was associated with increased recall of episodic and semantic autobiographical memory details by residents/clients. Overall, findings suggest that the principles of elaborative reminiscing may apply across the lifespan, and that the benefits of elaborative reminiscing for autobiographical memory may be particularly important in times of cognitive need. Practically, training aged care staff in specific and practical conversational tools can facilitate reminiscing for people receiving aged care.","output":"Teaching Elaborative Reminiscing to Support Autobiographical Memory and Relationships in Residential and Community Aged Care Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is crucial to evaluate student academic motivation and self-directed learning (SDL) readiness while teaching online or flexibly.

However, limited knowledge is available regarding the isolation room facilities for pediatric intensive care units (PICU) to accommodate more than one pediatric patient. In this aspect, this study investigates a negative-pressurized isolation facility in PICU with minimal design modifications with the possibility that it can accommodate more than one pediatric patient. The field measurement tests were conducted to ensure the design compliance of Taiwan CDC. Then, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was further utilized to numerically evaluate the HVAC system role and the ventilation performance towards infection control. A protected air-jet curtain system with a new ventilation layout was proposed through this study to enhance the protection for both pediatric patients and medical staff. The concentration decay was monitored and recorded within 900 s to evaluate the performance. The concentration can be reduced to 504 ppm for case 1, 620 ppm for case 2, 501 ppm for case 3, and 486 ppm for case 4.

Here we determined the ability of MIC-1 to detect precancerous lesions and CRC in an asymptomatic cohort from CRC Screening Program. METHODS We screened 2759 subjects with risk factors. Endoscopic and histopathological analyses revealed that 19 and 47 subjects had CRC or precancerous lesions. We randomly selected 24 subjects with normal colonoscopies as healthy controls. We used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of MIC-1 for CRC and precancerous lesions. RESULTS The optimal thresholds of MIC-1 levels with precancerous lesions or CRC were 314.12 pg/mL (sensitivity, 91.50%; specificity, 54.20%) and 357.64 pg/mL (sensitivity, 82.40%; specificity, 70.80%). Moreover, MIC-1 levels distinguished precancerous lesions better than CEA, CA19-9, or CA24-2 (AUC: 0.760 vs 0.529, 0.624, and 0.585) or CRC (AUCs: 0.821 vs 0.743, 0.657, and 0.688) from the healthy controls.

This is a single-center observational retrospective study that included 29 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the San Matteo Hospital Foundation between February and May 2020, with a diagnosis of PE, and a control population of 23 non-COVID-19 patients admitted at our hospital during the same time lapse in 2019. We calculated the patient-related delay (i.e., the time between the onset of the symptoms and the first medical examination), and the physician-related delay (i.e., the time between the first medical examination and the diagnosis of PE). The overall diagnostic delay significantly correlated with the physician-related delay (p < 0.0001), with the tendency to a worse outcome in long physician-related diagnostic delay (p = 0.04). The delay was related to the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase.

A selection-based screen, named two-dimensional combinatorial screening, revealed preferences in small-molecule chemotypes that bind RNA and preferences in the RNA motifs that bind small molecules. The screening program increased the dataset of known RNA motif-small molecule binding partners by 20-fold. Analysis of this dataset against the RNA-mediated pathways that regulate VEGFA defined that the microRNA-377 precursor, which represses Vegfa messenger RNA translation, is druggable in a selective manner. We designed TGP-377 to potently and specifically upregulate VEGFA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Characterization of the catalytic dyad cysteine residue enabled us to identify a nearby serine that is catalytically interchangeable with the dyad cysteine residue. The enzyme retains activity upon alanine replacement of either residue but a replacement of both cysteine and serine residues results in no detectable activity. Protein dynamics appears to allow the use of either the cysteine or the serine residue in catalysis.

Currently, hospital admissions are reserved for higher acuity patients. We describe a patient with delayed diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia with COVID-19 co-infection. Case Description A 55-year-old Peruvian male with a history of latent tuberculosis presented with worsening cough and dyspnea. Two months prior to this admission, the patient's primary care physician treated the patient for community-acquired pneumonia with doxycycline and azithromycin. CT chest showed a lingular consolidation, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pulmonary nodules. His COVID-19 PCR was positive. Due to the absence of hypoxia, dexamethasone and remdesivir were not prescribed. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. An outpatient bronchoscopy was planned to be scheduled once his COVID-19 PCR was negative. Three weeks after initial presentation and prior to the bronchoscopy, the patient returned with worsening dyspnea, nausea and vomiting. His COVID-19 PCR was negative. He underwent both bronchoscopy with lavage and CT guided lung biopsy. Cultures from the BAL and biopsy found fungal elements resembling cryptococcal forms. Lumbar puncture noted elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and the CSF identified cryptococcal species. The serum cryptococcal antigen was elevated. His HIV test was negative, absolute CD4 count was 339 cells/mcL. His cryptococcal meningitis and elevated ICP's resulted in generalized tonic-clonic seizures. His altered mental status worsened and he was intubated. Liposomal amphotericin and flucytosine were prescribed. Serial lumbar punctures and CSF drainage controlled his increased intracranial pressures. Cultures from multiple sites grew Cryptococcus gatti. His condition slowly improved and he was subsequently extubated. Discussion Central nervous system cryptococcosis in non-HIV infected patients generally occurs in patients with solid organ transplant, rheumatic disorders or CD4 lymphopenia. It is rarely seen in immunocompetent hosts, however is known to be a harbinger of subclinical immunodeficiency. The outcomes are dependent on high index of suspicion, early diagnosis and aggressive treatment. C. gatti is inhaled as aerosolized particles, causing a distinct and larger inflammatory response than C. neoformans Depending upon the host's immune status, C. gatti may cause asymptomatic pulmonary infections up to potentially life-threatening CNS infections. This pandemic has interrupted normal patterns of health care, often leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Our case underscores the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion for uncommon diseases.

However, the efficacy and mechanism of AMB in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the active components and mechanisms of AMB against NAFLD based on network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental verification. METHODS: First, the bioactive components and relevant targets of AMB were screened from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systematic Pharmacology (TCMSP) database, and NAFLD-related targets were obtained from the GeneCards database. Then, the AMB-NAFLD protein target interaction network was built by the STRING database. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database. The component targets were visualized using Cytoscape software. Finally, molecular docking and experiments were used to verify the results of network pharmacological prediction. RESULTS: Network pharmacology predicted that quercetin may be the main active component in AMB, and the TNF and MAPK signaling pathways may be the key targets of AMB against NAFLD. Molecular docking validation results demonstrated that quercetin, as the main active component of AMB, had the highest binding affinity with TNF. Furthermore, quercetin played a distinct role in alleviating NAFLD through in vitro experiments. Quercetin upregulated the phosphorylation levels of AMPK and inhibited the expression of p-MAPK and TNF-. In addition, we further discovered that quercetin could increase ACC phosphorylation and CPT1 expression in PA-induced HepG2 cells.

Therefore, knowing the epidemiological patterns of common respiratory viruses may be valuable to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of patients with suspected COVID-19, especially in Southwest China (a mild epidemic area). METHODS: A total of 2188 patients with clinically suspected of COVID-19 in Southwest China were recruited from January 21 to February 29, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and sputum specimens were collected to detect SARS-CoV-2 by using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other 12 viruses via PCR fragment analysis combined with capillary electrophoresis. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test findings were acquired from electronic medical records. All data were analyzed to unravel the epidemiological patterns. RESULTS: Only 1.1% (24/2188) patients with suspected COVID-19 were eventually confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the most frequently observed symptoms were fever (75.0%, 18/24) and cough (20.8%, 5/24). The overall detection rate of other respiratory pathogens was 10.3% (226/2188). Among them, human rhinovirus (3.2%, 71/2188), human parainfluenza viruses (1.6%, 35/2188), influenza B virus (1.2%, 26/2188) and mycoplasma pneumonia (1.2%, 26/2188) were the predominantly detected pathogens in this study.

CONCLUSIONS: In the study, TWEAK and LTE4 levels increased in cases with COVID-19. These results support that TWEAK/Fn14 pathway and LT may involved in the pathology of aberrant immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of each of these pathways may be a potential target in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"The assessment of the serum levels of TWEAK and prostaglandin F2 in COVID C 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic spreading worldwide, and Italy represented the first European country involved. Healthcare workers (HCWs) facing COVID-19 pandemic represented an at-risk population for new psychosocial COVID-19 strain and consequent mental health symptoms. The aim of the present study was to identify the possible impact of working contextual and personal variables (age, gender, working position, years of experience, proximity to infected patients) on professional quality of life, represented by compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout, and secondary traumatization (ST), in HCWs facing COVID-19 emergency. Further, two multivariable linear regression analyses were fitted to explore the association of mental health selected outcomes, anxiety and depression, with some personal and working characteristics that are COVID-19-related. A sample of 265 HCWs of a major university hospital in central Italy was consecutively recruited at the outpatient service of the Occupational Health Department during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs were assessed by Professional Quality of Life-5 (ProQOL-5), the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Seven-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) to evaluate, respectively, CS, burnout, ST, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Females showed higher ST than males, while frontline staff and healthcare assistants reported higher CS rather than second-line staff and physicians, respectively. Burnout and ST, besides some work or personal variables, were associated to depressive or anxiety scores. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new working challenge for HCWs and intervention strategies to prevent burnout and ST to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes are needed.","output":"Professional Quality of Life and Mental Health Outcomes among Health Care Workers Exposed to Sars-Cov-2 (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From staffing and supply shortages to furloughs and layoffs, few expected-let alone had a plan for managing-the COVID-19 pandemic.

Perceptions of risk of COVID\\\\19; government and media representations; vaccination status (Y/N); vaccine intentions (when offered, delayed vaccinators, vaccine refusers); reasons for hesitancy; confidence in safety and efficacy of vaccine; and information sources. Results: At the time of the survey, fewer than 1% of DSWs had been vaccinated and 17% had been offered vaccination. Of those who had not had the vaccine, 47% said they would get it as soon as it was offered; 19% would not get the vaccine; 12% would have if required; 13% hadn't decided; and 8% would wait until it was available for a while. Reasons for hesitancy included inadequate safety data (70% delayed vaccinators, 79% vaccine refusers), side effects (63% delayed vaccinators, 58% refusers), and distrust in the government (17% delayed vaccinators, 52% refusers). DSWs most trusted sources of information were their own doctor, Chief Medical Officers, and governments. 61% believed that COVID\\\\19 will only stop if most of the community is vaccinated and 53% agreed the chances of them or their clients getting COVID\\\\19 would be reduced if they were vaccinated.

In child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), such organizational envisioning is needed to cope with the foreseeable psychological effects of prolonged social isolation induced by nation-wide public health measures such as school closure. CAMHS need to ensure flexible responses to the psychopathological consequences of evolving societal dynamics, as dramatically actualized by the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. This would imply (a) shifting the focus of intervention from symptom reduction and containment of acute crises in a comparatively small number of severe cases to a broader preventive strategy, guided by a gradient of increasing intensity and specificity of treatment; (b) promoting smooth access pathways into services and encouraging participation of families; (c) adopting a transdiagnostic staging model to capture the developmental fluctuations from subsyndromal to syndromal states and back, with related changes in the intensity of the need of care; and (d) implementing digital tools to encourage help-seeking and compliance by digitally native youth.","output":"Editorial Perspective: Rethinking child and adolescent mental health care after COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a policy situation analysis in three Mekong region countries, focused on how the animal and human health systems interact to control avian influenza (AI).

We found signs of formal progress in establishing the policy and legislative frameworks needed to enable cooperation of the two sectors but a series of constraints that impede their effective operation. These included the competitive relationships involved, especially with budgetary allocations and mandates that can conflict with each other. Many local actors also view development partners (e.g., bilateral and multilateral donors) as having a dominant role in establishing these collaborations, limiting the extent to which there is local ownership of the agenda. The animal and human health sectors are not equally resourced, with the animal health sector disadvantaged in terms of surveillance and laboratory systems, human resources and financial allocations. Contrasting strategies for achieving objectives have also characterised the two sectors in recent decades, seeing a major shift towards the use of incentive-based approaches in the human health sector but very little parallel development in the animal health sector, largely dependent on command and control approaches. Successful future collaborations between the two sectors are likely to depend on better resourcing in the animal health sector, increasing local ownership of the agenda, and ensuring that both sectors can use the full range of regulatory strategies available to achieve objectives.","output":"Role of regulatory capacity in the animal and human health systems in driving response to zoonotic disease outbreaks in the the Mekong region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which originated in China, as a public health emergency of international concern as early as January 30, 2020, the current COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly.

Recanalization has been identified as a major prognostic factor for good outcome in BAO. Mechanical thrombectomy using retrievable stents is an emerging treatment option for acute stroke. First clinical trials using stent retrievers have shown promising high recanalization rates. However, these studies mainly included large artery occlusions in the anterior circulation with only a few or single cases of BAO. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy using retrievable stent in the treatment of acute BAO. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fourteen consecutive patients with BAO undergoing endovascular therapy using retrievable stents (Solitaire FR Revascularization Device) were included. Additional multimodal treatment approaches included thromboaspiration, intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis, and PTA/ permanent stent placement. Recanalization rates after multimodal therapy and stent retrieval were determined. Clinical outcome and mortality were assessed 3 months after treatment. RESULTS Median patient age was 64.5 years (range 55-85). Median NIHSS score at presentation was 21 (range 5-36). Overall, successful recanalization (TICI 3 or 2b) was achieved in all patients (TICI 3 in 78.6%, 11/14). In 4 patients (28.6%), insufficient recanalization after stent retrieval was due to an underlying atherosclerotic stenosis. Additional deployment of a permanent intracranial stent was performed in 3 patients (21.4%) and PTA alone in 1 patient (7.1%), resulting in final TICI 3 in 1 patient and TICI 2b in 3 patients. Stent retrieval alone was performed in 4 patients (28.6%). Average number of device passes was 1.3 (range 1-3). Median procedure time to maximal recanalization was 47 minutes (range 10-252). No device-related complications or thromboembolic occlusion of a previously unaffected artery occurred. There was no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. At 3 months, good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) was observed in 28.6% (4/14); overall mortality was 35.7% (5/14). CONCLUSIONS A multimodal endovascular approach using retrievable stents in BAO has high recanalization rates, with very low complication rates. Underlying atherothrombotic stenotic lesions of the basilar artery may still necessitate additional permanent stent placement to achieve complete recanalization.","output":"Technical feasibility and application of mechanical thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR Revascularization Device in acute basilar artery occlusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has led to the COVID-19 pandemic.

PorPV persistent infection could facilitate the establishment of secondary infections. The aim of this study was to analyse the pathogenicity of classic swine H1N1 influenza virus (swH1N1) in growing pigs persistently infected with porcine rubulavirus. Conventional six-week-old pigs were intranasally inoculated with PorPV, swH1N1, or PorPV/swH1N1. A mock-infected group was included. The co-infection with swH1N1 was at 44 days post-infection (DPI), right after clinical signs of PorPV infection had stopped. The pigs of the co-infection group presented an increase of clinical signs compared to the simple infection groups. In all infected groups, the most recurrent lung lesion was hyperplasia of the bronchiolar-associated lymphoid tissue and interstitial pneumonia. By means of immunohistochemical evaluation it was possible to demonstrate the presence of the two viral agents infecting simultaneously the bronchiolar epithelium. Viral excretion of PorPV in nasal and oral fluid was recorded at 28 and 52 DPI, respectively. PorPV persisted in several samples from respiratory tissues (RT), secondary lymphoid organs (SLO), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). For swH1N1, the viral excretion in nasal fluids was significantly higher in single-infected swH1N1 pigs than in the co-infected group. However, the co-infection group exhibited an increase in the presence of swH1N1 in RT, SLO, and BALF at two days after co-infection. In conclusion, the results obtained confirm an increase in the clinical signs of infection, and PorPV was observed to impact the spread of swH1N1 in analysed tissues in the early stage of co-infection, although viral shedding was not enhanced.

To assess the predictive value of the RAM, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Of 9407 patients who met study criteria, 274 patients developed VTE with a prevalence of 2.91%. The VTE rate was 0.41% for IMPROVE- score 0C1 (low risk), 1.21% for score 2C3 (moderate risk), and 5.30% for score  4 (high risk). Approximately 45.7% of patients were classified as high VTE risk, 33.3% moderate risk, and 21.0% low risk. Discrimination of low versus moderate-high VTE risk demonstrated sensitivity 0.971, specificity 0.215, PPV 0.036, and NPV 0.996. ROC AUC was 0.703. In this external validation study, the IMPROVE- VTE RAM demonstrated very good discrimination to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients at low, moderate, and high VTE risk.","output":"External validation of the IMPROVE- risk assessment model for venous thromboembolism among inpatients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak that affected whole the world with more than 6 million confirmed cases and over 370,000 deaths. At present, there are no effective treatments or vaccine for this disease, which constitutes a serious global health crisis. As the pandemic still spreading around the globe, it is of interest to use computational methods to identify potential inhibitors for the virus. The crystallographic structures of 3CLpro (PDB: 6LU7) and RdRp (PDB 6ML7) were used in virtual screening of 50000 chemical compounds obtained from the CAS Antiviral COVID19 database using 3D-similarity search and standard molecular docking followed by ranking and selection of compounds based on their binding affinity, computational techniques for the sake of details on the binding interactions, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction; we report three 4-(morpholin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine derivatives; two compounds (2001083-68-5 and 2001083-69-6) with optimal binding features to the active site of the main protease and one compound (833463-19-7) with optimal binding features to the active site of the polymerase for further consideration to fight COVID-19. The structural stability and dynamics of lead compounds at the active site of 3CLpro and RdRp were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential dynamics demonstrated that the three complexes remain stable during simulation of 20 ns, which may be suitable candidates for further experimental analysis. As the identified leads share the same scaffold, they may serve as promising leads in the development of dual 3CLpro and RdRp inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Increasing evidence has also linked metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with severe COVID-19 illness. Thus, we review different published clinical data relating to the association of MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. Our review showed that published studies consistently support the association between MAFLD and more severe COVID-19, even after adjustment for confounding factors. It was also observed that an increasing hepatic fibrosis score is correlated with increasing severity of COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated the mechanistic basis of variability in oral absorption of a model hydrophobic compound with pH-dependent solubility, BMS-955829, after oral dosing in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. The contribution of regional absorption to pharmacokinetic variability was assessed in ported monkeys by direct intraduodenal and intraileal administration. The effect of BMS-955829 on gastric emptying and intestinal motility was investigated by radiography after co-administration of barium. BMS-955829 exhibited species dependent oral bioavailability, with high variability in monkeys. During regional absorption studies, highest rate of drug absorption was observed after direct intraduodenal administration. Radiography studies indicated that BMS-955829 slowed gastric emptying and intestinal motility. The effect of rate and site of drug release on oral exposure was studied using different drug product formulations. Reducing the rate of drug release reduced oral exposure variability without compromising exposure in cynomolgus monkeys. This effect was likely mediated by avoidance of rapid initial absorption and drug effect on gastric emptying and intestinal transit within the biorelevant timeframe. Thus, drug release rate can modulate the effect of physiological factors on variability in the oral absorption of sensitive compounds.","output":"Role of regional absorption and gastrointestinal motility on variability in oral absorption of a model drug."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Local food systems are growing, and little is known about how the constellation of farms and markets change over time.

A cross-sectional study, including a self-reported running questionnaire completed after the first outdoor running session after quarantine, was performed. Three hundred recreational runners (74% males; 60% 18-40 years old; most typical running experience >3 years, 10-30 km weekly running distance distributed in 3-4 sessions) were considered for analysis.

Manning of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wards and ICUs, also surgery on COVID-positive patients is increasingly being relegated to that subset of health care workers (HCW) who themselves have resumed duties after surviving COVID-19 infection. Convalescent plasma therapy has been widely endorsed. Several vaccines are in the pipeline as potential preventive measures against the virus keeping HCW on the priority-list of recipients. Immunity passports are being validated for foreign travel. These events share a common presumption that exposure to COVID-19 virus (natural infection/inoculation) produces protective adaptive immunity. It is unknown whether all (COVID-19) infected patients mount a protective immune response and for how long any protective effect will last. Methods: This single institutional prospective longitudinal panel survey questions were deployed to the respondents online via email/WhatsApp groups to ascertain the symptomology and immunity status of HCW in the months following COVID-19 infection. The survey was administered to the same set/cohort of health care workers over 6 months. Results: 165 responses from 151 respondents (70 at 1-2months; 95 at 3-4 months including 14 at both time points) were analysed.7.14% of infected HCW failed to develop IgG antibodies at 4-6 weeks. 91.7% HCW with IgG titres in the highest bracket had experienced anosmia. Mean antibody titres were 12.08 {+/-} 9.56 and 9.72 {+/-} 9.34 at 1-2 months and 3-4 months post-development of first symptom, respectively. Conclusion: Understanding of COVID-19 patterns of variation in HCW may guide their deployment in the COVID ward and COVID-OTs. Revelation of this enigma (by quantification of serial IgG antibody levels) is critical for predicting response to vaccines under trial, fostering effective stratagems and tactics for pandemic control, ascertaining validity of immunity passports and understanding longevity/durability of protection by forecasting immunological memory against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Title: Immunity status of Health Care Workers post recovery from COVID-19: An online longitudinal panel survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autologous tumor cell-based vaccines (ATVs) are emerging as a transformable approach for personalized immunotherapy, but their therapeutic efficacy remains unsatisfying in patients with cancer.

In this cross-sectional study, 722 graduating students and fresh graduates were requested to answer a questionnaire pretested for validity and reliability. The data were analyzed statistically. Results revealed that medical participants scored 15.45 (out of 22), with 38% of them showing good knowledge about pediatric OSA, while dental participants scored 14.59, with 25.2% of them showing good knowledge. By regression analysis, medical participants (odds ratio (OR): 1.529) were more likely to have good knowledge than dental participants, while participants who belonged to institutions located in the central region (OR: 0.546) were less likely to have good knowledge than those from southern region institutions. In addition, participants from public institutions (OR: 0.290) were less likely to have good knowledge than those from private institutions. Regarding attitudes, medical participants scored 14.13 (out of 20), and dental participants scored 14.64. We detected a significant positive correlation between knowledge and attitude scores of dental participants. Given these findings, the knowledge level of graduating Saudi medical and dental students and fresh graduates about pediatric OSA was not optimal.

NMR is widely used in the study of proteins, ranging from determination of three-dimensional structures to characterizing dynamics and binding of small molecules and other proteins or ligands. Assigned chemical shift data for the atoms within proteins is a treasure trove of information that can facilitate a broad range of biochemical and biophysical studies. The Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) is a publicly accessible database that contains a large number of assigned chemical shifts; however, translating this wealth of knowledge into a practical application is not straightforward. Herein we present nightshift: a Python command line utility and library for plotting simulated 2D and 3D NMR spectra from assigned chemical shifts in the BMRB. This tool allows users to simulate routinely collected amide and methyl fingerprint spectra, backbone triple-resonance assignment spectra, and user-defined custom correlations, including ones that do not necessarily correspond to published experiments. This tool enables experienced NMR spectroscopists, those learning the craft, and interested scientists seeking to utilize NMR the ability to preview or examine a wide range of spectra for proteins whose assignments are deposited in the BMRB, irrespective of whether those experiments have been executed or reported. The tool applies equally to folded and intrinsically disordered proteins, limited only by the existence of a BMRB deposition. The features of nightshift are described along with applications that illustrate the ease with which complicated correlation spectra and binding events can be simulated.

One of the major reported complications of COVID-19 includes both arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Here we describe a case of COVID-19 provoked pulmonary embolism in a young patient already receiving prophylactic treatment for VTE. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old female with past medical history of diabetes mellites, hypertension, and asthma presented in the emergency department (ED) with dyspnea requiring 6 liters per minute of oxygen on presentation. Her main complaints were cough and vomiting. In the ED, hypoxemia worsened, and she ultimately required endotracheal intubation. Labs were suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and showed increase in all inflammatory markers and absolute lymphocytopenia. Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse patchy airspace opacities. Standard DKA management was started. She was also started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and subcutaneous heparin (5000 U every 8 h) for VTE prophylaxis. SARS-Cov2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction returned positive. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were discontinued the very next day because of low suspicion of bacterial infection while hydroxychloroquine was completed for 5 days. On the third day of admission, the patient self-extubated and was immediately placed on nonrebreather with spO2 in low 90s. On the fourth day of admission, D-dimer came back 4.74 mg/L, which was elevated from a prior value, so computed tomography angiography of the lungs was done, which disclosed multiple emboli in the lungs. She was started on therapeutic doses of enoxaparin sodium, which was continued through her admission. She was switched to Apixaban on discharge. CONCLUSIONS The finding of the case suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent VTE in COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of these patients may benefit from receiving prophylactic half doses or full doses of anticoagulants.","output":"A 46-Year-Old Woman Who Presented with Diabetic Ketoacidosis and COVID-19 Pneumonia with Multiple Pulmonary Thromboemboli: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote work has been of interest to managers since the implementation of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). During the initial period, it was treated as an employee's privilege or even a luxury and as such it was not a popular practice. The COVID-19 pandemic and the intervening period have changed attitudes toward remote work, as it became a necessity for many organisations. However, in connection with its use, many new, previously unknown problems have arisen, such as: the organisation of remote work, the supervision and monitoring of work performance, and employee support. The present research was conducted using a standardised questionnaire computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method in MayCJune 2021 on a population of 248 enterprises, divided into micro, small, medium-sized and large entities. The research data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic which, on the one hand, provided an exceptional opportunity to fill in the theoretical gaps that were existing in this field;however, on the other hand, it could be burdened with certain flaws due to the context of the pandemic. An enterprise's attitude to remote work has a positive influence on the efficiency of the remote work, the control of the remote work and the remote work support, with the strongest impact exerted on the last of the factors mentioned. A better attitude to remote work influences, to the largest degree, an enterprise's support for performing work from remote locations outside of corporate offices. Among the enterprises that were surveyed, the following were most frequently indicated as elements of such support: additional office equipment provided to an employee, remote work training, and the installation of additional computer programs.

GS-5734 is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug in the development for treatment of EBOV. METHOD: Antiviral activity of GS-5734 has been established in vitro against a wide range of pathogenic RNA virus families, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses (EC(50) = 37 to 200 nM) (Warren et al., Nature 2016; Sheahan et al., Sci Transl Med 2017; Lo et al., Sci Rep 2017). Herein, we describe the in vivo translation of the broad-spectrum activity of GS-5734 in relevant animal disease models for Ebola, Marburg, MERS-CoV, and Nipah. RESULT: Therapeutic efficacy against multiple filoviruses with 80C100% survival was observed in rhesus monkeys infected with lethal doses of EBOV (Kikwit/1995 or Makona/2014) or Marburg virus and treated with once daily intravenous (IV) administration of 5 to 10 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 3 to 5 days post-infection (p.i.). In all rhesus monkey filovirus infection models, GS-5734 significantly reduced systemic viremia and ameliorated severe clinical disease signs and anatomic pathology. In mice infected with MERS-CoV, twice daily subcutaneous administration of 25 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 1 day p.i. significantly reduced lung viral load and improved respiratory function. In rhesus monkeys, once-daily IV administration of 5 mg/kg GS-5734 initiated 1 day prior to MERS-CoV infection reduced lung viral load, improved clinical disease signs, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. Finally, in African green monkeys infected with a lethal dose of Nipah virus therapeutic once-daily IV administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734, starting 1 day p.i. resulted in 100% survival to at least day 35 without any major respiratory or CNS symptoms. CONCLUSION: GS-5734 is currently being tested in a phase 2 study in male Ebola survivors with persistent viral RNA in semen. Lyophilized drug formulation has been developed that can be administered to humans via a 30-minutes IV infusion and does not require cold chain storage. Together, these results support further development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum antiviral to treat viral infections with high mortality and significant outbreak potential. DISCLOSURES: R.

We conducted an international survey of centers undertaking studies of CCP to provide understanding of the common themes and differences between them. 64 studies in 22. countries were identified from clinical trial registries and personal contacts of the authors. 20 of the 64 centers (31%) from 12 of 22 countries (55%) responded to the survey. Of the 20 studies, 11 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 were case series. Only 4 of the RCTs plan to recruit 400 patients or more, and only 3 RCTs were blinded. The majority of studies will study the effect of CCP on sick patients requiring hospitalization and those requiring critical care, and none is examining the role of CCP in non-infected at-risk individuals. A wide variety of primary and secondary outcomes are being used. The donor eligibility criteria among the studies are very similar, and the use of plasmapheresis for the collection of CCP is almost universal. The planned dose of CCP ranges from as little as 200mL to well over 1 liter, but is 400-800 mL or 4 mL/kg or greater in all the RCTs. There is considerable variability in donor antibody testing with no consistency regarding the cut-off for antibody titer for acceptance as CCP or the use of pathogen-inactivation.

The pairing-dubbed happy hypoxia but more precisely termed silent hypoxemia-is especially bewildering to physicians and is considered as defying basic biology. This combination has attracted extensive coverage in media but has not been discussed in medical journals. It is possible that coronavirus has an idiosyncratic action on receptors involved in chemosensitivity to oxygen, but well-established pathophysiological mechanisms can account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia. These mechanisms include the way dyspnea and the respiratory centers respond to low levels of oxygen, the way the prevailing carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) blunts the brain's response to hypoxia, effects of disease and age on control of breathing, inaccuracy of pulse oximetry at low oxygen saturations, and temperature-induced shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve. Without knowledge of these mechanisms, physicians caring for patients with hypoxemia free of dyspnea are operating in the dark, placing vulnerable patients with COVID-19 at considerable risk. In conclusion, features of COVID-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology; an understanding of these mechanisms will enhance patient care if the much-anticipated second wave emerges.","output":"Why COVID-19 Silent Hypoxemia Is Baffling to Physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant evidence has accumulated to support the hypothesis that hippocampal region CA1 operates as an associative mismatch detector (e.g., Hasselmo et al., 1995; L?rincz & Buzski, 2000; Lisman & Otmakhova, 2001; Vinogradova, 2001; Meeter et al., 2004; Lisman & Grace, 2005; Kumaran & Maguire, 2007; Duncan et al., 2009; Schiffer et al., 2012). CA1 compares predictive synaptic signals from CA3 with synaptic signals from EC3, which reflect actual sensory inputs. The new CA1 pyramidal model presented here shows that the distal-proximal segregation of synaptic inputs from EC3 versus CA3, along with other biophysical features, enable such pyramids to serve as comparators that switch output encoding from a brief burst, for a match, to prolonged tonic spiking, for a mismatch. By including often-overlooked features of CA1 pyramidal neurons, this new model allows simulation of pharmacological effects that can eliminate either the match (phasic mode) response or the mismatch (tonic mode) response. These simulations reveal that dysfunctions can arise from either too much or too little ACh stimulation of the muscarinic receptors that control KCNQ channels. Additionally, a dysfunction caused by administration of an NMDA antagonist could be rescued by simultaneous administration of a KCNQ channel agonist, such as retigabine.","output":"Simulations reveal how M-currents and memory-based inputs from CA3 enable single neuron mismatch detection for EC3 inputs to the CA1 subfield of hippocampus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Shivering is an involuntary, spontaneous, and repetitive contraction of the skeletal muscle and increases patients discomfort, oxygen-consuming, wound infection; increased surgical bleeding, and morbid cardiac events.

In this study, we investigated the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Missouri, examined viral shedding over time, and analyzed the associations among emerging genetic variants, viral shedding, and disease severity. The study population included COVID-19 positive patients from CoxHealth (Springfield, Missouri) and University of Missouri Health Care (UMHC; Columbia, Missouri) between March and October 2020. All positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs (n=8,735) from March-October 2020 were collected. Available viral genomes (n=184) from March to July were sequenced. Hospitalization status and length of stay were extracted from medical charts of 1,335 patients (UMHC and sequenced patients). The primary outcome was hospitalization status (yes or no) and length of hospital stay (days). For the 1,335 individuals, 44 were hospitalized and four died due to COVID-19. The average age was 34.35 (SD=16.82), with 55.1% females (n=735) and 44.7% males (n=596). Multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Missouri, primarily from Australia, Europe, and domestic states, were observed. Four local lineages rapidly emerged and spread across urban and rural regions in Missouri. While most Missouri viruses harbored Spike-D614G mutations, many unreported mutations were identified among Missouri viruses, including seven in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex and Spike protein that were positively selected. A 15.6-fold increase in viral RNA levels in swab samples occurred from March to May and remained elevated through October. Accounting for comorbidities, individuals test-positive for COVID-19 with high viral loads were less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence interval=0.20, 0.77) and more likely to be discharged from the hospital sooner (hazard ratio=2.9, p=0.03) than those with low viral loads.

We find that approximately 39% of Zambias agricultural products were exported beyond the first year of trading and less than 10% lasted up to 6 years of trading. The mean and median duration of exporting agricultural products in Zambia was 1.7 years and 1 year, respectively. Among the products, maize had the highest export duration after the first year of trading, followed by sugar, tobacco, and cotton. Results of the discrete-time logit and probit models with random effects revealed that the duration of total agricultural products was significantly impacted by common colony, contiguity, partners gross domestic product (GDP), Zambias GDP, initial exports, and total exports. Of these factors, colonial history and Zambias GDP reduced export duration, while contiguity, partners GDP, initial exports, and total exports increased the durability of exports in Zambia. The effect of Zambias GDP was uniform across all individual agricultural products. Total exports also significantly impacted all other agriculture products in a similar manner except for maize. Export durability for cotton was significantly impacted by the Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), while the export durability of tobacco was significantly impacted by distance, contiguity, and partners GDP. To increase the duration of agriculture exports, we propose the exporting of finished agriculture products (and not just raw materials), which have a higher market value and duration probability.

Prior to predicting the demand, the spatial area was clustered into five communities using the community structure method. The demand prediction model was developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and the prediction results according to the activation function were compared. As a result, the model employing the exponential linear unit (ELU) and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) as the activation function produced good predictions regarding peak time demands and off-peak demands, respectively. This study presents a methodology for the efficient analysis of the wider spatial area of e-scooters.","output":"Predicting Demand for Shared E-Scooter Using Community Structure and Deep Learning Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially thought to be confined to the respiratory system only, is now known to be a multisystem disease. It is critical to be aware of and timely recognize neurological and neuroradiological manifestations affecting patients with COVID-19, to minimize morbidity and mortality of affected patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to our Level 1 trauma and stroke center during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York from March 1st to May 30, 2020, with a positive test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented mainly with neurological findings and had acute radiological brain changes on Computed Tomography (CT) scan. Patients with known chronic neurological disease processes were excluded from the study. We obtained and reviewed demographics, complete blood count, metabolic panel, D-dimer, inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), imaging, and patient's hospital course. We reviewed the current literature on neuroimaging, pathophysiology, and their clinical correlations on COVID-19. This case series study was approved by our institutional review board. Result: A total of 16 patients were selected for our case series. The most common neuroimaging features on CT, were territorial to multifocal ischemic infarcts, followed by a combination of ischemia and acute white matter encephalopathic changes, followed by temporal lobe predominant focal or more generalized encephalopathy with both confluent and non-confluent patterns, isolated cortical or more extensive intracranial hemorrhages and some combination of ischemia or hemorrhage and white matter changes. All our patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), most of them had elevated inflammatory markers, and D dimer. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is a multi-organ disease, which can manifest as rapidly progressive neurological disease beyond the more common pulmonary presentation. Early recognition of various neurological findings and neuroimaging patterns in these patients will enable timely diagnosis and rapid treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our retrospective study is limited due to small non-representative sample size, strict selection criteria likely underestimating the true extent of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, mono-modality imaging technique limited to predominantly CT scans and lack of CSF analysis in all except one patient. Multi-institutional, multi-modality, largescale studies are needed with radio-pathological correlation to better understand the complete spectrum of neurologic presentations in COVID-19 patients and study the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and CNS disease process.","output":"Spectrum of Neurologic & Neuroimaging manifestation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11 by WHO, due to its great threat to global public health.

Here we show that a clinically approved anti-HCV drug, Boceprevir, and a pre-clinical inhibitor against feline infectious peritonitis (corona) virus (FIPV), GC376, both efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells by targeting M(pro). Moreover, combined application of GC376 with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), results in sterilizing additive effect. Further structural analysis reveals binding of both inhibitors to the catalytically active side of SARS-CoV-2 protease M(pro) as main mechanism of inhibition.

How US hospitals responded to this crisis is unknown. RESEARCH QUESTION: What actions did US hospitals take to prepare for a potential surge in demand for critical care services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From September to November 2020, the chief nursing officers of a representative sample of US hospitals were surveyed regarding organizational actions taken to increase or maintain critical care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted proportions of hospitals for each potential action were calculated to create estimates across the entire population of US hospitals, accounting for both the sampling strategy and nonresponse. Also examined was whether the types of actions taken varied according to the cumulative regional incidence of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Responses were received from 169 of 540 surveyed US hospitals (response rate, 31.3%). Almost all hospitals canceled or postponed elective surgeries (96.7%) and nonsurgical procedures (94.8%). Few hospitals created new medical units in areas not typically dedicated to health care (12.9%), and almost none adopted triage protocols (5.6%) or protocols to connect multiple patients to a single ventilator (4.8%). Actions to increase or preserve ICU staff, including use of ICU telemedicine, were highly variable, without any single dominant strategy. Hospitals experiencing a higher incidence of COVID-19 did not consistently take different actions compared with hospitals facing lower incidence. INTERPRETATION: Responses of hospitals to the mass need for critical care services due to the COVID-19 pandemic were highly variable. Most hospitals canceled procedures to preserve ICU capacity and scaled up ICU capacity using existing clinical space and staffing. Future research linking hospital response to patient outcomes can inform planning for additional surges of this pandemic or other events in the future.","output":"Actions Taken by US Hospitals to Prepare for Increased Demand for Intensive Care During the First Wave of COVID-19: A National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In response to the pandemic, our facility recognized the need to safely decompress ICUs to create space for critically ill COVID-19 patients Stroke leadership identified select recipients of Alteplase to have care safely de-escalated from ICU to stepdown status earlier than the traditional protocol allowed Per previous protocol, all stroke patients recovered in ICU for 24 hours post- Alteplase with 36 neurological and vital sign assessments completed Acting upon the need to ensure patient safety and create inpatient ICU bed availability, the multidisciplinary stroke leadership team created the Fast Track Alteplase Protocol Goals: Project goals included decreasing ICU utilization and minimizing nursing encounters at the patient bedside to decrease potential COVID-19 exposures Methods: Protocol qualifications include both pre-Alteplase NIH Stroke Scale scores less than 10 and no large vessel occlusions or flow limiting stenosis present on imaging Once in the protocol, to qualify for transfer out of ICU, an NIH Stroke Scale score less than 10 throughout ICU stay, noncontrast head CT or MRI to evaluate infarct burden, not require continuous anti-hypertensive medications to maintain systolic blood pressure cap, and not demonstrate hemodynamic or respiratory concerns must be achieved and completed We developed education for nurses and physicians in ED, ICU, and stepdown patient care areas and tip sheets to guide nursing care and documentation associated with the new protocol Electronic orders were quickly developed and integrated as a new subphase specific to the Fast Track Alteplase Protocol within an existing stroke order set Results: The protocol decreased the number of encounters between nursing and patients from 36 to 12 interactions (66 7%) and planned time in the ICU from 24 to 12 hours (50%) The median time comparison of ICU length of stay for Fast Track vs traditional protocol was 12 hours and 26 min vs35 hours and 15 minutes respectively Conclusion: The protocol achieved both goals of decreasing the amount of time stroke patients arein the ICU and number of nursing encounters reducing the possibility of patient and staff exposure toCOVID-19","output":"Ready, set, go!

METHODS: A carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver fibrosis model was established in C57BL/6 mice to study the antifibrotic effect of DHM based on serum biochemical parameters, histological and immunofluorescence stainings, and the expression of several fibrosis-related markers. Based on the immunoregulatory role of DHM, the effect of DHM on NK cell activation ex vivo was evaluated by flow cytometry. Then, we investigated whether DHM-induced autophagy was involved in HSCs inactivation using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis. Thereafter, the role of DHM in NK cell-mediated killing was studied by in vitro coculture of NK cells and HSCs, with subsequent analysis by flow cytometry. Finally, the mechanism by which DHM regulates NK cells was studied by western blot analysis. RESULTS: DHM ameliorated liver fibrosis in C57BL/6 mice, as characterized by decreased serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, decreased expressions of collagen I alpha 1 (CoL-11), collagen I alpha 2 (CoL-12), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and desmin, as well as increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1). Interestingly, HSCs activation was significantly inhibited by DHM in vivo and in vitro. As expected, DHM also upregulated autophagy-related indicators in liver from CCl(4)-treated mice. DHM also prevented TGF-1-induced activation of HSCs in vitro by initiating autophagic flux. In contrast, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine markedly abolished the antifibrotic effect of DHM. Surprisingly, the frequency of activated intrahepatic NK cells was significantly elevated by DHM ex vivo. Furthermore, DHM enhanced NK cell-mediated killing of HSCs by increasing IFN- expression, which was abolished by an anti-IFN- neutralizing antibody. Mechanistically, DHM-induced IFN- expression was through AhR-NF-B/STAT3 pathway in NK cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that DHM can ameliorate the progression of liver fibrosis and inhibition of HSCs activation by inducing autophagy and enhancing NK cell-mediated killing through the AhR-NF-B/STAT3-IFN- signaling pathway, providing new insights into the preventive role of DHM in liver fibrosis.

The study sought to explore if the families presented different profiles of parent-child interaction quality, and to characterize such profiles in terms of discrete behaviors observed, parenting outcome variables, and families sociodemographic and CPS referral characteristics. The parent-child dyads took part in a 15 minutes structured task and parents completed self-report measures (affection, parenting behaviors, and stress). Discrete behaviors of parents and children during interactions were coded with a micro-analytic coding procedure. The global dimensions of the parents interactions were coded with a global rating system. A latent profile analysis, estimated with global dimensions, identified two subgroups, one subgroup in which parents displayed higher quality interactions (n = 12), and another subgroup in which parents displayed lower quality interactions (n = 35). Further analyses comparing the subgroups determined that the higher quality subgroup presented more positive behaviors, and the lower quality subgroup presented more negative behaviors during the interactions. No further differences or associations were found regarding the parenting outcome variables, and the families sociodemographic and CPS referral characteristics. The findings are in line with prior studies, suggesting that vulnerable families may frequently present depleted parent-child interactions.

Here, I use semistructured interviews of employees at two field sites, in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda and Loango National Park, Gabon, to understand if their employment influenced their attitude towards gorillas and conservation and led to behavior change. In contrast to western views of gorillas as \\"gentle giants,\\" staff viewed gorillas as dangerous animals before working for these projects. Overall, employment leads to viewing conservation and gorillas more positively, and in many cases, viewing the gorillas as kin. The most common value attributed to the gorillas was economic, yet intrinsic and non-use existence values were frequently mentioned. Loango staff, but not Bwindi staff, reported behavior change related to hunting and bushmeat consumption, which likely is related to bushmeat consumption being commonplace in Gabon but not in Uganda. The Bwindi staff seemed to have a more positive and broader outlook toward conservation than the Loango staff, possibly because they had more years of formal education, they worked with gorillas longer, there is more history of conservation activities in Bwindi, and/or they have been less directly affected by negative consequences of conservation (e.g., crop raiding). This study shows the importance of explaining that gorillas are not dangerous if not provoked and using their human-like characteristics as a means to change conservation values and interest of local communities, while concurrently recognizing that providing economic benefits and reducing negative effects of wildlife are a reality for conservation buy-in.","output":"Assessing attitudes towards gorilla conservation via employee interviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have recently been funded by the UK Prevention Research Partnership (UKPRP) to develop a UK school food network.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the association of short-term FI with dietary quality and energy 1) over six weeks in two seasonal months and 2) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using an ecological momentary assessment framework on smartphones, this study tracked daily FI via the 6-item U.S. Adult Food Security Survey Module and dietary intake via food diaries in 29 low-income adults. A total of 324 person-days of data were collected during two three-week long waves in fall and winter months. Generalized Estimating Equation models were applied to estimate the daily FI-diet relationship, accounting for intrapersonal variation and covariates. RESULTS: A one-unit increase in daily FI score was associated with a 7.10-point (95%CI:-11.04,-3.15) and 3.80-point (95%CI: -6.08,-1.53) decrease in the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) score in winter and during COVID-19, respectively. In winter months, a greater daily FI score was associated with less consumption of total fruit (-0.17 cups, 95% CI: -0.32,-0.02), whole fruit (-0.18 cups, 95%CI: -0.30,-0.05), whole grains (-0.57 oz, 95%CI: -0.99,-0.16) and higher consumption of refined grains (1.05 oz, 95%CI: 0.52,1.59).

Most studies to date have only focused on the effect of specific disorders on infection severity, without considering that patients usually present multiple chronic diseases and that these conditions tend to group together in the form of multimorbidity patterns. In this large-scale epidemiological study, including primary and hospital care information of 166,242 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from the Spanish region of Andalusia, we applied network analysis to identify multimorbidity profiles and analyze their impact on the risk of hospitalization and mortality. Our results showed that multimorbidity was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and that this risk increased with the morbidity burden. Individuals with advanced cardio-metabolic profiles frequently presented the highest infection severity risk in both sexes. The pattern with the highest severity associated in men was present in almost 28.7% of those aged 80 years and included associations between cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases;age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (1.71 (1.44C2.02)).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective 15-year study (4/2005-4/2020) at a regional level I trauma center. Patients were categorized as having a partial or complete transection injury. Treatment success was defined as the absence of hydronephrosis or obstruction on follow-up imaging. RESULTS: Eighteen patients suffered 10 partial and 9 complete ureteral transections. All 16 patients who underwent initial evaluation with computed tomography were correctly graded as having partial or complete transections, and there were no missed injuries. Treatment of partial transections included observation (3/9), retrograde double-J stent placement (4/9), and Heineke-Mikulicz pyeloplasty (2/9). At a median follow-up of 9 (IQR 2-59) months, 8/9 (89%) partial transections were treated successfully. Treatment of complete transections included pyeloplasty (3/9), ureteroureterostomy (4/9), and ureteroneocystostomy (1/9). One patient who underwent attempted reconstruction 6 days after trauma required nephrectomy. At a median follow-up of 32 (IQR 4-82) months, 7/8 (89%) reconstructed complete transections were treated successfully. CONCLUSIONS: CT with delayed phase imaging is a sensitive test to detect ureteral injuries after blunt trauma, and CT can distinguish between partial and complete transections. Partial transection injuries secondary to blunt trauma may be amenable to ureteral stent placement or close observation in select cases. Good intermediate-term outcomes can be achieved with early surgical intervention in the case of complete transections.","output":"Ureteral Injuries Secondary to Blunt Abdominal Trauma: A 15-Year Review of Presentation, Management, and Outcomes at a Level 1 Trauma Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two general practitioners (GPs) with SARS-CoV-2 infection provided in-person patient care to patients of their joint medical practice before and after symptom onset, up until SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmation.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 cases in total by the end of March, April, May, and June following viral introduction. METHODS: We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 cases are reached or the end of June, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under four different combinations of parameter values to test the sensitivity of our results. RESULTS: We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by end of March was close to 100% under all scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 1,000 cases in total reported by end of June whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by then was higher than 50% even under the most optimistic scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 cases far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","output":"Importations of COVID-19 into African countries and risk of onward spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic, but progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public-health system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public-health problems and, among other efforts, increased public-health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, and started a programme to rebuild local public-health facilities. These measures contributed to acceleration in efforts to control tuberculosis. By 2005, the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80% of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global tuberculosis control targets. At the same time, specific efforts to improve tuberculosis control also contributed to strengthening of the public-health system.

In 2017, the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act (GSDOA) was enacted by the Canadian government to provide people present at an overdose with legal protection from charges for simple drug possession, and conditions stemming from simple possession. Few studies have taken a multi-methods approach to evaluating the GSDOA. We used quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to explore awareness, understanding, and perceptions of the GSDOA in people at risk of witnessing an overdose. METHODS: Quantitative cross-sectional surveys and qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with adults and youth at risk of witnessing an overdose across British Columbia. Cross-sectional survey participants were recruited at 19 Take Home Naloxone sites and online through Foundry. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed hierarchically to determine factors associated with GSDOA awareness. Telephone interview participants were recruited by research assistants with lived/living experience of substance use. Deductive and inductive thematic analyses were conducted to identify major themes. RESULTS: Overall, 52.7% (n = 296) of the quantitative study sample (N = 453) reported being aware of the GSDOA. In multivariable analysis, cellphone possession (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36, 3.54) and having recently witnessed an opioid overdose (AOR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.45, 3.80) were positively associated with GSDOA awareness. Young adults (25 C 34 years) were more likely to be aware of the Act (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI 1.11, 3.98) compared to youth (16C24 years). Qualitative interviews (N = 42) revealed that many overestimated the protections offered by the GSDOA. To increase awareness and knowledge of the Act among youth, participants recommended adding the GSDOA to school curricula and using social media. Word of mouth was suggested to reach adults. CONCLUSION: Both awareness and knowledge of the GSDOA remain low in BC, with many overestimating the protections the Act offers. Dissemination efforts should be led by people with lived/living experience and should target those with limited awareness and understanding of the Act as misunderstandings can erode trust in law enforcement and harm reduction policy.

The aim of this study was to determine LUS patterns, their clinical significance, and how they compare to CT findings in hospitalized patients with coronavirus infection. METHODS: This observational study included 62 patients (33 men, age 59.315.9 years), hospitalized with pneumonia due to COVID-19, who underwent chest CT and bedside LUS on the day of admission. The CT images were analyzed by chest radiographers who calculated a CT visual score based on the expansion and distribution of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. The LUS score was calculated according to the presence, distribution, and severity of anomalies. RESULTS: All patients had CT findings suggestive of bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, with an average visual scoring of 8.12.9%. LUS identified 4 different abnormalities, with bilateral distribution (mean LUS score: 26.46.7), focal areas of non-confluent B lines, diffuse confluent B lines, small sub-pleural micro consolidations with pleural line irregularities, and large parenchymal consolidations with air bronchograms. LUS score was significantly correlated with CT visual scoring (rho = 0.70; p<0.001). Correlation analysis of the CT and LUS severity scores showed good interclass correlation (ICC) (ICC =0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52C0.83; p<0.001). Logistic regression was used to determine the cut-off value of 27 (area under the curve: 0.97; 95% CI: 90-99; sensitivity 88.5% and specificity 97%) of the LUS severity score that represented severe and critical pulmonary involvement on chest CT (CT: 3-4).

The present paper aims to analyze the dynamics of the opinions regarding COVID-19 vaccination by considering the one-month period following the first vaccine announcement, until the first vaccination took place in UK, in which the civil society has manifested a higher interest regarding the vaccination process. Classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been compared to select the best performing classifier. 2 349 659 tweets have been collected, analyzed, and put in connection with the events reported by the media. Based on the analysis, it can be observed that most of the tweets have a neutral stance, while the number of in favor tweets overpasses the number of against tweets. As for the news, it has been observed that the occurrence of tweets follows the trend of the events. Even more, the proposed approach can be used for a longer monitoring campaign that can help the governments to create appropriate means of communication and to evaluate them in order to provide clear and adequate information to the general public, which could increase the public trust in a vaccination campaign.","output":"The Longest Month: Analyzing COVID-19 Vaccination Opinions Dynamics From Tweets in the Month Following the First Vaccine Announcement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS: Patients at greatest risk of severe clinical conditions from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and death are elderly and comorbid patients. Increased levels of cardiac troponins identify patients with poor outcome. The present study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of Italian inpatients, admitted to a medical COVID-19 Unit, and to investigate the relative role of cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred to our dedicated medical Unit between February 26th and March 31st 2020. Patients clinical data including comorbidities, laboratory values, and outcomes were collected. Predictors of in-hospital mortality were investigated. A mediation analysis was performed to identify the potential mediators in the relationship between cardiac injury and mortality. A total of 109 COVID-19 inpatients (female 36%, median age 71 years) were included. During in-hospital stay, 20 patients (18%) died and, compared with survivors, these patients were older, had more comorbidities defined by Charlson comorbidity index  3(65% vs 24%, p = 0.001), and higher levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (Hs-cTnI), both at first evaluation and peak levels. A doseCresponse curve between Hs-cTnI and in-hospital mortality risk up to 200 ng/L was detected. Hs-cTnI, chronic kidney disease, and chronic coronary artery disease mediated most of the risk of in-hospital death, with Hs-cTnI mediating 25% of such effect. Smaller effects were observed for age, lactic dehydrogenase, and d-dimer. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of elderly and comorbid COVID-19 patients, elevated Hs-cTnI levels were the most important and independent mediators of in-hospital mortality.

Since then, numerous studies have been conducted on the issue, but the need for a holistic review study that highlights the gaps and limits of previous research, as well as opportunities and agendas for future studies, is palpable. Through a systematic literature review on blockchain technology (BCT) deployment in supply-chain management (SCM) concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, this research seeks to add to the content of previous studies and to enlighten the path for future studies. Relevant papers were found using a variety of resources (Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and ProQuest). Seventy-two articles were systematically selected, considering the PRISMA procedure, and were thoroughly analyzed based on BCT, methodologies, industrial sectors, geographical, and sustainability context. According to our findings, there is a significant lack of empirical and quantitative methodologies in the literature. The majority of studies did not take specific industries into account. Furthermore, the articles focusing on the sustainability context are few, particularly regarding social and environmental issues. In addition, most of the reviewed papers did not consider the geographical context. The results indicate that the deployment of BCT in several sectors is not uniform, and this utilization is reliant on their services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the concentration of research on the impacts of the BCT on SCM differs according to the conditions of various countries in terms of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also show that there is a direct relationship between the deployment of BCT and sustainability factors, such as economic and waste issues, under the circumstances surrounding COVID-19.

Using the example of a clinic for visceral, transplantation, thorax and vascular surgery (VTTG), the performance development of inpatient care in the first 7 weeks in comparison to the previous year as well as an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law were evaluated. METHODOLOGY Based on the performance figures, a comparison was made between the period from 16 March to 3 May 2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case mix index and day mix index as well as the bed occupancy days were recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act were applied to these changes and the adequacy was evaluated. RESULTS Compared to the previous year there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of 120 patients during the observation period. As a result there was a decrease of 370 points in case mix and 1433 days of occupancy. For the whole VTTG this resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately 0.8 million , which was completely compensated by the flat rate payment for empty beds. The individual areas of the VTTG showed a heterogeneous picture in relation to the compensation for the loss of revenue. Elective units in particular showed a shortfall up to 128,163  with respect to inpatient treatment for 7 weeks. CONCLUSION The measures taken by the Government are an important support for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to a heterogeneous picture in compensation for VTTG revenues and has to be understood as an alarm signal especially for elective surgical healthcare.","output":"[How severe is the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the department of surgery of a university hospital? : An analysis of the first 7 weeks]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rise of social media accompanied by the Covid-19 Pandemic has instigated a shift in paradigm in the presidential campaigns in Iran from the real world to social media.

In some types of lysosomal diseases, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is administered intravenously in weekly or biweekly doses. Unfortunately, scheduled ERT during COVID-19 was disrupted. We considered the possibility of adverse outcomes caused by the disruption in the treatment of patients with lysosomal storage disorders. METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a questionnaire that was delivered via Internet to assess how this vulnerable patient group was affected by the pandemic in terms of their access to treatment and their disease-related symptoms. RESULTS: The questionnaire was filled out by 75 patients. There were 35 patients whose treatment dose was missed because of COVID-19. The most common reason for skipping treatment was not wanting to go to the hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19. These 35 patients missed a median of four doses of ERT (range: 1-16 dosages). Twenty-one patients (60%) claimed that they were affected physically by not taking ERT (20 mucopolysaccaridoses, 1 Fabry disease), whereas 14 (40%) did not.

In Togo, where four in five people practice self-medication, the absence of a cure for COVID-19 and the constant progression of the disease requires an assessment of self-medication patterns in the context of the pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 and its associated factors in Lom, Togo. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lom, the capital city of Togo, from April 23rd to May 8th, 2020, with a sample of participants from five sectors: the healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal sectors. The participants were invited to provide information about their self-medication practices to prevent COVID-19 in the 2 weeks preceding the survey. RESULTS: A total of 955 participants (71.6% men) with a median age of 36 (IQR 32C43) were included. Approximately 22.1% were in the air transport sector, 20.5% were in the police sector, and 38.7% were in the health sector. The overall prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 was 34.2% (95% CI: 31.2C37.3%). The most commonly used products were vitamin C (27.6%) and traditional medicine (10.2%). Only 2.0% of participants reported using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Female sex (aOR=1.90; p< 0.001), work in the health sector (aOR=1.89; p= 0.001), secondary education level (aOR= 2.28; p= 0.043) and university education level (aOR= 5.11; p< 0.001) were associated with self-medication.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), an integrated health care system. All adult members who received 1 or more automated text or IVR message between October 1, 2018, and September 30, 2019, were included. EXPOSURES: Receipt of automated text or IVR messages. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Message volume and opt-out rates obtained from messaging systems over 1 year. RESULTS: Of the 428 242 adults included in this study, 59.7% were women, and 66.5% were White; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (17.7) years. During the study period, 84.1% received 1 or more text messages (median, 4 messages; interquartile range, 2-8 messages) and 67.8% received 1 or more IVR messages (median, 3 messages; interquartile range, 1-6 messages). A total of 8929 individuals (2.5%) opted out of text messages, and 4392 (1.5%) opted out of IVR messages.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed hospital admissions from Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, during the months of March and April from 2016-2020. Specifically, we identified all patients who had cranial neuro trauma consisting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or skull fractures, as well as spinal neuro trauma consisting of vertebral fractures and/or spinal cord injury (SCI). We then performed chart review to determine mechanism of injury and if emergent surgical intervention was required. Results Compared to previous years, we saw a significant decline in the number of neuro-traumas during the pandemic, with a 62% decline after the lockdown began. The number of emergent neuro-trauma surgical cases also significantly decreased by 84% in the month of April. Interestingly, while the number of vehicular traumas decreased by 77%, there was a significant 100% increase in the number of gunshot wounds.

The understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology is a vital part for the development of effective strategies for public health care and disease management. This work aims to analyze the available genomes sequenced in Brazil between February 2020 and February 2021, in order to identify mutation hotspots, geographical and temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the Brazilian territory by using phylogenetics and phylodynamics analyses from high-quality genomes.

Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for patients who are ambulant and post-discharge. A first ever trial in non-critically ill patients who were admitted to hospital has shown that a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin might improve clinical outcomes in this population. In critically ill patients, this same treatment does not improve outcomes and prophylactic dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended.

Sorting for entry which encompasses the most popular models requires selection of cargo and membrane and exclusion of non-secretory granule proteins in the TGN prior to secretory granule formation. Sorting by retention stipulates that protein selection or exclusion may occur after secretory granule formation: secretory granule specific components are retained during maturation of the granule while non-secretory granule molecules are removed in vesicles which bud from maturing secretory granules.

Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2. Methods In this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON? (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. Results To test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result. This analysis reinforces the validity our predictions.

METHODS A systematic review was performed on ERAS for liver surgery by searching EMBASE and Medline. Five independent reviewers selected relevant articles. Quality of randomized trials was assessed according to the Jadad score and CONSORT statement. The level of evidence for each item was determined using the GRADE system. The Delphi method was used to validate the final recommendations. RESULTS A total of 157 full texts were screened. Thirty-seven articles were included in the systematic review, and 16 of the 23 standard ERAS items were studied specifically for liver surgery. Consensus was reached among experts after 3 rounds. Prophylactic nasogastric intubation and prophylactic abdominal drainage should be omitted. The use of postoperative oral laxatives and minimally invasive surgery results in a quicker bowel recovery and shorter hospital stay. Goal-directed fluid therapy with maintenance of a low intraoperative central venous pressure induces faster recovery. Early oral intake and mobilization are recommended.

We found the Delta NTD on a Kappa or WT background increased spike S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and virus entry, specifically in Calu-3 lung cells and airway organoids, through use of TMPRSS2.

On average, 78.4% of outpatient services and 82.7% of functional surgeries were canceled, without significant differences by geographical distribution. An impact on patients' quality of life was anticipated by most of the respondents (87%) and 48.2% also reported potentially serious health risks for patients. Thirty-three percent of the respondents reported the use of telemedicine. If the nation-wide surgical activity increases by 20% postpandemic, it would take 37 months to clear the backlog of functional surgeries. We acknowledge the inherent limitations of the survey methodology and retrospective design.

In this line, it is important to avoid service termination by assessing the evolution, identifying drawbacks and success factors, that could be determinant on the systems future. Nonetheless, in many cases, subjective and objective information regarding BSS was not collected nor compared. In this study, we analyse the evolution of Madrids pioneer electric system, by combining the subjective data of three surveys, conducted since 2014 to 2019, with objective data from the service operator. The insights extracted shed light on the key factors determining the systems success, and its influence on travel behaviour. Results suggest that the user profile of the young early adopters evolved to middle-aged workers. Strong maintenance campaigns and network expansions improved bikes availably and user satisfaction. Slope of the streets is one of the lowest importance factors, whereas pedelec assistance the highest. It is likely to believe that there is a relationship between both, suggesting that electric assistance encourages cycling in a hilly city like Madrid. Transferable experiences to other cities evolving from traditional to e-BSS could be valuable, like the results suggesting that the introduction of an electric BSS is a potential trigger for bicycle adoption in dense urban environments. In addition, that subscribers tend to reduce the use of private car while increase cycling. This longitudinal analysis offers valuable policy implications, like those related with bike maintenance, network extension, and measures focused on keeping the new subscribers of the COVID-19 post-lockdown.","output":"Long term assessment of a successful e-bike-sharing system.

However, limited information describing their clinical characteristics and outcomes exists. Our study aims to describe clinical features and risk stratification strategies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with PE. We retrospectively analyzed 101 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and acute PE. Clinical outcomes measured were intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, bleeding and transfusion events, acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality. Pulmonary Severity Index (PESI) scores were used for risk stratification. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (50%), obesity (27%) and hyperlipidemia (32%) among this cohort. Baseline D-dimer abnormalities (4647.0  8281.8) were noted on admission with a 3-fold increase at the time of PE diagnosis (13288.4  14917.9; p<0.05). 5 (5%) patients required systemic thrombolysis and 12 (12%) patients experienced moderate to severe bleeding. 31 (31%) patients developed AKI and 1 (1%) patient required renal replacement therapy. 23 (23%) patients were admitted to ICU, of which 20 (20%) patients received mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate was 20%. Most patients (65%) had Intermediate to high risk PESI scores (>85), which portended a worse prognosis with higher mortality rate and length of stay. In conclusion, this study provides characteristics and early outcomes for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and acute pulmonary embolism.

Current recommendations for surveillance of PNETs less than 2 cm in size are based on low malignant potential and low rates of lymph node metastases (LNM). We investigated whether these guidelines are universally applicable regardless of race. STUDY DESIGN: A multi-institutional analysis of patients with resected, nonfunctional, sporadic PNETs was performed initially using the US Neuroendocrine Study Group dataset with the National Cancer Database as a validation dataset. Patients with distant metastatic disease were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: A total of 453 (388 White and 65 Black) and 5,532 patients (4,772 White and 760 Black) were analyzed in the initial and validation datasets, respectively. White patients had a low incidence of LNM in tumors of less than 2 cm in both datasets (5% and 12%, respectively), which increased with tumor size. However, the incidence of LNM in Black patients was similar in the initial and validation datasets for tumors sized less than 2 cm (23% and 21%) and 2 to 3 cm (21% and 29%). Black patients had a significantly higher incidence of LNM in tumors less than 2 cm in size in the initial and validation datasets (p < 0.01) compared with White patients. CONCLUSIONS: The current recommendation for surveillance of PNETs of less than 2 cm in size is likely based on a low rate of LNM seen in a predominantly White population. The incidence of LNM in Black patients with tumors less than 2 cm in size is clinically relevant and concerning. Current guidelines may not be universally applicable, and a more aggressive approach to resection in Black patients with small PNETs may be warranted.","output":"Are We Undertreating Black Patients with Nonfunctional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors?

The samples revealed the presence of 18 pesticides that belong to four different groups including organochlorines (OCP), organophosphorus (OPP), carbamates (Carb), and pyrethroids (Pyrth). The photocatalytic degradation of the five most abundant pesticides was studied in the presence and absence of 1% TiO2 or ZnO photocatalysts under UV irradiation at a wavelength of 306 nm. The five abundant pesticides were Atrazine (OCP), Chlorpyrifos methyl (OPP), Dimethoate (OPP), Heptachlor (OCP), and Methomyl (Carb). The results showed that photolysis of all pesticides was complete under UV radiation for irradiation times between 64-100 h. However, both photocatalysts enhanced photocatalytic degradation of the pesticides in comparison with photolysis. The pesticides were photocatalytically degraded completely within 20-24 h of irradiation. The TiO2 photocatalyst showed higher activity compared to ZnO. The organochlorine heptachlor, which is very toxic and persistent, was completely degraded within 30 h using TiO2 photocatalyst for the first time in soil.

Fatigue and cognitive impairment are amongst the most common and debilitating symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue and cognitive impairment 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis, and to characterize the inflammatory correlates and functional consequences of post-COVID-19 syndrome. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were conducted without language restrictions from database inception to June 8, 2021 on PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science, Google/Google Scholar, and select reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Primary research articles which evaluated individuals at least 12 weeks after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and specifically reported on fatigue, cognitive impairment, inflammatory parameters, and/or functional outcomes were selected. DATA EXTRACTION & SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted published summary data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool Freeman-Turkey double arcsine transformed proportions using the random-effects restricted maximum-likelihood model. MAIN OUTCOMES & MEASURES: The co-primary outcomes were the proportions of individuals reporting fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively, 12 or more weeks after COVID-19 infection. The secondary outcomes were inflammatory correlates and functional consequences of post-COVID-19 syndrome. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 10,979 studies, and 81 studies were selected for inclusion. The fatigue meta-analysis comprised 68 studies, the cognitive impairment meta-analysis comprised 43 studies, and 48 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis revealed that the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27, 0.37; p < 0.001; n = 25,268; I(2)=99.1%).

The review compared patient-related variables, length of hospital stay, wound morbidity, and costs associated with the index operation and encounters within a 6-month period. RESULTS Of the 54 patients identified, 59% underwent endoscopic repair, and 41% had an open CST repair. The patients were similar in age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of prior surgeries, active abdominal infection, defect size, operating room time, and length of hospital stay. The overall median direct costs were similar between endoscopic and open CST ($9,942 vs. $17,701; p = 0.09). No difference was detected in median operating room costs, but an approximate $7,000 difference was noted between endoscopic and open CST ($1,871 vs. $8,705; p = 0.96). The median mesh costs differed significantly between endoscopic and open CST ($733 vs. $8,415; p = 0.05) as did stapler use costs ($35 vs. $190; p = 0.002).

We adopted a socio-cultural approach to citizenship drawing on the scholarly tradition of ideological dilemmas and rhetorical psychology as well as interdisciplinary work on neoliberalism. In our analysis of over one hundred briefings and other material by the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet, we identified five interrelated constructions of the 'good citizen': the confined, the heroic, the sacrificial, the unfree and the responsible citizen. The paper maps these constructions onto the ideological dilemmas of freedom/control, passive/active citizenship and individualism/collectivism. We show that, through the rhetorical use of notions of gratefulness for citizens' sacrifice and shared responsibility, the UK government's discourse appears to challenge the dominant model of the neoliberal citizen. However, it solidifies this very same model by responsibilizing individual citizens whilst abdicating itself from responsibility.

No prospective randomized trial has tested the addition of cisplatin to single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PS2. CAPPA-2 was a multicenter, randomized phase 3 study for first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients, aged 18-70, were eligible if they had stage IV or IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or metastatic supraclavicular nodes (TNM VI edition) and adequate organ function. Patients in standard arm received gemcitabine 1200 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. Patients in experimental arm received cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. All treatments were repeated every 3 weeks, up to 4 cycles, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). To have 80% power of detecting hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, corresponding to an increase in median OS from 4.8 to 6.8 months, 285 deaths were required. The study was stopped in June 2012 after the enrolment of 57 patients, due to the slow accrual and the report of positive results from a similar study.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal study using municipality-level mortality data. METHODS: We investigated the patterns and spatial correlation of EM of men aged &#8805;75 years during the first two pandemic waves (March-April 2020 vs November 2020) of COVID-19, using the mortality data released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. EM was estimated at the municipality level to accurately detect the critical areas within the region. RESULTS: The areas that were mostly hit during the first wave of COVID-19 were generally spared by the second wave: EM of men aged &#8805;75 years in the municipality of Bergamo plummeted from +472% in March and April to -13% in November, and in Cremona the variation was from +344% to -19%. Conversely, in November 2020 EM was higher in some areas that had been protected in the first wave of the pandemic. Spatial correlation widely corroborates these findings, as large sections of the hot spots of EM detected in the first wave of the pandemic changed into cold spots in the second wave, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the specular distribution of EM between the first and second wave of the pandemic, which may entail the consequences of social distancing measures and individual behaviors, local management strategies, 'harvesting' of the frailer population and, possibly, acquired immune protection.

This unusual situation created both risks and opportunities for families. In the present study, we examined the role of parental identity as a resource for parental adaptation during this challenging period, thereby considering both parenthood experiences and parents' general mental health while also taking into account the cumulative risk to which parents were exposed (e.g., single parenthood). Furthermore, to shed light on the mechanisms behind the effects of parental identity, this study addressed the mediating role of parental satisfaction of their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. During the lockdown period in Belgium, 492 parents (88% mothers, Mage = 44 years, 63.7% in intact family, 31.2% with a university degree) completed online questionnaires on parental identity, need-based experiences, positive and negative parenthood experiences, and mental health. Several weeks earlier, these participants also rated their mental health and a variety of risks they were exposed to as part of a larger study. Results showed that a clear and self-endorsed parental identity was related to better parental adaptation, with parental need satisfaction playing a mediating role in these associations. Moreover, these associations remained significant after controlling for the prior levels of parental mental health and for cumulative risk.

METHODS Zucker diabetic fatty rats were randomized into three surgical groups: Sham, small bowel resection, and small bowel resection with sleeve gastrectomy (BRSG). Weight and fasting glucose levels were measured at randomization and monitored after surgery. Oral glucose tolerance testing was performed at baseline and 45 days after surgery to assess glucose homeostasis and peptide changes. RESULTS At baseline, all animals exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and showed no difference in weight or fasting (area under the curve) AUC(glucose). At sacrifice, Sham animals weighed more than BRSG animals (p = 0.047). At day 45, the Sham group experienced a significant increase in AUC(glucose) compared to baseline (p = 0.02), whereas there was no difference in AUC(glucose) in either surgical group at any time point: BR (p = 0.58) and BRSG (p = 0.56). Single-factor ANOVA showed a significant difference in AUC(glucose) of p = 0.004 between groups postoperatively: Sham (50,745  11,170) versus BR (23,865  432.6) (p = 0.01); Sham versus BRSG (28,710  3188.8) (p = 0.02).

As it is known that university students display behaviors different from the general population, very few studies have examined their activity participation and time allocation behavior during the pandemic. The present study investigates the changes in time allocations to sedentary, physically active, and eat-sleep activities before and during the pandemic. METHODS: The study hypothesizes that active mode (walk, bicycle) and transit users would compensate for the physical efforts by increasing physical activities at home during the lockdown. Students' perception of personal well-being, anxiety, and individual leisure during the pandemic and their impacts on time allocation decisions after controlling for demographic variables and temporal effects are also explored. A pan India behavioral data of 203 samples collected using an online survey conducted between May to July 2020, during India's lockdown phase, is used for analysis. A series of segmented analyses (using ANOVA's and Kruskal-Wallis Test) and empirical modeling (linear mixed-effect regression) were conducted based on the time use distribution. RESULTS: Findings showed that university students from low-income households and students who own a bicycle show a higher tendency to spend time in physical activities during lockdown periods. Students accessing college using active modes (before lockdown) allocate less time to sedentary and eat-sleep activities than physical activities during the lockdown period. Students' perception of Leisure items among those who use active modes is significantly different from those of private and public mode users. CONCLUSIONS: From a policy viewpoint, such investigation would help implicitly understand and publicize the health benefits of active modes and transit and encourage their use.

It is not yet fully known which symptoms of the disease are most commonly presented in patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. Our aim was to investigate the profile of patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation; what symptoms they had during the acute phase of the disease and what symptoms were still present at the start of pulmonary rehabilitation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Study included ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID patients who attended standard, in person pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients had COVID-19 disease at least four weeks before attending pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients completed questionnaires of self-reported somatic deficits during acute and post-COVID-19 stage as well as questionnaires regarding their psychological symptoms. Pulmonary function test, expiratory and inspiratory muscle strenght, hand grip strenght and six-minute walk test was performed prior and after pulmonary rehabilitation. RESULTS Study included 63 patients (32 male, 31 female), with mean age of 52.9 years. During acute COVID-19, majority of patients complained of fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgia and headache. More than 85% of patients reported pulmonary deficits during ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID-19 stage. Emotional distress and anxiety levels were significantly elevated in acute stage, while depression, anger and the need for help was not significantly elevated. All reported symptoms were significantly reduced in post-COVID-19 stage.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was suspected based on a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer and six manifestations of autoimmunity: fever, paronychia, oral ulcers, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Mastocytemia was observed on the blood smear. Although the clinical presentation of this case meets the classification criteria for SLE in humans, tick-borne disease and histopathology evaluation of the oral and cutaneous lesions would have been necessary to support a definite diagnosis of SLE. Baseline ANA titration was performed in two laboratories with conflicting results, which may reflect substrate differences used for the titration, but a false-positive result cannot be excluded. The cat received prednisolone and all clinical and laboratory abnormalities resolved after two months of treatment. Subsequent ANA titers remained positive and were not correlated to the patients clinical progression. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This report describes new findings associated with a presumptive diagnosis of SLE in a kitten, highlighting that SLE may not be ruled out even in young cats and may be associated with mastocytemia. ANA titration is part of the initial diagnostic work-up of SLE but is a non-specific test and discrepancies can be observed between laboratories. The titration of more specific antibodies such as those used in humans would be helpful to diagnose SLE. ANA titration may not correlate with clinical activity of SLE; hence, the interest of an ANA titer follow-up to establish disease control warrants further investigation.","output":"New findings associated with presumptive systemic lupus erythematosus in a kitten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some Authors recently suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should be discontinued, even temporarily, given the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant, which is known to facilitate gas exchanges. The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, available data are conflicting and some counter-intuitive findings suggest that ARBs may be beneficial, not harmful. Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. The excess angiotensin II would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation, a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin II levels, along with worsening in pulmonary function. Such detrimental effects have been blocked by ARBs in experimental models. In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors. Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited. This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"ACE-inibitori, sartani e sindrome respiratoria acuta da coronavirus 2./ [ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When conducting clinical trials under COVID-19 pandemic, protocol deviations and/or protocol violations are inevitably encountered due to possible environment change which may have an impact on the accuracy and reliability of clinical evaluation of the test treatment under investigation.

Fibrocytes are bone marrow-derived cells that traffic to injured tissues and contribute to fibrosis; hence their concentration in the peripheral blood has the potential to serve as a biomarker of lung fibrogenesis. We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that the concentration and phenotype of circulating fibrocytes in patients with ARDS predicts clinical outcomes. METHODS: For the animal studies, C57Bl/6 mice were infected with experimental Klebsiella pneumoniae in a model of acute lung injury; one-way ANOVA was used to compare multiple groups and two-way ANOVA was used to compare two groups over time. For the human study, 42 subjects with ARDS and 12 subjects with pneumonia (without ARDS) were compared to healthy controls. Chi-squared or Fishers exact test were used to compare binary outcomes. Survival data was expressed using a Kaplan-Meier curve and compared by log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to predict death. RESULTS: In mice with acute lung injury caused by Klebsiella pneumonia, there was a time-dependent increase in lung soluble collagen that correlated with sequential expansion of fibrocytes in the bone marrow, blood, and then lung compartments. Correspondingly, when compared via cross-sectional analysis, the initial concentration of blood fibrocytes was elevated in human subjects with ARDS or pneumonia as compared to healthy controls. In addition, fibrocytes from subjects with ARDS displayed an activated phenotype and on serial measurements, exhibited intermittent episodes of markedly elevated concentration over a median of 1 week. A peak concentration of circulating fibrocytes above a threshold of > 4.8  10(6) cells/mL cells correlated with mortality that was independent of age, ratio of arterial oxygen concentration to the fraction of inspired oxygen, and vasopressor requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating fibrocytes increase in a murine model of acute lung injury and elevation in the number of these cells above a certain threshold is correlated with mortality in human ARDS. Therefore, these cells may provide a useful and easily measured biomarker to predict outcomes in these patients.","output":"Circulating fibrocytes traffic to the lung in murine acute lung injury and predict outcomes in human acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Adult survivors of preterm birth without (PRE) and with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have airflow obstruction at rest and significant mechanical ventilatory constraints during exercise compared with those born at full term (CON). Do PRE/BPD have smaller airways, indexed via the dysanapsis ratio, than CON? What is the main finding and its importance? The dysanapsis ratio was significantly smaller in BPD and PRE compared with CON, with BPD having the smallest dysanapsis ratio. These data suggest that airflow obstruction in PRE and BPD might be because of smaller airways than CON. Adult survivors of very preterm birth (32 weeks gestational age) without (PRE) and with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have obstructive lung disease as evidenced by reduced expiratory airflow at rest and have significant mechanical ventilatory constraints during exercise. Airflow obstruction, in any conditions, could be attributable to several factors, including small airways. PRE and/or BPD could have smaller airways than their counterparts born at full term (CON) owing to a greater degree of dysanaptic airway development during the pre- and/or postnatal period. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare the dysanapsis ratio (DR), as an index of airway size, between PRE, BPD and CON. To do so, we calculated DR in PRE (n = 21), BPD (n = 14) and CON (n = 34) individuals and examined flow-volume loops at rest and during submaximal exercise. The DR, using multiple estimates of static recoil pressure, was significantly smaller in PRE and BPD (0.16  0.05 and 0.10  0.03 a.u.) compared with CON (0.22  0.04 a.u.; both P < 0.001) and smallest in BPD (P < 0.001). The DR was significantly correlated with peak expiratory airflow at rest (r = 0.42; P < 0.001) and the extent of expiratory flow limitation during exercise (r = 0.60; P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that PRE/BPD might have anatomically smaller airways than CON, which might help to explain their lower expiratory airflow rate at rest and during exercise and further our understanding of the consequences of preterm birth and neonatal O2 therapy.","output":"Premature birth affects the degree of airway dysanapsis and mechanical ventilatory constraints."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Underestimation of the number of cases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a constant concern worldwide. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA using realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most common method to confirm a case. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity. Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths in Mexico, accounting for the probabilities of false-negative tests. Methods: We used publicly available, national databases of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at public laboratories in Mexico between February 27 and October 31, 2020. We used the estimated probabilities of false-negative tests based on the day of clinical sample collection after symptom initiation calculated previously. With the resulting model, we estimated the corrected daily number of cases, ICU admissions, and deaths. Results: Among 2,024,822 people tested in Mexico between February 27 and October 31 with an available result, we estimated 1,248,583 (95% confidence interval 1,094,850-1,572,818) cases, compared to 902,343 cases reported with positive tests.

Understanding the pattern and the drivers of BTV-1 spread in Andalusia is critical for effective detection and control of future epidemics. A long-standing metric for quantifying the behaviour of infectious diseases is the case-reproduction ratio (R(t)), defined as the average number of secondary cases arising from a single infected case at time t (for t>0). Here we apply a method using epidemic trees to estimate the between-herd case reproduction ratio directly from epidemic data allowing the spatial and temporal variability in transmission to be described. We then relate this variability to predictors describing the hosts, vectors and the environment to better understand why the epidemic spread more quickly in some regions or periods. The R(t) value for the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia peaked in July at 4.6, at the start of the epidemic, then decreased to 2.2 by August, dropped below 1 by September (0.8), and by October it had decreased to 0.02. BTV spread was the consequence of both local transmission within established disease foci and BTV expansion to distant new areas (i.e. new foci), which resulted in a high variability in BTV transmission, not only among different areas, but particularly through time, which suggests that general control measures applied at broad spatial scales are unlikely to be effective. This high variability through time was probably due to the impact of temperature on BTV transmission, as evidenced by a reduction in the value of R(t) by 0.0041 for every unit increase (day) in the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which is itself directly dependent on temperature. Moreover, within the range of values at which BTV-1 transmission occurred in Andalusia (20.6C to 29.5C) there was a positive correlation between temperature and R(t) values, although the relationship was not linear, probably as a result of the complex relationship between temperature and the different parameters affecting BTV transmission. R(t) values for BTV-1 in Andalusia fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21C, a much higher threshold than that reported in other BTV outbreaks, such as the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe. This divergence may be explained by differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) compared those of the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus). Importantly, we found that BTV transmission (R(t) value) increased significantly in areas with higher densities of sheep. Our analysis also established that control of BTV-1 in Andalusia was complicated by the simultaneous establishment of several distant foci at the start of the epidemic, which may have been caused by several independent introductions of infected vectors from the North of Africa. We discuss the implications of these findings for BTV surveillance and control in this region of Europe.","output":"Understanding Spatio-Temporal Variability in the Reproduction Ratio of the Bluetongue (BTV-1) Epidemic in Southern Spain (Andalusia) in 2007 Using Epidemic Trees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The etiology of bipolar disorder (BD) is unknown and the neurobiological underpinnings are not fully understood Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk of BD, which may be linked through epigenetic mechanisms, including those regulated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes This study measures in vivo HDAC expression in individuals with BD for the first time using the HDAC-specific radiotracer [11C]Martinostat Eleven participants with BD and 11 age- and sex-matched control participants (CON) completed a simultaneous magnetic resonance - positron emission tomography (MR-PET) scan with [11C]Martinostat Lower [11C]Martinostat uptake was found in the right amygdala of BD compared to CON We assessed uptake in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to compare previous findings of lower uptake in the DLPFC in schizophrenia and found no group differences in BD Exploratory whole-brain voxelwise analysis showed lower [11C]Martinostat uptake in the bilateral thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, right hippocampus, and right amygdala in BD compared to CON Furthermore, regional [11C]Martinostat uptake was associated with emotion regulation in BD in fronto-limbic areas, which aligns with findings from previous structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging studies in BD Regional [11C]Martinostat uptake was associated with attention in BD in fronto-parietal and temporal regions These findings indicate a potential role of HDACs in BD pathophysiology In particular, HDAC expression levels may modulate attention and emotion regulation, which represent two core clinical features of BD","output":"In vivo human brain expression of histone deacetylases in bipolar disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the application of typical game elements in non-ludic environments has been extended.

Here we compare our open and minimally invasive Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy (MIE) experience. METHODS A prospective database of all oesophagectomies performed at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA between November 2007 and January 2011 was analysed. A total of 38 MIE and 76 open Ivor Lewis (OIE) oesophagectomies were performed for oesophageal carcinoma. Sixty-day surgical, oncological and postoperative outcomes were examined between the two groups. RESULTS Groups had similar demographics in terms of age, gender, tumour histology, clinical stage, preoperative comorbidities and neoadjuvant therapy. No difference was found with respect to adequacy of oncological resections. The median number of lymph nodes retrieved (OIE: 21, inter-quartile range (IQR): (16, 27) versus MIE: 19, IQR: (15, 28)), resection margins (OIE: 6.6% positive versus MIE: no positive margins) and 60-day mortality (OIE: 2.6% versus MIE: no deaths) were comparable. However, rates of pulmonary complications were significantly lower in the MIE group (OIE: 43.4 versus MIE: 2.6%, P < 0.001). Additionally, the median length of ICU and hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss and amount of intravenous fluids infused intraoperatively were also significantly decreased with MIE, while median operative times and the requirement for intraoperative blood transfusion were not significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified MIE as the only variable associated with a significant reduction in the rate of pulmonary complications in our study, while pre-existing pulmonary comborbidity was associated with an increased risk of pulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS Open and MIE appear equivalent with regard to early oncological outcomes. A minimally invasive approach, however, appears to lead to a significant reduction in the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications. Length of ICU and hospital stay, as well as intraoperative blood loss and intravenous fluid requirements are also reduced in the setting of MIE.

However, previous portrait matting methods were all based on identifiable portrait images. To fill the gap, we present P3M-10k in this paper, which is the first large-scale anonymized benchmark for Privacy-Preserving Portrait Matting (P3M). P3M-10k consists of 10,000 high-resolution face-blurred portrait images along with high-quality alpha mattes. We systematically evaluate both trimap-free and trimap-based matting methods on P3M-10k and find that existing matting methods show different generalization abilities under the privacy preserving training setting, i.e., training only on face-blurred images while testing on arbitrary images. Based on the gained insights, we propose a unified matting model named P3M-Net consisting of three carefully designed integration modules that can perform privacy-insensitive semantic perception and detail-reserved matting simultaneously. We further design multiple variants of P3M-Net with different CNN and transformer backbones and identify the difference in their generalization abilities. To further mitigate this issue, we devise a simple yet effective Copy and Paste strategy (P3M-CP) that can borrow facial information from public celebrity images without privacy concerns and direct the network to reacquire the face context at both data and feature levels. P3M-CP only brings a few additional computations during training, while enabling the matting model to process both face-blurred and normal images without extra effort during inference. Extensive experiments on P3M-10k demonstrate the superiority of P3M-Net over state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of P3M-CP in improving the generalization ability of P3M-Net, implying a great significance of P3M for future research and real-world applications.","output":"Rethinking Portrait Matting with Privacy Preserving"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The revolutionary changes in the creation of platform-type models and strategies within the framework of Industry 4.0 have created new potential for the development of the economy and transport.

For this purpose, a mathematical model is constructed and proposed by dividing the whole population into sensible and suitable compartments. The study captures the dates February 01 till May 15, 2021. For the control of the spread of disease, vaccination and infection rates are compared and calculated. During calculations and comparison, MatLab software is used. All of the data that are used are taken from the Ministry of Health. The effect of parameters is examined with sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, with this analysis, values of parameters are obtained. Afterwards, by using the constructed model, the effect of vaccine on infected individuals is analyzed separately. As a result, it is concluded that the studied part of the island is late for the control of the disease via vaccine. This can be explained by two main reasons;vaccinating the people that are not in mobility most of the time (aged people and people with chronic diseases) and getting the vaccine late. Hence, the results showed that this rate and distribution of vaccines would not be enough to control the pandemic on the island.","output":"Sensitivity Analysis of COVID-19 in Mediterranean Island"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) is a key factor in virus-induced down-regulation of host gene expression. In infected cells, nsp1 engages in a multi-pronged mechanism to inhibit host gene expression by binding to the 40S ribosome to block the assembly of translationally competent ribosome, and then inducing endonucleolytic cleavage and the degradation of host mRNAs. Here, we report a previously undetected mechanism by which nsp1 exploits the nuclear pore complex and disrupts nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of biomolecules. We identified members of the nuclear pore complex from nsp1-associated protein assembly and found that expression of nsp1 in HEK cells disrupts Nup93 localization around the nuclear envelope without triggering proteolytic degradation, while the nuclear lamina remains unperturbed. Consistent with its role in host shutoff, nsp1 alters the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of a RNA binding protein, nucleolin. Our results suggest that nsp1, alone, can regulate multiple steps of gene expression including nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.","output":"SARS coronavirus protein nsp1 disrupts localization of Nup93 from the nuclear pore complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 situation had escalated into an unprecedented global crisis in just a few weeks.

DESIGN: Simulations of provisional mortality data. SETTING: US and 16 other high income countries in 2010-18 and 2020, by sex, including an analysis of US outcomes by race and ethnicity. POPULATION: Data for the US and for 16 other high income countries from the National Center for Health Statistics and the Human Mortality Database, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth, and at ages 25 and 65, by sex, and, in the US only, by race and ethnicity. Analysis excluded 2019 because life table data were not available for many peer countries. Life expectancy in 2020 was estimated by simulating life tables from estimated age specific mortality rates in 2020 and allowing for 10% random error. Estimates for 2020 are reported as medians with fifth and 95th centiles. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2018, the gap in life expectancy between the US and the peer country average increased from 1.88 years (78.66 v 80.54 years, respectively) to 3.05 years (78.74 v 81.78 years). Between 2018 and 2020, life expectancy in the US decreased by 1.87 years (to 76.87 years), 8.5 times the average decrease in peer countries (0.22 years), widening the gap to 4.69 years. Life expectancy in the US decreased disproportionately among racial and ethnic minority groups between 2018 and 2020, declining by 3.88, 3.25, and 1.36 years in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White populations, respectively. In Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, reductions in life expectancy were 18 and 15 times the average in peer countries, respectively. Progress since 2010 in reducing the gap in life expectancy in the US between Black and White people was erased in 2018-20; life expectancy in Black men reached its lowest level since 1998 (67.73 years), and the longstanding Hispanic life expectancy advantage almost disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: The US had a much larger decrease in life expectancy between 2018 and 2020 than other high income nations, with pronounced losses among the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations. A longstanding and widening US health disadvantage, high death rates in 2020, and continued inequitable effects on racial and ethnic minority groups are likely the products of longstanding policy choices and systemic racism.","output":"Effect of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 on life expectancy across populations in the USA and other high income countries: simulations of provisional mortality data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe mobility restrictions imposed countrywide by authorities of Chile in response to the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have impacted all areas of activities Major difficulties began in March 2020, with partial quarantines in the capital city, which later extended to other cities in the country, and it soon transformed in total confinement We examine the evolution of the pandemic and its consequences on the field and headquarters operations of the National Seismological Centre (CSN), as remote stations could not be visited to carry out maintenance work Several indicators, as a function of time, such as station operability percentage, timely reports, and ability to deliver requested information, reveal some negative impact on the uptime of stations but not in the capability of the CSN to fulfill its mission, which is to deliver timely seismic information to emergency services The largest event in the country within this period took place on 3 June 2020, activating in a timely manner, the new tools on finite-fault modeling being developed within the center ?

Understanding the causes and the extent of water vulnerability is required for developing effective strategies for water insecurities. This study attempts to assess the water vulnerability across different wards of a touristic city of Himalaya-Nainital using IPCC approach considering the three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Seven indicators, mostly spatial, i.e. edaphic (aspect, elevation) and climatic (land surface temperature) besides some water infrastructural (distance to water distribution) and population, were considered for development of vulnerability index using Analytical Hierarchy Process for assigning weights. These indicators were simple to extract and easy to obtain and mostly available from secondary sources and were capable to account the variability at micro-level. Moreover, the current adaptation mechanisms for water security were also derived through conducting surveys by randomly selecting households across the wards. Staff House and Harinagar wards were the most vulnerable. The survey results that the adaptation mechanism should be managed at individual and organization level. Policy measures such as optimum use of water, grey water recycling, spring rejuvenation, rain water harvesting, and leakage proof infrastructure with intervention of new technologies, may be adopted and implemented for reducing the water vulnerability in the city along with the public participation.

Evolutionary adaptations would have been required to survive the elevated body temperatures during flight.

Basal expression level of major HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90) is significantly higher in two different bat species compared to other mammals. This HSP expression could be a bat-unique, key factor to modulate cellular stress and death. Consequently, bat cells survive prolonged heat treatment, along with other stress stimuli, in a HSP-dependent manner, whereas other mammalian cells succumbed. This suggests HSP expression in bats could be an important adaption to intrinsic metabolic stresses like flight and therefore an important model to study stress resilience and longevity in general.

RdRP simulations in its apo, NTP-bound, and analogue-bound form have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were, favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The conformational flexibility of the RdRP molecule has been explored using principal component (PCA) and Markov state modeling (MSM) analysis. PCA inferred the presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of RdRP. Inter-domain distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent RNA template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553, and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the analogues. MSM analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations explored by the RdRP. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template entry site.

There are various methods of treatment for angina. Lifestyle modification and pharmacological management are considered as conservative treatments. If these medications do not result in the resolution of pain, more invasive approaches are an option, like coronary revascularization. Refractory angina (RA) is differentiated from acute or chronic angina based on the persistence of symptoms despite conventional therapies. Overall, the prevalence of RA is estimated to be 5%-15% in patients with coronary artery disease, which can account for up to 1,500,000 current cases and 100,000 new cases in the United States per year. Spinal cord stimulation treatment is a viable option for patients who are suffering from RA pain and are either not candidates for revascularization surgery or are currently not being well managed on more traditional treatments.

The majority of infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild enteric disease. However, approximately 5 % of cases develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a systemic disease that is a frequent cause of death in young cats. In this study, we report the complete coding genome sequences of six FCoVs: three from faecal samples from healthy cats and three from tissue lesion samples from cats with confirmed FIP. The six samples were obtained over a period of 8 weeks at a single-site cat rescue and rehoming centre in the UK. We found amino acid differences located at 44 positions across an alignment of the six virus translatomes and, at 21 of these positions, the differences fully or partially discriminated between the genomes derived from the faecal samples and the genomes derived from the tissue lesion samples. In this study, two amino acid differences fully discriminated the two classes of genomes: these were both located in the S2 domain of the virus surface glycoprotein gene. We also identified deletions in the 3c protein ORF of genomes from two of the FIP samples.

It has strong foundations rooted in over a century of discoveries in the field of virology and recent advances in molecular biology and sequencing technologies. Historically, most studies have deconstructed the concept of viruses into a simplified perception of viral agents as mere pathogens, which demerits the scope of large-scale viromic analyses. Viruses are, in fact, much more than regular parasites. They are by far the most dynamic and abundant entity and the greatest killers on the planet, as well as the most effective geo-transforming genetic engineers and resource recyclers, acting on all life strata in any habitat. Yet, most of this uncanny viral world remains vastly unexplored to date, greatly hindered by the bewildering complexity inherent to such studies and the methodological and conceptual limitations. Viromic studies are just starting to address some of these issues but they still lag behind microbial metagenomics. In recent years, however, higher-throughput analysis and resequencing have rekindled interest in a field that is just starting to show its true potential. In this review, we take a look at the scientific and technological developments that led to the advent of viral and bacterial metagenomics with a particular, but not exclusive, focus on human viromics from an ecological perspective.

With the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, several governments and institutions struggled to have satisfactory, fast, and accurate decision-making in a wide, dispersed, and global environment. In the current literature, we found that the most common related challenges include delay (network latency), software scalability, health data privacy, and global patient identification. We propose to design, implement and evaluate a healthcare software architecture focused on a global vaccination strategy, considering healthcare privacy issues, latency mitigation, support of scalability, and the use of a global identification. We have designed and implemented a prototype of a healthcare software called Fog-Care, evaluating performance metrics like latency, throughput and send rate of a hypothetical scenario where a global integrated vaccination campaign is adopted in wide dispensed locations (Brazil, USA, and United Kingdom), with an approach based on blockchain, unique identity, and fog computing technologies. The evaluation results demonstrate that the minimum latency spends less than 1 second to run, and the average of this metric grows in a linear progression, showing that a decentralized infrastructure integrating blockchain, global unique identification, and fog computing are feasible to make a scalable solution for a global vaccination campaign within other hospitals, clinics, and research institutions around the world and its data-sharing issues of privacy, and identification.

Chest CT scan plays an important role in the early diagnosis and management of respiratory complications due to nCovid19. Clinicians should be aware about the indications for the CT scan of the thorax, timing of investigation, and limitations of CT. Main body of abstract Chest CT scan is indicated in patients with moderate to severe respiratory symptoms and pretest probability of nCovid19 infection, when RT-PCR test results are negative, and in patients for whom an RTPCR test is not performed or not readily available. When a rapid antigen test is negative and an RT-PCR test report takes time, CT can be used in seriously ill patients to decide whether it is COVID or not. For patients who are dependent on oxygen even after 2 weeks, CT may help to show the extent of lung involvement and predict long-term prognosis. CT may be done to exclude nCovid19 pneumonia. For patients with high risk for nCovid19 who require an immediate diagnosis to rule out lung involvement, CT can be done. A normal CT excludes nCovid19 pneumonia. CT scan is required in confirmed cases of nCovid19 pneumonia when complications are suspected clinically. These include pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumothorax, mediastinal/surgical emphysema, bacterial pneumonia, and unexplained deterioration with new shadows in chest X-ray. CT pulmonary angiogram is indicated when pulmonary embolism is suspected, and in other cases, plain CT should be done. In pre-operative cases where emergency surgery is required, nCovid19 disease is suspected clinically, and RT-PCR report awaited or not available, CT thorax can be done. Conclusion: CT scan is useful for early diagnosis of lung involvement, detection complications, triaging of cases, risk stratification, and preoperative evaluation in select cases. CT scan should be done only when there is a definite indication so to reduce radiation hazards and to reduce health care expenditure. Normal CT excludes nCovid19 lung involvement, but the patient may have upper respiratory involvement which may progress later to involve lungs.","output":"Role of CT scan thorax in nCovid-19-a case-based review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical predictors of COVID\\\\19 severity and bleeding in ACTIV\\\\4B[Image: see text]","output":"Clinical predictors of COVID\\\\19 severity and bleeding in the ACTIV\\\\4B COVID\\\\19 outpatient thrombosis prevention trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To evaluate vascular changes in the early period after COVID-19 infection and at a 6-month follow-up Methods This study included 50 eyes of 25 patients who had been hospitalized for PCR-positive COVID-19 infection and 50 eyes of 25 healthy individuals All subjects underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) using a 6  6 macular protocol in the early period after hospital discharge and 6 months later Foveal vessel density (VD) and parafoveal VD values were measured from 4 quadrants (superior, inferior, nasal, temporal) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP) Choriocapillaris (CC) flow area and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were also measured The OCT-A measurements of the patient group were compared both between time points and with the control group at each time point Results COVID-19 patients showed lower VD values than control subjects in all parafoveal quadrants of both the SCP (superior, p=0 01;inferior, p=0 048;nasal, p=0 003;temporal, p=0 048) and the DCP (superior, p=0 001;inferior, p=0 011;nasal, p=0 012;temporal, p=0 018) at the initial checkup and in all parafoveal quadrants of the SCP (superior, p=0 0001;inferior, p=0 007;nasal, p=0 001;temporal, p=0 017) and in 2 of the parafoveal quadrants of the DCP (superior, p=0 003;inferior, p=0 016) at the 6-month follow-up CC flow area values were significantly lower at the 6-month follow-up compared with the initial examination (p=0 044) Conclusion It is important to perform appropriate follow-up for COVID-19 patients as retinal vascular flow changes may persist in the long term","output":"Evaluation Of Early And Late Covid-19-Induced Vascular Changes With Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A coalition of registered nurses with the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA), along with patients, families, advocates and elected officials who have been fighting for the preservation of mental health beds across Western Massachusetts, has launched a new campaign, ?Mental Health is Public Health,? to save essential inpatient psychiatric services, according to a March 16 news release The effort comes as Trinity Health plans to close 74 pediatric and adult psychiatric beds at Providence Behavioral Health Hospital in Holyoke;Baystate Health seeks the closure of all its mental health beds in Greenfield, Palmer and Westfield;and COVID-19 places additional pressure on already-strained emergency departments and other hospital services throughout the region ?These proposed closures would devastate an already-strained mental health system,? said Cindy Chaplin, RN at Providence and co-chair of the MNA Bargaining Committee ?Right now, we need to maximize capacity in emergency departments and other hospital units, not decrease services When everyone else in Massachusetts agrees we should be making it easier for patients to get high-quality mental healthcare, Trinity Health is going in the opposite direction ?","output":"Massachusetts coalition launches campaign to preserve bed access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus pandemic public health emergency begins to ebb in the United States, policymakers and providers need to evaluate how the addiction treatment system functioned during the public health emergency and draw lessons for future emergencies.

These factors can contribute to toxic stress, which has been shown to negatively impact childrens health. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this project was to partner with community organizations to obtain a baseline needs assessment from families in Maywood regarding sources of toxic stress and to identify interventions of interest. METHODS: In total, 75 anonymous surveys were collected from the Loyola Outpatient Center Pediatric Clinic and a Maywood community center. Survey responses were statistically analyzed in order to determine toxic stressors most commonly impacting families in Maywood as well as interventions of most interest to the community. RESULTS: There were 78 respondents for a response rate of approximately 71%. The most common stressors were smoking in the home (33.3%), food insecurity (29.5%), and exposure to violence (26.9%). In this sample, Black respondents were 11.5 times more likely than non-Black respondents to report that their child was exposed to violence in the community C even after controlling for concern about their childs behavior which served as a surrogate measure of the childs exposure to toxic stress (P = 0.001). Further, those living with food insecurity were 7.40 times more likely to report that access to food and transportation vouchers were important (P < .001). For every 1-point increase in the total toxic stress score, respondents were 1.35 times more likely to report that increasing access to mental health resources was important to them, though this was not significant (P = .10). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that toxic stressors, health risks and unmet social needs are prevalent in the Maywood community, which puts local children at risk for future adverse health outcomes.

Moreover, general anaesthesia may contribute to serious conditions or adverse events such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium. To understand the basic mechanisms of general anaesthesia, this project aims to study and compare possible de novo neuroplastic changes induced by two commonly used types of general anaesthesia, i.e. inhalation anaesthesia by sevoflurane and intravenously administered anaesthesia by propofol. In addition, we wish to to explore possible associations between neuroplastic changes, neuropsychological adverse effects and subjective changes in fatigue and well-being. METHODS: This is a randomised, participant- and assessor-blinded, cross-over clinical trial. Thirty healthy volunteers (male:female ratio 1:1) will be randomised to general anaesthesia by either sevoflurane or propofol. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain will be performed before and after general anaesthesia and repeated after 1 and 8 days. Each magnetic resonance imaging session will be accompanied by cognitive testing and questionnaires on fatigue and well-being. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks, the volunteers will receive the other type of anaesthetic (sevoflurane or propofol), followed by the same series of tests. Primary outcomes: changes in T1-weighted 3D anatomy and diffusion tensor imaging. Secondary outcomes: changes in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, fatigue, well-being, cognitive function, correlations between magnetic resonance imaging findings and the clinical outcomes (questionnaires and cognitive function). Exploratory outcomes: changes in cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism, lactate, and response to visual stimuli.

Objective: To evaluate the risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with not-infected, concomitant pregnant individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study that took place from March to October 2020, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-infected women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge. Exposures: COVID-19 in pregnancy determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measures were indices of (maternal and severe neonatal/perinatal) morbidity and mortality; the individual components of these indices were secondary outcomes. Models for these outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity. Results: A total of 706 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1424 pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled, all with broadly similar demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [6.1] years). Overweight early in pregnancy occurred in 323 women (48.6%) with COVID-19 diagnosis and 554 women (40.2%) without. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at higher risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia (relative risk [RR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.43), severe infections (RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.63-7.01), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10), maternal mortality (RR, 22.3; 95% CI, 2.88-172), preterm birth (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94), medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.56-2.51), severe neonatal morbidity index (RR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.69-4.18), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.66-2.75). Fever and shortness of breath for any duration was associated with increased risk of severe maternal complications (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.92-3.40) and neonatal complications (RR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.11-11.69). Asymptomatic women with COVID-19 diagnosis remained at higher risk only for maternal morbidity (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54) and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.01-2.63). Among women who tested positive (98.1% by real-time polymerase chain reaction), 54 (13%) of their neonates tested positive. Cesarean delivery (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.91) but not breastfeeding (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.66-1.85) was associated with increased risk for neonatal test positivity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with consistent and substantial increases in severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications when pregnant women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis were compared. The findings should alert pregnant individuals and clinicians to implement strictly all the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures.","output":"Maternal and Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality Among Pregnant Women With and Without COVID-19 Infection: The INTERCOVID Multinational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose- Previous studies have reported less favorable outcome and less effect of endovascular treatment (EVT) after ischemic stroke in women than in men. Our aim was to study the influence of sex on outcome and on the effect of EVT for ischemic stroke in recent randomized trials on EVT. Methods- We used data from 7 randomized controlled trials on EVT within the HERMES collaboration. The primary outcome was 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale). We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between men and women. With ordinal logistic regression, we evaluated the association between EVT and 90-day functional outcome for men and women separately, adjusted for potential confounders. We tested for interaction between sex and EVT. Results- We included 1762 patients in the analyses, of whom 833 (47%) were women. Women were older (median, 70 versus 66 years; P<0.001), were smoking less often (30% versus 44%; P<0.001), and had higher collateral grades (grade 3: 46% versus 35%; P<0.001) than men. Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) at 90 days was reached by 318 women (39%) and 364 men (39%). The effect of EVT on the ordinal modified Rankin Scale was similar in women (adjusted common odds ratio [acOR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.47-3.07) and men (acOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.59-2.96), with a P for interaction of 0.926.

However, the function of the (G)-G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs in the NNS RNA virus Newcastle disease virus (NDV) remains unclear. We observed G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs in all NDV genotypes. By using the infection cloning system of NDV rSG10 strain, recombinant NDVs with a single amino acid mutated to alanine in one motif (G-G-D or K-D-K-E) were rescued. The intracerebral pathogenicity index and mean death time assay results revealed that the G-G-D motif and K-D-K-E motif attenuate the virulence of NDV to various degrees. The replication, transcription, and translation levels of the K-D-K-E motif-mutant strains were significantly higher than those of wild-type virus owing to their altered regulation of the affinity between nucleocapsid protein and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E. When the infection dose was changed from a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 to an MOI of 0.01, the cell-to-cell spread abilities of G-G-D- and K-D-K-E-mutant strains were reduced, according to plaque assay and dynamic indirect immunofluorescence assay results. Finally, we found that NDV strains with G-G-D or K-D-K-E motif mutations had less pathogenicity in 3-week-old specific-pathogen-free chickens than wild-type NDV. Therefore, these methyltransferase motifs can affect virulence by regulating the translation and cell-to-cell spread abilities of NDV. This work provides a feasible approach for generating vaccine candidates for viruses with methyltransferase motifs. IMPORTANCE Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an important pathogen that is widespread globally. Research on its pathogenic mechanism is an important means of improving prevention and control efforts. Our study found that a deficiency in its methyltransferase motifs (G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs) can attenuate NDV and revealed the molecular mechanism by which these motifs affect pathogenicity, which provides a new direction for the development of NDV vaccines. In addition to the (G)-G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs of many nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses, similar motifs have been found in dengue virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This suggests that such motifs may be present in more viruses. Our finding also provides a molecular basis for the discovery and functional study of (G)-G-G-D and K-D-K-E motifs of other viruses.","output":"Mutations in the Methyltransferase Motifs of L Protein Attenuate Newcastle Disease Virus by Regulating Viral Translation and Cell-to-Cell Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sensitive assays are essential for the accurate identification of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

COVID-19 started in the city of Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and spread to the whole world in a short time. This infection caused millions of infected cases globally and still poses a disturbing situation for the people. Recently, some mathematical models have been constructed for better understanding of the coronavirus infection. Mostly, these models are based on classical integer-order derivative using real numbers which cannot capture the fading memory. So, at the current position, it is a challenge for the world to control the spreading of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to utilize fuzzy logic to control the transmission and spreading of COVID-19. Here, we develop three new methods such as the generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric (GIVIFEWG) operator, the generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted geometric (GIVIFEOWG) operator, and the generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein hybrid geometric (GIVIFEHG) operator. Intuitionistic fuzzy information for interval-valued is the moral and decent method to precise the fuzzy information for judgment or decision and Einstein operations are the best approximations, and the generalized aggregation operators are a generalization of most aggregation operators so, in these notes, we can spread the Einstein operations to aggregate the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information based on the generalized aggregation operators. At the end of the paper, an illustration of the emergency situation of COVID-19 is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the suggested approach, showing the feasibility and reliability of the new methods.

Results: Dry eye syndrome is one of the most common eye conditions worldwide in a daily medical practice. The ocular manifestation of COVID can resemble DES. It is recommended that during properly conducted diagnostics, the patient should be properly classified in terms of severity of symptoms. A diet rich in vitamins and flavonoids and the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids are common recommendations for both DES treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This in particular validates the appropriate use of these substances. Fatty acids such as -lipoic or -linolenic are proven to have the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. Conclusions: In the era of pandemia the ocular manifestation and transmission of COVID has to be always considered since every patient could be a coronavirus carrier.

Meanwhile, in the context of lockdowns and other measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, the internet has surged as a web-based resource for health information. Under these conditions, social question-and-answer communities (SQACs) are playing an increasingly important role in improving public health literacy. There is great theoretical and practical significance in exploring the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model that could analyze the influence factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. Particularly, we tried to test the moderating effects that different demographic characteristics had on the variables' influences. METHODS: This study was conducted by administering a web-based questionnaire survey and analyzing the responses from a final total of 598 valid questionnaires after invalid data were cleaned. By using structural equation modelling, the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information were analyzed. The moderating effects of variables were verified via hierarchical regression. RESULTS: Performance expectation (?=.282; P<.001), social influence (?=.238; P=.02), and facilitating conditions (?=.279; P=.002) positively affected users' willingness to adopt health information, whereas effort expectancy (P=.79) and perceived risk (P=.41) had no significant effects. Gender had a significant moderating effect in the structural equation model (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information was evidently affected by multiple factors, such as performance expectation, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The structural equation model proposed in this study has a good fitting degree and good explanatory power for users' willingness to adopt health information.

However, the impact of SHS on the male reproductive system, particularly on the regulation of genes and molecular pathways that govern sperm production, maturation, and functions remains largely understudied. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of SHS on the testis transcriptome in a validated mouse model. METHODS: Adult male mice were exposed to SHS (5 h/day, 5 days/week for 4 months) as compared to controls (clean air-exposed). RNA-seq analysis was performed on the testis of SHS-exposed mice and controls. Variant discovery and plink association analyses were also conducted to detect exposure-related transcript variants in SHS-treated mice. RESULTS: Exposure of mice to SHS resulted in the aberrant expression of 131 testicular genes. Whilst approximately two thirds of the differentially expressed genes were protein-coding, the remaining (30.5%) comprised noncoding elements, mostly lncRNAs (19.1%). Variant discovery analysis identified a homozygous frameshift variant that is statistically significantly associated with SHS exposure (P = 7.744e-06) and is generated by retention of a short intron within Pde1a, a key regulator of spermatogenesis. Notably, this SHS-associated intron variant harbors an evolutionarily conserved, premature termination codon (PTC) that disrupts the open reading frame of Pde1a, presumably leading to its degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. DISCUSSION: SHS alters the expression of genes involved in molecular pathways that are crucial for normal testis development and function. Preferential targeting of lncRNAs in the testis of SHS-exposed mice is especially significant considering their crucial role in the spatial and temporal modulation of spermatogenesis. Equally important is our discovery of a novel homozygous frameshift variant that is exclusively and significantly associated with SHS-exposure and is likely to represent a safeguard mechanism to regulate transcription of Pde1a and preserve normal testis function during harmful exposure to environmental agents.","output":"Secondhand smoke affects reproductive functions by altering the mouse testis transcriptome, and leads to select intron retention in Pde1a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One IBV isolate, SC021202, was isolated from the kidneys of the infected young chickens by inoculating embryonated eggs, and its morphology, physiochemical and haemagglutonating properties were detected.

We assessed associations between various social network aspects and practicing behavior to prevent respiratory infectious diseases. METHODS: We analyzed baseline-data (2019) from the SaNAE-cohort on social networks and health, collected by an online questionnaire in Dutch community-dwelling people aged 40-99 years. Outcome was the number of preventive behaviors in past two months [range 0-4]. Associations between network aspects were tested using ordinal regression analyses, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Of 5,128 participants (mean age 63; 54% male), 94% regularly washed hands with water and soap, 55% used only paper (not cloth) handkerchiefs/tissues; 19% touched their face as little as possible; 39% kept distance from people with respiratory infectious disease symptoms; median score of behaviors was 2. Mean network size was 11 (46% family; 27% friends); six network members were contacted exclusively in-person and two exclusively via phone/internet. Participants received informational, emotional, and practical support from four, six, and two network members, respectively. Independently associated with more preventive behaviors were: 'strong relationships', i.e., large share of friends and aspects related to so called 'weak relationships', a larger share of distant living network members, higher number of members with whom there was exclusively phone/internet contact, and more network members providing informational support. Club membership and a larger share of same-aged network members were inversely associated. CONCLUSION: Friends ('strong' relationships) may play an important role in the adoption of infection-preventive behaviors. So may 'weak relationships', e.g. geographically more distant network members, who may provide informational support as via non-physical modes of contact.

Within this context, the present review systematically introduced the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs); reviewed the current research status of different nanocarriers in the treatment of respiratory diseases, including liposomes, solid lipid nanocarriers, polymeric nanocarriers, dendrimers, inorganic nanocarriers and protein nanocarriers; and discussed the main advantages and limitations of therapeutic nanomedicine in this field. The application of nanotechnology overcomes drug inherent deficiencies to a certain extent, and provides unlimited potential for the development of drugs to treat respiratory diseases. However, most of the related research work is in the preclinical experimental stage and safety assessment is still a challenging task. Future studies are needed to focus on the performance modification, molecular mechanism and potential toxicity of therapeutic nanomedicine.","output":"Application of nanotechnology in drug delivery systems for respiratory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is our great pleasure to thank all authors for submitting and presenting their manuscripts to the 1st International Conference on Biomass Utilization and Sustainable Energy 2020, organised by the Centre of Excellence for Biomass Utilization, Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP). This virtual conference was held online from 15 to 16 December 2020 via the GoogleMeet platform, and was officiated by the Vice Chancellor of Universiti Malaysia Perlis. The virtual platform was chosen in the first place due to travel restrictions and safety reasons during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we ensured that this platform is as good as any face-to-face conference as all plenary sessions were open to every participants to build efficient research networks. In the spirit of knowledge sharing, the 2 Keynote sessions were made live via the official Facebook of Universiti Malaysia Perlis. Our conference participants represented Malaysia, Philippines, Nepal and Indonesia. Keep the network growing! We have seen global scenarios of environmental pollution resulting from burning of agricultural wastes. Also, almost all biodiversity is not plastic-free today, and plastics are not renewable. Thus this brings us to the theme of the conference this year, which was Biomass Innovation for Sustainable Development. This theme has been chosen in view of the current revolution and rapid developments in the field of biomass utilization. With breakthrough research and novel findings, agricultural wastes can be made directly into valuable chemicals and products with an increase in value. A number of 117 papers were published and organised around broad subdisciplines such as such as sustainable biomass resources for decarbonising the economy, biomass conversion technologies for bioenergy, biomass conversion to intermediates and products, bioeconomy sustainability, impacts and policies, bioenergy integration and many more. A total of 16 plenary virtual sessions were conducted with 79 oral presentations (15 minutes presentation and 5 minutes Q&A) and 42 posters.

Although TSLP has been shown to be produced mainly by airway epithelial cells, the regulation of epithelial TSLP expression has not been extensively studied. We investigated the expression of TSLP in cytokine- or TLR ligand-treated normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). The mRNA for TSLP was significantly up-regulated by stimulation with IL-4 (5.5-fold) and IL-13 (5.3-fold), weakly up-regulated by TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, and IFN-beta, and not affected by IFN-gamma in NHBE. TSLP mRNA was only significantly up-regulated by the TLR3 ligand (dsRNA) among the TLR ligands tested (66.8-fold). TSLP was also induced by in vitro infection with rhinovirus. TSLP protein was detected after stimulation with dsRNA (120 +/- 23 pg/ml). The combination of TNF-alpha and IL-4 produced detectable levels of TSLP protein (40 +/- 13 pg/ml). In addition, TSLP was synergistically enhanced by a combination of IL-4 and dsRNA (mRNA; 207-fold, protein; 325 +/- 75 pg/ml). The induction of TSLP by dsRNA was dependent upon NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) signaling via TLR3 as indicated by a study with small interfering RNA. The potent topical glucocorticoid fluticasone propionate significantly suppressed dsRNA-dependent TSLP production in NHBE. These results suggest that the expression of TSLP is induced in airway epithelial cells by stimulation with the TLR3 ligand and Th2 cytokines and that this response is suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment. This implies that respiratory viral infection and the recruitment of Th2 cytokine producing cells may amplify Th2 inflammation via the induction of TSLP in the asthmatic airway.","output":"TLR3- and Th2 cytokine-dependent production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin in human airway epithelial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, novel cases of pneumonia were reported for the 1st time in Wuhan, Hubei, China A novel virus of the big family of coronavirus (COV) was identified as the pathogen, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) The disease is called COV Disease-19 and then SARS-COV 2 The infectious disease has spread worldwide with major number of patients in China, Italy, Spain, France, and the USA On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic Morbidity and mortality of the disease cannot yet estimate but have already seen that lethality appears to be particularly higher in older patients The aim of this article is to present a characteristic clinical picture as case report SARS-COV 2 pneumonia and to provide an overview of the existing literature","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 interstitial bilateral pneumonia: A case report and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An effective response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires a better understanding of the biology of the infection and the identification of validated biomarker profiles that would increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of COVID-19 testing.

Despite geographical location and distance still being major barriers for scientific collaboration, little is known about whether high-impact collaborations are similarly constrained by geography compared to collaborations of average impact. To address this question, we analyze Web of Science (WoS) data on international collaboration between global leader cities in science production. We report an increasing intensity of international city-city collaboration and find that average distance of collaboration of the strongest connections has slightly increased, but distance decay has remained stable over the last three decades. However, high-impact collaborations span large distances by following similar distance decay. This finding suggests that a larger geographical reach of research collaboration should be aimed for to support high-impact science. The creation of the European Research Area (ERA) represents an effective action that has deepened intracontinental research collaborations and the position of the European Union (EU) in global science. Yet, our results provide new evidence that global scientific leaders are not sufficiently collaborative in carrying out their big science projects.","output":"Exploring the changing geographical pattern of international scientific collaborations through the prism of cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moral preferences pervade many aspects of our lives, dictating how we ought to behave, whom we can marry and even what we eat. Despite their relevance, one fundamental question remains unanswered: where do individual moral preferences come from? It is often thought that all types of preferences reflect properties of domain-general neural decision mechanisms that employ a common neural currency to value choice options in many different contexts. This view, however, appears at odds with the observation that many humans consider it intuitively wrong to employ the same scale to compare moral value (e.g. of a human life) with material value (e.g. of money). In this paper, we directly test if moral subjective values are represented by similar neural processes as financial subjective values. In a study combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a novel behavioral paradigm, we identify neural representations of the subjective values of human lives or financial payoffs by means of structurally identical computational models. Correlating isomorphic model variables from both domains with brain activity reveals specific patterns of neural activity that selectively represent values in the moral (right temporo-parietal junction) or financial (ventral-medial prefrontal cortex) domain. Intriguingly, our findings show that human lives and money are valued in (at least partially) distinct neural currencies, supporting theoretical proposals that human moral behavior is guided by processes that are distinct from those underlying behavior driven by personal material benefit.","output":"Neuro-computational foundations of moral preferences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Antenatal Care (ANC) services are a prime focus of the National Health Mission (NHM) of the Government of India, with emphasis on promoting maternal and child health. The services are designed to reach villages with the appointment of Frontline Health Workers (FLHWs) and the establishment of a network of health centres at the primary level for uninterrupted service delivery. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the outcomes of the national lockdown from late March to June 2020 the decisions to access these services were impacted. Methods: Using a qualitative design, data were collected through 12 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with pregnant women and 17 IDIs with frontline health workers in the selected six districts under study. The narratives were analysed using inductive coding in Atlas.ti. Results: Pregnant women, most of whom belonged to poor and marginalised groups, were left with limited access to health centres and FLHWs. Respondents from the study areas of rural Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh extensively reported concerns stemming from the lockdown that influenced their decision around accessing ANC services . These included anxieties around meeting their families daily needs due to a loss of livelihood (in particular, abject food insecurity), inability to access healthcare, and a sense of mistrust in public health systems and functionaries. All of these, coupled with the real threat to health posed by COVID-19, threw their plans for pregnancy and delivery into jeopardy. Conclusion: This study identified a number of behavioural, social and structural factors deeply entrenched in the communities, which resulted in confusion and anxiety, leaving pregnant women and FLHWs feeling hapless and helpless. To ensure ANC services in times of crisis, strategies to address the behavioural, social and structural concerns and place ANC services as essential services in the study area and in similar contexts need to take into account the factors identified by this study.","output":"Accessing Antenatal Care (ANC) services during the COVID-19 First Wave - Insights into decision-making process from rural India (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to assess changes in sleep pattern and their influence on people's daily life and emotion during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Historically, serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated. Evidence from the literature points towards the serotonin receptor 2A gene (HTR2A) as a primary candidate. Our meta-analysis investigated whether polymorphisms in HTR2A are associated with OCD or its subtypes, based on sex and age of onset. METHODS: Studies employing case-control or family-based designs were systematically searched, and those meeting eligibility underwent quality assessment, resulting in 18 studies. A random-effects meta-analysis using standard inverse-variance weighting to compute odds ratio (OR) was conducted. To examine sensitivity, results were also obtained using a more conservative statistical method. RESULTS: Three HTR2A variants were identified: T102C, G-1438A, and C516T. T102C and G-1438A were analyzed together due to strong linkage disequilibrium, where the 102T allele co-occurs with -1438A allele. Results reported as OR [95%CI] showed that the T/A allele were significantly associated with OCD, 1.14 [1.01, 1.29]. After stratification, results remained significant for females, 1.20 [1.00, 1.45], and early-onset OCD, 1.27 [1.02, 1.58], but not males, 1.06 [0.91, 1.23]. No associations were found for late-onset OCD, 0.98 [0.70, 1.37], or C516T, 1.22 [0.14, 10.37], but conclusions cannot be drawn from two studies. LIMITATIONS: Associations no longer reached significance with the conservative statistical approach. HTR2A alone cannot explain OCD complexity and limited samples reporting genetic data according to subtypes.

As dependency on critical services provided by software systems grows globally, a potential security threat in such systems poses higher and higher risks (e.g. economical damage, a threat to human life, criminal activity). Finding potential security vulnerabilities at the code level automatically is a very popular approach to aid security testing. However, most of the methods based on machine learning and statistical models stop at listing potentially vulnerable code parts and leave their validation and mitigation to the developers. Automatic program repair could fill this gap by automatically generating vulnerability mitigation code patches. Nonetheless, it is still immature, especially in targeting security-relevant fixes. In this work, we try to establish a path towards automatic vulnerability fix generation techniques in the context of JavaScript programs. We inspect 361 actual vulnerability mitigation patches collected from vulnerability databases and GitHub. We found that vulnerability mitigation patches are not short on average and in many cases affect not just program code but test code as well. These results point towards that a general automatic repair approach targeting all the different types of vulnerabilities is not feasible.

This systematic review of reviews aims to synthesize data from existing reviews on the prevention and/or reduction of suicide behavior in late-life and evidence for effectiveness of interventions. A systematic database search was conducted in eight electronic databases from inception to 4/2020 for reviews targeting interventions among adults  60 to prevent and/or reduce suicide, suicide attempt, self-harm and suicidal ideation. Four high quality reviews were included and interventions categorized as pharmacological (antidepressant use: 239 RCTs, seven observational studies) and behavioral (physical activity: three observational studies, and multifaceted primary-care-based collaborative care for depression screening and management: four RCTs). The 2009 antidepressant use review found significant risk reduction for suicide attempt/self-harm (OR = 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.58) and suicide ideation (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.78) versus placebo. The 2015 review found an increased risk of attempts with antidepressants versus no treatment (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.27) and no statistically significant change in suicides versus no treatment (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.68-1.66) or ideation versus placebo (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.14-1.94). Protective effects were found for physical activity on ideation in 2 out of 3 studies when comparing active versus inactive older people. Collaborative care demonstrated significantly less attempts/ideation (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.94) in intervention group versus usual care. The results of this review of reviews find the evidence inconclusive towards use of antidepressants for the prevention of suicidal behavior in older people, thus monitoring is required prior to start, dosage change or cessation of antidepressants. Evidence to date supports physical activity and collaborative management for reduction of suicide ideation, but additional trials are required for a meta-analysis. To build on these findings, continued high-quality research is warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in late life.","output":"Prevention of suicidal behavior in older people: A systematic review of reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates both the negative and positive impacts of a crisis on Entrepreneurial Ventures.

The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","output":"Proteomic Analysis of Urine Exosomes Reveals Renal Tubule Response to Leptospiral Colonization in Experimentally Infected Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Due to the availability of proper hygiene standards and suggestions, many dental health centers fail to satisfy the minimal disease control criteria. Objective: The goal of this research was to investigate the degree of attitude, perception, and awareness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and disease management among dental practitioners in Namakkal district - A prevalence study. Methods: Dental practitioner operating in Namakkal district private health center, nursing homes, and health-care organizations was included in the research population. An questionnaire survey was issued to a test group in May 2020. The participants answered a sequence of quiz about dental practitioner survey was, their deep understanding of latent period, disease symptoms, SARS-COV-2 spreading route, and disease prevention. Results: A total of 207 dental practitioner were included in this study (98 males and 109 females). While all respondents (100%) were aware of the PPE required in this situation, a small percentage (2.5%) did not prefer to use one. About 99.5% of them endorsed social isolation as a containment measure to avert this epidemic and correctly identified the age group in which the disease is most prevalent.

There is limited evidence of PP effects on awake patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects and feasibility of PP on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated awake patients with ARDS in a subintensive setting of care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single-center case-control study involving patients with severe COVID-19 infection. A total of 29 patients underwent noninvasive ventilation, and PP was initiated 12 h from admission; 18 patients tolerated prone and side positioning for at least 10 h/d and cycled their position every 2 h, and 11 patients had no complaints with PP. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (25 men and 4 women) with a median age of 64 years showed the average baseline white blood cell count of 8.45109 cells/L, C-reactive protein of 10.1 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase of 366 mU/mL, and interleukin-6 of 172 pg/mL. Basal pO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) was 95 (56.5) and showed no linear correlation with any of the inflammatory markers tested. Computed tomography findings included ground-glass opacities in 100% (29/29) of patients. Consolidation/atelectasis was found in 58% (17/29) of patients. P/F was homogeneously distributed at baseline in patients with PP (96.5) and without PP (95). P/F during PP increased significantly compared with noncompliant controls (288 vs. 202; p=0.0002). Total duration of respiratory failure was significantly shorter in patients with PP (14 vs. 21 days; p=0.002). The number of days to recover from respiratory failure inversely correlated with PP P/F independently from baseline P/F. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can lead to a severe impairment of gas exchange regardless of inflammatory status. Therefore, respiratory support may play a major role in COVID-19 treatment. We documented substantial efficacy of PP when started early and for at least 10 h/d. On awake patients, PP feasibility strictly depends on patient's compliance. The interface should be carefully chosen to best fit every patient.","output":"Early Prone Positioning and Non-Invasive Ventilation in a Critical COVID-19 Subset.

In this paper, a previously synthesized novel pyrimidine molecule is proposed, and its pharmaceutical properties are investigated. Computational techniques such as the density functional theory, ADMET evaluation, and molecular docking were applied to elucidate the chemical nature, drug likeness and antibacterial function of molecule. The viewpoint of quantum chemical computations revealed that the molecule was relatively stable and has a high electrophilic nature. The contour maps of HOMO-LUMO and molecular electrostatic potential were analyzed to illustrate the charge density distributions that could be associated with the biological activity. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed details about the interaction between donor and acceptor within the bond. Drug likeness and ADMET analysis showed that the molecule possesses the agents of safety and the effective combination therapy as pharmaceutical drug. The antimicrobial activity was investigated using molecular docking. The investigated molecule demonstrated a high affinity for binding within the active sites of antibacterial and antimalarial proteins. The high affinity of the antibacterial protein was proved by its low binding energy (?7.97 kcal/mol) and a low inhibition constant value (1.43 M). The formation of four conventional hydrogen bonds in ligandCprotein interactions confirmed the high stability of the resulting complexes. When compared to known standard drugs, the studied molecule displayed a remarkable antimalarial activity, as indicated by higher binding affinity (B.E. ?5.86 kcal/mol & Ki = 50.23 M).

An often-overlooked capability of this approach is the opportunity to examine the electronic evolution of a chemical system. For AIMD trajectories based on Hartree-Fock or density functional theory methods, the real-time evolution of single-particle molecular orbitals (MOs) can provide detailed insights into the time-dependent electronic structure of molecules. The evolving electronic Hamiltonians at each MD step pose problems for tracking and visualizing a given MO's character, ordering, and associated phase throughout an MD trajectory, however. This report presents and assesses a simple algorithm for correcting these deficiencies by exploiting similarity projections of the electronic structure between neighboring MD steps. Two aspects bring this analysis beyond a simple step-to-step projection scheme. First, the challenging case of coincidental orbital degeneracies is resolved via a quadrupole-field perturbation that nonetheless rigorously preserves energy conservation. Second, the resulting orbitals are shown to evolve adiabatically, in spite of the \\"preservation of character\\" concept that undergirds a projection of neighboring steps' MOs. The method is tested on water clusters, which exhibit considerable dynamic degeneracies, as well as a classic organic nucleophilic substitution reaction, in which the adiabatic evolution of the bonding orbitals clarifies textbook interpretations of the electronic structure during this reactive collision.","output":"Adiabatic Molecular Orbital Tracking in Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hintergrund Als Reaktion auf die COVID-19-Pandemie hat der deutsche Gesetzgeber die Rahmenbedingungen fr die Pflegeberatung nach  37 Abs. 3 SGB XI ge?ndert.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is the diagnostic criterion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, RNA detection has many limitations, such as being time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and it must be performed in specialized laboratories. Virus antibody detection is a routine method for screening for multiple viruses, but data about SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection are limited. METHOD: Throat swabs and blood were collected from 67 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection patients at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and Zunyi Fourth People's Hospital isolated observation departments. Throat swab samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by real-time PCR. Blood was used subjected to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gold immunochromatography assay (GICA). Blood underwent C-reactive protein detection by immunoturbidimetry, and white blood cells, neutrophil percentages and lymphocyte percentages were counted and calculated, respectively. Clinical symptoms, age and lifestyle habits (smoking and drinking) in all patients were recorded. Data were analysed using SPSS version 19. The results were confirmed by T and &#967;2 tests; correlations with detection results were analysed by kappa coefficients. Odds ratio (OR) and corrected OR values were analysed by logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients included in this study, 26 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. GICA IgM sensitivity was 50.9% (13/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgM sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgG sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 95.1% (39/41).

On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that (1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, (2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and (3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.","output":"Robust and optimal predictive control of the COVID-19 outbreak()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In 2011, we predicted that surgeon shortages for rural hospitals would contribute to closures of rural hospitals. Here, we update population trends, the distribution of rural and urban hospitals, and surgeon supply to estimate surgeon demand for rural and urban hospital settings by 2040. METHODS Surgeon supply was based on new certifications for general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology adjusted for retirement. Surgeon demand from 2020 to 2040 was projected based on the US Census and published practice ratios: general surgery 10.7/100,000, orthopedic surgery 7.9/100,000, and obstetrics and gynecology 13.0/100,000. RESULTS The US population grew from 309 million in 2011 to 327 million in 2017 with rural populations unchanged at 56 million. By 2040, the US population will be 374 million (urban 85% and rural 15%) creating shortages of general surgery (-31.5%), orthopedic surgery (-34.3%), and obstetrics and gynecology (-25.3). Future hiring needs for urban hospitals will be 5 times greater than rural hospitals. Urban hospitals will likely recruit most newly certified surgeons. CONCLUSION Increases in surgery trainees will not meet the demand. The continued urbanization of American surgery may push rural hospitals into a vicious financial cycle leading to additional closures of rural hospitals and worsening issues of access. An alternative training paradigm for the rural surgeon is recommended to meet the unique demands of rural hospitals.","output":"The continued urbanization of American surgery: A threat to rural hospitals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In September 2020 my eight-year -old son Matteo finally went back to school after being at home for six months because of the Italian response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the role of BKPyV integration on oncogenesis is still unclear. In this study, next-generation virome capture sequencing of primary and metastatic tumors were performed in three patients with BKPyV-associated urothelial carcinoma after renal transplantation. As a result, a total of 332 viral integration sites were identified in the six tumors. Integration of BKPyV in both primary and metastatic tumors followed the mechanism of microhomology-mediated end joining mostly, since microhomologies between human and BKPyV genomes were significantly enriched in flanking regions of 84% of the integration sites. Viral DNA breakpoints were nonrandom and tended to assemble in large T gene, small T gene and viral protein 2 gene. There were three, one and one consensus integration sites between the primary and metastatic tumors, which affected LINC01924, eIF3c, and NEIL2 genes in the three cases respectively. Thus, we concluded that integration of BKPyV was a continuous process occurring in both primary and metastatic tumors, generating heterogenous tumor cell populations. Through this ongoing process, certain cell populations might have gained growth advantage or metastatic potential, as a result of viral integration either affecting the cellular genes where the viral DNA integrated to or altering the expression or function of the viral genes.","output":"Viral integration in BK polyomavirus-associated urothelial carcinoma in renal transplant recipients: multistage carcinogenesis revealed by next-generation virome capture sequencing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION there were no formal regulatory approvals for antivirals for the COVID-19 pandemic as of June 2020.

MethodsUsing data from 1,600 South African respondents who were surveyed during 2021 for the Eighth Round of Afrobarometer (AB-R8), discrete measures of household- and individual-level sociodemographic and economic factors were generated to permit confounder-adjusted analyses of probabilistic causal relationships between self-reported measures of: personal/household COVID-19 illness and job/income/business loss as a result of COVID-19; and the likelihood that respondents would accept a (government-approved) COVID-19 vaccine, or support the reallocation of health sector funding towards health emergency preparedness. FindingsThere was little evidence that personal/household experience of COVID-19 illness was associated with the likelihood that respondents would (or would not) accept a (government-approved) COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.72,1.28); or that these respondents would (or would not) support the reallocation of health sector funding towards health emergency preparedness (OR: 0.95; 95%CI: 0.71,1.26), even after adjustment for individual- or household-level sociodemographic and economic covariates considered likely confounders. There was similarly little evidence that personal/household experience of job/income/business loss as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with support for the reallocation of health sector resources for emergency preparedness (OR: 1.02; 95%CI: 0.80,1.30); again, even after adjustment for potential confounders. However, respondents who reported that they or someone in their household had lost their job/income/or business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic had only around half the odds of reporting that they would accept a (government-approved) COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 0.60; 95%CI: 0.47,0.77) - and this finding, like the others in these analyses, was largely unaffected by the inclusion/exclusion of covariates considered susceptible to change following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. those covariates potentially operating as colliders rather than genuine confounders). ConclusionsThese findings suggest that - despite the postulated experiential dividend of COVID-19 illness (i.e. its expected impact on vaccine hesitancy and support for the reallocation of health sector resources for health emergency preparedness) - no such dividend was observed in this broadly representative sample of South African adults. Indeed, job/income/business loss (and associated economic hardship) also had little effect on support for the reallocation of health sector resources for health emergency preparedness; yet this was somewhat paradoxically associated with a much lower odds of vaccine acceptance - paradoxically, since vaccination has been widely viewed as a pragmatic (if somewhat neoliberal) intervention to protect economic activity. However, these findings might simply reflect inadequate confounder adjustment for preceding and entrenched attitudes towards vaccination amongst those South Africans who are also most vulnerable to job/income/business loss as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Protecting the livelihood and health of such individuals and households is likely to remain a substantial challenge and key priority for future emergencies in which economic activity is compromised. AimThe aim of the present study was to examine whether first-hand experience of ill-health and economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic might have strengthened public support for vaccination, and for the reallocation of health sector funding towards health emergency preparedness in South Africa - a country in which high rates of vaccine hesitancy go hand in hand with widespread discontent regarding public service delivery.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major histocompability complex class &#921; (MHC-&#921;) down-regulation both in vitro and in vivo. The viral protein encoded by open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all viral proteins, directly interacts with MHC-&#921; molecules and mediates their down-regulation. In ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-&#921; molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are much less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

One region that appears highly conserved among different genera of coronaviruses is the substrate-binding site of the main protease (M(pro) or 3CL(pro)), making it an attractive target for the development of broad-spectrum drugs for multiple coronaviruses. PF-07321332, developed by Pfizer, is the first orally administered inhibitor targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which also has shown potency against other coronaviruses. Here, we report three crystal structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV bound to the inhibitor PF-07321332. The structures reveal a ligand-binding site that is conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, providing insights into the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication. The long and narrow cavity in the cleft between domains I and II of the main protease harbors multiple inhibitor-binding sites, where PF-07321332 occupies subsites S1, S2, and S4 and appears more restricted than other inhibitors. A detailed analysis of these structures illuminated key structural determinants essential for inhibition and elucidated the binding mode of action of the main proteases from different coronaviruses. Given the importance of the main protease for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, insights derived from this study should accelerate the design of safer and more effective antivirals. IMPORTANCE The current pandemic of multiple variants has created an urgent need for effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 to complement vaccine strategies. PF-07321332, developed by Pfizer, is the first orally administered coronavirus-specific main protease inhibitor approved by the FDA. We solved the crystal structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV that bound to the PF-07321332, suggesting PF-07321332 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor for coronaviruses.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of long-term testosterone therapy in A1C levels in men with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and hypogonadism, controlling for BMI, pre-treatment A1C, and age among different testosterone therapy adherence groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 1737 men with diabetes and hypogonadism on testosterone therapy for 5 years of data from 2008-2018, isolating A1C, lipid panels, and BMI results for analysis. Subjects were categorized into adherence groups based on quartiles of the proportion of days covered (> 75% of days, 51-75% of days, 26-50% of days and 0-25% of days), with >75% of days covered considered adherent to therapy. RESULTS Pre-treatment median A1C was 6.8%. Post-treatment median A1C was 7.1%. The adherent group, >75%, was the only group notable for a decrease in A1C, with a median decrease of -0.2 (p=0.0022). BMI improvement was associated with improved post-treatment A1C (p= 0.007). When controlling for BMI, age, and pre-treatment A1C, the > 75% adherence group was associated with improved post-treatment A1C (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION When controlling for all studied variables, testosterone adherence was associated with improved post-treatment A1C. The higher the initial A1C at the initiation of therapy, the higher the potential for lowering the patient's A1C with >75% adherence. Further, all groups showed some reduction in BMI, which may indicate that testosterone therapy may affect A1C independent of weight loss. CONCLUSION Even when controlling for improved BMI, pre-treatment A1C, and age, testosterone positively impacted glycemic control in diabetes patients with hypogonadism, with the most benefit noted in those most adherent to therapy (>75%).","output":"Glycemic Benefits with Adherence to Testosterone Therapy in Men with Hypogonadism and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the world over the past weeks, with already 8,25 million infections and 445,000 deaths worldwide, leading to an unprecedented international global effort to contain the virus and prevent its spread.

Central to this vision is the achievement of universal health coverage (UHC). To provide an indication of the UHC-related priorities of Pacific health authorities and promote alignment of domestic and international investments in health sector development, we thematically analyzed the discussion, resolutions, and recommendations from 5 years (2015C2020) of senior-level Pacific health meetings. Five main themes emerged: (i) the Healthy Islands vision has (and continues to have) a unifying influence on action for UHC; (ii) adoption of appropriate service delivery models that support integrated primary health care at the community level are needed; (iii) human resources for health are critical if efforts to achieve UHC are to be successful; (iv) access to reliable health information is core to health sector improvement; and (v) while not a panacea for all challenges, digital health offers many opportunities.

Since then, it has arisen as a serious threat to the world public health. Since no approved vaccines or drugs has been found to efficiently stop the virulent spread of the virus, progressive inquiries targeting these viruses are urgently needed, especially those from plant sources. Metabolic profiling using LC-HR-ESI-MS of the butanol extract of Ocimum menthiifolium (Lamiaceae) aerial parts yielded 10 compounds including flavonoids, iridoids and phenolics. As it has been previously reported that some flavonoids can be used as anti-SARS drugs by targeting SARS-CoV-1 3CLpro, we chose to examine 14 flavonoids (detected by metabolomics and other compounds isolated via several chromatographic techniques). We investigated their potential binding interactions with the 4 main SARS-CoV-2 targets: Mpro, nsp16/nsp10 complex, ACE2-PD and RBD-S-protein via molecular docking. Docking results indicated that the nsp16/nsp10 complex has the best binding affinities where the strongest binding was detected with apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, prunin and acaciin with -9.4, -9.3 and -9.3 kcal/mol binding energy, respectively, compared to the control (SAM) with -8.2 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the stability of these complexes was studied using molecular dynamics of 150 ns, which were then compared to their complexes in the other three targets. MM-PBSA calculations suggested the high stability of acaciin-nsp16 complex with binding energy of -110 kJ/mol.

Economic analyses to date have not identified the financial implications of pandemic-related changes to CR. The aim of this study was to compare the costs and reimbursements of CR between two periods: (1) pre-COVID-19 and (2) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Health care costs of providing CR were calculated using a microcosting approach. Unit costs of CR were based on staff time, consumables, and overhead costs. Reimbursement rates were derived from commercial and public health insurance. The mean cost and reimbursement/participant were calculated. Staff and participant COVID-19 infections were also examined. RESULTS The mean number of CR participants enrolled/mo declined during the pandemic (-10%; 33.8  2.0 vs 30.5  3.2, P = .39), the mean cost/participant increased marginally (+13%; $2897  $131 vs $3265  $149, P = .09), and the mean reimbursement/participant decreased slightly (-4%; $2959  $224 vs $2844  $181, P = .70).

With the spread of the disease, a better understanding of patient outcomes associated with their symptoms in diverse geographic levels is vital. This study aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients by disease symptoms in Ilam province, Iran. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Data were collected from integrated health system records for all hospitals affiliated with the Ilam University of Medical Sciences between 26-Jan-2020 and 02-May-2020. All patients with a confirmed positive test were included in this study. Descriptive analyses, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression model were performed by using SPSS version 22. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 46.47  18.24 years. Of the 3608 patients, 3477 (96.1%) were discharged, and 129 (3.9%) died. 54.2% of the patients were male and were in the age group of 30C40 years. Cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and fever or chills were the most common symptoms. Patients with symptoms of shortness of breath, abnormal radiographic findings of the chest, and chest pain and pressure were relatively more likely to die. According to binary logistic regression results, the probability of death in patients with shortness of breath, abnormal chest radiographic findings, and chest pain was 1.34, 1.24, and 1.32 times higher, respectively, than for those without.

Methodology: The sample study of this cross-sectional study includes individuals over 60 years old residing in Isfahan, Iran. For interviews based on a structured questionnaire, which was drafted based on reviewing the literature, 453 participants were randomly selected in 15 municipality districts of Isfahan. A binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the data. Result and Discussion: The results indicate that in the post-outbreak the average walking duration per week decreased from 59 to 29 min;while, the share of this mode has increased from 40% to 65%. Also, the share of bicycles and the average cycling duration per week increased from 9% to 18% and from 9 to 15 min, respectively. Moreover, trip frequency, bicycle ownership, quality of walking and cycling routes, intersections safety, neighborhood security and greenery, traffic calming, CBD accommodation, and public transportation accessibility have positive effects on AMCOA;while, trip distance and vehicle ownership affect negatively. The results reveal that older adults have turned to the bicycle for most of their long trips during the pandemic because it is not subjected to traffic restrictions. Besides, the findings show that increasing bicycle ownership and improving bike-sharing infrastructure make the bicycle a resilient alternative when public transportation and private vehicles are not efficient. Conclusion: Policymakers and urban planners should consider that an elderly-friendly neighborhood with mixed, dense, and accessible land uses and services, as well as safe and secure routes can increase older adults' active mobility in the crises.

While published guidelines provide suggestions on which cases are appropriate for treatment delay, there are no good quantitative estimates on the association of delays with tumor control or risk of new metastases. OBJECTIVES: To develop a simplified mathematical model of tumor growth, control, and new metastases for cancers with varying doubling times and metastatic potential and to estimate tumor control probability (TCP) and metastases risk as a function of treatment delay interval. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model describes a quantitative model for 3 tumors (ie, head and neck, colorectal, and nonCsmall cell lung cancers). Using accepted ranges of tumor doubling times and metastatic development from the clinical literature from 2001 to 2020, estimates of tumor growth, TCP, and new metastases were analyzed for various treatment delay intervals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk estimates for potential decreases in local TCP and increases in new metastases with each interval of treatment delay. RESULTS: For fast-growing head and neck tumors with a 2-month treatment delay, there was an estimated 4.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-6.4%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.49% (0.47%-0.51%) increase in new distal metastases risk. A 6-month delay was associated with an estimated 21.3% (13.4-30.4) increase in local tumor control risk and a 6.0% (5.2-6.8) increase in distal metastases risk. For intermediate-growing colorectal tumors, there was a 2.1% (0.7%-3.5%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 2.7% (2.6%-2.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months and a 7.6% (2.2%-14.2%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 24.7% (21.9%-27.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. For slower-growing lung tumors, there was a 1.2% (0.0%-2.8%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.19% (0.18%-0.20%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months, and a 4.3% (0.0%-10.6%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 1.9% (1.6%-2.2%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study proposed a model to quantify the association of treatment delays with local tumor control and risk of new metastases.

To construct a measurement model and a structural model, structural equation models using four measurement scales with valid items were adopted, including a scale of psychological trauma, a scale of resilience, a scale of positive emotional regulation, and a scale of mental health. Participants reported their answers to items on a 5-point Likert-like scale. Results The results revealed that psychological trauma was a negative predictor of mental health, and resilience and positive emotion regulation mediated the relationship between psychological trauma and mental health.

However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score has not yet been fully explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients with abdominal obesity showed significantly higher CXR severity scores and had higher rates of CXR severity scores  8 compared to those without abdominal obesity (P < 0.001; P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, patients with normal weight, with overweight and those with BMI-based obesity showed no significant differences in either CXR severity scores or in the rates of CXR severity scores  8 (P = 0.104; P = 0.271, respectively). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) correlated more closely with CXR severity scores than BMI (r = 0.43, P < 0.001; r = 0.41, P < 0.001; r = 0.17, P = 0.012, respectively). The area under the curves (AUCs) for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than that for BMI in identifying a high CXR severity score ( 8) (0.68 [0.60C0.75] and 0.67 [0.60C0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51C0.66], P = 0.001). A multivariate analysis indicated abdominal obesity (risk ratio: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25C2.45, P < 0.001), bronchial asthma (risk ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.07C2.81, P = 0.026) and oxygen saturation at admission (risk ratio: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94C0.97, P < 0.001) as the only independent factors associated with high CXR severity scores. CONCLUSION: Abdominal obesity phenotype is associated with a high CXR severity score better than BMI-based obesity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Therefore, when visiting the patient in a hospital setting, waist circumference should be measured, and patients with abdominal obesity should be monitored closely.

However, in a recent systematic review, we found that Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) co-resistant to carbapanems, aminoglycosides, polymyxins and tigecycline (CAPT-resistant) are increasingly being reported worldwide. Clinical data to guide the treatment of CAPT-resistant GNB are scarce and based exclusively on few case reports and small case series, but seem to indicate that appropriate (in vitro active) antimicrobial regimens, including newer antibiotics and synergistic combinations, may be associated with lower mortality. In this review, we consolidate the available literature to inform clinicians dealing with CAPT-resistant GNB about treatment options by considering the mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems. In combination with rapid diagnostic methods that allow fast detection of carbapenemase production, the approach proposed in this review may guide a timely and targeted treatment of patients with infections by CAPT-resistant GNB. Specifically, we focus on the three most problematic species, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Several treatment options are currently available for CAPT-resistant K. pneumonia. Newer -lactam--lactamase combinations, including the combination of ceftazidime/avibactam with aztreonam against metallo--lactamase-producing isolates, appear to be more effective compared to combinations of older agents. Options for P. aeruginosa (especially metallo--lactamase-producing strains) and A. baumannii remain limited. Synergistic combination of older agents (e.g., polymyxin- or fosfomycin-based synergistic combinations) may represent a last resort option, but their use against CAPT-resistant GNB requires further study.","output":"Treatment options for K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii co-resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, polymyxins and tigecycline: an approach based on the mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A post-hoc analysis of the phase 2 data was performed for the SARS-COV-2 subunit protein vaccine MVC-COV1901.

The restaurant and restaurant industry is still believed to be a form of business that has good prospects, even in times of crisis. However, in the same period many restaurants went out of business, because they were unable to maintain the number of visitors. Success in the food and beverage sector is not only determined by the number of visitors, but is also determined by the ability to increase customer growth. One strategy that can be done is to use Celebgram or Celebrity Endorser and Brand Trust as a mediator. In previous research, it was found that the use of Celebrity Endorser in increasing consumers' purchase intention only had an effect of 28.53%, so it was deemed necessary to add a Brand Trust variable as a mediator which was expected to further increase consumer buying intentions. The population in this study is the community in Denpasar City with the determination of the sample using purposive sampling. The data analysis technique used the PLS data analysis technique. The results of this study found that brand trust is able to mediate the relationship between the use of celebrity endorsers and consumers' intention to buy online so that the use of celebrity endorsers and brand trusts is expected to provide a reference for MSMEs that offer products in the form of food and beverages online. If before the Covid 19 pandemic conditions consumers were still hesitant to buy food and beverage products online, it is hoped that by using celebrity endorsers that display food and beverage products in a real and honest manner, as well as trust in brands, it can increase the purchase intention of consumers who previously were still hesitant to buy food and beverage products online.

Soon, the disease, whose etiological factor was recognized as a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, had spread across the world. The resulting CoV-associated diseases were classified by the WHO as COVID-19, and a pandemic was declared in March 2020. By 25 November 2021, there have been nearly 256.8 million of confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world, including 5.17 million deaths. This review focuses on basal characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus - its structure, replication cycle, variants and course of infection. It also briefly characterizes the currently recommended drugs and vaccines. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of RNA viruses with a characteristic solar corona image observable on electron micrographs. SARS-CoV-2 possesses high affinity to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which serves as a cellular entry receptor. Its replication in human cells is accompanied by a high mutation rate. Six variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to be associated with essential changes of global public health significance; they are referred to as 'variants of concern' (VOC). The main route of transmission is through respiratory droplets. Although COVID-19 presents primarily as a respiratory disease, it can affect various other organs and systems that present the ACE2 protein to which the virus binds, including the heart, kidneys, intestines, liver, muscular and nervous system. COVID-19 infection can result in uncontrolled systemic hyperinflammation caused by release of a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines (a 'cytokine storm'), which can lead to multi-organ failure, rapid clinical deterioration and even death. Around 30% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain asymptomatic, with the majority of patients demonstrating only mild or moderate symptoms; however, about 20% develop severe or critical disease. Three main groups of medications are currently recommended for therapy of COVID-19: monoclonal antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, antiviral drugs and immunosuppressants which inhibit the cytokine storm. At present, the safest and most cost-effective way to prevent COVID-19 illness is a preventative vaccination.","output":"COVID-19: from the structure and replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 to its disease symptoms and treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate high resolution CT (HRCT) manifestations and clinical features of patients infected with the novel coronavirus B.1.617.2 variant.

Like other disease states, there are patient characteristics that impact clinical risk and determine the spectrum of severity. Obesity, or adiposity-based chronic disease, has emerged as an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. It is imperative to further stratify risk in patients with obesity to determine optimal mitigation and perhaps therapeutic preparedness strategies. We suspect that insulin resistance is an important pathophysiologic cause of poor outcomes in patients with obesity and COVID-19 independent of body mass index. This explains the association of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), and cardiovascular disease with poor outcomes since insulin resistance is the main driver of both dysglycemia-based chronic disease and cardiometabolic-based chronic disease towards end-stage disease manifestations.

Adnexal tumours constituted a significant percentage of cutaneous tumours in guinea pigs (24.3%, with the most common being trichofolliculoma), pet rabbits (46.5%, with the most common being trichoblastoma), ferrets (33.3%, mostly derived from sebaceous glands), hamsters (52.9%, with the most common being trichoepithelioma) and gerbils (66.7%, scent gland epithelioma). Soft tissue sarcomas were a predominant group of tumours in rats (52.8%, with the most common being fibrosarcoma), African pygmy hedgehogs (100%), degus (87.5%) and chinchillas (66.7%). Melanocytic tumours were only sporadically seen in small mammal pets. Mast cell tumours were diagnosed only in ferrets, while epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma was diagnosed only in a hamster and a degu. In summary, malignant tumours constitute a significant percentage of cutaneous tumours in many species of small mammal pets. Therefore, each cutaneous tumour should be sampled for further cytologic or histopathologic diagnosis.","output":"Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Tumours of Small Pet Mammals-Retrospective Study of 256 Cases (2014-2021)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has demanded a quick response from governments in terms of planning contingency efforts that include the imposition of social isolation measures and an unprecedented increase in the availability of medical services. Both courses of action have been shown to be critical to the success of epidemic control. Under this scenario, the timely adoption of effective strategies allows the outbreak to be decelerated at early stages. The objective of this study is to present an epidemic model specially tailored for the study of the COVID-19 epidemics, and the model is aimed at allowing the integrated study of epidemic control strategies and dimensioning of the required medical infrastructure. Along with the theoretical model, a case study with three prognostic scenarios is presented for the first wave of the epidemic in the city of Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas state, Brazil. Although the temporary collapse of the medical infrastructure is hardly avoidable in the state-of-affairs at this time (April 2020), the results show that there are feasible control strategies that could substantially reduce the overload within reasonable time. Furthermore, this study delivers and presents an intuitive, straightforward, free, and open-source online platform that allows the direct application of the model.

The mortality among critically ill patients, especially the elder ones, is relatively high. Considering many patients died of severe inflammation response, it is urgent to develop effective therapeutic strategies for these patients. The human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) have shown good capabilities to modulate the immune response and repair the injured tissue. Therefore, investigating the potential of hUCMSCs to the treatment of COVID-19 critically ill patients is necessary. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old woman felt fatigued and had a fever with body temperature of 38.2()C, coughed up white foaming sputum. After 1 day, she had chest tightness with SPO(2) of 81%, and blood pressure of 160/91 mm Hg. DIAGNOSE: According to the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (Trial 4th Edition), COVID-19 was diagnosed, based on the real-time RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2. INTERVENTIONS: After regular treatment for 12 days, the inflammation symptom of the patient was still very severe and the potential side effects of corticosteroid were observed. Then, allogenic hUCMSCs were given 3 times (5  10(7) cells each time) with a 3-day interval, together with thymosin 1 and antibiotics daily injection. OUTCOMES: After these treatments, most of the laboratory indexes and CT images showed remission of the inflammation symptom. The patient was subsequently transferred out of ICU, and the throat swabs test reported negative 4 days later.

This type of strict measures caused an outcome, the reduction of urban air pollution, around the world. The present study aims to investigate the reduction of the concentration of pollutants in the air of Dhaka City and the reduction of the Air Quality Index (AQI). Necessary time-series data of the concentration of PM(2.5), NO(2), SO(2), and CO have been collected from the archive of the Air Quality Monitoring Station of the US Embassy in Dhaka and Sentinel-5P. The time-series data have been analyzed by descriptive statistics, and AQI was calculated following an appropriate formula suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on the criteria pollutants. The study found that the concentrations of PM(2.5), NO(2), SO(2), and CO during AprilCMay 2020 have been reduced by 26, 30, 07, and 07%, respectively, compared with the preceding years concentrations. Moreover, the AQI has also been reduced by about 35% on average during the lockdown period than the same times of the previous year. However, the magnitude of pollution reduction in Dhaka is lower than in other cities and countries globally, including Delhi, Sao Paulo, Wuhan, Spain, Italy, the USA. The main reasons may include, among others, the poor implementation of lockdown (especially in the first week of April and the second fortnight of May), pre-existing pollution, transboundary pollution, incineration of solid waste, etc. This study will help policymakers figure out how to regulate pollution sources and improve the air quality of Dhaka.

Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4 to 10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31 of 40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/mL, within 1 to 2 weeks in the second month and then sustained at around 100 AU/mL until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turned negative (P = .002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs late recovery stage, n = 16, P = .003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7%-77.0%). Our results suggested that the decline of IgM may be an indicator of virus clearance and recovered patients may have a robust immunity against reinfection within at least 3 months after illness onset. Yet, the rapid reduction of IgG by half rises serious concerns on the robustness and sustainability of the humoral immune response in the period after discharge, which is crucial for immunity strategy and developing a vaccine.","output":"The dynamic changes of serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses, from a human rights and feminist economy perspective, the emergency financial policies deployed by the international financial institutions (IFIs)-in particular the IMF and the World Bank-to help States in Latina America to cope with the Covid-19 crisis. The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions as well as the underlying economic policies behind the loans that IFIs are granting to States are studied, identifying clear signals that fiscal discipline and pro-market options will continue being the priorities as soon as the emergency has been overcome. The study explains how the adjustment and austerity policies implemented in the countries in the region have adversely and disproportionally affected women's rights, in particular reinforcing the invisibilization of gender inequalities in the domestic and care work and how this situation, in turn, has put women in a situation of greater vulnerability to the pandemic. It also criticizes the (self)called \\"gender approach\\" of IFIs for being merely instrumental to economic growth without consideration to the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's rights. The responsibility of IFIs for complicity with economic reforms with known adverse effects on gender equality is studied. Given the policy and legal implications of the findings presented in this research, the article concludes that States in the region should consider carefully the conditions of the loans being offered by IFIs, for which it is crucial to conduct ex ante evaluations of the impact of these financial contacts on the human rights of the population, and in particular on gender equality.","output":"Covid-19, international financial institutions and the continuity of androcentric policies in Latin America/ Covid-19, instituciones financieras internacionales y continuidad de las polticas androcntricas en Amrica Latina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated stressors have impacted the daily lives and sleeping patterns of many individuals, including university students.

While there are studies that analyze dreams in high-stress situations, little is known of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted dreams of university students. The aim of this study was to explore how the dream content of students was affected during the university COVID-19 lockdown period (MarchCJuly, 2020). Using online survey methods, we analyzed dream recall content (n = 71) using the Hall-Van de Castle dream coding system and Fisher's exact tests for sex comparisons. Preliminary results indicate that female students experienced more nightmares as compared to male students. Dream analysis found that, relative to normative American College Student (ACS) samples generated pre-COVID-19, women were more likely to experience aggressive interactions in their dream content, including increased physical aggression. Results indicate that university students did experience changes in dream content due to the pandemic lockdown period, with women disproportionally affected.

Although VR's clinical benefits are reported, biometric data quantifying VR's effect on pain tolerance is lacking. We used time-lapse, subjective, and biometric data to evaluate VR's effect on modulating pain. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled crossover within-subject clinical trial. SETTING: This study was conducted in the Chariot Lab at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and outdoors at Stanford University School of Medicine. PATIENTS: 156 healthy volunteers were included. INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent pain-inducing ice immersions while connected to biometric sensors. Participants were randomized to immerse their dominant or non-dominant hand with VR or control (no VR) for one immersion, and then crossed-over to the other hand for the second immersion. We instructed participants to submerge their hand until they reached their pain tolerance or until four minutes elapsed. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes included ice immersion duration, perceived pain scores, and skin conductance response density (SCRD), a marker of sympathetic arousal. We used survival analysis and mixed effects models to compare measurements with and without VR. MAIN RESULTS: 153 participants were included in the analysis. Participants with VR were 64% less likely to remove their hands from the ice bath throughout the immersion's duration compared to control (P < 0.001). Participants with VR reported significantly lower pain scores after controlling for dominant hand treatment assignment, VR vs. no VR treatment order, and gender (P < 0.001). SCRD increased as time progressed for both VR and control groups (P = 0.047 combined), with no significant mean group differences. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with VR were more likely to survive the 4-min ice bath challenge longer and with lower levels of pain perception, supporting VR's effectiveness as a distraction tool during painful procedures.

METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we evaluated 150 emergency department patients (mean age 65  17 years) undergoing CTPA with a fixed scan (100 kVp) and contrast media protocol (60 mL, 4 mL/s) who had no pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients were subdivided into training cohort (n = 100) and test cohort (n = 50). Three independent, blinded readers measured the attenuation in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) on axial images. The ratio (HU(ratio)) and difference (HU(diff)) between RV and LV attenuation were calculated. Diagnosis of acute HF was made on the basis of clinical, laboratory, and echocardiography data. Optimal thresholds, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated using the area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristics analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the 150 patients (40%) were diagnosed with acute HF. Attenuation measurements showed an almost perfect interobserver agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.986, 95%CI: 0.980C0.991). NT-pro BNP exhibited moderate correlations with HU(ratio) (r = 0.50, p < 0.001) and HU(diff) (r = 0.50, p < 0.001). In the training cohort, HU(ratio) (AUC: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.82C0.95) and HU(diff) (AUC: 0.88, 95%CI: 0.81C0.95) showed a very good performance to diagnose HF. Optimal cutoff values were 1.42 for HU(ratio) (sensitivity 93%; specificity 75%) and 113 for HU(diff) (sensitivity 93%; specificity 73%). Applying these thresholds to the test cohort yielded a sensitivity of 89% and 89% and a specificity of 69% and 63% for HU(ratio) and HU(diff), respectively.

Around 7% reported they believe the virus is the part of a virus war (7.2%). The bivariate analysis found the presence of socio-demographic factors of the respondents, as well as the factors related to social and mass media, were significantly associated with the COVID-19s misconception. However, once all factors considered together in the multivariate model, misconception were found to be lower among secondary (AOR, 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13C0.84) and tertiary (AOR, 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09C0.92) educated respondents compared to the respondents with primary education. CONCLUSION: This study obtained a very higher percentage of misconception about the COVID-19 among the respondents of Satkhira district in Bangladesh. This could be a potential challenge to fight against this pandemic which is now ongoing. Prioritizing mass and social media to disseminate evidence-based information as well as educate people about this disease are necessary.","output":"Communitys misconception about COVID-19 and its associated factors in Satkhira, Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Portal hypertension, a common complication associated with liver cirrhosis, can result in variceal bleeding, which greatly impacts patient survival. Recently, -arrestin-2 has been shown to predict the acute hemodynamic response to nonselective -blocker therapy for cirrhotic portal hypertension. However, more data is needed on the long-term effects of and changes in -arrestin-2 following nonselective -blocker therapy. AIM: To investigate the expression and role of -Arrestin-2 in predicting the long-term response to nonselective -blockers in cirrhotic portal hypertensive patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 91 treatment-na?ve patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension. Baseline clinical and laboratory data were obtained. Gastroscopy was performed for grading and treating varices and obtaining gastric antral biopsies. We measured the serum and antral expression of -arrestin-2 and obtained Doppler measurement of the portal vein congestion index. Treatment with nonselective -blockers was then started. The patients were followed up for 18 mo, after which they have undergone a repeat antral biopsy and re-evaluation of the portal vein congestion index. RESULTS: A higher serum level and antral expression of -arrestin-2 was associated with longer bleeding-free intervals, greater reduction in the portal vein congestion index, and improved grade of varices. Among patients with a low -arrestin-2 expression, 17.6% were nonselective -blocker responders, whereas, among those with high expression, 95.1% were responders (P < 0.001). A serum -arrestin-2 value  2.23 ng/mL was associated with a lower likelihood of variceal bleeding (90% sensitivity and 71% specificity). -arrestin-2 expression significantly decreased after nonselective -blocker therapy. CONCLUSION: -arrestin-2 expression in cirrhotic portal hypertension predicts the clinical response to long-term nonselective -blocker treatment. Serum -arrestin-2 is a potential noninvasive biomarker for selecting the candidate patients for nonselective -blockers.","output":"-arrestin-2 predicts the clinical response to -blockers in cirrhotic portal hypertension patients: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Investigating the dynamic characteristics of serologic antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is of significance. Method Here, the dynamic changes and prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from symptoms onset to 210 days were described. Antibodies were detected by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Result For all patients, the average titers and positive rates of IgG/IgM within 30 days from symptoms onset reached to the peak and then began continuous decline. The titers and positive rates of IgG/IgM from symptoms 180 to 210 days remained 43.1  27.0 AU/mL/84.3% and 4.4  5.2 AU/mL/12.0%, respectively. Further statistical analysis revealed that the dynamic changes and prevalence in the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgG/IgM antibodies are mainly based on age and disease severity, not sex. The change trend of dynamic and prevalence of IgM antibody was similar as the description of IgG. Even so, the decline rate of IgM antibody is faster. The IgG level that reduced to 16.33  3.15 AU/mL might be a threshold value and should be alerted because the IgG level might become undetectable within 30 to 60 days when the IgG down to the threshold value.

Analysis of various cell cycle-regulatory proteins and cellular morphology indicated that there was a down-regulation of cyclins D1 and D2 (G1 regulatory cyclins) and that a proportion of virus-infected cells underwent aberrant cytokinesis, in which the cells underwent nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, division. We assessed the impact of the perturbations on the cell cycle for virus-infected cells and found that IBV-infected G2/M-phase-synchronized cells exhibited increased viral protein production when released from the block when compared to cells synchronized in the G0 phase or asynchronously replicating cells.

Rising water temperatures accommodate the immigration of warm-adapted species and endanger populations of cold ones. Increased temperature interacts with cultural eutrophication to extend the duration and extent of seasonal hypoxia. Higher regional temperatures threaten human health, particularly populations of poorer residents that lack refuge from heatwaves and flooding events. Acidification of the Bay, which is linked to climate change agents, endangers species that rely upon calcium carbonate for shell and skeleton. Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs, primarily CO(2), NO(2), CH(4)) from human economic activity drives climate change. The food system accounts for 25C30% of human GHGs emissions.

Currently available EBVS instruments use a scissor-like jaw configuration and closing mechanism, which causes decreasing compression pressure from the proximal to the distal end of the jaws. A new EBVS system is described here which utilizes a different instrument jaw configuration and closing mechanism to enable a more homogeneous pressure distribution despite longer instrument jaws. METHODS Results of jaw pressure distribution measurements as well as sealing experiments with subsequent burst pressure measurements ex vivo on bovine uterine arteries are demonstrated. Furthermore, an in vivo evaluation of the new EBVS system in a canine and porcine model including histological examination is presented. RESULTS The device revealed an even pressure distribution throughout the whole jaw length. The ex vivo burst pressure measurements revealed high average burst pressures, above 300 mmHg, independent of the outer diameter (1 to 7 mm) of the tested vessels. Histological evaluation of sealed vessels 21 days postoperatively demonstrated sealed and fused vessels without adjacent tissue damage.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study via use of a web-based questionnaire survey of dentists who were affiliated with the Dental Practice-based Research Network Japan (n = 297). To quantify the EPG on MID, we used a questionnaire that included 10 clinical questions or scenarios to assess concordance between dental practice and published evidence on MID. We evaluated concordance by coding responses to each question as consistent or inconsistent with the evidence. An overall concordance was then determined as percent of responses that were consistent with published evidence for 10 questions. Subsequently, multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between dentist characteristics and higher overall concordance (&#8805;median) with published evidence. RESULTS: Mean and median overall dentist-level concordance were both 60% (SD: 18, interquartile range: 50-75%).

Increased access to specialist care in a regional setting is an additional benefit. Variation in diagnostic accuracy of telehealth consultations may affect diagnosis and management. Therefore, our aim is to determine the diagnostic concordance of telemedicine for otolaryngology in an Australian regional setting with physical consultations. METHODS Retrospective review was conducted for all patients who received an initial telemedicine appointment over a 7-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in regional Victoria, Australia. Data were collected regarding initial diagnosis and management from telemedicine consultations, subsequent physical appointment findings and management and intraoperative findings. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (version 8.0, GraphPad). RESULTS Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were included. The most common conditions referred were for consideration of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy (44.0%). Overall diagnostic concordance of the initial referrer was 63.3% and for telephone appointments, it was 81.9%. Concordance of recommended treatment plans between telephone and physical appointments was 96.9%. CONCLUSION Although physical appointments are an essential aspect of practice in OHNS, there are significant benefits of phone only telemedicine within the context of a global pandemic which were compounded by a regional setting.

In Lebanon, this population is poorly studied and there is no poison center to which healthcare providers and the public can refer in case of toxicological exposure, leading to unnecessary Emergency Department (ED) visits. This study describes the pediatric toxicological exposures seen at the largest tertiary care center in Lebanon. It also evaluates the appropriateness of ED visits among confirmed or suspected toxicological exposures in children, in order to assess the role of a national poison center in reducing unnecessary ED visits. METHODS This is a secondary analysis of a database for a telephonic medical toxicology service at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, the largest tertiary care center in Lebanon. Data relating to all pediatric patients aged 0-19 years of age were entered into the database by the medical toxicology team. The cases were independently reviewed by 2 medical toxicologists for the adequacy of referral to the ED and performance of invasive procedures. RESULTS Two hundred and nine exposures were recorded between 15 April 2015 and 31 December 2019, of which 53.1% were females. Children aged less than 5 years were involved in 67.0% of cases while adolescents aged 13-19 years were involved in 21.1%. The most commonly involved substances were analgesics (14.8%) and cardiovascular drugs (10.0%). The majority had no (59.3%) or minor (26.3%) effects and were treated and discharged home (67.5%). More than a third of ED visits were deemed unnecessary by the toxicologists (Kappa = 0.705), and when including only unintentional cases, around 45% of the ED visits were deemed unnecessary (Kappa = 0.677). CONCLUSION Our data show that 37% of all pediatric poisoning ED visits and 45% of ED visits due to unintentional pediatric poisonings were unnecessary. Additionally, more often than not lavage suctions were done unnecessarily. Future research investigating the possibility of preventing unnecessary visits by establishing a national poison center is needed.","output":"Toxicological exposures among the pediatric patients at a tertiary care center in Lebanon: the case for establishing a national poison center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Despite low rates of bacterial coinfection in patients admitted with COVID-19, antimicrobials are frequently prescribed. Our primary objective was to evaluate antimicrobial prescribing over time in patients admitted with COVID-19. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the role of ID providers in antimicrobial utilization, describe the rate of confirmed bacterial infection and determine factors associated with empirical antimicrobial prescribing in COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review was performed for adult patients admitted to a tertiary care centre with COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 30 November 2020. Patient demographics, disease severity, risk factors for severe disease, clinical outcomes, antimicrobial prescribing and respiratory microbiological testing were collected and analysed. Prescribing trends were evaluated by month, and factors contributing to prescribing were established using univariate and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Antibiotics were prescribed during admission in 37.9% of the study cohort, with 85.1% of patients who received antibiotics having therapy initiated within 48 h of admission. Antibiotic prescribing incidence increased with disease. Over the study period, antimicrobial prescribing rates decreased by 8.7% per month. Multivariable analysis found ICU admission, obtainment of procalcitonin values, intubation, heart failure, haemodialysis and nursing home residence were associated with empirical antimicrobial prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing in patients with viral syndromes like COVID-19 continues to represent an area of concern. Antimicrobial stewardship efforts during COVID-19 should consider patient-specific factors associated with antibiotic prescribing. Recognition of such factors, in combination with application of well-established antimicrobial stewardship tactics, may serve to impact antimicrobial prescribing trends, even as patient volumes rise.","output":"A retrospective antibiotic prescribing assessment and examination of potential antibiotic stewardship targets in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"End of the year 2019 marks an unprecedented outbreak of a pandemic named COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2. It was first discovered in China and later spread to the whole world, currently inflicting almost 200 countries. After China, few other countries have emerged as potential epicenters of this disease including the US, Italy, Spain and Pakistan, as indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since proper preventive and curative measures in the form of a vaccine or medication are currently unavailable throughout the world, the only remedy devised to stop the spread of this virus is self-isolation. Such a measure necessitates ample awareness and understanding among people to avoid actions that lead to the spread of this virus. Pakistan is the fifth-most populous country in the world (212.2 million) and has a record of contagious outbreaks in the past. Therefore, it is key to evaluate the general understanding regarding the cause, spread and control of this disease in Pakistani population and acquire data to anticipate the possible spread and persistence of this disease to design relevant preventive measures. We have attempted to collect such data from professionals who are susceptible to acquiring the infection due to an unavoidable exposure. Keeping in view the current lock down, we have relied on an internet based collection of data by filling a self-designed questionnaire that is responded to by 1132. Descriptive and Frequency Analysis were performed on the responses received using MS Excel and SPSS software. A total of 1132 individuals responded to the questionnaire among which include academic (45.8%), non-academic (20.8%), healthcare (7.8%), security (5.9%) and other (19.7%) professionals. The questionnaire addressed the level of basic information regarding the cause, spread, cure and prevention of this disease among professionals, in an attempt to provide directions for awareness campaigns at different levels in Pakistan and provide a model for similar outbreaks in the future.To our expectations, almost after a month of the coronavirus outbreak in Pakistan, above 50% to up to 90% of the recorded responses against every question showed ample understanding regarding the cause, spread and control of the disease which is an indicator of effective public awareness campaigns throughout the country largely based on media drive.","output":"Knowledge, awareness and practices of Pakistani professionals amid-COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We researched clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in environmental samples from a recreation club in Brazil.

Mice are resistant to infections with primary BDV isolates, but certain laboratory strains can be adapted to replicate in mice. We determined the molecular basis of adaptation by studying mutations acquired by a cDNA-derived BDV strain during one brain passage in rats and three passages in mice. The adapted virus propagated efficiently in mouse brains and induced neurological disease. Its genome contained seven point mutations, three of which caused amino acid changes in the L polymerase (L1116R and N1398D) and in the polymerase cofactor P (R66K). Recombinant BDV carrying these mutations either alone or in combination all showed enhanced multiplication speed in Vero cells, indicating improved intrinsic viral polymerase activity rather than adaptation to a mouse-specific factor. Mutations R66K and L1116R, but not N1398D, conferred replication competence of recombinant BDV in mice if introduced individually. Virus propagation in mouse brains was substantially enhanced if both L mutations were present simultaneously, but infection remained mostly nonsymptomatic. Only if all three amino acid substitutions were combined did BDV replicate vigorously and induce early disease in mice. Interestingly, the virulence-enhancing effect of the R66K mutation in P could be attributed to reduced negative regulation of polymerase activity by the viral X protein. Our data demonstrate that BDV replication competence in mice is mediated by the polymerase complex rather than the viral envelope and suggest that altered regulation of viral gene expression can favor adaptation to new host species.","output":"Adaptation of Borna disease virus to new host species attributed to altered regulation of viral polymerase activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people throughout the world since December 2019. However, there is a limited amount of data about pediatric patients infected with the disease agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: The epidemiological, laboratory, radiological, and treatment features of the pediatric patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age of 81 children included in the study was 9.50 years (0C17.75 years). The most frequent symptoms at the time of admission were fever (58%), cough (52%), and fatigue or myalgia (19%). The abnormal laboratory findings in these cases were decreased lymphocytes (2.5%, n = 2), leucopenia (5%, n = 4), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (17.2%, n = 14), C-reactive protein (16%, n = 13), procalcitonin (3.7%, n = 3), and D-dimer (12.3%, n = 10). Three (4%) patients had consolidation in chest computed tomography, and three (4%) had ground-glass opacities. None of the patients needed intensive care except for the newborns. The median time to turn SARS-CoV-2 negative in the RT-PCR test was 5 (3C10) days. The median length of hospital stay was 5 (4C10) days. The time to turn SARS-CoV-2 negative in the RT-PCR test and the length of hospital stay were significantly longer for those aged five years or younger than others (P = 0.037, P = 0.01).

There is no need to direct the analysis to any identification before sequencing which can decrease the introduction of bias and false negatives results. It also allows the assessment of genetic aberrations in the genome (e.g., single nucleotide variants, deletions, insertions and copy number variants) including in noncoding protein regions. METHODS: The performance of four different random priming amplification methods to recover RNA viral genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 were compared in this study. In method 1 (H-P) the reverse transcriptase (RT) step was performed with random hexamers whereas in methods 2C4 RT incorporating an octamer primer with a known tag. In methods 1 and 2 (K-P) sequencing was applied on material derived from the RT-PCR step, whereas in methods 3 (SISPA) and 4 (S-P) an additional amplification was incorporated before sequencing. RESULTS: The SISPA method was the most effective and efficient method for non-targeted/random priming whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 that we tested. The SISPA method described in this study allowed for whole genome assembly of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in mixed samples. We determined the limit of detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 virus which was 10(3) pfu/ml (Ct, 22.4) for whole genome assembly and 10(1) pfu/ml (Ct, 30) for metagenomics detection. CONCLUSIONS: The SISPA method is predominantly useful for obtaining genome sequences from RNA viruses or investigating complex clinical samples as no prior sequence information is needed. It might be applied to monitor genomic virus changes, virus evolution and can be used for fast metagenomics detection or to assess the general picture of different pathogens within the sample.

Methods Four eligible lung transplant recipients with positive SARS-CoV2 PCR testing and mild-moderate illness received placebo or 1-2 weekly 700mg subcutaneous doses of leronlimab. Demographics, laboratory, radiologic, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Results Between March and May 2020, three single-lung transplant recipients received leronlimab and one received placebo for mild-moderate disease. The total median age was 63.5 years (range 59.0-73.0) with equal male and female participants. The median duration between transplant and COVID-19 diagnosis was 409 days (range 149-631). Three patients (75%) required hospitalization for a median of 3 days (range 2-4); however, none required mechanical ventilation or positive pressure support.

Here, we characterized a panel of 44 inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns, and coagulation-related factors, as well as markers of endothelial activation in 30 patients suffering from renal failure in the course of sepsis. All patients received continuous veno-venous hemodialysis with either high cut-off filters or with standard filters, and mediators were quantified for all patients at the initiation of dialysis and after 24 h and 48 h. Mediator concentrations in individual patients ranged widely, demonstrating the heterogeneity of sepsis patients. None of the mediators correlated with SAPS III or TISS scores. The overall in-hospital mortality of the study population was 56.7% (57.1% vs. 56.3% for high cut-off vs. standard filter). The two filter groups differed regarding most of the mediator levels at baseline, prohibiting conclusions regarding the effect of standard filters versus high cut-off filters on mediator depletion.

While the COVID-19 illness is largely associated with respiratory consequences, there is increased reporting of other organ-specific disease sequelae that include the skin. OBJECTIVE To identify, describe, and classify the main skin manifestations of COVID-19 and associated protocols for management. METHODS Forty-five patients from three clinical centers in North and South America with positive COVID-19 PCR and/or serology presenting cutaneous manifestations were included in this retrospective chart review. Medical history, biopsies, dermoscopy, laboratory findings, clinical photography, and disease management were documented. RESULTS Seven main types of cutaneous manifestations were identified: exanthema/molbilliform, urticaria, papular/pustular/vesicular, petechiae/purpura, livedo reticularis, chilblains, and alopecia. Histopathogical analysis from skin biopsies and/or dermoscopy highlighted an inflammatory or vascular pathophysiology depending on the type of manifestation. While the first three types of COVID-19 skin manifestations preceded or coincided with other symptoms such as anosmia, fever, chills, chilblains, and livedo were found in later disease stages. All cases had a positive resolution with appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS Cutaneous symptoms are part of the COVID-19 disease spectrum.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined by the presence and subsequent expansion of somatic, leukemia-associated driver mutations in apparently healthy individuals with normal blood counts. CHIP has been associated with increased inflammation, with cytokines such as IL1-b, IL6 and TNF-a being elevated at baseline in affected individuals. We hypothesized that the presence of CHIP in patients with COVID-19 would result in excessive inflammation-related mortality and morbidity. Methods: We used the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 database to identify patients with COVID-19 on whom peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were available for research use (IRB approved). We carried out target-capture next generation sequencing for 220 CH related genes, by previously described methods (1000 x coverage, variant allele fraction/VAF detection limit >0.5%; Kusne Y et al AJH 2021). CHIP was defined by the presence of a CH mutation with a VAF>1% in an individual with normal baseline blood counts. Demographics, blood counts, and inflammatory markers (CRP and cytokine levels- ELISA assay) at COVID-19 diagnosis and during follow-up (as clinically indicated) were collected. COVID-19 disease severity was classified based on the presence and severity of CRS, graded using the Penn Grading Scale (Porter et. al., 2018), and the WHO ordinal scale (WHO Blueprint, 2020). We used Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare categorical and continuous variables. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. We accounted for differences in age and sex using multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards regression models. Results: Seventy-two CHIP mutations were detected in 56 (25%) of the 227 patients with COVID-19 that had PBMC available; median age 69 years (range; 42-99 years), 61% male. Fifteen (26%) patients had 2 CHIP mutations, while 1 patient had 3 CHIP mutations. Common mutations encountered included DNMT3A (32%) , TET2 (19%) , SF3B1 (8%) , ASXL1 (6%) , MPL (5%) , and TP53 (5%; Figure 1A). COVID-19 patients with CHIP were older in age (median 69 vs 57 years; p<0.0001) and had higher baseline MCP-1 (p=0.04) levels. However, there were no differences in sex, comorbidities, blood counts, IL1-b, IL6 and TNF-a levels between the two groups. The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 9 months. The relative change from baseline in blood counts and inflammatory markers (CRP and cytokines) during follow-up was similar in CHIP and non-CHIP patients, with the exception that COVID-19-onset neutropenia was more common in CHIP patients (8% vs 1%; p=0.017) compared to those without CHIP. At last follow up neutropenia had resolved in all patients. Both groups had comparable number of patients with CRS (61% CHIP vs 53% non-CHIP patients, p=0.354, Figure 1B), however, CHIP patients had more severe CRS (median Penn Grade 3 versus 2 in non-CHIP, p=0.018, Figure 1C). Based on the WHO ordinal scale, CHIP patients were more likely to experience hospitalization with severe disease and death (61% versus 45% in non-CHIP, p = 0.049). Moreover, COVID-19 CHIP patients experienced worse overall survival in comparison to patients without CHIP (median 13.1 months vs not reached, p<0.001, Figure 1D). This association remained consistent after adjusting for age and sex at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (HR 3.15, 95% 1.32 - 7.55, p = 0.010). At last follow-up, 22 deaths were documented: 13 (23%) in patients with CHIP and 9 (5%) in the non-CHIP group (p=0.02), with the primary cause for mortality being hypoxic respiratory failure (62% in CHIP vs 44% non-CHIP, p=0.04). Conclusions: In this study, we observe an age-independent impact of CHIP on COVID-19 associated inflammatory morbidity (CRS) and mortality (hypoxemic respiratory failure). We are currently carrying out detailed single cell (ssDNA, RNA and ATAC-seq) and proteomic studies (O-link PEA assays) to better elucidate this pathophysiology.

DI particles and related satellite genomes of the plant RNA viruses are generated by a wide variety of animal, plant, and fungal viruses. The ubiquity of DI viruses was first clearly recognized by Huang and Baltimore. They proposed and defined the term DI particle to include defective viruses containing only some portion of the infectious virus genome, requiring homologous parental virus as a helper for the replication, containing virus structural proteins and antigens, and exhibiting the capacity to replicate preferentially at the expense of infectious helper virus in cells infected by both. Satellite RNAs of plants are small RNAs that usually share little or no homology with their helper viruses, although some do exhibit some sequence homology with their helper viruses, and thus resemble DI particles in at least a portion of their genomes. Depending on the leaving sites and resumption sites, DI particles can be produced that are simple internal deletions of the virus genome, simple deletions with a new terminus, or complex or bizarre genomes with multiple rearrangements of the virus segments. DI viruses and defective viruses generally are widespread in nature.

Bivariate analysis with chi-square testing compared categorical variables associated with vaccine willingness. RESULTS: Of 401 respondents, 70.1% were willing to receive an authorized COVID-19 vaccination if it was available to them, 22.7% were unsure, and 7.2% were unwilling. The most frequent concern for those unsure was vaccine safety.

METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, done at 43 centres in France, we randomly assigned patients (1:1) receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for up to 72 h with PCR confirmed COVID-19 and associated moderate-to-severe ARDS to receive either IVIG (2 g/kg over 4 days) or placebo. Random assignment was done with a web-based system and was stratified according to the participating centre and the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation before inclusion in the trial (<12 h, 12C24 h, and >24C72 h), and treatment was administered within the first 96 h of invasive mechanical ventilation. To minimise the risk of adverse events, the IVIG administration was divided into four perfusions of 05 g/kg each administered over at least 8 hours. Patients in the placebo group received an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 09% (10 mL/kg) over the same period. The primary outcome was the number of ventilation-free days by day 28, assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04350580.

INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechanical ventilation for moderate-to-severe ARDS, IVIG did not improve clinical outcomes at day 28 and tended to be associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse events, although not significant. The effect of IVIGs on earlier disease stages of COVID-19 should be assessed in future trials.

There is a question asked to ourselves whether it is possible to return to normalcy? To do this, a risk-free environment must be developed. COVID-19 virus spreads through the respiratory mainly from infected persons who come in close contact with other beings. Wearing a Face Mask will act as a physical barrier for these respiratory droplets. The main aim of this research paper is to create a face mask detection system using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV that identifies whether or not a person is wearing a mask by monitoring a live video feed and notifying them with a beep sound. An alert system has been integrated with face mask detection system in three phases. In the first phase, the dataset is trained with CNN (using Keras/TensorFlow) with an accuracy of 98.38%. The second phase is focused on identifying whether a person is wearing a mask on a live video stream using Haar Cascade Classifier. In the third phase, the alert system is developed. If a person is detected not wearing a mask, he/she gets alerted via beep sound. This face mask detection system can be used at the entrance of universities, airports, hotels, public buildings, Railway Stations, or any major places huge crowds are expected. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Alert System for Face Mask Detection using CNN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Despite widespread use of flow diverters (FDs) to treat aneurysms, the exact healing mechanism associated with FDs remains poorly understood. We aim to describe the healing process of aneurysms treated using FDs by demonstrating the histopathologic progression in a canine aneurysm model. Methods Twenty-one side wall aneurysms were created in common carotid artery of eight dogs and treated with two different FDs. Angiographic follow-ups were done immediately after placement of the device, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At last follow-up, the aneurysm and the device-implanted parent artery were harvested. Results Histopathologic findings of aneurysms at 4 weeks follow-up showed intra-aneurysm thrombus formation in laminating fashion, and neointimal thickening at the mid-segment of aneurysm. However, there are inhomogenous findings in aneurysms treated with the same type of FD showing same angiographic outcomes. At 12 weeks, aneurysms of complete and near-complete occlusion revealed markedly shrunken aneurysm filled with organized connective tissues with thin neointima. Aneurysms of incomplete occlusion at 12 weeks showed small amount of organized thrombus around fringe neck and large empty space with thick neointmal formation. Neointimal thickness and diameter stenosis was not significantly different between the groups of FD specification and follow-up period. Conclusion Intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation and organization seem to be an important factor for the complete occlusion of aneurysms treated using the FD. Neointimal formation could occur along the struts of the FD independently of intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation. However, neointimal formation could not solely lead to complete aneurysm healing.","output":"Healing of Aneurysm after Treatment Using Flow Diverter Stent : Histopathological Study in Experimental Canine Carotid Side Wall Aneurysm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of severe acute respiratory failure, including the acute respiratory distress syndrome, has become better defined in recent years in light of emerging high-quality evidence and technological advances.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, however, has highlighted deficiencies in organizational capacity, research capability, knowledge sharing and resource utilization. While governments, medical societies, hospital systems and clinicians were collectively unprepared for the scope of this pandemic, the use of ECMO - a highly resource-intensive and specialized form of life support - presented specific logistical and ethical challenges. As the pandemic has evolved, there has been greater collaboration in the use of ECMO across centers and regions, along with more robust data-reporting through international registries and observational studies. Nevertheless, centralization of ECMO capacity is lacking in many regions of the world and equitable use of ECMO resources remains uneven. There are no widely available mechanisms to conduct large-scale, rigorous clinical trials in real-time. In this Critical Care Perspective, we outline lessons learned during COVID-19 and prior respiratory pandemics in which ECMO was used, and how we might apply these lessons going forward both during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as in the future.","output":"ECMO During Respiratory Pandemics: Past, Present, and Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has direct and indirect effects on cardiovascular system which may be due to myocardial injury from hemodynamic derangement or hypoxemia, inflammatory myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, microvascular dysfunction /thrombosis due to hypercoagulability, or cytokine storm causing destabilization of coronary artery plaques. The vascular impact will be greater in patients who have preexisting CAD. Here, we report a patient with COVID 19 disease with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) who developed acute STEMI in spite of prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Case Description - A 67 year old male with significant CAD s/p CABG X 5 and PCI with 18 stents, DM II, HTN presented with dyspnea, fever and non productive cough. He tested positive for Covid19 and found to have bilateral infiltrates on chest X ray and elevated inflammatory markers. Patient was hypoxic requiring 80 % High-flow nasal oxygen supplementation. His D dimer levels on admission was normal around 250 and his serial D dimer were in range of 250-310, with no evidence of venous thromboembolism on ultrasound of lower extremities. He was started on prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin. On Day 9, patient was found to have apical and anterior STEMI. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated significant thrombus burden with occluded left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, occluded sephanous vein graft, occluded left anterior descending artery, occluded right coronary artery and left main with 90% occlusion. Percutaneous coronary intervention was deemed futile and not attempted in presence of mixed, refractory shock and profound respiratory failure. Patient died shortly thereafter. Discussion - Our patient developed severe acute coronary artery thrombosis in spite of prophylactic enoxaparin. The American Society of Hematology and CHEST guidelines suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate or therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID19 who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE). Our case highlights the fact that in COVID 19 affected patients with significant CAD, therapeutic anticoagulation should be seriously considered in spite of absence of randomized evidence and a normal D dimer doesn't necessarily preclude this risk.","output":"ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in COVID-19: Redefining Anticoagulation Guidelines - Is Full Dose Anticoagulation Indicated in High Risk Patients to Prevent Thrombotic Coronary Artery Disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transposons are genomic elements that can relocate within a host genome using a cut- or copy-and-paste mechanism. They make up a significant part of many genomes, serve as a driving force for genome evolution, and are linked with Mendelian diseases and cancers. Interactions between two specific retrotransposon types, autonomous (e.g., LINE1/L1) and nonautonomous (e.g., Alu), may lead to fluctuations in the number of these transposons in the genome over multiple cell generations. We developed and examined a simple model of retrotransposon dynamics under conditions where transposon replication machinery competed for cellular resources: namely, free ribosomes and available energy (i.e., ATP molecules). Such competition is likely to occur in stress conditions that a malfunctioning cell may experience as a result of a malignant transformation. The modeling revealed that the number of actively replicating LINE1 and Alu elements in a cell decreases with the increasing competition for resources; however, stochastic effects interfere with this simple trend. We stochastically simulated the transposon dynamics in a cell population and showed that the population splits into pools with drastically different transposon behaviors. The early extinction of active Alu elements resulted in a larger number of LINE1 copies occurring in the first pool, as there was no competition between the two types of transposons in this pool. In the other pool, the competition process remained and the number of L1 copies was kept small. As the level of available resources reached a critical value, both types of dynamics demonstrated an increase in noise levels, and both the period and the amplitude of predatorCprey oscillations rose in one of the cell pools. We hypothesized that the presented dynamical effects associated with the impact of the competition for cellular resources inflicted on the dynamics of retrotransposable elements could be used as a characteristic feature to assess a cell state, or to control the transposon activity.","output":"Stochastic Effects in Retrotransposon Dynamics Revealed by Modeling under Competition for Cellular Resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Leukoreduction to eliminate mononuclear cells within blood products is necessary to prevent graft-versus-host disease after transfusion. Published reports document low concentrations of mononuclear cells leftover in fresh-frozen plasma products, however the phenotype and the proliferative potential of these cells has not been tested. MATERIALS AND METHODS We investigated residual cellular components contained within fresh and fresh-frozen plasma products and characterised their proliferative potential in co-cultures with unrelated allogeneic cells. We designed a flow-based assay to phenotype cells and quantify cell division by measuring the dilution of fluorescently labeled protein as cells divide. Leukocytes from consenting donors were purified from fresh liquid or fresh-frozen plasma units and cultured for three to seven days with unrelated irradiated allogeneic targets. RESULTS We discovered a median of 1.6107 viable lymphocytes were detectable in fresh plasma units after collection (n=8), comprised of a mixture of CD3+ CD8+ and CD3+ CD4+ cells. Furthermore, we identified a median of 8.4% of live CD3+ plasma lymphocytes divided as early as Day 4 when co-cultured with unrelated allogeneic cells, expanding to a median 88.8% by Day 7 (n=3). Although freezing the plasma product reduced the total number of viable leukocyte cells down to 2.3105 (n=10), residual naive CD3+ cells were viable and demonstrated division through Day 7 of co-culture.

The clinical data suggest that platelet hyperactivity plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 from its onset and that platelets may serve critical functions during COVID-19 progression. Hyperactivation of blood platelets and the coagulation system are emerging as important drivers of inflammation and may be linked to the severity of the 'cytokine storm' induced in severe cases of COVID-19, in which disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet hyperactivity are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality. We propose that targeting platelet hyperactivity in the early stages of COVID-19 infection may reduce the immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19 and subdue the systemic inflammatory response. Lowering baseline platelet activity may be of particular importance for higher-risk groups. As an alternative to antiplatelet drugs, an inappropriate intervention in public health, we propose that the dietary antiplatelet agent Fruitflow?, derived from tomatoes, may be considered a suitable therapy.

In order to effectively encourage it among adolescents, it is necessary to understand the associated mental mechanisms. Health behavior theories suggest that emotions, personality, motivation, and moral disengagement could all play a role. On the basis of a longitudinal study, we investigated the importance of these factors in predicting PDB. METHODS: The participants were 347 adolescents residing in Italy. Data were collected in four waves starting from 1 year before the pandemic. A structural equation model based on health behavior theory was tested. RESULTS: After the COVID-19 national lockdown, adolescents experienced fewer positive emotions and more negative emotions compared with 1 year earlier. Nevertheless, these emotional changes, and adolescents personality (except for openness to experiences), were not related to the adoption of PDB. Instead, the autonomous motivation of adolescents significantly predicted a higher likelihood to adopt PDB by increasing the intention to engage in this behavior and, more indirectly, by substantially decreasing moral disengagement, which was negatively related to PDB. In contrast, controlled motivation corresponded to significantly higher levels of moral disengagement and predicted less likelihood of adopting PDB. CONCLUSIONS: Messages and interventions targeted at adolescents should be oriented towards supporting autonomy, emphasizing the personal and social value of PDB. Communications should avoid the use of coercive strategies based on eliciting emotions such as shame and guilt in adolescents who do not adopt PDB, which appear to trigger off mechanisms of moral disengagement.","output":"Physical Distancing Behavior: The Role of Emotions, Personality, Motivations, and Moral Decision-Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotional exhaustion in the workplace can cause employees psychological and physical health problems, affect work performance, and create burdens for the organization.

METHODS: Upon IRB approval, consecutive laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients aged 50 years or older who were referred for chest CT scan and had same-day normal CXR were invited to participate in this prospective study. First, a standard-dose chest CT scan (150 mAs) was performed. Only if typical COVID-19 pneumonia features were identified, then a low-dose CT (30 mAs) was done immediately. Diagnostic accuracy of low-dose and standard-dose CT in the detection of typical COVID-19 pneumonia features were compared. RESULTS: Twenty patients with a mean age of 64.20  13.8 were enrolled in the study.

METHODS Data of all eligible patients who received endovascular treatment (EVT) for ICA occlusion using Penumbra aspiration catheters between January 2015 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. After dividing into two groups according to use of penumbra ACE68, baseline characteristics of patients, successful recanalization rate, puncture to recanalization time, and switch to stent base technique rate were assessed. Successful recanalization was defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score 2b and favorable functional outcome was defined according to modified Rankin scale (score, 0-2). RESULTS ACE68 reperfusion catheter was used in 29 of 75 eligible patients (39%). The puncture to recanalization time was significantly shorter (2618.2 minutes vs. 4024.9 minutes, p=0.011) and the rate of switch to stent-based retrieval was significantly lower (3% vs. 20%, p=0.046) in ACE68 catheter group. Moreover, although not statistically significant, the successful recanalization rate was higher (83% vs. 76%, p=0.492) in ACE68 catheter group.

The objective of this study was to compare maternal outcomes of women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infections who underwent cesarean births. Study Design: This was a matched cohort study of pregnant women who had a cesarean birth between March 15 and May 20, 2020. Cases included women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. For every case, two patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were matched by maternal age, gestational age, body mass index, primary or repeat cesarean birth, and whether the procedure was scheduled or unscheduled. We compared rates of adverse post cesarean complications (intraoperative bladder or bowel injury, estimated blood loss greater than or equal to 1000 mL, hemoglobin drop more than 3 g/dL, hematocrit drop more than 10%, need for blood transfusion, need for hysterectomy, maternal intensive care unit admission, postoperative fever, and development of surgical site infection), with the primary outcome being a composite of those outcomes. We also assessed duration of postoperative stay. Fisher exact tests were performed to compare the primary outcome between both groups. Results: Between March and May 2020, 202 women who subsequently underwent cesarean birth were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of those 202, 43 (21.3%) patients were positive. They were matched to 86 patients who tested negative. There was no significant difference in the rate of composite adverse surgical outcomes between groups (SARS-CoV-2 infected 27.9%, SARS-CoV-2 uninfected 25.6%;p=.833) (Table 1). There was a higher rate of postoperative fevers (20.9% vs. 5.8%;p=.015), but that did not result in a longer length of stay (p=.302) (Table 2).

METHODS: This multi-center, retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to four hospitals in Hubei Province, China, from 31 December, 2019 to 31 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to their exposure to RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy within 48 hours of admission. Mixed-effect Cox model and Logistic regression were used to explore the association between early treatments of RBV/IFN-&#945; with primary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2037 patients eventually included, 1281 patients received RBV/IFN-&#945; (RBV alone/IFN-&#945; alone/RBV combined with IFN-&#945;) treatments and 756 patients received none of these treatments. In mixed effect model, RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy was not associated with progression from non-severe into severe type (aHR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.88-1.36) or with reduction in 30-day mortality (aHR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.61-1.30).

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 137 patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia who were discharged from the Enze Hospital, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) from January 31 2020 to March 11 2020 was conducted. Follow-up occurred 2 weeks after hospital discharge, during which patients underwent a pulmonary function test. RESULTS: Of the 137 patients who underwent a pulmonary function test 2 weeks after discharge, 51.8% were male, and the mean age was 47 years. Only 19.7% of the patients were identified as having severe COVID-19-induced pneumonia. The pulmonary function tests showed that for a small number of patients the forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC)/% values were <70%, and the mean forced inspiratory volume (IVC) and FVC values were 2.40.7 and 3.20.8 L, respectively. In severe cases, 88.9% of patients had an IVC <80% of the predicted value, and 55.6% of patients had an FVC <80% of the predicted value. The proportion of patients with maximum expiratory flow rate at 25%, 50% and 75% of the vital capacity (MEF25, MEF50, and MEF75) values <70% were 55.6%, 40.7%, and 25.9%, respectively.

A retrospective outcome study was performed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent echocardiography (n=380) at the West Branch of the Union Hospital, Wuhan, China and in patients admitted to Kings Health Partners in South London, United Kingdom. Association of EF1 with survival was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. EF1 was compared in patients with COVID-19 and in historical controls with similar comorbidities (n=266) who had undergone echocardiography before the COVID-19 pandemic. In patients with COVID-19, EF1 was a strong predictor of survival in each patient group (Wuhan and London). In the combined group, EF1 was a stronger predictor of survival than other clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics including age, comorbidities, and biochemical markers. A cutoff value of 25% for EF1 gave a hazard ratio of 5.23 ([95% CI, 2.85C9.60]; P<0.001) unadjusted and 4.83 ([95% CI, 2.35C9.95], P<0.001) when adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, hs-cTnI (high-sensitive cardiac troponin), and CRP (C-reactive protein).

METHODS: We developed an individual-based transmission model to simulate transmission of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 among a synthetic population, representative of Bay Area cities. We parameterized the model using community contact rates from vaccinated households ascertained from a household survey of Bay Area families with children conducted between February C April, 2021. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: We evaluated the additional infections in students and teachers/staff resulting over a 128-day semester from in-school instruction compared to remote instruction when various NPIs (mask use, cohorts, and weekly testing of students/teachers) were implemented in schools, across various community-wide vaccination coverages (50%, 60%, 70%), and student (12 years) and teacher/staff vaccination coverages (50% C 95%). We quantified the added benefit of universal masking over masking among unvaccinated students and teachers, across varying levels of vaccine effectiveness (45%, 65%, 85%), and compared results between Delta and Alpha variant circulation. RESULTS: The Delta variant sharply increases the risk of within-school COVID-transmission when compared to the Alpha variant. In our highest risk scenario (50% community and within-school vaccine coverage, no within-school NPIs, and predominant circulation of the Delta variant), we estimated that an elementary school could see 33C65 additional symptomatic cases of COVID-19 over a four-month semester (depending on the relative susceptibility of children <10 years). In contrast, under the Bay Area reopening plan (universal mask use, community and school vaccination coverage of 70%), we estimated excess symptomatic infection attributable to school reopening among 2.0C9.7% of elementary students (8C36 excess symptomatic cases per school over the semester), 3.0% of middle school students (13 cases per school) and 0.4% of high school students (3 cases per school). Excess rates among teachers attributable to reopening were similar. Achievement of lower risk tolerances, such as <5 excess infections per 1,000 students or teachers, required a cohort approach in elementary and middle school populations. In the absence of NPIs, increasing the vaccination coverage of community members from 50% to 70% or elementary teachers from 70% to 95% reduced the estimated excess rate of infection among elementary school students attributable to school transmission by 24% and 41%, respectively. We estimated that with 70% coverage of the eligible community and school population with a vaccine that is 65% effective, universal masking can avert more cases than masking of unvaccinated persons alone. CONCLUSIONS: Amidst circulation of the Delta variant, our findings demonstrated that schools are not inherently low risk, yet can be made so with high community vaccination coverages and universal masking. Vaccination of adult community members and teachers protects unvaccinated elementary and middle school children. Elementary and middle schools that can support additional interventions, such as cohorts and testing, should consider doing so, particularly if additional studies find that younger children are equally as susceptible as adults to the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. LIMITATIONS: We did not consider the effect of social distancing in classrooms, or variation in testing frequency, and considerable uncertainty remains in key transmission parameters.","output":"Model-based assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant transmission dynamics within partially vaccinated K-12 school populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychosocial health can influence the development and experience of several chronic diseases, and has been negatively affected for many individuals amid the COVID-19 global pandemic.

A total of 1,097 participants residing in California who responded to at least one of three COVID-19 surveys were included in this analysis. Linear and generalized mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate relationships between individual contemplative practice behaviors (CPB) (embodied observing meditation, non-reactive mindfulness meditation, self-compassion cultivation, cultivation of compassion for others) and four psychosocial outcomes measured in the original WELL questionnaire (resilience, dealing with stress, positive emotions, and negative emotions). In addition, the associations between CPB and depression, distress, and compliance with local Shelter-In-Place orders were also investigated. Participants who engaged in any contemplative practice reported significantly more resilience and positive emotions, dealing better with stress, lower distress, and were less likely to report an experience with depression in the last week. Similar findings held when CPB was modeled as a continuous variable. Significant interactions between the duration of the SIP and CPB were also observed for resilience and SIP compliance outcomes, indicating that steeper declines were observed among participants with little or no CPB across the study period.

Materials and Methods: A total of 84 patients (mean age: 67.3 years 15) with moderate-to-severe pneumonia on chest tomography at the time of diagnosis were included in the study, of which 51 (61%) were males and 33 (39%) were females. Initial and follow-up CT scans averaged 8.3 days  2.2 and 112.1 days  14.6 after symptom onset, respectively. Participants were recorded in two groups as those with and without fibrotic-like changes such as traction bronchiectasis, fibrotic - parenchymal bands, honeycomb appearance according to 3-6 months follow-up CT scans. Differences between the groups were evaluated with a two-sampled t-test. Logistic regression analyzes were performed to determine independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like sequelae changes. Result: On follow-up CTs, fibrotic-like changes were observed in 29 (35%) of the 84 participants (Group 1), while the remaining 55 (65%) showed complete radiological recovery (Group 2).

This study addresses the question of whether clinical variability in PRRS results from (a) genetic variation among viral isolates and/or (b) variation in management practices among farms on which isolates are found. Genetic data (open reading frame 5 gene sequences) and data on farm characteristics and associated clinical disease signs were collected for 62 PRRS virus (PRRSV) field isolates, representing 52 farms. Clinical disease signs were interrelated  confirming that a true reproductive syndrome exists (involving abortions, infertility in sows, deaths of sows and preweaning mortality). Pairs of farms experiencing deaths in their sow populations also tended to share viral isolates which were more similar to one another than expected by chance alone. This implies that sow death (one of the more-severe manifestations of PRRS) is under genetic influence. Large herd size was a significant risk factor for the death of sows and for respiratory disease in nursery pigs. All-inCall-out management practices in the nursery were protective against reproductive signs in the sow herd. All-inCall-out management practices in the finishing stages of production were protective against respiratory disease in nursery pigs  but were paradoxically associated with an increased risk of infertility in sows. These results suggest that farm-management practices can also influence which PRRS clinical signs are manifested during an outbreak. In general, signs associated with PRRS appear to result from a combination of genetic factors and herd-management characteristics. The relative contributions of these two influences differ depending on the specific clinical sign in question.","output":"Associations between genetics, farm characteristics and clinical disease in field outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected young population all over the world.

Neutrophils extrude extracellular nets which are histone- and protease-coated web-like DNA structures, activate coagulation and platelets, and release radicals and proteases such as elastase. The unique phylogenetically ancient and \\"versatile\\" inhibitor &#945;2 -M contributes particularly during childhood to the antithrombin activity of plasma, binds a broad spectrum of proteases and interacts with other mediators of inflammation such as cytokines. It is suggested that the scope of basic research and clinical studies would include the potential role of &#945;2 -M in COVID-19.","output":"Thromboinflammation in COVID-19: Can 2 -Macroglobulin Help to Control the Fire?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly emerged coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2) and the disease that it causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have changed the world we know.

In Ethiopia, its prevalence is low, but it results in devastative health problems of the mother and her baby. Even though the Ethiopian government and nongovernmental organizations tried to strengthen the health care system, significant adverse maternal and fetal outcome is still associated with uterine rupture. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of uterine rupture in Jinka and Arba Minch General Hospitals. METHODS The study was conducted in Jinka and Arba Minch General Hospitals, and the data collection period was 15 to 30 November 2018. A case-control study design was used with simple random sampling of 1:4. Data were collected using data extraction sheets. Variables with p < 0.25 in bivariate logistic regression were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Variables with p < 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression were used to determine significant association between dependent and independent variables. RESULT Uterine rupture occurred in 112 cases with 448 controls. Women referred from health facilities (adjusted odds ratio = 8.0, 95% confidence interval: 3.5-17.8), multiparous women (adjusted odds ratio = 12.7, 95% confidence interval: 4.2-39.0), duration of labor more than 18 h (adjusted odds ratio = 11.5, 95% confidence interval: 5.5-24.1), malpresentation (adjusted odds ratio = 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-8.0) and gestational age of ?37 weeks (adjusted odds ratio = 5.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-19.3) were independent factors associated with uterine rupture.

Perceptions of COVID-19 among Indonesian citizens were assessed 2 months after the first reported case in the country. The study used an online survey tool, which was adapted from a standardized questionnaire for risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak. The questions of the survey involved respondents' perceived level of knowledge, preparedness, efficacy of control measures, newness, infectiousness, seriousness, motivating and hindering factors, and effectiveness of prevention methods, as well as questions that assessed actual level of knowledge of respondents such as causative agents, modes of transmission, number of total cases, and available control measures. A total of 1,043 respondents participated in this study. The main sources of information of respondents were social media (85.2%) and online news (82.2%). Nearly all respondents were aware that COVID-19 is a viral disease with saliva droplets (97.1%) and contaminated surfaces (86.5%) being its main modes of transmission. Participants showed a good level of knowledge pertaining to control measures, an adequate level of belief toward their efficacy, and a willingness to implement such measures. More than 95% of the respondents perceived COVID-19 to be either serious or very serious. However, the level of anxiety among respondents was moderate, suggesting the presence of risk tolerance in the community. Individual characteristics such as gender, educational background, and occupation were found to have a statistically significant relationship with risk perception and tolerance, but voluntary participation in control measures was high and similar.

This is particularly true in cases where recognition requires integration of patient information from different sources, or where disease presentation can be heterogeneous and the recognition step may be easier for some patients than for others. METHODS: We propose a general data-driven metric for clinician recognition that accounts for the variability in patient disease severity and for institutional standards. As a case study, we evaluate the ventilatory management of 362 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at a large academic hospital, because clinician recognition of ARDS has been identified as a major barrier to adoption to evidence-based ventilatory management. We calculate our metric for the 48 critical care physicians caring for these patients and examine the relationships between differences in ARDS recognition performance from overall institutional levels and provider characteristics such as demographics, social network position, and self-reported barriers and opinions. RESULTS: Our metric was found to be robust to patient characteristics previously demonstrated to affect ARDS recognition, such as disease severity and patient height. Training background was the only factor in this study that showed an association with physician recognition. Pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) training was associated with higher recognition ( = 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.46C0.80, p < 7  10(? 5)). Non-PCCM physicians recognized ARDS cases less frequently and expressed greater satisfaction with the ability to get the information needed for making an ARDS diagnosis (p < 5  10(? 4)), suggesting that lower performing clinicians may be less aware of institutional barriers. CONCLUSIONS: We present a data-driven metric of clinician disease recognition that accounts for variability in patient disease severity and for institutional standards. Using this metric, we identify two unique physician populations with different intervention needs. One population consistently recognizes ARDS and reports barriers vs one does not and reports fewer barriers.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. SEARCH METHODS Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding preprocedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies, and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. We assessed heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years. Eight studies had high risk of bias; eight had unclear risk of bias. No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). Two studies measured contamination per volume of air sampled at different distances from the patient's mouth, and 14 studies sampled particles on agar plates at specific distances from the patient's mouth. The results presented below should be interpreted with caution as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the 'minimal clinically important difference' in CFU. High-volume evacuator Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot (~ 30 cm) from a patient's mouth (MD -47.41, 95% CI -92.76 to -2.06; 3 RCTs, 122 participants (two studies had split-mouth design); very high heterogeneity I2 = 95%), but not at longer distances (MD -1.00, -2.56 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 80 participants). One split-mouth RCT (six participants) found that HVE may not be more effective than conventional dental suction (saliva ejector or low-volume evacuator) at 40 cm (MD CFU -2.30, 95% CI -5.32 to 0.72) or 150 cm (MD -2.20, 95% CI -14.01 to 9.61). Dental isolation combination system One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector (low-volume evacuator) during AGPs (MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.20) or after AGPs (MD -0.35, -0.99 to 0.29). However, an 'n of 1' design study showed that the combination system may reduce CFU compared with rubber dam plus HVE (MD -125.20, 95% CI -174.02 to -76.38) or HVE (MD -109.30, 95% CI -153.01 to -65.59). Rubber dam One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) receiving dental treatment, found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one-metre (MD -16.20, 95% CI -19.36 to -13.04) and two-metre distance (MD -11.70, 95% CI -15.82 to -7.58). One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead (MD 0.98, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.70) and occipital region of the operator (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.46 to 2.00). One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest (MD -251.00, 95% CI -267.95 to -234.05) and dental unit light (MD -12.70, 95% CI -12.85 to -12.55). Air cleaning systems One split-mouth CCT (two participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation (MD -66.70 CFU, 95% CI -120.15 to -13.25 per cubic metre) or ultrasonic scaling (MD -32.40, 95% CI - 51.55 to -13.25). Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor (MD -483.56 CFU, 95% CI -550.02 to -417.10 per cubic feet per minute per patient) and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth (MD -319.14 CFU, 95% CI - 385.60 to -252.68). Disinfectants ? antimicrobial coolants Two RCTs evaluated use of antimicrobial coolants during ultrasonic scaling. Compared with distilled water, coolant containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU: CHX (MD -124.00, 95% CI -135.78 to -112.22; 20 participants), povidone iodine (MD -656.45, 95% CI -672.74 to -640.16; 40 participants), cinnamon (MD -644.55, 95% CI -668.70 to -620.40; 40 participants). CHX coolant may reduce CFU more than povidone iodine (MD -59.30, 95% CI -64.16 to -54.44; 20 participants), but not more than cinnamon extract (MD -11.90, 95% CI -35.88 to 12.08; 40 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using colony-forming units. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions evaluated but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions. We did not find any studies on methods such as ventilation, ionization, ozonisation, UV light and fogging. Studies are needed that measure contamination in aerosols, size distribution of aerosols and infection transmission risk for respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 in dental patients and staff.","output":"Interventions to reduce contaminated aerosols produced during dental procedures for preventing infectious diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread across the world. As of April 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 140,000,000 and caused more than 3,000,000 deaths globally. In November 2020, the monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab was approved by the FDA for non-hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) who possessed risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19. This provided a treatment option that may help prevent hospitalization. METHODS: Patients who regularly received ambulatory care at a military treatment facility and who were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and possessed risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 were treated with a single, intravenous infusion (700 mg) of the virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab. The primary outcome was improvement of self-reported symptoms within 24 to 72 hours of receiving the infusion. The secondary outcome was prevention of disease progression requiring emergency department (ED) utilization or hospitalization related to COVID-19 within 30 days of infusion. Bamlanivimab was administered in accordance with the FDA's approval and Defense Health Agency's guidance, including follow-up within 72 hours of administration. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained. RESULTS: Of the COVID-19 patients who were given the option of a bamlanivimab infusion, 40 accepted and 6 did not (40/46, 86.9%). Thirty-six of 40 patients in the treatment group were contacted within 72 hours. ED/hospitalization information was available for all 46 patients. In the treatment group, 94.4% (34/36) reported global improvement. Three of 40 (7.5%) patients in the treatment group required inpatient admission, and 2 of 40 patients (5%) required ED evaluation within 30 days of infusion. Therefore, 5 of 40 (12.5%) patients required evaluation shortly after infusion, while 2 of 6 (33.3%) patients who declined treatment required hospital evaluation or admission related to COVID-19 within 30 days of infusion (P = .15). CONCLUSIONS: Global improvement of symptoms within 24 to 72 hours of infusion was reported by 94.4% of patients receiving bamlanivimab; however, statistical significance could not be determined due to the small sample size and lack of placebo group due to study design. Furthermore, ED visits and hospital admissions were analyzed, but with only six patients in the comparison group, the relative risk was not statistically significant and could not be precisely estimated. In the future, this study can be replicated with both larger control/treatment arms to validate the initial results of this small, retrospective, cohort study.","output":"Bamlanivimab Use in a Military Treatment Facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The virus has rapidly spread to humans, causing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Enormous progress in finding therapies has been made, but an effective therapy is still absent. In this study, we propose a computational strategy aimed at identifying novel multi-target scaffolds against the virus. The proposed study was performed using bioinformatics methods, such as homology modeling, virtual screening and classical molecular dynamics, where 3D structures of targets were reconstructed and compounds with potential inhibitory activity against different virus targets were identified. Furthermore, a potential mechanism of action was proposed. Our study could provide new insights and approaches for the rapid identification of novel multi-target inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease that spreads rapidly in humans. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying a multi-target-directed ligand approach would open up new opportunities for drug discovery to combat COVID-19. The aim of this work was to perform a virtual screening of an exclusive chemical library of about 1700 molecules containing both pharmacologically active compounds and synthetic intermediates to propose potential protein inhibitors for use against SARS-CoV-2. In silico analysis showed that our compounds triggered an interaction network with key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), blocking trimer formation and interaction with the human receptor hACE2, as well as with the main 3C-like protease (3CLpro), inhibiting their biological function. Our data may represent a step forward in the search for potential new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"In Silico Multi-Target Approach Revealed Potential Lead Compounds as Scaffold for the Synthesis of Chemical Analogues Targeting SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measuring the magnitudes and specificities of antiviral CD8 T-cell responses is critical for understanding the dynamics and regulation of adaptive immunity. Despite many excellent studies, the accurate measurement of the total CD8 T-cell response directed against a particular infection has been hampered by an incomplete knowledge of all CD8 T-cell epitopes and also by potential contributions of bystander expansion among CD8 T cells of irrelevant specificities. Here, we use several techniques to provide a more complete accounting of the CD8 T-cell response generated upon infection of C57BL/6 mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Eight days following infection, we found that 85 to 95% of CD8 T cells exhibit an effector phenotype as indicated by granzyme B, 1B11, CD62L, CD11a, and CD127 expression. We demonstrate that CD8 T-cell expansion is due to cells that divide >7 times, whereas heterologous viral infections only elicited <3 divisions among bystander memory CD8 T cells. Furthermore, we found that approximately 80% of CD8 T cells in spleen were specific for ten different LCMV-derived epitopes at the peak of primary infection. These data suggest that following a single LCMV infection, effector CD8 T cells divide > or =15 times and account for at least 80%, and possibly as much as 95%, of the CD8 T-cell pool. Moreover, the response targeted a very broad array of peptide major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs), even though we examined epitopes derived from only two of the four proteins encoded by the LCMV genome and C57BL/6 mice only have two MHC class I alleles. These data illustrate the potential enormity, specificity, and breadth of CD8 T-cell responses to viral infection and demonstrate that bystander activation does not contribute to CD8 T-cell expansion.","output":"Quantitating the magnitude of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific CD8 T-cell response: it is even bigger than we thought."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commonly presents with pneumonia.

To quantitatively measure the magnetic susceptibility, the nuclei should be accurately segmented, which is a tedious task for clinicians. In this paper, we proposed a dual-branch residual-structured U-Net (DB-ResUNet) based on 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment such brain gray matter nuclei. Due to memory limit, 3D-CNN-based methods typically adopted image patches, instead of the whole volumetric image, which, however, ignored the spatial contextual information of the neighboring patches, and therefore led to the accuracy loss. To better tradeoff segmentation accuracy and the memory efficiency, the proposed DB-ResUNet incorporated patches with different resolutions. By jointly using QSM and 3D T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) as inputs, the proposed method was able to achieve better segmentation accuracy over its single-branch counterpart, as well as the conventional atlas-based method and the classical 3D CNN structures. The susceptibility values and the volumes were also measured, which indicated that the measurements from the proposed DB-ResUNet was able to present high correlation with values from the manually annotated regions of interest.","output":"Brain gray matter nuclei segmentation on quantitative susceptibility mapping using dual-branch convolutional neural network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a virus appeared suddenly he claims Covid-19, which started in China and began to spread very widely around the world.

The COMFORT communication model was used to develop and pilot a webinar-based communication training series to meet training needs. Pre-post measures of comfort in communication and post-curriculum evaluation were used to evaluate the webinars. RESULTS Survey findings from 94 healthcare providers demonstrated that communication training is most needed when patient/family culture is different from provider. Physicians reported less comfort in communication than nurses and other professionals, especially in communication with family about spiritual or religious concerns. Nurses reported more overall training in palliative care communication topics than physicians and other disciplines. The 3-part webinar series increased communication comfort for physicians and nurses, was highly rated, and participants reported that they would recommend COMFORT webinar training to colleagues.

Data were collected using a specially designed and validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis included the 2-test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression. RESULTS Overall 348 patients (204 females and 144 males) were involved in the study. The patients who reported having used dietary supplements were 67% of the study population. Various combinations ranked first among the dietary supplement types, and vitamins/minerals presented a substantial part (75.9%). The majority of the patients (61.6%) used dietary supplements for more than one reason, mainly for organ-related disorders. Most of the respondents (76.4%) considered them to be completely safe.

The purpose of this study was to present the angioarchitectural and clinical phenotypes of a foramen magnum region AVF from a large, single-center experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed cases from a 10-year neurointerventional data base. Arterial and venous angioarchitectural features and clinical presentation were extracted from the medical record. Venous drainage patterns were stratified into 4 groups as follows: type 1 = unrestricted sinus drainage, type 2 = sinus reflux (including the inferior petrosal sinus), type 3 = reflux involving sinuses and cortical veins, and type 4 = restricted cortical vein outflow or perimedullary congestion. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (mean age, 57.9 years; 57.1% men) had 29 foramen magnum region AVFs. There were 11 (37.9%) type 1, nine (31.0%) type 2, six (20.7%) type 3, and 3 (10.3%) type 4 fistulas. Pulsatile tinnitus was the most frequent symptom (82.1%), followed by orbital symptoms (31.0%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.8%), cranial nerve XII palsy (10.3%), and other cranial nerve palsy (6.9%). The most frequent arterial supply was the ipsilateral ascending pharyngeal artery (93.1% ipsilateral, 55.5% contralateral), vertebral artery (89.7%), occipital artery (65.5%), and internal carotid artery branches (48.3%). CONCLUSIONS We present the largest case series of foramen magnum region AVFs to date and show that clinical features relate to angioarchitecture.

We show that pDC are not productively infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed CD80, CD86, CCR7, and OX40 ligand at levels similar to influenza virus-induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-, interferon-1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. All major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation critically depended on IRAK4 and UNC93B1, as established using pDC from genetically deficient patients. Overall, our data indicate that human pDC are efficiently activated by SARS-CoV-2 particles and may thus contribute to type I IFN-dependent immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 induces human plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cell diversification via UNC93B and IRAK4"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that causes a potentially deadly syndrome that affects especially the respiratory tract Kidney-transplanted patients are immunosuppressed and more susceptible to viral infections We have examined our transplantation activity to explore the future role of kidney transplantation from deceased and living donors in COVID-19 era Patients and Methods The activity of our transplant center of Naples (one of the two transplant centers in Campania, South Italy) continued during the COVID-19 pandemic We have analysed the kidney transplants carried out between March 9 and June 9, 2020, comparing these data with the numbers of procedures performed in the two previous years Moreover, we have considered the possibility of performing living donor transplants during a worldwide pandemic Results From March 9, 2020, when the Italian lockdown begun, till June 9, 2020, five kidney transplants have been performed at our transplant center in Naples, all from deceased donors The donors and the recipients have been screened for COVID-19 infection, and the patients, all asymptomatic, followed strict preventive measures and were fully informed about the risks of surgery and immunosuppression during a pandemic All the transplanted patients remained COVID negative during the follow-up The number of transplants performed has been constant compared to the same months of 2018 and 2019 In agreement with the patients, we decided to postpone living donor transplants to a period of greater control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in Italy Conclusion Deceased donor kidney transplantation should continue, especially in a region with moderate risk, like Campania, with a more careful selection of donors and recipients, preferring standard donors and recipients without severe comorbidities Living donor transplantation program, instead, should be postponed to a period of greater control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread, as it is an elective surgery and its delay does not determine additional risks for patients [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of BioMed Research International is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"COVID-19 and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation in Naples during the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to detect recombination in pathogen genomes is crucial to the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis and consequently to forecasting the spread of infectious diseases and to developing therapeutics and public health policies.

Community health workers (CHW) use a door-to-door delivery strategy to treat children with SMC drugs, but for SMC to be as effective as in clinical trials, coverage must be high over successive seasons. METHODS: We developed and used a microplanning model that utilizes population raster to estimate population size, generates optimal households visit itinerary, and quantifies SMC coverage based on CHWs time investment for treatment and walking. CHWs performance under current SMC deployment mode was assessed using CHWs tracking data and compared to microplanning in villages with varying demographics and geographies. RESULTS: Estimates showed that microplanning significantly reduces CHWs walking distance by 25%, increases the number of visited households by 36% (p < 0.001) and increases SMC coverage by 21% from 37.3% under current SMC deployment mode up to 58.3% under microplanning (p < 0.001). Optimal visit itinerary alone increased SMC coverage up to 100% in small villages whereas in larger or hard-to-reach villages, filling the gap additionally needed an optimization of the CHW ratio. CONCLUSION: We estimate that for a pair of CHWs, the daily optimal number of visited children (assuming 8.5mn spent per child) and walking distance should not exceed 45 (95% CI 27C62) and 5 km (95% CI 3.2C6.2) respectively.

The patients were divided into three datasets for development, internal validation, and external validation (mean age: 74.2  14.1, 73.8  14.2, and 71.0  11.7 years, respectively; sex: 50.2, 48.8, and 55.2% male, respectively). At baseline, 102 variables were submitted to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression algorithm for variable selection. The selected variables were processed by the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling combined with univariate analysis and stepwise regression. The model was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration plot. Finally, the nomogram was provided to visualize the results. The improvement in the regression model was calculated by the net reclassification index (NRI) (with tenfold cross-validation and 200 bootstraps). Results: Among the selected 2,980 patients, 1,696 (56.9%) were readmitted within 180 days, and 1,502 (50.4%) were men. A nomogram was established by the results of Lasso regression, univariate analysis, stepwise regression and multivariate Cox regression, as well as variables with clinical significance. The values of the C-index were 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72C0.79], 0.75 [95% CI: 0.69C0.81], and 0.73 [95% CI: 0.64C0.83] for the development, internal validation, and external validation datasets, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using hemostatic energy-based surgical devices during thyroid surgery in a canine model. METHODS Twenty-four beagle dogs were randomly divided into the following groups: electrotome (30 kW), electrotome (15 kW), the Harmonic scalpel (output level 3), and LigaSure (middle gear). The hemostatic devices were applied on the thyroid surface for 3 seconds and then near the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN; distance of 5 mm, 3 mm, or 1 mm) for 3 seconds. Evoked electromyography (EMG) amplitudes were recorded by intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM). Acute microstructural morphological damage to thyroid tissues and the RLN were evaluated immediately after the procedure by light and electron microscopy. RESULTS Electrotome caused a significant decrease in evoked EMG amplitudes when applied at a vertical distance of 1 mm from the RLN, both at 30 kW (1046  404.3 V vs 153  245.5 V; p < .001) and 15 kW (1197  589.2 V vs 986.3  797.3 V; p = .037), compared with those evoked under normal conditions. Furthermore, distinct acute microstructural morphological changes of the RLNs were observed by light and electron microscopy. However, no significant functional or histological changes were induced by the electrotome at a vertical distance of 5 mm or 3 mm from the RLN. The Harmonic scalpel and LigaSure induced neither marked changes in evoked EMG amplitudes when applied at vertical distances of 5 mm, 3 mm, or 1 mm (all p > .05) nor microstructural morphological changes in the RLNs. The electrotome (15 kW) caused more serious thermal damage to thyroid tissues than that caused by either the Harmonic scalpel or LigaSure (thermal damaged depth: 0.951  0.061 vs 0.756  0.074, p < .001; 0.951  0.061 vs 0.724  0.116, p < .001).

In addition to the impact on global health caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of related misinformation poses an additional health threat. Detecting and controlling the spread of misinformation using algorithmic methods is a challenging task. Relying on human fact-checking experts is the most reliable approach, however, it does not scale with the volume and speed with which digital misinformation is being produced and disseminated. In this paper, we present the SAMS Human-in-the-loop (SAMS-HITL) approach to combat the detection and the spread of digital misinformation. SAMS-HITL leverages the fact-checking skills of humans by providing feedback on news stories about the source, author, message, and spelling. The SAMS features are jointly integrated into a machine learning pipeline for detecting misinformation. First results indicate that SAMS features have a marked impact on the classification as it improves accuracy by up to 7.1%.

All drugs in use for treating plague are registered based on experimental data and anecdotal evidence, and no regimen currently recommended is supported by a randomized clinical trial. The IMASOY trial intends to fill this knowledge gap by comparing two 10-day regimens included in the national guidelines in Madagascar. The primary objective of the trial is to test the hypothesis that ciprofloxacin monotherapy is non-inferior to streptomycin followed by ciprofloxacin for the treatment of bubonic plague, thus avoiding the need for injectable, potentially toxic, aminoglycosides. METHODS: A two-arm parallel-group randomized control trial will be conducted across peripheral health centres in Madagascar in five districts. Males and non-pregnant females of all ages with suspected bubonic or pneumonic plague will be recruited over the course of three plague seasons. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the proportion of patients with bubonic plague who have a therapeutic response to treatment (defined as alive, resolution of fever, 25% reduction in the size of measurable buboes, has not received an alternative treatment and no clinical decision to continue antibiotics) as assessed on day 11. DISCUSSION: If successful, the trial has the potential to inform the standard of care guidelines not just in Madagascar but in other countries afflicted by plague.

In this paper, we consider a deterministic epidemic model of four compartments classified based on the health status of the populations of a given country to capture the disease progression. A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time basic reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period.

Therefore, the epidemiology and phylogenetic status of HPyV6 must be systematically characterized. METHODS: The VP1 gene of HPyV6 was detected with an established TaqMan real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections. The HPyV6-positive specimens were screened for other common respiratory viruses with real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: The prevalence of HPyV6 was 1.7 % (15/887), and children  5 years of age accounted for 80 % (12/15) of cases. All 15 HPyV6-positive patients were coinfected with other respiratory viruses, of which influenza virus A (IFVA) (8/15, 53.3 %) and respiratory syncytial virus (7/15, 46.7 %) were most common. All 15 HPyV6-positive patients were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections, and their viral loads ranged from 1.38 to 182.42 copies/l nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen. The most common symptoms were cough (100 %) and fever (86.7 %). The complete 4926-bp genome (BJ376 strain, GenBank accession number KM387421) was amplified and showed 100 % identity to HPyV6 strain 607a. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HPyV6 was 1.7 % in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections, as analyzed by real-time PCR. Because the coinfection rate was high and the viral load low, it was not possible to establish a correlation between HPyV6 and respiratory diseases.

Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) from cancer-derived exosomes have shown promising diagnosis potential. Our review aims to present CRISPR/Cas-based molecular platforms as an inexpensive, swift, and robust detection tool of cancer-derived exosome micro-RNAs to streamline future applications based on the novel CRISPR/Cas-based platforms to achieve early CRC diagnosis. ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer with the second highest mortality rate worldwide. CRC is a heterogenous disease with multiple risk factors associated, including obesity, smoking, and use of alcohol. Of total CRC cases, 60% are diagnosed in late stages, where survival can drop to about 10%. CRC screening programs are based primarily on colonoscopy, yet this approach is invasive and has low patient adherence. Therefore, there is a strong incentive for developing molecular-based methods that are minimally invasive and have higher patient adherence. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of extracellular vesicles (EVs), specifically exosomes, as intercellular communication vehicles with a broad cargo, including micro-RNAs (miRNAs). These have been syndicated as robust candidates for diagnosis, primarily for their known activities in cancer cells, including immunoevasion, tumor progression, and angiogenesis, whereas miRNAs are dysregulated by cancer cells and delivered by cancer-derived exosomes (CEx). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has shown good results detecting specific cancer-derived exosome micro-RNAs (CEx-miRNAs) associated with CRC, but qPCR also has several challenges, including portability and sensitivity/specificity issues regarding experiment design and sample quality. CRISPR/Cas-based platforms have been presented as cost-effective, ultrasensitive, specific, and robust clinical detection tools in the presence of potential inhibitors and capable of delivering quantitative and qualitative real-time data for enhanced decision-making to healthcare teams. Thereby, CRISPR/Cas13-based technologies have become a potential strategy for early CRC diagnosis detecting CEx-miRNAs. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas13-based platforms ease of use, scalability, and portability also showcase them as a potential point-of-care (POC) technology for CRC early diagnosis. This study presents two potential CRISPR/Cas13-based methodologies with a proposed panel consisting of four CEx-miRNAs, including miR-126, miR-1290, miR-23a, and miR-940, to streamline novel applications which may deliver a potential early diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.","output":"CRISPR/Cas13-Based Platforms for a Potential Next-Generation Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer through Exosomes Micro-RNA Detection: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In this study, we investigate the number of emergency room consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 in Germany compared to figures from the previous year. METHODS Case numbers from calendar weeks 1 through 22 of the two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 were obtained from 29 university hospitals and 7 non-university hospitals in Germany. Information was also obtained on the patients' age, sex, and urgency, along with the type of case (outpatient/inpatient), admitting ward, and a small number of tracer diagnoses (I21, myocardial infarction; J44, COPD; and I61, I63, I64, G45, stroke /TIA), as well as on the number of COVID-19 cases and of tests performed for SARS-CoV-2, as a measure of the number of cases in which COVID-19 was suspected or at least included in the differential diagnoses. RESULTS A total of 1 022 007 emergency room consultations were analyzed, of which 546 940 took place in 2019 and 475 067 in 2020. The number of consultations with a positive test for the COVID-19 pathogen was 3122. The total number of emergency room consultations in the observation period was 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a maximum drop by 38% coinciding with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (calendar week 14; 572 cases). After the initiation of interpersonal contact restrictions in 2020, there was a marked drop in COVID-19 case numbers, by a mean of -240 cases per week per emergency room (95% confidence interval [-284; -128]). There was a rise in case numbers thereafter, by a mean of 17 patients per week [14; 19], and the number of cases of myocardial infarction returned fully to the level seen in 2019. CONCLUSION In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in medical emergencies of all kinds presenting to the nation's emergency departments.

Complications of COVID-19 are closely related to an upregulation of the inflammatory response revealed by the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines (to the point of causing a cytokine storm), which is also a contributing cause of the associated coagulation disorders with venous and arterial thromboembolisms, causing multiple organ dysfunction and failure. In severe fulminant cases of COVID-19, there is an activation of coagulation and consumption of clotting factors leading to a deadly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is well established that human immune response changes with age, and also that the pro-inflammatory profile of plasma cytokines is upregulated in both healthy and diseased elderly people. In fact, normal aging is known to be associated with a subclinical, sterile, low-grade, systemic pro-inflammatory state linked to the chronic activation of the innate immune system, a phenomenon known as \\"inflammaging\\". Inflammaging may play a role as a condition contributing to the co-occurrence of the severe hyper-inflammatory state (cytokine storm) during COVID-19, and also in other severe infections (sepsis) in older people. Moreover, we must consider the impact of inflammation on coagulation due to the crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation. The systemic inflammatory state and coagulation disorders are closely related, a phenomenon that here we call \\"coagul-aging\\" (Giunta S.). In this review, we discuss the various degrees of inflammation in older adults after being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the adverse effects of aging on the inflammatory response and coagulation system. It is important to note that although there is no gender difference in susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, however, due to differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, innate immunity, and comorbidities, older men exhibit more severe disease and higher mortality than older women. There are currently no FDA-approved specific antiviral drugs that can be used against the virus. Therapies used in patients with COVID-19 consist of remdesivir, dexamethasone, low-molecular-weight heparin, in addition to monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the disease. Future pharmacological research should also consider targeting the possible role of the underlying scenario of inflammaging in healthy older people to prevent or mitigate disease complications. It is worth mentioning that some specific cytokine antagonists and traditional Chinese medicine preparations can reduce the elderly's inflammatory state.","output":"Do inflammaging and coagul-aging play a role as conditions contributing to the co-occurrence of the severe hyper-inflammatory state and deadly coagulopathy during COVID-19 in older people?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the Korean version of a short screening tool for psychosis as the first stage in finding undiagnosed psychosis in the community.

The Psychosis Screener (PS) comprises 7 items covering psychotic symptoms. The presence of each psychotic symptom was determined by a trained mental health professional and coded yes or no. Two psychiatrists reviewed the medical records independently and extracted the ICD-10-based diagnoses. Any differences between the two clinicians were resolved by consensus, and the agreed diagnosis was used as a gold standard in the study. RESULTS: Among 126 psychiatric outpatients who were enrolled in a consecutive manner during the study period, the proportion of psychosis was 15.1%.

DESIGN: Empirical analysis. DATA SOURCE: Guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) up to 27 March 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Recommendations were clearly categorised as consensus or evidence based, were separated from the remainder of the text, and included both the quality of evidence and the strength of the recommendations. DATA EXTRACTION: Paired authors independently extracted the recommendation characteristics, including type of recommendation (consensus or evidence based), grading system used for developing recommendations, strength of the recommendation, and quality of evidence. The study team also calculated the number of discordant recommendations (strong recommendations with low quality evidence) and inappropriate discordant recommendations (those that did not meet grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation criteria of appropriateness). RESULTS: The study included 12 ACC/AHA guidelines that generated 1434 recommendations and 69 ASCO guidelines that generated 1094 recommendations. Of the 504 ACC/AHA recommendations based on low quality evidence, 200 (40%) proved to be consensus based versus 304 (60%) evidence based; of the 404 ASCO recommendations based on low quality evidence, 292 (72%) were consensus based versus 112 (28%) that were evidence based. In both ACC/AHA and ASCO guidelines, the consensus approach yielded more discordant recommendations (ACC/AHA: odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 3.1; ASCO: 2.9, 1.1 to 7.8) and inappropriate discordant recommendations (ACC/AHA: 2.6, 1.7 to 3.7; ASCO: 5.1, 1.6 to 16.0) than the evidence based approach.

The mobile-based online test is the buzzing in the current pandemic time. Institutions need to use online learning as a powerful tool for conducting exams and assess the students effectively. Integrating technology in education can be advantageous for universities and help engage better results for students. Therefore, it is important to understand each student their capacities and create a different test based on the required difficulty. Students should be graded based on their capabilities. The purpose of the research study is to develop the progressive model with the calibration of difficulty level according to the student capacity. To achieve the goal, a test of 20 python questions was conducted on 120 students with each question having difficulty given by 8 field experts. To verify the model, 5 categories were formed with different difficulty levels which in turn gave satisfactory results. To find a relation between the initial difficulty and the calculative difficulty based on the student response, a correlation test was conducted. After careful analysis of the question difficulty and student responses, it was observed that both are highly dependent on each other wherein the difficulty level of any question can be calculated using incorrect answers. The correlation coefficient obtained between them was 0.9833. Upon collecting the difficulty of the questions and student responses, respective grading could be done using the stated formula. Later on, the progressive model was simulated with five different cases (Best case, above-average case, below average case, the average case, worst case). The model outperformed in all the cases with appropriate difficulty levels. Online Tests have ushered a revolution in the assessment of students but yet they tend to be unpopular in India as the evaluation based on pen-paper approach is preferred. The main reasons for this are difficult to grade everyone at the same level, susceptible to cheating, and transition to open books.

As a result, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its incidence and effect on various populations at a molecular level as well as clinical implications have been heavily studied; however, its role in morbidity and mortality in the Indo-Caribbean population is often overlooked. The Caribbean diaspora is a vibrant and heterogeneous culture, encompassing individuals with ancestries from across the world including the Indian subcontinent and Africa. Abundant research is consistently conducted on these populations, but limited research exists on how the interplay between genetics and environment translates to the manifestation of various diseases in the Indo-Caribbean population. This scoping review aims to identify and assess the current literature within the past 10 years conducted on CVD in Indo-Caribbeans in order to gain a thorough understanding of disease and management to improve health outcomes. Additionally, this review aimed to identify gaps in research that require further study to gain a better understanding of relevant variables affecting disease outcomes in the Indo-Caribbean population. Multiple health databases were queried, and the initial search yielded over 3,000 results. However, after screening with the inclusion and exclusion criteria established, the final search included less than 1% of the papers initially searched. This search yielded data that included treatment and management of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, but notably did not yield papers that discussed the relationship between social determinants of health and CVD in Indo-Caribbeans. Florida and New York are prominent states that have robust Indo-Caribbean populations; the lack of research renders these states vulnerable to improving health outcomes in these patients. The authors call for increased focus on this population in research studies and efforts to improve the quality of the data collected through stratification by ethnicity. Robust data may allow for improvement in the treatment and management of CVD in Indo-Caribbeans, which offers a more proactive rather than reactive approach to decreasing morbidity and mortality.","output":"Cardiovascular Disease in the Indo-Caribbean Population: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the predominant UK circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain in May 2021. How Delta infection compares with previous variants is unknown. MethodsThis prospective observational cohort study assessed symptomatic adults participating in the app-based COVID Symptom Study who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from May 26 to July 1, 2021 (Delta overwhelmingly predominant circulating UK variant), compared (1:1, age- and sex-matched) with individuals presenting from December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) predominant variant). We assessed illness (symptoms, duration, presentation to hospital) during Alpha- and Delta-predominant timeframes; and transmission, reinfection, and vaccine effectiveness during the Delta-predominant period. Findings3,581 individuals (aged 18 to 100 years) from each timeframe were assessed. The seven most frequent symptoms were common to both variants. Within the first 28 days of illness, some symptoms were more common with Delta vs. Alpha infection (including fever, sore throat and headache) and vice versa (dyspnoea). Symptom burden in the first week was higher with Delta vs. Alpha infection; however, the odds of any given symptom lasting []7 days was either lower or unchanged. Illness duration []28 days was lower with Delta vs. Alpha infection, though unchanged in unvaccinated individuals. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 was unchanged. The Delta variant appeared more (1{middle dot}47) transmissible than Alpha. Re-infections were low in all UK regions. Vaccination markedly (69-84%) reduced risk of Delta infection. InterpretationCOVID-19 from Delta or Alpha infections is clinically similar. The Delta variant is more transmissible than Alpha; however, current vaccines show good efficacy against disease.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo identify existing evidence for differences (including illness, transmissibility, and vaccine effectiveness) from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, we searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles and medRxiv for preprint publications between March 1 and November 18, 2021 using keywords (\\"SARS-CoV-2\\" OR \\"COVID-19\\") AND (\\"delta variant\\" OR \\"B.1.617.2\\") AND (symptom* OR transmiss* OR \\"disease duration\\" OR \\"illness duration\\" OR \\"symptom* duration\\"). Searches were not restricted by language. Among 169 identified PubMed articles, we found evidence that Delta variant has increased replication capacity (from 4-fold, up to 21-fold, compared with wild-type) and greater transmissibility (estimated between +20% and +97%), compared with previous strains. Currently available vaccines may have 2- to 5-fold lower neutralizing response to Delta vs. previous variants, depending on vaccine formulation, although their protective effect against severe disease and death appears to remain strong. REACT-1 study found that in UK infections were increasing exponentially in the 5-17-year old children in September 2021, coinciding with the start of the autumn school term in England. This was interpreted as an effect of the relatively low rate of vaccinated individuals in this age group. Other studies found that in unvaccinated individuals, Delta variant may be associated with higher odds of pneumonia, oxygen requirement, emergency care requests, ICU admission, and death. In a study of 27 (mainly young) cases, 22 persons were symptomatic, with fever (41%), cough (33%), headache (26%), and sore throat (26%) the commonest symptoms. We found no studies, beyond case series, investigating symptom and/or illness duration due to Delta variant infection otherwise. Added value of this studyUsing data from one of the largest UK citizen science epidemiological initiatives, we describe and compare illness (symptom duration, burden, profile, risk of long illness, and hospital attendance) in symptomatic community-based adults presenting when either the Alpha or Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK. We assess evidence of transmission, reinfection, and vaccine effectiveness. Our data show that the seven most common symptoms with Delta infection were the same as with Alpha infection. Risks of illness duration []7 days and []28 days, and of requiring hospital care, were not increased. In line with previous research, we found increased transmissibility of Delta vs. previous variants; and no evidence of increased re-infection rates. Our data support high vaccine efficacy of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 formulations against Delta variant infection. Overall, our study adds quantitative information regarding meaningful clinical differences in COVID-19 due to Delta vs. other variants. Implications of all the available evidenceOur observational data confirm that COVID-19 disease in UK in adults is generally comparable to infection with the Alpha variant, including in elderly individuals. Our data contribute to epidemiological surveillance from the wider UK population and may capture information from COVID-19 presentation within the community that might be missed in healthcare-based surveillance. Our data may be useful in informing healthcare service planning, vaccination policies, and measures for social protection.","output":"COVID-19 due to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant compared to B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant of SARS-CoV-2: two prospective observational cohort studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Virus neutralization by antibodies is an important prognostic factor in many viral diseases. To easily and rapidly measure titers of neutralizing antibodies in serum or plasma, we developed pseudovirion particles composed of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 incorporated onto murine leukemia virus capsids and a modified minimal murine leukemia virus genome encoding firefly luciferase. This assay design is intended for use in laboratories with biocontainment level 2 and therefore circumvents the need for the biocontainment level 3 that would be required for replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus. To validate the pseudovirion assay, we set up comparisons with other available antibody tests including those from Abbott, Euroimmun and Siemens, using archived, known samples. RESULTS: 11 out of 12 SARS-CoV-2-infected patient serum samples showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudotyped MLV viruses, with neutralizing titers-50 (NT(50)) that ranged from 1:25 to 1:1,417. Five historical samples from patients hospitalized for severe influenza infection in 2016 tested negative in the neutralization assay (NT(50) < 25). Three serum samples with high neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2/MLV pseudoviruses showed no detectable neutralizing activity (NT(50) < 25) against SARS-CoV-1/MLV pseudovirions. We also compared the semiquantitative Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, which measures binding of IgG to recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the neutralization titers obtained in the pseudovirion assay and the results show high concordance between the two tests (R(2) = 0.9344). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 spike/MLV pseudovirions provide a practical means of assessing neutralizing activity of antibodies in serum or plasma from infected patients under laboratory conditions consistent with biocontainment level 2. This assay offers promise also in evaluating immunogenicity of spike glycoprotein-based candidate vaccines in the near future.","output":"Neutralization assay with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped murine leukemia virions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 72-year-old woman was referred for whole-body (111)In-pentetreotide scintigraphy with SPECT/CT.

These differences result in different cell tropisms and low fusogenicity from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Recent studies have revealed that host metalloproteases are also involved in cell surface entry and fusogenic activity of SARS-CoV-2, independent of TMPRSS2. However, the involvement of metalloproteinase-mediated cell entry and fusogenicity in Omicron infections has not been investigated. Here, we report that Omicron infection is less sensitive to the metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat, like the TMPRSS2 inhibitor nafamostat, and is more sensitive to the cathepsin B/L inhibitor E-64d than infections with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and other variants. The findings indicate that Omicron preferentially utilizes the endosomal pathway rather than cell surface pathways for entry. Moreover, the Omicron variant also displays poor syncytia formation mediated by metalloproteinases, even when the S cleavage status mediated by fusion-like proteases is unchanged. Intriguingly, the pseudovirus assay showed that a single mutation, H655Y, of the Omicron spike (S) is responsible for the preferential entry pathway usage without affecting the S cleavage status. These findings suggest that the Omicron variant has altered entry properties and fusogenicity, probably through the H655Y mutation in its S protein, leading to modulations of tissue and cell tropism, and reduced pathogenicity. Author summary Recent studies have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant displays altered cell tropism and fusogenicity, in addition to immune escape. However, comprehensive analyses of the usage of viral entry pathways in Omicron variant have not been performed. Here, we used protease inhibitors to block each viral entry pathway mediated by the three host proteases (cathepsin B/L, TMPRSS2, and metalloproteinases) in various cell types. The results clearly indicated that Omicron exhibits enhanced cathepsin B/L-dependent endosome entry and reduced metalloproteinase-dependent and TMPRSS2-dependent cell surface entry. Furthermore, the H655Y mutation of Omicron S determines the relative usage of the three entry pathways without affecting S cleavage by the host furin-like proteases. Comparative data among SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, may clarify the biological and pathological phenotypes of Omicron but increase the understanding of disease progression in infections with other SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike H655Y mutation is responsible for enhancement of the endosomal entry pathway and reduction of cell surface entry pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To exploit the features of digital PCR for implementing SARS-CoV-2 observational studies by reliably including the viral load factor expressed as copies/L. METHODS: A small cohort of 51 Covid-19 positive samples was assessed by both RT-qPCR and digital PCR assays. A linear regression model was built using a training subset, and its accuracy was assessed in the remaining evaluation subset. The model was then used to convert the stored cycle threshold values of a large dataset of 6208 diagnostic samples into copies/L of SARS-CoV-2. The calculated viral load was used for a single cohort retrospective study. Finally, the cohort was randomly divided into a training set (n = 3095) and an evaluation set (n = 3113) to establish a logistic regression model for predicting case-fatality and to assess its accuracy. RESULTS: The model for converting the Ct values into copies/L was suitably accurate. The calculated viral load over time in the cohort of Covid-19 positive samples showed very low viral loads during the summer inter-epidemic waves in Italy. The calculated viral load along with gender and age allowed building a predictive model of case-fatality probability which showed high specificity (99.0%) and low sensitivity (21.7%) at the optimal threshold which varied by modifying the threshold (i.e. 75% sensitivity and 83.7% specificity). Alternative models including categorised cVL or raw cycle thresholds obtained by the same diagnostic method also gave the same performance. CONCLUSION: The modelling of the cycle threshold values using digital PCR had the potential of fostering studies addressing issues regarding Sars-CoV-2; furthermore, it may allow setting up predictive tools capable of early identifying those patients at high risk of case-fatality already at diagnosis, irrespective of the diagnostic RT-qPCR platform in use.

However, studies also suggest that insufficient closure of the mesh slit may lead to recurrences. Aim: This report describes a novel technique using AbsorbaTacks (Covidien) to close the mesh slit and refashion an artificial deep ring to minimize recurrence. Technique: We report the case of a fit 82-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a recurrent large right indirect inguinoscrotal hernia (8 x 8  7 cm with 4  4 cm deep inguinal ring). The patient underwent a TAPP repair with a background of unsuccessful open repair by another surgeon previously. Following mesh deployment, the mesh was lifted up by the cord structures, which was under tension due to a large defect. A slit was made in the inferomedial aspect of the mesh. This allowed it to be wrapped around the cord structures. The overlapped trouser flaps were then stapled together encircling the cord, by AbsorbaTacks to create a secure artificial deep ring. Edges of the mesh were also standardly affixed by AbsorbaTacks to the pectineal ligament and posterior abdominal wall. This creates a secure four-point fixation of the mesh scaffold to prevent windsock effect, which happens when the mesh is pushed into the widened deep inguinal ring, leading to early recurrences. The peritoneal incision was also closed with AbsorbaTacks. Conclusion: No complications were registered during the early postoperative period. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged within 20 hours with simple analgesia. No recurrence was reported during the 6 months follow-up period. Clinical significance: The anchoring of a slit mesh with tackers around the cord structures can be used to repair large recurrent inguinal hernias laparoscopically following an open repair.

However, indications for early SAVR in asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal left ventricular function remain debated. Methods: The Aortic Valve replAcemenT versus conservative treatment in Asymptomatic seveRe aortic stenosis (AVATAR) trial is an investigator-initiated international prospective randomized controlled trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of early SAVR in the treatment of asymptomatic patients with severe AS, according to common criteria (valve area 1 cm2 with aortic jet velocity >4 m/s or a mean trans-aortic gradient 40 mm Hg), and with normal LV function. Negative exercise testing was mandatory for inclusion. The primary hypothesis was that early SAVR would reduce the primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure, as compared to a conservative strategy according to guidelines. The trial was designed as event-driven to reach a minimum of 35 prespecified events. The study was performed in 9 centers in 7 European countries. Results: Between June 2015 and September 2020, 157 patients (mean age 67 years, 57 % men) were randomly allocated to early surgery (n=78) or conservative treatment (n=79). Follow-up was completed in May 2021. Overall median follow-up was 32 months: 28 months in the early surgery group and 35 months in the conservative treatment group. There was a total of 39 events, 13 in early surgery and 26 in conservative treatment group. In the early surgery group, 72 patients (92.3 %) underwent SAVR with operative mortality of 1.4 %.

We aim to randomize 320 socially isolated adults 75+ years old [160 Caucasian and 160 African American participants, 50:50 split between those with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)] recruited from the community to either the video chat intervention group or the control group (1:1 allocation). Those in the video chat group receive a computer and Internet service for the duration of the study, which they use to video chat with study staff for 30 min/day 4/week for 6 months (high dose), and then 2/week for an additional 6 months (maintenance dose). Both video chat and control groups have a brief (about 10 min) telephone check-in with study staff once per week. The primary outcome is the change in global cognitive function measured by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in cognition in memory and executive function domains, emotional well-being measured by NIH Toolbox emotional battery, and daily functional abilities assessed with the Revised Observed Tasks of Daily Living (OTDL-R). Eligible participants have MRIs at baseline and 6 months. Participants contribute saliva for genetic testing (optional consent), and all video chats, weekly check-in calls and neuropsychological assessment sessions are recorded for speech and language analysis. The pandemic halted research activities and resulted in protocol modifications, including replacing in-person assessment with remote assessment, remote deployment of study equipment, and revised targeted sample size. Discussion: This trial provides user-friendly hardware for the conversational-based intervention that can be easily provided at participants' homes. The trial aspires to use age and culture-specific conversational materials and a related platform developed in this trial for enhancing cognitive reserve and improving cognitive function.","output":"The Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT) in Socially Isolated Adults 75+ Years Old: Randomized Controlled Trial Protocol and COVID-19 Related Study Modifications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented challenge. Different models of reorganization have been described aiming to preserve resources while ensuring optimal medical care. limited clinical neurosurgical experience including COVID-19 patients have been reported. We share organizational experience, attitudes, and preliminary data of patients treated at our institution. Methods Institutional guidelines and patient workflow are described and visualized. A cohort of all neurosurgical patients managed during the lockdown period is presented and analyzed assessing suspected nosocomial infection risk factors. A comparative surgical subcohort from the previous year was used to investigate the impact on surgical activity. Results A total of 176 patients were admitted in 66 days, twenty tested positive for COVID-19. Patients initially admitted to the neurosurgical ward were less likely to be suspected for a COVID-19 infection when compared to patients admitted for critical emergencies, particularly with neurovascular and stroke-related pathologies. The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was remarkably high (45%), and even higher in patients that underwent surgical intervention (77 %). In addition to the expected drop in surgical activity (-53%), a decrease in traumatic emergencies was noted. Conclusion By applying infection prevention and resource-sparing logistics measures shared by the international medical community, we were able to maintain essential neurosurgical care in a pandemic with controlled nosocomial infection risk. Special consideration should be given to medical management and surgical indications in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as they seem to exhibit a problematic hemostatic profile that might result in an unfavorable clinical and surgical outcome.","output":"COVID-19 impact on neurosurgical practice: lockdown attitude and experience of a European academic center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of point-of-care (POC) devices most commonly used for coagulation analyses in the acute settings.

New normal lifestyle behaviors, including getting adequate physical activity (PA), consuming sufficient fruits and vegetables (FV) and enacting individual preventive behaviors (frequent hand washing, facemask wearing, and social distancing), as a significant determinant for QoL, have not been adequately addressed in older adults during the pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of QoL in Chinese older adults after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei China, to examine the associations of lifestyle behaviors with QoL, and to identify the moderating role of socioeconomic indicators in the associations. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in Hubei, China, from June 15, 2020, to July 10, 2020. 516 older adults completed an online survey (mean age = 67.6  6.6;57.9% women). The questionnaire consisted of demographic information, covariates (chronic diseases and infected cases of acquaintances), lifestyle behaviors (PA stage, FV intake (FVI) stage and three preventive behaviors) and QoL. T-tests, ANOVA tests, hierarchical multiple linear regression models with simple slope analyses were used to test the hypotheses. ResultsQoL significantly differed in relation to economic situation, chronic diseases, marital status, education, living situation, age group and professional status. Participants economic situation (  average vs. below average = 0.17, p < 0.01; above average vs. below average = 0.15, p < 0.01), chronic diseases (  yes vs. no = 0.19, p < 0.001), FVI stage (  = 0.21, p < 0.001) and preventive behaviors (  = 0.10, p < 0.05) indicated a significant association with QoL. Education level and economic situation significantly interacted with preventive behaviors on QoL respectively (  preventive behaviors x educational level = -1.3, p < 0.01; preventive behaviors x economic situation = -0.97, p < 0.05). ConclusionsFindings emphasize the importance of enhancing FVI and preventive behaviors on QoL improvement in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In CRISPR diagnostics, a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) containing a spacer sequence that specifically complements with the target nucleic acid sequence guides the activation of a CRISPR effector protein (Cas13a, Cas12a or Cas12b), leading to collateral cleavage of RNA or DNA reporters and enormous signal amplification. CRISPR function can be disrupted by some types of sequence mismatches between the spacer and target, according to previous studies. This poses a potential challenge in the detection of variable targets such as RNA viruses with a high degree of sequence diversity, since mismatches can result from target variations. To cover viral diversity, we propose in this study that during crRNA synthesis mixed nucleotide types (degenerate sequences) can be introduced into the spacer sequence positions corresponding to viral sequence variations. We test this crRNA design strategy in the context of the Cas13a-based SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) technology for detection of CrimeanCCongo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a biosafety level 4 pathogen with wide geographic distribution and broad sequence variability. The degenerate-sequence CRISPR diagnostic proves functional, sensitive, specific and rapid. It detects within 30C40 minutes 1 copy/l of viral RNA from CCHFV strains representing all clades, and from more recently identified strains with new mutations in the CRISPR target region. Also importantly, it shows no cross-reactivity with a variety of CCHFV-related viruses. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the degenerate sequence-based CRISPR diagnostic is a promising tool of choice for effective detection of highly variable viral pathogens.","output":"Degenerate sequence-based CRISPR diagnostic for CrimeanCCongo hemorrhagic fever virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia show increased thrombotic risk.

The purpose of this study was to assess persistence with osteoporosis treatment in patients from the FLS over a period of 1 year, and to determine predictors of discontinuation. METHODS: The study population comprised adults of both genders, aged 50 or over, admitted to Lille University Hospital between January 2016 and January 2019 for a low-trauma fracture and managed in our FLS. Outcomes included (1) persistence rate at 1 year after treatment initiation, (2) persistence rate at 2 years after treatment initiation, (3) persistence rate at 1 and 2 years after treatment initiation according to type of treatment, (4) predictors of non-persistence, and (5) reasons for discontinuing treatment over 1 year after initiation. Persistence was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In all, 1,224 patients (&#8805; 50 years old) with a recent history of low-trauma fracture (&#8804; 12 months) were identified. Of these, 380 patients - 79.2% female; mean (SD) age 76 (11) years - were seen at the FLS. In those 380 patients, 410 fractures were found and 360 of them (87.8%) were major fractures, breaking down as follows: vertebra (44%), hip (19%), proximal humerus (10%), and pelvis (8%). Osteoporosis treatment was prescribed for 367 (96.6%) patients and 275 of them began the prescribed treatment. The following anti-osteoporosis drugs were prescribed: zoledronic acid (n=150, 54.5%), teriparatide (n=63, 22.9%), and denosumab (n=39, 14.2%). Oral bisphosphonates were prescribed for a few patients (n=23, 8.4%). Persistence with osteoporosis medication (any class) was estimated at 84.1% (95% CI: 79.1% to 88.1%) at 12-month follow-up, and dropped to 70.3% (95% CI: 63.7% to 75.9%) at 24 months. When drug-specific analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, persistence rates at 12 and 24 months were found to be higher with denosumab than with any other treatment. Independent predictors of non-persistence at 12 months were 'follow-up performed by a general practitioner (GP)' - Odds Ratio (OR) for GP vs. FLS = 3.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 8.90, p=0.004 - and 'treatment with zoledronic acid' - OR for zoledronic acid vs. denosumab = 3.39; 95% CI, 1.21 to 9.50, p=0.019; OR for zoledronic acid vs. teriparatide = 8.86; 95% CI, 1.15 to 68.10, p=0.035.

This survey included responses from a national sample of 349 predominantly white parents of children between the ages of 3 and 12 recruited through Amazons Mechanical Turk in United States. Parents reported that although children asked about COVID-19 and its causes (17.3%), children asked primarily about lifestyle changes that occurred as a result of the pandemic (24.0%) and safety (18.4%). Parents reported answering these questions by emphasizing that the purpose of different preventative measures was to protect the child (11.8%) or the family (42.7%) and providing reassurance (13.3%). Many parents discussed how it was their social responsibility to slow the spread of the virus (38.4%). Parents of younger children tended to shield them from information about COVID-19 (p = .038), while parents with more knowledge were more likely to provide explanations (p <.001).

Additionally, CV complications are associated with poorer mental health, lower socioeconomic status, and non-White race/ethnicity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on mental well-being and disproportionately affects people of lower socioeconomic status and non-White race/ethnicity. Thus, we hypothesized that the pandemic would differentially affect pregnant people with and without CV complications. We performed a cross-sectional survey of 465 pregnant people in California from June 6 through July 29, 2020. Twenty-three participants reported CV complications (e.g., hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes) and 29 participants reported non-CV complications. The CV group was 56.5% (13 of 23) Latinx and 43.5% (10 of 23) White versus the uncomplicated pregnancy group, which was 33.7% (137 of 407) Latinx and 66.3% (270 of 407) White (chi-square, p=0.03;6 respondents did not answer). The CV complications group was 9.5% (2 of 21) African American and the uncomplicated pregnancy group was 4.9% (19 of 392) African American (Fisher's Exact, p=0.053;23 respondents did not answer). We assessed 64 health behaviors reported on a Likert scale with the Wilcoxon 2-Sample Test and found the CV group reported more healthpromoting behaviors, including: less likely to eat sweets (p=0.004), more likely to sanitize frequently used areas in their homes and their groceries (p=0.049 and 0.069, respectively). However, they were also more likely to smoke cigarettes (p=0.02).

Striving to ensure the maximum safety of the therapeutic process, we decided to promote hand hygiene by implementing the educational program titled Clean Care is a Safer Care. The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the compliance with procedures related to the sanitary regime, including the frequency and accuracy of hand decontamination by medical personnel. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the usefulness of the educational program titled Clean Care is a Safer Care as a tool for increasing compliance with hand hygiene principles. METHODS: We monitored the compliance with the hygiene procedure before implementation of the program as well as during the hand hygiene campaign by means of direct observation as well as the disinfectant consumption rates. RESULTS: In the initial self-assessment survey, the hospital had scored 270/500 points (54%). Preliminary audit revealed the hygiene compliance rate at the level of 49%. After broad-scaled educational efforts, the semi-annual audit revealed an increase in hand hygiene compliance rate up to 81% (hospital average) while the final audit carried out after one year of campaigning revealed a compliance rate of 77%. The final score for the hospital increased to 435/500 points. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic dramatically increased accuracy of proper hand hygiene procedures and consumption of disinfectant agents. The educational program has succeeded to reach its goal; however, long-term educational efforts are required to maintain and improve the quality of provided services.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic as a factor of hospital staff compliance with the rules of hand hygiene: assessment of the usefulness of the Clean Care is a Safer Care program as a tool to enhance compliance with hand hygiene principles in hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To define the prevalence and severity of fear of cancer recurrence and identify factors associated with fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer and colorectal cancer survivors attending the Sydney Cancer Survivorship Clinic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using prospectively collected data. Survivors completed questionnaires assessing quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and symptoms (Distress Thermometer, Patient's Disease and Treatment Assessment Form)). Survivors were assessed by a clinical psychologist for the presence of fear of cancer recurrence. Clinical and quality of life variables were evaluated for associations with fear of cancer recurrence. RESULTS: Overall, 315 survivors (181 breast cancer, 134 colorectal cancer) were included. In total, 201 survivors (64%) had fear of cancer recurrence according to psychology assessment, and of the 118 that had fear of cancer recurrence severity recorded, 64 (54%) were rated as moderate-severe. On univariate analysis, fear of cancer recurrence was associated with younger age (P < 0.001), higher distress thermometer score (P = 0.001) and poorer overall wellbeing (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, younger age (P = 0.043), being bothered by side effects of treatment (P = 0.023), feeling sad (P = 0.020) and greater worry that their condition will get worse (P = 0.017) were independently associated with fear of cancer recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of cancer recurrence is common in breast and colorectal cancer survivors, and moderate-severe in over half.

The function of intestinal microbiota in modulating mucosal homeostasis and defense has been widely studied; however, the potential function of lung microbiota in regulating immunity and homeostasis has just begun. Increasing evidence indicates the relevance of microbiota to lung homeostasis and disease. In this review, we describe the distribution and composition of microbiota in the respiratory system and discuss the potential function of lung microbiota in both health and acute/chronic lung disease.

Remote monitoring can help with the critical need for early detection of symptoms among those diagnosed with COVID-19, enabling timely symptom management that can mitigate clinical deterioration. In response to this need, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center fast-tracked a program to monitor patients with COVID-19 from home, using an electronic symptom-tracking questionnaire and digital pulse oximeter to track patients' status and alert care teams to intervene if symptoms worsened. A multi-disciplinary group composed of Oncology providers, advanced practice providers, nursing, nursing informatics and biomedical informatics formed to manage the program. Methods: Memorial Sloan Kettering launched a remote monitoring program for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 25, 2020. All patients testing positive for COVID-19 were enrolled in the program and asked to complete a daily symptom tracking questionnaire accessed through their patient portal or administered verbally over the phone. A subset of high risk patients were also provided with a digital pulse oximeter linked to their patient portal and capable of transmitting readings directly to the care team. Clinicians received alerts for patients reporting symptoms or an oxygen saturation below 92%. Alerts resulted in an immediate response from the care team to determine if the patient needed additional care. We retrospectively evaluated the program usage, outcomes and learnings from March 25, 2020 to December 22, 2020. Results: In total, 1,721 patients were enrolled in the program from March 25, 2020 to December 22, 2020. Among these, 210 were deemed high risk patients who received a pulse oximeter in addition the daily symptom questionnaire. Over this period, 27% of patients triggered an alert from an electronic symptom questionnaire, and 63% of patients with a pulse oximeter triggered an alert from their device. Among patients who triggered an alert of any kind, 3% were triaged to a higher level of care. Patients reported that the program was highly valued and alleviated anxiety about their care. Iterative improvements were made to the program over time in response to the evolving knowledge about care for patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Memorial Sloan Kettering was able to quickly implement a program to detect and triage symptoms among patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Refinements were made over time to many aspects of the program in response to learnings about care related to COVID-19, including to clinical eligibility, alert criteria, monitoring duration and workflows. The program also demonstrated value for patients who felt more comfortable with their care while being monitored remotely. This program established a successful model for remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19 with the potential to be scaled to other institutions or clinical areas.","output":"Use of remote patient monitoring in the care of COVID-positive patients in oncology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has a history of nonhuman primate (NHP) consumption and exposure to simian retroviruses yet little is known about the extent of zoonotic simian retroviral infections in DRC. We examined the prevalence of human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV), a retrovirus group of simian origin, in a large population of persons with frequent NHP exposures and a history of simian foamy virus infection. We screened plasma from 3,051 persons living in rural villages in central DRC using HTLV EIA and western blot (WB). PCR amplification of HTLV tax and LTR sequences from buffy coat DNA was used to confirm infection and to measure proviral loads (pVLs). We used phylogenetic analyses of LTR sequences to infer evolutionary histories and potential transmission clusters. Questionnaire data was analyzed in conjunction with serological and molecular data. A relatively high proportion of the study population (5.4%, n = 165) were WB seropositive: 128 HTLV-1-like, 3 HTLV-2-like, and 34 HTLV-positive but untypeable profiles. 85 persons had HTLV indeterminate WB profiles. HTLV seroreactivity was higher in females, wives, heads of households, and increased with age. HTLV-1 LTR sequences from 109 persons clustered strongly with HTLV-1 and STLV-1 subtype B from humans and simians from DRC, with most sequences more closely related to STLV-1 from Allenopithecus nigroviridis (Allens swamp monkey). While 18 potential transmission clusters were identified, most were in different households, villages, and health zones. Three HTLV-1-infected persons were co-infected with simian foamy virus. The mean and median percentage of HTLV-1 pVLs were 5.72% and 1.53%, respectively, but were not associated with age, NHP exposure, village, or gender. We document high HTLV prevalence in DRC likely originating from STLV-1. We demonstrate regional spread of HTLV-1 in DRC with pVLs reported to be associated with HTLV disease, supporting local and national public health measures to prevent spread and morbidity.","output":"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 transmission dynamics in rural villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with high nonhuman primate exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recurrent theme of the literature and wider public discourse is that trade and digitization are good for health as it promotes economic prosperity.

Very recent data show that the use of inhaled type I IFN is associated with decreased mortality in Chinese COVID-19 patients. However, IFN nebulization is currently not standard in Europe and the United States. Therefore, our group has set up a project aimed to evaluate the possibility to nebulize IFN--1b (a drug currently used in Europe to treat multiple sclerosis via subcutaneous injections) and to assess the safety of this new mode of administration in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We present here literature data that allowed us to build our hypothesis and to develop collaboration between clinical pharmacists, intensivists and nebulization engineers in order to gain first pre-clinical and clinical experience of IFN--1b nebulization. After validation of the nebulization method and verification of droplet size compatible with nebulization, the method has been applied to four intensive care patients treated at our university hospital, for whom none of the COVID-19 therapies initially used in France led to significant clinical improvement. All patients exhibited negative viral carriage and experienced clinical improvement 7C16 days after having initiated nebulized IFN--1b inhalation therapy. No side effects were observed. All patients were alive within a 90-days follow-up. Although it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on treatment efficacy based on this case report, our study shows that pulmonary IFN--1b administration is feasible, with a good safety profile.

As in case of Ebola virus, it was present in semen for longer period in a carrier man without any symptom. Additional hypothesis is that since ACE2 could serve as a mediator for the endocytosis of the previously SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cells through similar mechanism. From the protein expression atlas, high levels of ACE2 precursor were found in intestines and testis. Hence, the testis and seminal fluids could be the host cell and/or reservoir.

How do new entrants to the market and incumbents influence horizontal and vertical integration of health systems? Traditionally, it has been argued that M&A activity is designed to reduce inequities in the market, shift toward value-based care, or enhance the number and quality of health care offerings in a given market. However, the recent history of M&A activity has yielded fewer noble results. As might be expected, the smaller the geographical region in which M&A activity is pursued, the higher the likelihood that monopolistic tendencies will result. OBJECTIVE: We focused on three types of competition perceptions, external environment uncertaintyCrelated competition, technology disruptionCdriven competition, and customer serviceCdriven competition, and two integration plans, vertical integration and horizontal integration. We examined (1) how health system characteristics help discern competition perceptions and integration decisions, and (2) how environment-, technology-, and service-driven competition aspects influence vertical and horizontal integration among US health systems in the post-COVID-19 new normal. METHODS: We used data for this study collected through a consultant from a robust group of health system chief executive officers (CEOs) across the United States from February to March 2021. Among the 625 CEOs, 135 (21.6%) responded to our survey. We considered competition and integration aspects from the literature and ratified them via expert consensus. We collected secondary data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Compendium of the US Health Systems, leading to a matched data set for 124 health systems. We used inferential statistical comparisons to assess differences across health systems regarding competition and integration, and we used ordered logit estimations to relate competition and integration. RESULTS: Health systems generally have a high level of the four types of competition perceptions, with the greatest concern being technology disruptionCdriven competition rather than environment uncertaintyCrelated competition and customer serviceCdriven competition. The first set of estimation results showed that size, teaching status, revenue, and uncompensated care burden are the main contingent factors influencing the three competition perceptions. The second set of estimation results revealed the relationships between different competition perceptions and integration plans. For vertical integration, environment uncertaintyCrelated competition had a significant positive influence (P<.001), while the influence of technology disruptionCdriven competition was significant but negative (P<.001). The influence of customer serviceCdriven competition on vertical integration was not evident. For horizontal integration, the results were similar for environment uncertaintyCrelated competition and technology disruptionCdriven competition; however, the significance of technology disruptionCdriven competition was weak (P=.05). The influence of customer serviceCdriven competition in the combined model was significant and negative (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Competition-driven integration has subtle influences across health systems. Environment uncertaintyCrelated competition is a significant factor, with underlying contingent factors such as revenue concerns and leadership as the leading causes of integration plans. However, technology disruption may hinder integrations. Undoubtedly, small- and low-revenue health systems facing a high level of competition are likely to merge to navigate the health care business successfully. This trend should be a focus of policy to avoid monopolistic markets.","output":"Competition and Integration of US Health Systems in the Post-COVID-19 New Normal: Cross-sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea has re-emerged with devastating impact in central China since October 2010.

Students enrolled in STEM classes were surveyed at the end of spring 2020 (N = 425) and fall 2020 (N = 347) semesters. Our results show that the majority of student respondents had more anxiety in fall 2020 than in spring 2020 with online learning in general, and less anonymous class activities tended to cause the greatest anxiety. Distractions from the environment and personal technologies commonly prevented engagement in both semesters, but no significant differences were observed between the spring and fall. In contrast, more students reported that health-related stress, work-related stress, and issues with technology prevented participation in fall 2020 than in spring 2020.

DESIGN: observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: accesses to the emergency departments (EDs) of Lazio Region hospitals in the first three months of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: total number of accesses to the emergency room and number of specific accesses for cardio and cerebrovascular diseases, for severe trauma, for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, and for symptoms related to pneumonia. RESULTS: in the first 3 months of 2019, there were 429,972 accesses to the EDs of Lazio Region; in the same period of 2020, accesses arise to 353,806, (reduction of 21.5%), with a 73% reduction in the last three weeks of march 2020 as compared with the corresponding period of 2019. Comparing the first 3 months of the 2017-2019 with 2020, the accesses for acute coronary syndrome and acute cerebrovascular disease decreased since the 10th week up to more than 57% and 50%, respectively. The accesses due to symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, proxy of potentially inappropriate conditions, decreased since the 8th week, with a maximum reduction of 70%.

This study evaluated the efficacy of chest CT to predict disease progression, pulmonary complications, and viral positivity duration. METHODS: A single-center cohort study was conducted by consecutively including hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The chest CT patterns were described and a total severity score was calculated. The predictive accuracy of the severity score was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis, while a Cox proportional hazards regression model was implemented to identify the radiological features that are linked to prolonged duration of viral positivity. RESULTS: Overall, 42 patients were included with 10 of them requiring intensive care unit admission. The most common lesions were ground glass opacities (92.9%), consolidation (66.7%), and crazy-paving patterns (61.9%). The total severity score significantly correlated with inflammatory and respiratory distress markers, as well as with admission CURB-65 and PSI/PORT scores. It was estimated to predict critical illness with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 70%, respectively. Time-to-event analysis indicated that patients without ground-glass opacities presented significantly shorter median viral positivity (16 vs. 27 days). CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT severity score positively correlates with markers of COVID-19 severity and presents promising efficacy in predicting critical illness. It is suggested that ground-glass opacities are linked to prolonged viral positivity.

Methods: We performed quasi-Poisson regression analyses at 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years of age using nationwide time-series data from the Republic of Korea (2011-2015). We constructed distributed lag linear models employing a generalized difference-in-differences method and controlling for other air pollutants. Results: A 10.0-ppb increase in 8-hour maximum ozone levels was associated with a higher risk of hospital admissions due to pneumonia at 0-4 (relative risk [RR] = 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.03) and 5-9 years of age (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.08) but not at 10-14 (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.04) or 15-19 years of age (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.06).

Comparing the safety and effectiveness of treatments for vasomotor symptoms is limited by the use of inconsistent outcome measures, and uncertainty as to which outcomes are most important to symptomatic women. To address this, we have developed a Core Outcome Set (COS) for use in clinical trials of treatments for VMS. METHODS We systematically reviewed the primary outcomes measured in randomized controlled trials of treatments for VMS. These were refined and entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey completed by clinicians, researchers, and postmenopausal women between November 2019 and March 2020. Outcomes were scored on a nine-point scale from \\"not important\\" to \\"critically important.\\" Two international consensus meetings were held to finalize the COS. RESULTS Based on the systematic review, 13 separate outcomes were included in the Delphi process. This was completed by 227 participants of whom 58% were postmenopausal women, 34% clinicians, and 8% researchers. Predefined thresholds were applied to categorize importance scores obtained during Round 2 of the Delphi survey. These informed discussions at the consensus meetings which were attended by 56 participants from 28 countries. The final COS includes six outcomes: 1) frequency of VMS, 2) severity of VMS, 3) distress, bother or interference caused by VMS, 4) impact on sleep, 5) satisfaction with treatment, and 6) side-effects of treatment. CONCLUSION Implementation of this COS will: better enable research studies to accurately reflect the joint priorities of postmenopausal women, clinicians and researchers, standardize outcome reporting, and facilitate combining and comparing results from different studies, and ultimately improve outcomes for women with bothersome VMS.

This study investigated whether CL and subcutaneous F of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in humans can be separately estimated from subcutaneous injection data only. METHODS First, the geometric mean of linear pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, intercompartmental CL [Q], volume of distribution in the central compartment [Vc], and volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment [Vp]) after intravenous injection for mAbs in humans that have been reported in public data sources was estimated from 103 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics and 44 mAbs with nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Next, we estimated the CL and F of 25 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics from plasma/serum mAb concentration-time profiles after subcutaneous injection in humans by fixing the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp based on the public data. Moreover, the plasma/serum concentration-time profile of 25 mAbs after intravenous injection was simulated using the estimated CL and the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp. RESULTS There were no significant differences in parameters among subclasses (immunoglobulin [Ig] G1, 2, and 4) or in linearity (derivation from linear and nonlinear pharmacokinetics). Using only subcutaneous injection data, we successfully estimated the CL of 23/25 mAbs (92%) and F of all 25 mAbs (100%) within 1.5-fold of the observed value. Moreover, overall, the simulated concentration-time profiles were largely consistent with observed data (90.8% within 1.5-fold of the observed values).

There was no clustering of the present WNV with other WNVs isolated in other parts of the Middle East. Within lineage 1a, the dromedary WNV occupied a unique position, although it was most closely related to other WNVs of cluster 2. Comparative analysis revealed that the putative E protein encoded by the genome possessed the original WNV E protein glycosylation motif NYS at E154C156, which contained the N-linked glycosylation site at N-154 associated with increased WNV pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness.

RESULTS: Adaptation of disease control strategies to the epidemiological situation per barangay, through micro-stratification, brings gains in efficiency, but should be accompanied by further capacity building on local situational analysis for better selection and targeting of vector control interventions within the barangay. An integrated approach to vector control, aiming to improve the rational use of resources, was evident with a multi-disease strategy for detection and response, and by the use of combinations of vector control methods. Collaboration within the health sector was apparent from the involvement of barangay health workers, re-orientation of job descriptions and the creation of a disease surveillance unit. The engagement of barangay leaders and use of existing community structures helped mobilize local resources and voluntary services for vector control. In one location, local authorities and the community were involved in the planning, implementation and evaluation of malaria control, which triggered local programme ownership.

Our general-purpose framework integrates into a single computational platform a multi-purpose compartmental disease propagation model, a human behavior network, a resource logistics model, and a stochastic queueing model for vaccination operations. We apply the modeling framework to the current COVID-19 pandemic and derive an optimal trigger for switching from a prioritized vaccination strategy to a non-prioritized strategy so as to minimize the overall attack rate and mortality rate. When vaccine supply is limited, such a mixed vaccination strategy is broadly effective. Our analysis suggests that delays in vaccine supply and inefficiencies in vaccination delivery can substantially impede the containment effort. Employing an optimal mixed strategy can significantly reduce the attack and mortality rates. The more infectious the virus, the earlier it helps to open the vaccine to the public. As vaccine efficacy decreases, the attack and mortality rates rapidly increase by multiples;this highlights the importance of early vaccination to reduce spreading as quickly as possible to lower the chances for further mutations to evolve and to reduce the excessive healthcare burden. To maximize the protective effect of available vaccines, of equal importance are determining the optimal mixed strategy and implementing effective on-the-ground dispensing. The optimal mixed strategy is quite robust against variations in model parameters and can be implemented readily in practice. Studies with our holistic modeling framework strongly support the urgent need for early vaccination in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Our framework permits rapid custom modeling in practice.

Intimate linkage of human and animal health is not a new phenomenon. However, the global scope of contemporary zoonoses has no historical precedent. Indeed, most human infectious diseases classed as emerging are zoonotic, and many of these have spilled over from natural wildlife reservoirs into humans either directly or via domestic or peridomestic animals. Conservation medicine has recently emerged as a meaningful discipline to address the intersection of animal, human, and ecosystem health. Interest in the development of novel vaccines for wildlife encounters important challenges that may prevent progress beyond the conceptual phase. Although notable examples of successful wildlife immunisation programmes exist, depending upon key considerations, vaccination may or may not prove to be effective in the field. When implemented, wildlife vaccination requires a combination of novel zoonosis pathogen management strategies and public education to balance conservation, economic, and public health issues.","output":"Vaccination in conservation medicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A study conducted at the International Airport of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, with the aim of investigating the presence/absence of invasive Aedes mosquito species resulted in finding Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald 1901) eggs in one of the ovitraps placed on site.

Improving autoregulation monitoring methods would significantly advance neonatal neurocritical care. METHODS We tested several mathematical algorithms from the frequency and time domains in a piglet model of HIE, hypothermia, and hypotension. We used laser Doppler flowmetry and induced hypotension to delineate the gold standard lower limit of autoregulation (LLA). Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses were used to determine which indices could distinguish blood pressure above the LLA from that below the LLA in each piglet. RESULTS Phase calculation in the frequency band with maximum coherence, as well as the correlation between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and near-infrared spectroscopy relative total tissue hemoglobin (HbT) or regional oxygen saturation (rSO2), accurately discriminated functional from dysfunctional autoregulation. Neither hypoxia-ischemia nor hypothermia affected the accuracy of these indices. Coherence alone and gain had low diagnostic value relative to phase and correlation. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that phase shift is the most accurate component of autoregulation monitoring in the developing brain, and it can be measured using correlation or by calculating phase when coherence is maximal. Phase and correlation autoregulation indices from MAP and rSO2 and vasoreactivity indices from MAP and HbT are accurate metrics that are suitable for clinical HIE studies.","output":"Comparison of Frequency- and Time-Domain Autoregulation and Vasoreactivity Indices in a Piglet Model of Hypoxia-Ischemia and Hypothermia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus infection (COVID) presents with flu-like symptoms and can cause serious complications. Here, we discuss the presentation and outcomes of COVID in an ambulatory setting along with distribution of positive cases amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). METHOD: Patients who visited the COVID clinic between 03/11/2020 and 06/14/2020 were tested based on the CDC guidelines at the time using PCR-detection methods. Medical records were reviewed and captured on a RedCap database. Statistical analysis was performed using both univariate and bivariate analysis using Fischer's exact test with 2-sided P values. RESULTS: Of the 2471 evaluated patients, 846 (34.2%) tested positive for COVID. Mean age of positivity was 43.4 years (SD  15.4), 60.1% were female and 49% were Black. 58.7% of people tested had a known exposure, and amongst those with exposure, 57.3% tested positive. Ninety-four patients were hospitalized (11.1%), of which 22 patients (23.4%) required ICU admission and 10 patients died. The overall death rate of patients presenting to clinic was 0.4%, or 1.2% amongst positive patients. Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (range 1-51). Symptoms significantly associated with COVID included: anosmia, fever, change in taste, anorexia, myalgias, cough, chills, and fatigue. Increased risk of COVID occurred with diabetes, whereas individuals with lung disease or malignancy were not associated with increased risk of COVID. Amongst COVID positive HCWs, the majority were registered nurses (23.4%), most working in general medicine (39.8%) followed by critical care units (14.3%).

The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19. The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify: (a) geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk in the Greater St. Louis area of Missouri, USA; (b) predictors of the identified disparities. Methods: Data on COVID-19 incidence and chronic disease hospitalizations were obtained from the Departments of Health and Missouri Hospital Association, respectively. Socioeconomic and demographic data were obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey while population mobility data were obtained from the SafeGraph website. Choropleth maps were used to identify geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk and its predictors at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) spatial scale. Global negative binomial and local geographically weighted negative binomial models were used to identify predictors of ZCTA-level geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk. Results: There were geographic disparities in COVID-19 risk. Risks tended to be higher in ZCTAs with high percentages of the population with a bachelors degree (p<0.0001) and obesity hospitalizations (p<0.0001). Conversely, risks tended to be lower in ZCTAs with high percentages of the population working in agriculture (p<0.0001). However, the association between agricultural occupation and COVID-19 risk was modified by per capita between ZCTA visits. Areas that had both high per capita between ZCTA visits and high percentages of the population employed in agriculture had high COVID-19 risks. The strength of association between agricultural occupation and COVID-19 risk varied by geographic location. Conclusions: Geographic Information Systems, global and local models are useful for identifying geographic disparities and predictors of COVID-19 risk. Geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk exist in the St. Louis area and are explained by differences in sociodemographic factors, population movements, and obesity hospitalization risks. The latter is particularly concerning due to the growing prevalence of obesity and the known immunological impairments among obese individuals. Therefore, future studies need to focus on improving our understanding of the relationships between COVID-19 vaccination efficacy, obesity and waning of immunity among obese individuals so as to better guide vaccination regimens, reduce disparities and improve population health for all.","output":"Geographic Disparities and Determinants of COVID-19 Incidence Risk in the Greater St. Louis Area, Missouri"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present BESSIE (Behavior and Epidemic Simulator for Synthetic Information Environments), an open source, agent-based simulator for COVID-type epidemics.

The aim of this study was to identify barriers to and facilitators of women's participation in HIV clinical trials in Switzerland. METHODS We conducted semi-structured interviews among 20 women with HIV to explore factors associated with non-participation in clinical trials. The interviewer presented to participants a clinical trial's description and discussed it with them. Lexicometric analysis on transcribed interviews identified three themes and eight sub-themes related to the pros and cons of participation in HIV clinical trials. RESULTS Participants evoked mainly decision-making drivers, concerns for women living with HIV and treatment side-effects. They highlighted the need for extensive information provided by trusted healthcare professionals on the research process as central to the decision to enrol in HIV clinical trials. Familial responsibilities were clearly identified as barriers to their participation, but not pregnancy. Additional preoccupations were other health concerns and comorbidities and the consequences of stopping ongoing antiretroviral treatments. CONCLUSIONS To overcome the barriers to the participation of women living with HIV in clinical research in Western countries, healthcare professionals and researchers should increase women's research literacy by involving them in the study design and by tailoring clinical trials to their social roles and health concerns.

Both mRNA BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Fosun Pharma) and inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccines are widely available, however coverage has remained low in older adults. Vaccine effectiveness in this predominantly infection-naive population is unknown. Methods: We used individual-level case data on mild/moderate, severe/fatal and fatal hospitalized COVID-19 from December 31, 2021 to March 8, 2022, along with census information and coverage data of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac. We used a negative binomial model, adjusting for age and calendar day to estimate vaccine effectiveness of one, two and three dose schedules of both vaccines, and relative effectiveness by number of doses and vaccine type. Findings: A total of 12.7 million vaccine doses were administered in the 7.3 million population of Hong Kong, and we analyzed data from confirmed cases with mild/moderate (N=5,474), severe/fatal (N=5,294) and fatal (N=4,093) COVID-19. Two doses of either vaccine protected against severe disease and death, with higher effectiveness among adults []60 years with BNT162b2 (VE: 88.2%, 95% confidence interval, CI: 84.4%, 91.1%) compared to CoronaVac (VE: 74.1%, 95% CI: 67.8%, 79.2%). Three doses of either vaccine offered very high levels of protection against severe outcomes (VE: 98.1%, 95% CI: 97.1%, 98.8%).

The questionnaire, which is potentially capable of differentiating patients with fractures, does not appear to have the differential capacity in terms of osteoporosis. PURPOSE: This study aims to conduct the reliability and validity study of QUALEFFO-31 in Turkish and to evaluate the capacity of the questionnaire to distinguish patients in terms of osteoporosis. METHODS: The original English version was translated into Turkish by two translators whose native language was Turkish. Subsequently, this Turkish version was translated back into English by two different bilingual translators whose native language was English. After this preliminary questionnaire was tested in 30 patients, words, terminology, information errors, and parts difficult to understand were revised, and the questionnaire was finalized. Internal consistency and testCretest analyses were used for the reliability study. For the validity study, convergent-discriminant validity, concurrent validity, factor analysis, known-group validity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were evaluated. Internal consistency levels were optimal except for the mental function. ICC coefficients showed good retest reliability for all domains and total tests. The convergent and discriminant validity ratios for the mental function domain were 78% for both and 100% for the other domains. There was a moderate and good negative correlation between QUALEFFO-31 and SF-36 domains which had similar names. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 3 structures. However, there was a spread to the other factors in physical function domain items. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) markers were not at a very good fitting level except for the relative chi-square index. When CFA was performed according to the assumed model, the fitting level increased in all analyses. There was no significant differential capacity in terms of osteoporosis or fracture for either QUALEFFO-31 or SF-36. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of QUALEFFO-31 has a sufficient level of reliability, validity, and psychometric properties. Nevertheless, improvements in pain and mental function domains and some changes applying to the model may increase the psychometric capacity of the questionnaire. The questionnaire, which is potentially capable of differentiating patients with fractures, does not appear to have the differential capacity in terms of osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a same-day discharge (SDD) pathway after conscious sedation, transfemoral (minimalist) TAVR to help minimize risk of viral transmission and conserve hospital resources. Studies support that next-day discharge (NDD) for carefully selected patients following minimalist TAVR is safe and feasible. There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of SDD after TAVR. METHODS: In-hospital and 30 day outcomes of consecutive patients meeting pre-specified criteria for SDD after minimalist TAVR at our institution between March and July of 2020 were reviewed. Outcomes were compared to a NDD cohort from July 2018 through July 2020 that would have met SDD criteria. Primary endpoints were mortality, delayed pacemaker placement, stroke and cardiovascular readmission at 30 days. RESULTS: Twenty nine patients were discharged via the SDD pathway after TAVR. 128 prior NDD patients were identified who met all criteria for SDD. The STS scores were similar between the two groups (SDD 2.6% 1.5 vs. NDD 2.3%  1.2). There were no deaths at 30 days in either group. There was no significant difference in delayed pacemaker placement (SDD 0% vs. NDD 0.8%, p > .99) or cardiovascular readmission (SDD 0% vs. NDD 5.5%, p = .35) at 30 days.

Lack of skills and knowledge on the part of health care providers have a negative effect on their access to care and health outcomes. This study 1) explores the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding LGBT people, and 2) assesses the impact of a one-hour lecture targeting adolescent LGBT health needs. METHODS Fourth-year medical students attended a compulsory one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and gender identity development in adolescence, highlighting health issues. We created a questionnaire with items to elicit students' knowledge and attitudes about LGBT health issues. Students were invited to complete this questionnaire online anonymously one week before the lecture and one month after the lecture. RESULTS Out of a total of 157 students, 107 (68.2%) responded to the pre-intervention questionnaire and 96 (61.1%) to the post-intervention questionnaire. A significant proportion-13.7% of all respondents-identified as LGBT or questioning. Our results show that most medical students already show favorable attitudes towards LGBT people and a certain degree of knowledge of LGBT health needs. They demonstrated a large and significant increase in knowledge of LGBT health issues one month after the lecture.

Exemplars within a category were presented with different contexts as a function of color (e.g., the five red staplers were presented with a classroom scene, and the five blue staplers with an office scene). Participants then completed a visual search task, in which they searched for novel exemplars matching a category label cue among arrays of eight objects superimposed over a scene background. In the context-match condition, the color of the target exemplar was consistent with the color associated with that combination of category and scene context from the exposure phase (e.g., a red stapler in a classroom scene). In the context-mismatch condition, the color of the target was not consistent with that association (e.g., a red stapler in an office scene). In two experiments, search response time was reliably lower in the context-match than in the context-mismatch condition, demonstrating that the learning of category-specific color regularities was itself structured by scene context.

Substantial interplay can be expected between pregnant women and providers respective experiences of care, but most studies report findings separately. This study explores the experience and effects of G-ANC on both women and providers to inform an integrated theory of change for G-ANC in LMICs. METHODS: This paper reports on multiple secondary outcomes from a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial of group antenatal care in Kenya and Nigeria conducted from October 2016November 2018 including 20 clusters per country. We collected qualitative data from providers and women providing or receiving group antenatal care via focus group discussions (19 with women; 4 with providers) and semi-structured interviews (42 with women; 4 with providers). Quantitative data were collected via surveys administered to 1) providers in the intervention arm at enrollment and after facilitating 4 cohorts and 2) women in both study arms at enrollment; 3C6 weeks postpartum; and 1 year postpartum. Through an iterative approach with framework analysis, we explored the interactions of voiced experience and perceived effects of care and placed them relationally within a theory of change. Selected variables from baseline and final surveys were analyzed to examine applicability of the theory to all study participants. RESULTS: Findings support seven inter-related themes. Three themes relate to the shared experience of care of women and providers: forming supportive relationships and open communication; becoming empowered partners in learning and care; and providing and receiving meaningful clinical services and information. Four themes relate to effects of that experience, which are not universally shared: self-reinforcing cycles of more and better care; linked improvements in health knowledge, confidence, and healthy behaviors; improved communication, support, and care beyond G-ANC meetings; and motivation to continue providing G-ANC. Together these themes map to a theory of change which centers the shared experience of care for women and providers among multiple pathways to improved outcomes. DISCUSSION: The reported experience and effects of G-ANC on women and providers are consistent with other studies in LMICs. This study is novel because it uses the themes to present a theory of change for G-ANC in low-resource settings. It is useful for G-ANC implementation to inform model development, test adaptations, and continue exploring mechanisms of action in future research.","output":"Transforming womens and providers experience of care for improved outcomes: A theory of change for group antenatal care in Kenya and Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NEW FINDINGS Humans use sensory integration mechanisms to sense skin wetness based on thermal and mechanical cues. Ageing impairs the skin's thermal and tactile sensitivity; yet does ageing also induce loss of skin wetness sensitivity? We assessed skin wetness sensing across the body of younger (20y) and older healthy males (60y) and found that older adults show an average 15% loss of skin wetness sensitivity, with this sensory deficit being mediated by a combination of reductions in skin's tactile sensing and hydration status. These findings increase the knowledge on wetness sensing mechanisms across the life span. ABSTRACT Humans use sensory integration mechanisms to sense skin wetness based on thermal and mechanical cues. Ageing impairs the skin's thermal and tactile sensitivity. Yet, we lack evidence on whether wetness sensing also changes with aging. We mapped local skin wetness and temperature sensitivity in response to cold-, neutral-, and warm-wet stimuli applied to the forehead, neck, lower back, dorsal foot, index finger and thumb, in 10 YOUNGER (22.41.1y) and 10 OLDER males (58.25.1y). We measured local skin temperature and conductance (i.e. a marker of hydration status) at the tested sites, to establish the role of skin's thermal and mechanical parameters in ageing-induced changes in wetness sensing. Irrespective of body site, OLDER reported overall lower wetness perceptions than YOUNGER across all wet stimuli's temperatures (mean difference: -14.6mm; 95%CI: -4.3, -24.9; p = 0.008; 15% difference). When considering regional wetness sensitivity, the effect of ageing was more pronounced in response to the cold-wet stimulus over the lover back (mean difference OLDER vs. YOUNGER: -36.8mm; 95% CI = -68.4, -5.2; p = 0.014; 37% difference) and dorsal foot (mean difference: -37.1mm; 95% CI = -68.7, -5.5; p = 0.013; 37% difference). We found no differences between age groups on overall thermal sensations (p = 0.744) nor local skin temperature (p = 0.372); however, we found that OLDER presented overall lower skin conductance than YOUNG (mean difference: -1.56 S; 95%CI: -0.49, -2.62; p = 0.005), which corresponded to a 78% reduction in skin hydration. We conclude that skin wetness sensing decreases with ageing primarily due to age-induced changes in skin mechanics and tactile sensitivity. This article is protected by copyright.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also raised concerns among patients with inflammatory rheumatic conditions and their treating physicians. There are emerging data regarding the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 for this particular patient group. However, less is known with regard to the course of COVID-19 among patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors. The aim of the current article is to review the growing body of knowledge on the course/management of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases by presenting a SARS-CoV-2 infected case with ankylosing spondylitis under secukinumab therapy. A 61-year old patient with ankylosing spondylitis who was on secukinumab therapy for 5 months admitted with newly onset fever and gastrointestinal complaints. After being hospitalized, she developed respiratory manifestations with focal pulmonary ground-glass opacities and multiple nodular densities in both lungs. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substantial clinical improvement was obtained following a management plan, which included tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and enoxaparin sodium. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched by using relevant keywords and their combinations. The literature search revealed four articles reporting the clinical course of COVID-19 in seven rheumatic patients on secukinumab. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in most of these patients, while one of them experienced severe COVID-19. Interleukin-17 has been related to the hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 and IL-17 inhibitors were presented as promising targets for the prevention of aberrant inflammation and acute respiratory distress in COVID-19. However, this hypothesis still remains to be proved. Further studies are warranted in order to test the benefits and risks of IL-inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis treated with secukinumab: a case-based review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hematopoietic and immune cells originate from a common hematopoietic/lymphopoietic stem cell what explains that these different cell types often share the same receptors and respond to similar factors. Moreover, the common goal of both lineages is to ensure tissue homeostasis under steady-state conditions, fight invading pathogens, and promote tissue repair. We will highlight accumulating evidence that innate and adaptive immunity modulate several aspects of hematopoiesis within the hormetic zone in which the biological response to low exposure to potential stressors generally is favorable and benefits hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Innate immunity impact on hematopoiesis is pleiotropic and involves both the cellular arm, comprised of innate immunity cells, and the soluble arm, whose major component is the complement cascade (ComC). In addition, several mediators released by innate immunity cells, including inflammatory cytokines and small antimicrobial cationic peptides, affect hematopoiesis. There are intriguing observations that HSPCs and immune cells share several cell-surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosol-expressed NOD, NOD-like, and RIG-I-like receptors and thus can be considered pathogen sensors. In addition, not only lymphocytes but also HSPCs express functional intracellular complement proteins, defined as complosome which poses challenging questions for further investigation of the intracellular ComC-mediated intracrine regulation of hematopoiesis.","output":"Hematopoiesis and innate immunity: an inseparable couple for good and bad times, bound together by an hormetic relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the fabrication of efficient multicomponent semiconductors for photocatalysis, well-defined hierarchical structures and high-quality heterojunctions are still highly desired.

Herein, nine traditional Chinese medicinal plant constituents from different origins (Glycyrrhizin 1, Lycorine 2, Puerarin 3, Daidzein 4, Daidzin 5, Salvianolic acid B 6, Dihydrotanshinone I 7, Tanshinone I 8, Tanshinone IIa 9) previously reported to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV were virtually screened in silico (molecular docking) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The tested medicinal plant compounds were in silico screened for their activity against two key SARS-CoV-2 target proteins;3CLpro, and Spike binding-domain proteins. Among the tested medicinal plant compounds, Salvianolic acid B 6 (Sal-B) showed promising binding affinities against the two specified SARS-CoV-2 target proteins compared to the reference standards used. Hence molecular dynamics simulations followed by calculating the free-binding energy were carried out for Sal-B providing information on its affinity, stability, and thermodynamic behavior within the two SARS-CoV-2 target proteins as well as key ligand-protein binding aspects. Besides, the quantum mechanical calculations showed that Sal-B can adopt different conformations due to the existence of various rotatable bonds. Therefore, the enhanced antiviral activity of Sal-B among other studied compounds can be also attributed to the structural flexibility of Sal-B. Our study gives an explanation of the structure activity relationship required for targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and Spike proteins and also facilitates the future design and synthesis of new potential drugs exhibiting better affinity and specificity.

By 1 October 2020, there were 210 000 COVID deaths in the US population with 693 expected physician deaths. Observed deaths were 16% of expected. Seventy-five per cent of the deaths occurred among physicians older than age 60 and about half appeared to be among those retired from clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Observed physician deaths were significantly below expected based on deaths the general population.

However, their role in circulation and transmission of both endemic and emerging disease is a source of concern in a region considered a hotspot of disease emergence. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos), live and dead wild animals are frequently found in wet markets, despite legislation against the bushmeat trade. This is generally considered to increase the risk of disease transmission and emergence, although whether or not wildlife vendors themselves have indeed increased incidence of zoonotic disease has rarely been assessed. In preparation for a future longitudinal study of market vendors investigating vendors' exposure to zoonotic pathogens, we conducted a pilot survey of Lao market vendors of wildlife meat, livestock meat and vegetables, to identify demographic characteristics and potential control groups within markets. We also investigated baseline risk perception for infectious diseases among market vendors and assessed the association between risk perception and risk mitigation behaviours. The surveys conducted with 177 vendors revealed similar age, sex, ethnic background and geographical origin between vendor types, but differences in professional background and work history for livestock meat vendors. The perception of disease risk was very low across all vendors, as was the reported use of personal protective equipment, and the two appeared unrelated. Personal risk discounting and assumptions about transmission routes may explain this lack of association. This information will help inform the development of future research, risk communication and risk mitigation policy, especially in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perception of health risks in Lao market vendors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among healthcare personnel (HCP) and to assess occupational risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of healthcare personnel (HCP) followed for 6 months from May through December 2020. SETTING: Large academic healthcare system including 4 hospitals and affiliated clinics in Atlanta, Georgia. PARTICIPANTS: HCP, including those with and without direct patient-care activities, working during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infections were determined through serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG at enrollment, at 3 months, and at 6 months. HCP completed monthly surveys regarding occupational activities. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify occupational factors that increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Of the 304 evaluable HCP that were seronegative at enrollment, 26 (9%) seroconverted for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by 6 months. Overall, 219 participants (73%) self-identified as White race, 119 (40%) were nurses, and 121 (40%) worked on inpatient medical-surgical floors. In a multivariable analysis, HCP who identified as Black race were more likely to seroconvert than HCP who identified as White (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.3C14.2). Increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection was not identified for any occupational activity, including spending >50% of a typical shift at a patients bedside, working in a COVID-19 unit, or performing or being present for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs).

There has not yet been a systematic, critical appraisal of the relative strength of evidence among subsets of the practice of facial plastic surgery. METHODS The current study is a systematic review, designed to evaluate the level of evidence observed in the facial plastic surgery literature. Five journals were queried using facial plastic surgery terms for four selected years over a 10-year period. Following screening, articles were assigned to a category regarding subject matter, assessed for the presence of various methodological traits, and evaluated for overall level of evidence. Comparisons were made in regard to level of evidence across the breadth of facial plastic surgery subject matter. RESULTS A total of 826 articles were included for final review. Studies on operative facial rejuvenation and rhinoplasty had significantly fewer authors on average than studies on cancer reconstruction or craniofacial topics. Craniofacial studies demonstrated higher levels of evidence relative to all other categories, with the exception of facial paralysis and facial trauma studies, from which there was no significant difference. In general, reconstructive studies had significantly more authors and higher levels of evidence than did articles with an aesthetic focus. CONCLUSION Level of evidence in facial plastic surgery remains relatively weak overall.

The capacity of the virus to destroy the host cell by liberating its own DNA or RNA and replicating inside the host cell poses challenges in the development of antiviral therapeutics. In recent years, many new technologies have been explored for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections. Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the most promising technologies on account of its ability to deal with viral diseases in an effective manner, addressing the limitations of traditional antiviral medicines. It has not only helped us to overcome problems related to solubility and toxicity of drugs, but also imparted unique properties to drugs, which in turn has increased their potency and selectivity toward viral cells against the host cells. The initial part of the paper focuses on some important proteins of influenza, Ebola, HIV, herpes, Zika, dengue, and corona virus and those of the host cells important for their entry and replication into the host cells. This is followed by different types of nanomaterials which have served as delivery vehicles for the antiviral drugs. It includes various lipid-based, polymer-based, lipid-polymer hybrid-based, carbon-based, inorganic metal-based, surface-modified, and stimuli-sensitive nanomaterials and their application in antiviral therapeutics.

Herein, we describe its use in immunoPET to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection of rhesus macaques. Using PET/CT imaging of macaques at different times post-SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, we demonstrate that the (64)Cu-labelled CR3022-F(ab)2 probe targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can be used to study the dynamics of infection within the respiratory tract and uncover novel sites of infection. Differences in lung pathology between infection with the WA1 isolate and the delta variant were readily observed using immunoPET and corroborated CT lung pathology. The ability of the probe to illuminate lung-associated pathology demonstrates its specificity and function to detect infection in PET scan. The (64)Cu-CR3022-probe also demonstrated dynamic changes occurring between 1- and 2-weeks post-infection. Remarkably, a robust signal was seen in the male genital tract (MGT) of all three animals studied. Infection of the MGT was validated by immunofluorescence imaging of infected cells in the testicular and penile tissue and severe pathology was observed in the testes of one animal at 2-weeks post-infection.

METHODS: In this large comparative cohort study, real-time searches and analyses were performed on adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were treated with TNFis or methotrexate compared with those who were not treated. The likelihood of hospitalization and mortality were compared between groups with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors. RESULTS: More than 53 million (53,511,836) unique patient records were analyzed, of which 32,076 (0.06%) had a COVID-19-related diagnosis documented starting after January 20, 2020. Two hundred fourteen patients with COVID-19 were identified with recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure compared with 31,862 patients with COVID-19 without TNFi or methotrexate exposure.

One of their prominent activities is the antimicrobial/antiviral activities, which are much apparent when the key functional structural moieties of both of them meet into the same compounds. The current COVID-19 pandemic motivated us to computationally screen and evaluate our library of previously-synthesized 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles against the major SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Interestingly, few ligands showed promising low binding free energies (potent inhibitory interactions/affinities) with the active sites of some coronaviral-2 enzymes, specially the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nCoV-RdRp). One of them was 5,5'-{5,5'-[(1R,2R)-1,2-dihydroxyethane-1,2-diyl]bis(1,3,4-oxadiazole-5,2-diyl)}dibenzene-1,2,3-triol (Taroxaz-104), which showed significantly low binding energies (-10.60 and -9.10 kcal/mol) with nCoV-RdRp-RNA and nCoV-RdRp alone, respectively. These binding energies are even considerably lower than those of remdesivir potent active metabolite GS-443902 (which showed -9.20 and -7.90 kcal/mol with the same targets, respectively). Further computational molecular investigation revealed that Taroxaz-104 molecule strongly inhibits one of the potential active sites of nCoV-RdRp (the one with which GS-443902 molecule mainly interacts), since it interacts with at least seven major active amino acid residues of its predicted pocket. The successful repurposing of Taroxaz-104 has been achieved after the promising results of the anti-COVID-19 biological assay were obtained, as the data showed that Taroxaz-104 exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.42 M) with interesting effectiveness against the new strains/variants of SARS-CoV-2.

While much research focuses on the epidemiological and virological aspects of COVID-19 transmission, there remains an important gap in knowledge regarding the drivers of geographical diffusion between places, in particular at the global scale. Here, we use quantile regression to model the roles of globalisation, human settlement and population characteristics as socio-spatial determinants of reported COVID-19 diffusion over a six-week period in March and April 2020. Our exploratory analysis is based on reported COVID-19 data published by Johns Hopkins University which, despite its limitations, serves as the best repository of reported COVID-19 cases across nations. RESULTS: The quantile regression model suggests that globalisation, settlement, and population characteristics related to high human mobility and interaction predict reported disease diffusion. Human development level (HDI) and total population predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a high number of total reported cases (per million) whereas larger household size, older populations, and globalisation tied to human interaction predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a low number of total reported cases (per million). Population density, and population characteristics such as total population, older populations, and household size are strong predictors in early weeks but have a muted impact over time on reported COVID-19 diffusion. In contrast, the impacts of interpersonal and trade globalisation are enhanced over time, indicating that human mobility may best explain sustained disease diffusion. CONCLUSIONS: Model results confirm that globalisation, settlement and population characteristics, and variables tied to high human mobility lead to greater reported disease diffusion. These outcomes serve to inform suppression strategies, particularly as they are related to anticipated relocation diffusion from more- to less-developed countries and regions, and hierarchical diffusion from countries with higher population and density. It is likely that many of these processes are replicated at smaller geographical scales both within countries and within regions. Epidemiological strategies must therefore be tailored according to human mobility patterns, as well as countries' settlement and population characteristics. We suggest that limiting human mobility to the greatest extent practical will best restrain COVID-19 diffusion, which in the absence of widespread vaccination may be one of the best lines of epidemiological defense.","output":"The socio-spatial determinants of COVID-19 diffusion: the impact of globalisation, settlement characteristics and population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have demonstrated that female patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrate more favorable prognosis relative to male patients","output":"Estrogen and the Disease Severity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lithium chloride has been widely used as a therapeutic mood stabilizer. Although cumulative evidence suggests that lithium plays modulatory effects on postsynaptic receptors, the underlying mechanism by which lithium regulates synaptic transmission has not been fully elucidated. In this work, by using the advantageous neuromuscular synapse, we evaluated the effect of lithium on the stability of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in vivo. We found that in normally innervated neuromuscular synapses, lithium chloride significantly decreased the turnover of nAChRs by reducing their internalization. A similar response was observed in CHO-K1/A5 cells expressing the adult muscle-type nAChRs. Strikingly, in denervated neuromuscular synapses, lithium led to enhanced nAChR turnover and density by increasing the incorporation of new nAChRs. Lithium also potentiated the formation of unstable nAChR clusters in non-synaptic regions of denervated muscle fibres. We found that denervation-dependent re-expression of the foetal nAChR -subunit was not altered by lithium. However, while denervation inhibits the distribution of -catenin within endplates, lithium-treated fibres retain -catenin staining in specific foci of the synaptic region. Collectively, our data reveal that lithium treatment differentially affects the stability of postsynaptic receptors in normal and denervated neuromuscular synapses in vivo, thus providing novel insights into the regulatory effects of lithium on synaptic organization and extending its potential therapeutic use in conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system.","output":"Lithium causes differential effects on postsynaptic stability in normal and denervated neuromuscular synapses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization. Pathogen identification fails in approximately 20% of children but is critical for optimal treatment and prevention of hospital-acquired infections.

Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs from 70 children <5 years with CAP of unknown etiology and 90 asymptomatic controls were tested by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and pan viral group (PVG) PCR for 19 viral families. Association of viruses with CAP was assessed by adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for season and age group. RESULTS. RNA-seq/PVG PCR detected previously missed, putative pathogens in 34% of patients. Putative viral pathogens included human parainfluenza virus 4 (aOR 9.3, P = .12), human bocavirus (aOR 9.1, P < .01), Coxsackieviruses (aOR 5.1, P = .09), rhinovirus A (aOR 3.5, P = .34), and rhinovirus C (aOR 2.9, P = .57).

Conclusions Quarantine can be a considerable stressor for asylum seekers. In this explorative study, shortcomings in the provision of daily necessities and information were visible. Potential adverse impacts of quarantine on wellbeing should be minimised through ensuring its comprehensibility, the supply of daily needs and low-threshold access to psychosocial support. Key messages Quarantine can be a significant stressor for newly arriving asylum seekers. Quarantine-induced stress should be minimised through appropriate information, the provision of daily necessities and psychosocial support.","output":"Asylum seeker? experiences with quarantine after arriving in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of major international concern. Real-time RT-PCR assays are recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19. Here we report a rare case of COVID-19 with multiple negative results for PCR assays outside Wuhan, China. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year old male was admitted to our hospital because of 6 days of unexplained fever on January 29, 2020. He had come from Wuhan city 10 days before admission. Five days before admission, no abnormality was noted in laboratory test, chest radiography, and nasopharyngeal swab test for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The patient was treated with ibuprofen for alleviating fever. On admission, chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities in right lower lung field. COVID-19 was suspected. Three times of nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected after admission. However, none of the specimens were positive. The patient was confirmed with COVID-19 after fifth SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. He was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant human interferon alfa-2b inhalation, methylprednisolone. After 18 days of treatment, he was discharged with improved symptoms, lung lesions and negative results of nasopharyngeal swab. CONCLUSION: This case reminds clinician that a patient with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but multiple negative RT-PCR result should not be taken out of isolation. A combination of patient's exposure history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and typical imaging findings plays a vital role in making preliminary diagnosis and guide early isolation and treatment. Repeat swab tests are helpful in diagnosis for this kind of patients.","output":"A COVID-19 patient with multiple negative results for PCR assays outside Wuhan, China: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the high incidence of COVID-19 case numbers internationally, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of global relevance, advising countries to follow protocols to combat pandemic advance through actions that can reduce spread and consequently avoid a collapse in the local health system. On March 18, 2020, Para notified the first case of COVID-19. After seven weeks, the number of confirmed cases reached 4,756 with 375 deaths. Knowing that infected people may be asymptomatic, the disease symptomatology absence and the population's neglect of isolation influence the spread, and factors such as chronic pneumonia, high age, obesity, chronic kidney diseases and other comorbidities favor the mortality rate. On the other hand, social isolation, quarantine and lockdown seek to contain the intraregional contagion advance.

The clinical practice of otolaryngology was especially impacted due to a reduction in elective procedures, such as facial plastic surgeries and vocal fold injections. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to examine the extent of clinical trial (CTs) disruption secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic in the field of otolaryngology. METHODS: On August 1, 2021, we conducted a systematic search utilizing ClinicalTrials.gov for CTs related to common otolaryngology disorders. We utilized the date range January 1, 2020 through August 1, 2021 to identify all trials potentially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Investigators performed screening and data extraction in a duplicate, masked fashion. Trials resulting from the search were extracted for trial status, condition treated, enrollment number, funding, study type, study design, last update posted date, and trial location. Trials that explicitly mentioned COVID-19 as a reason for discontinuation or suspension were coded as such. For trials that did not explicitly mention COVID-19, we coded the reason provided from ClinicalTrials.gov. The Oklahoma State University Center for Health Science Institutional Review Board determined that this project did not qualify as human subject research. RESULTS: A total of 1,777 CTs met the inclusion criteria, and 223 CTs were discontinued between January 1, 2020 and August 1, 2021. Thirty-three (14.8%) of the 223 CTs reported discontinuation explicitly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 33 studies had 1,715 participants enrolled in total. Among the primary interventions, 11 (33.3%) were devices, 10 (30.3%) were drugs, 5 (15.2%) were behavioral, 4 (12.1%) were diagnostic tests, 1 (3.0%) was dietary, and 2 (6.1%) were labeled as \\"other.\\" Regarding the CT location, 20 (60.6%) were conducted in the United States, and 13 (39.4%) were conducted internationally. Of the 33 CTs, 19 (57.6%) were suspended, 9 (27.3%) were terminated, and 5 (15.2%) were withdrawn. The overall most common reason for trial disruption was recruitment difficulties (24.2%). Median enrollment for discontinued trials due to COVID-19 was 37 (interquartile range [IQR], 19-71) and for other reasons was 6 (IQR, 0-27), for which the Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the two (z=-3.913, p<0.001). There were no significant associations between trial location, funding source, randomization, or whether a study involved masked vs unmasked participants. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has incited an impact on clinical research in the field of otolaryngology. To preserve trial continuation amid future threats to participant interaction and communication, we recommend further exploration of remote monitoring practices and virtual procedures-those that will maintain the effectiveness and accuracy needed to establish novel therapeutics. We encourage future trials to gauge which remote assessments show the greatest validity, with the long-term goal of establishing innovative study designs resilient to future pandemics.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on otolaryngology research: a cross-sectional analysis of discontinued trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Early detection and monitoring of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients are key to tackling dementia and providing benefits to patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and society. We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA); a 5-minute, language independent computerised cognitive test that employs an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to improve its accuracy in detecting cognitive impairment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the generalisability of the ICA in detecting cognitive impairment in MCI and mild AD patients. METHODS We studied the ICA in a total of 230 participants. 95 healthy volunteers, 80 MCI, and 55 participants with mild AD completed the ICA, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE) cognitive tests. RESULTS The ICA demonstrated convergent validity with MoCA (Pearson r = 0.58, p<0.0001) and ACE (r = 0.62, p<0.0001). The ICA AI model was able to detect cognitive impairment with an AUC of 81% for MCI patients, and 88% for mild AD patients. The AI model demonstrated improved performance with increased training data and showed generalisability in performance from one population to another. The ICA correlation of 0.17 (p=0.01) with education years is considerably smaller than that of MoCA (r=0.34, p<0.0001) and ACE (r=0.41, p<0.0001) which displayed significant correlations. In a separate study the ICA demonstrated no significant practice effect observed over the duration of the study. DISCUSSION The ICA can support clinicians by aiding accurate diagnosis of MCI and AD and is appropriate for large-scale screening of cognitive impairment.

Due to the limited evidence available on the dynamics of the virus and effective treatment options available, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a huge impact in terms of morbidity and mortality. The economic impact is still to be assessed. Aims: The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for the multiple treatment options available, to consider the future of this global pandemic, and to identify some potential options that could revolutionize the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this article underscores the sheer importance of repurposing some of the available antiviral and antimicrobial agents that have long been in use so as to have an effective and expeditious response to this widespread pandemic and the need to conduct a multicenter global randomized controlled trial to find an effective single antiviral agent or a cocktail of available antimicrobial agents. Method: We thoroughly searched and reviewed various case reports, retrospective analyses, and in vitro studies published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar regarding the treatment options used for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 since its outbreak in an attempt to highlight treatments with the most promising results. Conclusion: We are currently facing one of the worst pandemics in history. Although SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a lower mortality rate than are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, its higher infectivity is making it a far more serious threat. Unfortunately, no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 or effective drug regimen for COVID-19 currently exists. Drug repurposing of available antiviral agents may provide a respite; moreover, a cocktail of antiviral agents may be helpful in treating this disease.

Using a translational ovine model, we showed that intra-amniotic exposure to inflammatory stimuli decreased the regulatory/effector T (Treg/Teff) cell balance in the gut, which was accompanied by intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. We thus aimed to augment the Treg/Teff cell ratio in the fetal gut by prophylactic IL-2 treatment and evaluate whether it is sufficient to prevent chorioamnionitis-induced intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. METHODS Fetal sheep (122 d of gestation) were intra-amniotically exposed to lipopolysaccharide for 2 or 7 days with or without prophylactic IL-2 treatment (4 d). We evaluated the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes. Cytokine gene expression was analyzed in fetal ileum and the inflammatory changes were correlated with gut wall integrity. RESULTS IL-2 administration preferentially increased intestinal Treg cells and thus the Treg/Teff cell ratio. Prophylactic IL-2 treatment reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced influx of neutrophils and CD3(+) T cells and decreased the messenger RNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-17 in the fetal ileum. Importantly, prophylactic IL-2 treatment prevented mucosal damage without inducing fetal adverse treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Our data show that prophylactic IL-2 treatment prevents fetal intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury in the context of experimental chorioamnionitis.

These rare cells reside in the hypoxic niche of the bone marrow (BM) where they are subjected to a complex network of regulatory factors including cellular and molecular components. To sustain hematopoiesis over the lifetime of an individual, HSCs maintain distinctive metabolic programs, and in recent years nutritional factors have been increasingly recognized as critical regulators of HSC numbers and functions. Leptin (LEP), a neuroendocrine messenger, and its receptor (LEPR) are well-known for their immunomodulatory and energy balancing effects; yet, how LEP/LEPR signaling plays a role in hematopoiesis is under-appreciated. In this review, we summarize and highlight recent work that demonstrated involvement of LEP/LEPR in hematopoiesis under steady state or stress-associated situations as well as in pathological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and malignancies.

Previous reports demonstrate the existence of endotoxemia in viral infections without superimposed gram-negative bacteremia, but the rate and severity of endotoxemia in critically ill patients with COVID-19 requires further exploration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center cross-sectional study of 92 intensive care unit patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Endotoxin activity (EA) was measured in patients that met the following criteria: (1) age 18 years and (2) multi-organ dysfunction score >9 from March 24, 2020, to June 20, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for measurement of EA. The median age of the study cohort was 60 years with a majority male (21/32, 65%) with hypertension (50%). A significant proportion of the patients exhibited either elevated EA in the intermediate range (0.40C0.59 EA units) (10/32, 31%) or high range (0.60 EA units) (14/32, 44%) or were nonresponders (NRs, low neutrophil response) to EA (6/32, 19%), with the presence of gram-negative bacteremia only in 2/32 (6%) patients. Low EA was reported in 2/32 patients.

Patients hospitalized with active cancer are predisposed to thrombosis but whether active cancer further amplifies thrombotic risk with COVID\\\\19 is not known. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cumulative incidences of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events in hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients with and without active cancer at 28 days. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analyses of consecutive adults hospitalized with COVID\\\\19 was performed. Active cancer required cancer\\\\directed therapy within last 6 months. The cumulative incidences of thrombosis or hemorrhage were estimated considering death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Patients without cancer (n=353) and active cancer (n=45) were comparable in terms of age, sex, antibiotics administered, length of hospitalization, and critical care. The most common malignancies were lymphoid (17.8%), gastrointestinal (15.6%), lung (13.3%), and genitourinary (13.3%). At day 28, the cumulative incidence of thrombotic events was 18.2% (95% CI, 10.2% to 27.9%) in non\\\\cancer cohort and 14.2% (95% CI, 4.7% to 28.7%) in the cancer cohort.

It is not clear whether FcR receptors play a role in human asthma and allergy. The aim of current study was to investigate whether functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FcR genes (FCGR) are associated with human asthma and allergy. METHODS: Functional SNPs of FCGR2A (FcRIIA-131His>Arg, rs1801274), FCGR2B (FcRIIB-187Ile>Thr, rs1050501), FCGR2C (FcRIIC-13Gln>Stop, rs10917661), FCGR3A (FcRIIIA-158Val>Phe, rs396991), and FCGR3B variants (FcRIIIB NA1 and NA2) were genotyped in an asthma family cohort including 370 atopy positive, 239 atopy negative, and 169 asthma positive subjects. The genotype and phenotype data (asthma, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and atopy) of subjects were analyzed using family-based association tests (FBAT) and logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. RESULT: The FcRIIA-131His>Arg SNP is significantly associated with atopy in a family-based association test (P = 0.00287) and in a logistic regression analysis (P = 0.0269, OR 0.732, 95% CI: 0.555C0.965). The FcRIIA-131His (or rs1801274-A) allele capable of binding human IgG2 has a protective role against atopy. In addition, the rare FcRIIB-187Thr (or rs1050501-C) allele defective for the receptor-mediated inhibitory signals is a risk factor for atopy (P = 0.0031, OR 1.758, 95% CI: 1.209C2.556) and IgE production (P<0.001).

Functional electrical stimulation is a technique that helps regain motor function, assisting patients in daily life activities and in rehabilitation practices. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a treatment based on whole-body Adaptive Functional Electrical Stimulation Kinesitherapy (AFESK?) with the use of muscle synergies, a well-established method for evaluation of motor coordination. The evaluation is performed on retrospectively gathered data of neurological patients executing whole-body movements before and after AFESK-based treatments. METHODS Twenty-four chronic neurologic patients and 9 healthy subjects were recruited in this study. The patient group was further subdivided in 3 subgroups: hemiplegic, tetraplegic and paraplegic. All patients underwent two acquisition sessions: before treatment and after a FES based rehabilitation treatment at the VIKTOR Physio Lab. Patients followed whole-body exercise protocols tailored to their needs. The control group of healthy subjects performed all movements in a single session and provided reference data for evaluating patients' performance. sEMG was recorded on relevant muscles and muscle synergies were extracted for each patient's EMG data and then compared to the ones extracted from the healthy volunteers. To evaluate the effect of the treatment, the motricity index was measured and patients' extracted synergies were compared to the control group before and after treatment. RESULTS After the treatment, patients' motricity index increased for many of the screened body segments. Muscle synergies were more similar to those of healthy people. Globally, the normalized synergy similarity in respect to the control group was 0.50 before the treatment and 0.60 after (p < 0.001), with improvements for each subgroup of patients. CONCLUSIONS AFESK treatment induced favorable changes in muscle activation patterns in chronic neurologic patients, partially restoring muscular patterns similar to healthy people.

The scaling solution accurately reproduces universal properties of the transition. This finding is used to infer the critical properties of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model for epidemics in infinite and finite power-law distributed networks. Here, discrepancies between analytical approaches and numerical results regarding the finite-size scaling of the epidemic threshold are a crucial open issue in the literature. We find that the scaling exponent assumes a nontrivial value during a long preasymptotic regime. We calculate this value, finding good agreement with numerical evidence. We also show that the crossover to the true asymptotic regime occurs for sizes much beyond currently feasible simulations.

An important subset of marine organisms are sessile, for which the most common mechanism for disease transmission is direct contact with waterborne parasites. Only recently, some deterministic compartmental models have been proposed to describe this kind of epidemics, being these models based on non-spatial descriptions where space is homogenised and parasite mobility is not explicitly accounted for. However, in realistic situations, epidemic transmission is conditioned by the spatial distribution of hosts and the parasites mobility patterns. Thus, the interplay between these factors is expected to have a crucial effect in the evolution of the epidemic, so calling for a explicit description of space. In this work we develop a spatially-explicit individual-based model to study disease transmission by waterborne parasites in sessile marine populations. We investigate the impact of spatial disease transmission, performing extensive numerical simulations and analytical approximations. Specifically, the effects of parasite mobility into the epidemic threshold and the temporal evolution of the epidemic are assessed. We show that larger values of pathogen mobility have two main implications: more severe epidemics, as the number of infections increases, and shorter time-scales to extinction. Moreover, an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number of the spatial model, , is derived as function of the non-spatial counterpart, R0, which characterises a transition between a disease-free and a propagation phase, in which the disease propagates over a large fraction of the system. This allows to determine a phase diagram for the epidemic model as function of the parasite mobility and the basic reproduction number of the non-spatial model.","output":"Spatial effects in parasite induced marine diseases of immobile hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with COVID-19 and acute cardiac injury as measured by an elevated high-sensitivity troponin I or troponin T upon admission or during hospitalization have a mortality rate of over 50% in initial reports.

Anteromedial coronoid fracture, in association with lateral collateral ligament (LCL) disruption, often results from varus posteromedial forces. Terrible triad injuries are more likely to result from valgus posterolateral forces. However, our case presentation has combined medial and lateral elbow instability in addition to terrible triad injury of the elbow with no radial head injury. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 38-year-old man with an atypical complex elbow dislocation. He was successfully treated by stabilizing the medial epicondyle and coronoid anterolateral facet fractures, in addition to LCL repair and medial collateral ligament (MCL) reconstruction. A radial head fracture was unnoted. The procedure yielded satisfactory functional outcome, with a stable and painless full elbow range of motion. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Multi-ligament injuries with coronoid fractures result in highly unstable elbow joints, forming a variant of the terrible triad injury. Surgical options vary according to the surgeons experience and equipment availability. In this case, direct LCL repair and MCL reconstruction were performed and were well tolerated. Elbow stability improved and the patient experienced improved functionality with minimal pain. However, it may be premature to report a definite outcome in this case because of short follow-up time postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The injury described in this case has a unique presentation as a multi-ligamentous injury will make the elbow very unstable.

We then use the observations from all putative connections in the recording to estimate two network properties: the presynaptic neuron type (excitatory or inhibitory) and the relationship between synaptic latency and distance between neurons. Constraining the presynaptic neuron's type, synaptic latencies, and time constants improves synapse detection. In data from simulated networks, this model outperforms two previously developed synapse detection methods, especially on the weak connections.

Small DNA viruses mutate orders of magnitude faster than their hosts despite using host-encoded polymerases for replication, which suggests these viruses may avoid post-replicative repair. Supporting this, the genome of bacteriophage ?X174 is completely devoid of GATC sequence motifs, which are required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. Here, we show that restoration of the randomly expected number of GATC sites leads to an eightfold reduction in the rate of spontaneous mutation of the phage, without severely impairing its replicative capacity over the short term. However, the efficacy of mismatch repair in the presence of GATC sites is limited by inefficient methylation of the viral DNA. Therefore, both GATC avoidance and DNA under-methylation elevate the mutation rate of the phage relative to that of the host. We also found that the effects of GATC sites on the phage mutation rate vary extensively depending on their specific location within the phage genome. Finally, the mutation rate reduction afforded by GATC sites is fully reverted under stress conditions, which up-regulate repair pathways and expression of error-prone host polymerases such as heat and treatment with the base analog 5-fluorouracil, suggesting that access to repair renders the phage sensitive to stress-induced mutagenesis.","output":"Effect of mismatch repair on the mutation rate of bacteriophage ?X174"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Magnesium (Mg) based temporary implants are an appealing new solution to counter the problems associated with the currently available temporary orthopaedic implants, used in fracture fixing. To make the extensive use of Mg-based implants in-vivo, mechanical integrity in the physiological environment is a prerequisite. This study presents an insight into the biomechanical stability of Mg-3Zn/HA (0, 5, and 15 wt % of HA) composites in two different milieus (simulated body fluid (SBF) and serum contained SBF (m-SBF)). After 14 days of static immersion in SBF, ~65% mechanical strength was compromised in the case of 15 wt % HA reinforcement. However, the degradation rate was slowed down by ~35% with the addition of 15 wt % HA in Mg-3Zn. Mg-3Zn/HA composite, when soaked in both fluids, was found to induce apatite layer formation on the surfaces for several days. However, in the case of m-SBF immersion, 15 wt % HA facilitated less precipitation of apatite growth when compared to SBF immersion. Nevertheless, m-SBF immersed 15 wt % HA composite facilitated better corrosion resistance and excellent mechanical stability after 14 days of immersion. The approach thereby assists in establishing an effective mechanism between the degradation and mechanical stability in in-vitro immersion. In addition, this study has also developed a semi-empirical model for prediction of the compressive strength of these composites as a function of the number of days of immersion and the content of hydroxyapatite (HA).

Using novel panel estimation techniques, our results find strong evidence of causation between meteorological factors and COVID-19 outcomes. We report that high temperature and high relative humidity reduce the viability, stability, survival and transmission of COVID-19 whereas low temperature, wind speed, dew/frost point, precipitation and surface pressure prolong the activation and infectivity of the virus.

Diagnostic information should be presented in an easily interpretable way, which conveys both test characteristics (diagnostic accuracy) and the potential for use in clinical practice (predictive value). METHODS: We discuss the types of graphical display commonly encountered in primary diagnostic accuracy studies and systematic reviews of such studies, and systematically review the use of graphical displays in recent diagnostic primary studies and systematic reviews. RESULTS: We identified 57 primary studies and 49 systematic reviews. Fifty-six percent of primary studies and 53% of systematic reviews used graphical displays to present results. Dot-plot or box-and- whisker plots were the most commonly used graph in primary studies and were included in 22 (39%) studies. ROC plots were the most common type of plot included in systematic reviews and were included in 22 (45%) reviews. One primary study and five systematic reviews included a probability-modifying plot. CONCLUSION: Graphical displays are currently underused in primary diagnostic accuracy studies and systematic reviews of such studies. Diagnostic accuracy studies need to include multiple types of graphic in order to provide both a detailed overview of the results (diagnostic accuracy) and to communicate information that can be used to inform clinical practice (predictive value).

Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent, has been shown to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in Vero cells at a concentration of 5 M. These limited in vitro results triggered the investigation of ivermectin as a treatment option to alleviate COVID-19 disease. However, in April 2021, the World Health Organization stated the following: The current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. It is speculated that the in vivo concentration of ivermectin is too low to exert a strong antiviral effect. Here, we performed a head-to-head comparison of the antiviral activity of ivermectin and the structurally related, but metabolically more stable moxidectin in multiple in vitro models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including physiologically relevant human respiratory epithelial cells. Both moxidectin and ivermectin exhibited antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells. Subsequent experiments revealed that these compounds predominantly act on the steps following virus cell entry. Surprisingly, however, in human-airway-derived cell models, both moxidectin and ivermectin failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, even at concentrations of 10 M. These disappointing results call for a word of caution in the interpretation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of drugs solely based on their activity in Vero cells. Altogether, these findings suggest that even using a high-dose regimen of ivermectin, or switching to another drug in the same class, is unlikely to be useful for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","output":"Moxidectin and Ivermectin Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Vero E6 Cells but Not in Human Primary Bronchial Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracies of quantitative computed tomography (CT) parameters and semiquantitative visual score in evaluating clinical classification of severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 187 patients with COVID-19 treated at Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College from February 15, 2020, to February 29, 2020. Demographic data, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and based on the clinical classification of severity, patients were divided into groups 1 (mild) and 2 (severe/critical). A semiquantitative visual score was used to estimate the lesion extent. A three-dimensional slicer was used to precisely quantify the volume and CT value of the lung and lesions. Correlation coefficients of the quantitative CT parameters, semiquantitative visual score, and clinical classification were calculated using Spearman's correlation. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracies of quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS: There were 59 patients in group 1 and 128 patients in group 2. The mean age and sex distribution of the two groups were not significantly different. The lesions were primarily located in the subpleural area. Compared to group 1, group 2 had larger values for all volume-dependent parameters (p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of lesions had the strongest correlation with disease severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. In comparison, the correlation coefficient of semiquantitative score was 0.349. To classify the severity of COVID-19, area under the curve of the percentage of lesions was the highest (0.807; 95% confidence interval, 0.744-0.861: p &lt; 0.001) and that of the quantitative CT parameters was significantly higher than that of the semiquantitative visual score (p = 0.001).

COVID-19 is characterized by atypical pneumonia, mild colds, and more severe illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory distress, thrombosis, organ failure, and various secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Notably, the severity of COVID-19 in different age groups is not well known, and the validity of clinical laboratory data remains unclear. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we examined differential regulation of clinical, hematologic, and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. We divided 104 COVID-19 patients into five different groups according to age (0?17, 18?45, 46?65, 66?79, and >80 years). Baseline data (sex, comorbidities, intensive care admission, and medications), hematologic markers, liver, and renal function tests, coagulation, and inflammatory markers were examined in these groups. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal threshold for predicting COVID-19 biological markers. RESULTS: We found that the highest percentage (45%) of COVID-19 patients was in the age group of 46?65 years. The hematologic parameters (WBC, HB, and PLT) were normal between the patient groups. The area under the curve in ROC analysis showed significant differences in the levels of creatine, GGT, BUN, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, AST, and procalcitonin between the patients of age groups 46?65 and 66?79 years. Renal biomarkers were significantly high in most patients, regardless of age. In contrast, the liver biomarkers, did not differ significantly between patient groups. CONCLUSION: The main finding of our study is that laboratory parameters such as GGT, creatinine, BUN, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin and D-dimer were differentially regulated in COVID -19 patients of different age groups. Importantly, these laboratory parameters may help as clinical predictors to assess the severity of the disease in the population.

It relies on its ability to compete with the translation initiation factor eIF4F to specifically recognize foreign capped mRNAs, while remaining inactive against host mRNAs marked by ribose 2'-O methylation at the first cap-proximal nucleotide (N1). We report here several crystal structures of RNA-bound human IFIT1, including a 1.6-? complex with capped RNA. IFIT1 forms a water-filled, positively charged RNA-binding tunnel with a separate hydrophobic extension that unexpectedly engages the cap in multiple conformations (syn and anti) giving rise to a relatively plastic and nonspecific mode of binding, in stark contrast to eIF4E. Cap-proximal nucleotides encircled by the tunnel provide affinity to compete with eIF4F while allowing IFIT1 to select against N1 methylated mRNA. Gel-shift binding assays confirm that N1 methylation interferes with IFIT1 binding, but in an RNA-dependent manner, whereas translation assays reveal that N1 methylation alone is not sufficient to prevent mRNA recognition at high IFIT1 concentrations. Structural and functional analysis show that 2'-O methylation at N2, another abundant mRNA modification, is also detrimental for RNA binding, thus revealing a potentially synergistic role for it in self- versus nonself-mRNA discernment. Finally, structure-guided mutational analysis confirms the importance of RNA binding for IFIT1 restriction of a human coronavirus mutant lacking viral N1 methylation. Our structural and biochemical analysis sheds new light on the molecular basis for IFIT1 translational inhibition of capped viral RNA.","output":"Structure of human IFIT1 with capped RNA reveals adaptable mRNA binding and mechanisms for sensing N1 and N2 ribose 2'-O methylations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose, design, and evaluate PIVOT, a privacy-enhancing and effective contact tracing solution that aims to strike a balance between utility and privacy: one that does not collect sensitive information yet allowing effective tracing and notifying the close contacts of diagnosed users.

To protect usersprivacy, it uses local proximity tracing based on broadcasting and recording constantly changing anonymous public keys via short-range communication. These public keys are used to establish a shared secret key between two people in close contact.

These hashes are never revealed to the public. To improve utility, user exposure score computation is performed centrally, which provides health authorities with minimal, yet insightful and actionable data. Data minimisation is achieved by the use of per-user-per-contact hashes and by enforcing role separation: the health authority act as a mixing node, while the matching between reported and queried hashes is outsourced to a third entity, an independent matching service. This separation ensures that out-of-scope information, such as userssocial interactions, is hidden from the health authorities, whereas the matching service does not learn userssensitive information.

Recommended treatment consists of an injectable antimalarial followed by a full course of oral artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Children who cannot access prompt parenteral treatment should be administered a single dose of rectal artesunate (RAS) and promptly referred to an appropriate facility for further care. This study aimed to assess compliance with the treatment recommendation in children under 5 years diagnosed with severe malaria and admitted to referral facilities in 3 high-burden sub-Saharan African countries. Methods and Findings: This study accompanied the implementation of RAS as a pre-referral treatment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda. Children under 5 who were admitted at a referral health facility (RHF) with a diagnosis of severe malaria were included. Type and dosage of antimalarial treatment at RHFs was assessed for children referred from a community-based provider and those directly attending the RHF. We used multivariable regression models to assess factors associated with administration of compliant treatment. RHF data of 7,983 children was analysed for compliance with regards to antimalarials, a subsample of 3,449 children was assessed in more detail for schedule and dosage compliance and method of ACT provision. Overall, 42.0% (3,356/7,983) of admitted children were administered full treatment consisting of a parenteral antimalarial and an ACT, with large variation among study countries (2.7% in Nigeria, 44.5% in Uganda and 50.3% in DRC). Children receiving RAS from a community-based provider were more likely to be administered compliant post-referral medication at RHFs in DRC (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) =2.19, 95% CI 1.60-2.99), but less likely in Uganda (aOR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-0.96). Use of injectable antimalarials was very high in all three countries (99.2% (1,344/1,355) in Uganda, 98.1% (413/421) in Nigeria and 94.4% (1,580/1,673) in DRC), with most children receiving the recommended minimum of three doses (99.0% (1,331/1,344) in Uganda, 95.5% (1,509/1,580) in DRC and 92.0% (380/413) in Nigeria). Rather than being administered in the RHF, ACTs were often prescribed at discharge in Nigeria (54.4%, 229/421) and Uganda (53.0%, 715/1,349), while this was rarely done in DRC (0.8%, 14/1,669) where inpatient administration was more common. Conclusions: Directly observed treatment with both a parenteral antimalarial and an ACT was rare and variable between countries, bearing a high risk for incomplete parasite clearance and disease recrudescence. Parenteral artesunate not followed up with a full course of oral ACT constitutes an artemisinin monotherapy and may favour the selection or development of resistant parasites.

AIM: As an integral stakeholder in communication during a pandemic, this descriptive study sought to delineate the media frames of the COVID-19 pandemic in online news headlines in the first month that the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. SETTING: Online news headlines in three global hotspots, namely Italy, the USA and South Africa, during the month of March 2020, were analysed. METHODS: Thematic content analysis and epidemic framing typology. RESULTS: The findings indicate that COVID-19 has been internationally portrayed as a lethal pandemic that destroys and disrupts human life. Discursive frames of consequences monopolised its coverage, whilst discursive frames of reassurance were rare, despite the high survival rate. One of the unique findings of this study is that the COVID-19 pandemic coverage included the naming of positive patients, who were thereby made known to the public. CONCLUSION: Internationally, COVID-19 pandemic coverage used consequence frames that dramatised loss of life instead of deploying frames of reassurance that foreground the high survival rate of this disease.

AIM: We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 effect on the number of stroke code activations and timings during the first two months of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the stroke code database of a single comprehensive stroke centre in Portugal for the number of activations through 2019-2020. We compared the pathway timings between March and April 2020 (COVID-19 period) and the homologous months of the previous four years (pre-COVID-19 period), whilst using February as a control. RESULTS: Monthly stroke code activation rates decreased up to 34.2% during COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, we observed an increase in the time from symptom onset to emergency call, with a significant number of patients waiting more than four hours (March 20.8% vs. 6.8%, p = 0.034; April 23.8% vs. 6%, p = 0.01); as well as an increase in the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (March: median 136 minutes [IQR 106-410] vs. 100 [IQR 64-175], p = 0.001; April: median 188 [IQR 96-394] vs. 98 [IQR 66-168], p = 0.007). No difference between both periods was found concerning in-hospital times, patient characteristics, stroke/mimic diagnosis, stroke severity, and mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related factors probably reduced healthcare services utilization, and delayed emergency calls and hospital arrival after stroke onset. These highlight the importance of health education to improve the effectiveness of medical assistance.

Common immune abnormalities include progressive hypercytokinemia with elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1?, proinflammatory chemokines, activated macrophages and increased levels of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF&#954;B). Inflammasome activation and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is common to COVID-19, H1N1, and MAS but does not appear to be a feature of CRS. Elevated levels of IL-18 are detected in patients with COVID-19 and MAS but have not been reported in patients with H1N1 influenza and CRS. Elevated interferon-?3 is common to H1N1, MAS, and CRS but levels of this molecule appear to be depressed in patients with COVID-19. CD4+ T, CD8+ and NK lymphocytes are involved in the pathophysiology of CRS, MAS, and possibly H1N1 but are reduced in number and dysfunctional in COVID-19.

Our starting hypothesis was that their use without periodic removal, cleaning or replacement for between 24 to 48 months after insertion is safe and effective. METHODS: This was a prospective observational and descriptive study. One hundred one women who successfully completed the 24 first months of continuous use of a ring pessary were included and monitored for another 24 months. The objectives were to establish the percentage of patients maintaining its use 48 months after insertion, the reasons for discontinuation and the adverse events. Another purpose of this study was to determine the timing of replacement of the vaginal pessary in long-term users. RESULTS: Of the women, 92.1% (93/101) had successful pessary use, and it was discontinued by three patients (2.9%, 3/101); 76.2% (77/101) of the women continued pessary use after the end of the study, and in 16 (15.8%, 16/101) patients, after pessary removal, the prolapse disappeared and did not recur. Forty-five women (48.4%, 45/93) presented some adverse events that required temporary pessary removal. The most common one was an increase in vaginal discharge (73.3%, 33/45). In four women (8.9%, 4/45), the ring pessary was detected embedded in the vaginal epithelium.

Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in HIV latency and reactivation. We show that reactivation of HIV is associated with downregulation of the key H(2)S producing enzyme cystathionine--lyase (CTH) and reduction in endogenous H(2)S. Genetic silencing of CTH disrupts redox homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and remodels the transcriptome of latent cells to trigger HIV reactivation. Chemical complementation of CTH activity using a slow-releasing H(2)S donor, GYY4137, suppressed HIV reactivation and diminished virus replication. Mechanistically, GYY4137 blocked HIV reactivation by inducing the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF-B, and recruiting the epigenetic silencer, YY1, to the HIV promoter. In latently infected CD4(+) T cells from ART-suppressed human subjects, GYY4137 in combination with ART prevented viral rebound and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 exhibited no adverse influence on proviral content or CD4(+) T cell subsets, indicating that diminished viral rebound is due to a loss of transcription rather than a selective loss of infected cells. In summary, this work provides mechanistic insight into H(2)S-mediated suppression of viral rebound and suggests exploration of H(2)S donors to maintain HIV in a latent form.","output":"Hydrogen sulfide blocks HIV rebound by maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was declared on March 11, 2020, which led to the massive economic and social crisis in the world Hospitals and healthcare systems faced the most changes during this time As for any other medical departments, orthopedic departments were affected by this situation Trauma and musculoskeletal injuries require emergency action or even operation which would not stop due to COVID-19 crisis Special protocols and guidelines were used to minimize infection risks in Kashani educational trauma center Here we explain the changes and protocols in the following sections: Outpatient-Clinic, emergency department, Operation room and Orthopedic Ward These strategies included: Reducing the number of admitted patients in clinics, changing the decoration of waiting rooms, screening the patients at the entrance and personal protection equipment for staff We also dedicated special emergency rooms for patients suspicious to COVID-19 infection and also special operation rooms and corridor for patients with COVID-19 infection Changes in discharging protocols and continuous consultations with infectious diseases specialists brought us the ability to manage these patients Here in the present paper, we described different strategies of the management of patients in Kashani hospital during COVID-19 outbreak We hope that our experience of patients management could help other physicians and hospitals","output":"Management of orthopedic patients during covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microscopic epidemic models are powerful tools for government policy makers to predict and simulate epidemic outbreaks, which can capture the impact of individual behaviors on the macroscopic phenomenon.

Using qualitative methods, interviews took place with OSHPs in two organisations to understand how their role developed during the pandemic. Additionally, seven focus groups were organised and met virtually, using the Zoom platform, each addressing a different topic identified by the researchers. Participants (n = 45) from 10 different countries were distributed among the focus groups. Topics were separated into four themes: impact on the workplace;the psychosocial dynamic;medical and health issues and occupational safety and health (OSH) issues. Results were subsequently divided into seven action categories and compared with the findings from the organisational interviews. Comparison pointed to an expanded role for the OSHP including business continuity, resilience and wellbeing in addition to assessing and controlling risks emerging during the pandemic. There is also the need for a means to adequately disseminate trustworthy information. Results indicated that there was no single average role of the OSHP, demonstrating essential contributions as a member of the management team. Results also stressed that the pandemic carried three health-related co-morbidities, stress, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and burnout. Directions for future research included: the education of the OSHP to support a move away from compliance towards risk management;determining how mental health issues in organisations should be managed;expanded roles for OSHPs within business;and implications for professional bodies, membership institutions and academia in supporting the above-mentioned emerging roles.","output":"Perceptions, experiences and opportunities for occupational safety and health professionals arising out of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene locus plays a fundamental role in human immunity, and it is established that certain HLA alleles are disease determinants. METHODS: By combining the predictive power of multiple in silico HLA predictors, we have previously identified prevalent HLA class I and class II alleles, including DPA1*02:02, in two small cohorts at the COVID-19 pandemic onset. Since then, newer and larger patient cohorts with controls and associated demographic and clinical data have been deposited in public repositories. Here, we report on HLA-I and HLA-II alleles, along with their associated risk significance in one such cohort of 126 patients, including COVID-19 positive (n=100) and negative patients (n=26). RESULTS: We recapitulate an enrichment of DPA1*02:02 in the COVID-19 positive cohort (29%) when compared to the COVID-negative control group (Fishers exact test [FET] p=0.0174). Having this allele, however, does not appear to put this cohorts patients at an increased risk of hospitalization. Inspection of COVID-19 disease severity outcomes reveal nominally significant risk associations with A*11:01 (FET p=0.0078), C*04:01 (FET p=0.0087) and DQA1*01:02 (FET p=0.0121). CONCLUSIONS: While enrichment of these alleles falls below statistical significance after Bonferroni correction, COVID-19 patients with the latter three alleles tend to fare worse overall. This is especially evident for patients with C*04:01, where disease prognosis measured by mechanical ventilation-free days was statistically significant after multiple hypothesis correction (Bonferroni p = 0.0023), and may hold potential clinical value.","output":"Retrospective in silico HLA predictions from COVID-19 patients reveal alleles associated with disease prognosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many rapid serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed or use, but lost have only been validated on a few samples, and none provide medical practitioners with an easy-to-use, self-contained, bedside test with high accuracy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two-hundred fifty-six sera from 101 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR) and 50 control sera were tested for IgM/IgG using the NG-Test IgM-IgG COVID all-in-one assay. The seroconversion dynamic was assessed by symptom onset and day of RT-PCR diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, positive IgG and/or IgM result was observed for 67.3% of patients (68/101), including 17 (16.8%) already positive at the day of RT-PCR, and 51 (50.5%) with observable seroconversion, and 32.7% (33/101) remained negative as subsequent sampling was not possible due to patient discharge or death. The sensitivity increased with the delay between onset of symptoms and sampling, going from 29.1%, 78.2% and 86.5% for the time periods of 0-9-, 10-14- and >14-days after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Cumulative sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value were 970%, 100%, 100% and 962%, respectively 15-days after the onset of symptoms. No difference in seroconversion delay was observed regardless of whether patients received ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: The NG-test is a bedside serological assay that could serve as a complementary source of diagnostic information to RT-PCR and chest imaging. It may also be useful to monitor immunological status of medical and non-medical workers during the ongoing pandemic, and the general population after social distancing measures have eased.","output":"Rapid Determination of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Using a Bedside, Point-of-Care, Serological Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to describe the perspectives of patients from rural communities on access to all forms of kidney replacement therapy to inform strategies to address such inequity. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted. Transcripts were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: There were 28 participants, of whom, 14 (50%) were female and 5 (17%) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The mean distance to a nephrologist was 107 km, and transplant center was 447 km. We identified the following 5 themes: encumbered by transportation hardship (burdening of family and friends, frustration at lack of transportation options, heightened vulnerability to road trauma, unrelenting financial strain); deprived of treatment and care (isolated from centralized services, unresolved psychological distress, vulnerable without care, disadvantaged by limited options); confused by multiple information sources (despair at fragmented care, fear of unfamiliar health settings and treatments); compounding economic consequences (depletion of income/leave, coping with unexpected expenses); and the looming threat of relocation (devastated by displacement, resigned to periods of separation, uncertainty in sourcing appropriate accommodation). CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in rural communities face profound economic, logistical, and psychological obstacles to accessing dialysis and transplant, leaving them feeling vulnerable and confused. To achieve equity of access and improved health outcomes for rural patients with CKD, barriers to dialysis, transplantation, and psychological services in this population require addressing through policy and alternate models of health service delivery, in consultation with rural communities and those families affected by CKD.","output":"Patients Perspectives on Access to Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation in Rural Communities in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This was a case series.

These variabilities are especially pronounced in multicenter cohorts, where batch effects (i.e. systematic technical artifacts unrelated to biological variability) may introduce biases to machine learning algorithms. To date, manual quality control (QC) has been the de facto standard for dataset curation but remains highly subjective and is too laborious in light of the increasing scale of tissue slide digitization efforts. This study aimed to evaluate a computer aided QC pipeline for facilitating a reproducible QC process of WSI datasets. An open source tool, HistoQC, was employed to identify image artifacts and compute quantitative metrics describing visual attributes of WSIs to the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) digital pathology repository. A comparison in inter-reader concordance between HistoQC aided and un-aided curation was performed to quantify improvements in curation reproducibility. HistoQC metrics were additionally employed to quantify the presence of batch effects within NEPTUNE WSIs. Of the 1814 WSIs (458 H&E, 470 PAS, 438 Silver, 448 Trichrome) from n = 512 cases considered in this study, approximately 9% (163) were identified as unsuitable for subsequent computational analysis. The concordance in the identification of these WSIs among computational pathologists rose from moderate (Gwet's AC1 range 0.43 to 0.59 across stains) to excellent (Gwet's AC1 range 0.79 to 0.93 across stains) agreement when aided by HistoQC. Furthermore, statistically significant batch effects (p < 0.001) in the NEPTUNE WSI dataset were discovered. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that quantitative QC is a necessary step in the curation of digital pathology cohorts. This article is protected by copyright.

Within each year\\\\pair, we used the earlier year of data to train models and tested the model in the later year, with burnout (emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization) as the outcome for each survey. We used potentially modifiable workCenvironment characteristics as predictors, controlling for employee demographic characteristics as covariates, and employment facility as random intercepts. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We included workCenvironment predictors that appeared in all 4 years (11 in AES; 17 in MHPS). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In 2015C2018, 31.0%C38.0% of BHPs reported burnout in AES or MHPS.

It is not known how well mRNA vaccines induce B and plasma cell responses in dialysis patients (DP) or kidney transplant recipients (KTR) compared to healthy controls (HC). We studied humoral and B cell responses of 35 HC, 44 DP and 40 KTR. Markedly impaired anti-BNT162b2 responses were identified among KTR and DP compared to HC. In DP, the response was delayed (3-4 weeks after boost) and reduced with anti-S1 IgG and IgA positivity in 70.5% and 68.2%, respectively. In contrast, KTR did not develop IgG responses except one patient who had a prior unrecognized infection and developed anti-S1 IgG. The majority of antigen-specific B cells (RBD+) were identified in the plasmablast or post-switch memory B cell compartments in HC, whereas RBD+ B cells were enriched among pre-switch and na?ve B cells from DP and KTR. The frequency and absolute number of antigen-specific circulating plasmablasts in the cohort correlated with the Ig response, a characteristic not reported for other vaccinations. In conclusion, these data indicated that immunosuppression resulted in impaired protective immunity after mRNA vaccination, including Ig induction with corresponding generation of plasmablasts and memory B cells. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve vaccination protocols in patients after kidney transplantation or on chronic dialysis.","output":"Impaired humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients and dialysis patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with an approximate reproductive number of 2C2.5, suggesting that two or three individuals may be infected with index patient cases.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems, including organ transplants. We aimed to evaluate the responses of SOT centers to COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic around the world. Methods We conducted a web-based survey amongst transplant centers, sent to members of The American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice Group, between April and May 2020. The survey included basic information of each transplant center (number and types of transplants in 2019), the countermeasures employed against COVID-19 such as timing of postponing of transplantation, and management of outpatient clinics including implementation of telemedicine and screening for in-person visits. Results A total of 65 centers from 19 countries responded (Table 1). Regarding the percentage of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at the time of the survey, 39 (60%) centers reported < 10%, two centers reported > 80%. All centers reduced their services to some extent as shown in Table 2. Centers reported postponing living donor kidney transplant (50/58, 86%), deceased donor kidney transplant (20/57, 35%), living donor liver transplant (32/42, 80%), deceased donor liver transplant (17/41, 41%), lung transplant (20/31, 65%), heart transplant for LVAD (18/33, 55%) and non-LVAD patients (18/33, 55%). In March and April 2020, cancellation of pre- and post- transplant clinics were reported by 36/64 (56%) and 17/65 (26%) centers. Postponing clinic appointments were reported by 56/65 (86%) centers. Most institutions (54/64, 85%) used telemedicine. Screening for COVID-19 for clinic visits was done by telephone, in-person questionnaires and/or temperature checks. Conclusion During the early phase of the pandemic, when management strategies were highly uncertain, non-urgent and living donor transplants were frequently postponed. Emergent liver transplants continued regardless. These findings could help us navigate SOT in future epidemics. Limitations included a small sample and lack of assessment of clinical outcomes from postponing SOT.

In this study, RNA-Seq technology was applied to investigate the transcriptome-wide changes of DF-1 cells upon ARV infection at the middle stage. RESULTS: Total RNA of ARV-infected or mock-infected samples at 10 and 18 h post infection (hpi) was extracted to build RNA-Seq datasets. Analysis of the sequencing data revealed that the expressions of numerous genes were altered, and a panel of differentially expressed genes were confirmed with RT-qPCR. At 10 hpi, 104 genes were down-regulated and 64 were up-regulated, while the expressions of 47 genes were increased and only one was down-regulated, which may play a role in retinoic acid biosynthesis, at 18 hpi in the ARV-infected cells. The similar profiles of up-regulated genes between the two groups of infected cells suggest that ARV infection activated a prolonged antiviral response of host cells. Alternative splicing analysis found no significantly changed events altered by ARV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the differential expression profile presented in this study can be used to expand our understanding of the comprehensive interactions between ARV and the host cells, and may be helpful for us to reveal the pathogenic mechanism on the molecular level.

This paper proves that sample sizes n = (d2 log p) and n = (d2p2=m) are sufficient for the proposed algorithm to recover linear SEMs with sub- Gaussian and (4m)-th bounded-moment error distributions, respectively, where p is the number of nodes and d is the maximum degree of the moralized graph.

Through simulations, we verify that the proposed algorithm is statistically consistent and computationally feasible, and it performs well compared to the state-of-the-art US, GDS, LISTEN and TD algorithms with our settings.

IFN-independent, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) regulation in the context of CMV infection was first documented 20 years ago. Since then several IFN-independent, IRF3-dependent ISGs have been characterized and found to be among the most influential in the innate response to CMV. These include virus inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated IFN-inducible (viperin), ISG15, members of the interferon inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) family, interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins and myxovirus resistance proteins A and B (MxA, MxB). IRF3-independent, IFN-independent activation of canonically IFN-dependent signaling pathways has also been documented, such as IFN-independent biphasic activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) during infection of monocytes, differential roles of mitochondrial and peroxisomal mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), and the ability of human CMV (HCMV) immediate early protein 1 (IE1) protein to reroute IL-6 signaling and activation of STAT1 and its associated ISGs.

The purpose of this study was to examine survival characteristics in patients suffering torso trauma with no recorded vital signs (VS) in the emergency department (ED). METHODS The National Trauma Data Bank was analyzed from 2007 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were patients with blunt and penetrating torso trauma without VS in the ED. Patients with head injuries, transfers from other hospitals, or those with missing values were excluded. The characteristics of survivors were evaluated, and statistical analyses performed. RESULTS A total of 24,191 torso trauma patients without VS were evaluated in the ED and 96.6% were declared dead upon arrival. There were 246 survivors (1%), and 73 (0.3%) were eventually discharged home. Of patients who responded to resuscitation (812), the survival rate was 30.3%. Injury severity score (ISS), penetrating mechanism (odds ratio [OR] 1.99), definitive chest (OR 1.59) and abdominal surgery (OR 1.49) were associated with improved survival. Discharge to home (or police custody) was associated with lower ISS (OR 0.975) and shorter ED time (OR 0.99). CONCLUSION Over a recent nine-year period in the United States, nearly 25,000 trauma patients were treated at trauma centers despite lack of VS. Of these patients, only 73 were discharged home. A trauma center would have to attempt over one hundred resuscitations of traumatic arrests to save one patient, confirming previous reports that highlight a grave prognosis.

The purpose of this paper is to review mechanisms of iron homeostasis and current clinical data exploring mechanisms of iron repletion in heart failure. RECENT FINDING: Multiple international societies now advise iron repletion for symptomatic heart failure patients with iron deficiency. Due to the chronic inflammation in heart failure, iron deficiency in heart failure is classically defined as ferritin < 100 g/L or ferritin 100C300 g/L and transferrin saturation < 20%. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefit from intravenous iron repletion, though studies have predominantly focused on functional capacity and quality of life. A recent study, AFFIRM-AHF, supports the treatment of iron deficiency identified during acute heart failure admissions, noting a reduction in future heart failure hospitalizations. Studies examining iron repletion in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are currently in process. SUMMARY: Iron homeostasis is maintained predominantly through the regulation of iron absorption, keeping iron levels tightly controlled in the normal state regardless of iron intake. In chronic heart failure however, iron homeostasis becomes dysregulated with resulting iron deficiency in many patients, with and without associated anemia. Iron is a critical element not only for erythropoiesis and oxygen carrying, but also for energy production at the level of the mitochondria and in other cell processes. We thus propose a standardized approach be utilized to screen and treat heart failure patients with iron deficiency.","output":"Iron Deficiency in Heart Failure: Characteristics and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (APAP) is a worldwide antipyretic as well as an analgesic medication. It has been extensively utilized during the outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). APAP misuse would lead to liver injury. Diacerein (DIA), an anthraquinone derivative, has antioxidant and inflammatory properties. Hence, this study attempted to evaluate the impact of DIA treatment on liver injury induced by APAP and its influence on nuclear factor-B (NF-B) /toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/high mobility group box-1(HMGB-1) signaling as well as the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-) expression. METHODS: Male albino rats received 25 as well as 50 mg/kg/day DIA orally for seven days. One hour after the last administration, rats received APAP (1gm/kg, orally). For histopathological analysis, liver tissues and blood were collected, immunohistochemical (IHC) assay, biochemical assay, as well as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: DIA markedly reduced liver injury markers and ameliorated histopathological changes. Moreover, DIA dose-dependently alleviated oxidative stress status caused by APAP administration along with inflammatory markers, including the level of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Furthermore, DIA downregulated protein levels as well as mRNA of HMGB-1, TLR4, NF-B p65 expression, and enhanced PPAR- expression. Moreover, DIA ameliorated apoptotic (Bax) and caspase-3 expressions and increased the anti-apoptotic (Bcl2) expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that DIA exerts anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties against liver injury induced by APAP that is attributed to inhibition of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-B pathway, besides upregulation of the expression of PPAR-.","output":"Diacerein ameliorates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in rats via inhibiting HMGB1/TLR4/NF-B and upregulating PPAR- signal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the end of 2019, the world has been facing an unpredicted COVID-19 pandemic with consequences for the economy, environment, society, and health.

We undertook a systematic review of reviews to investigate the effects of interventions for this population on substance use, housing, and related outcomes, as well as on treatment engagement, retention and successful completion. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched ten electronic databases from inception to October 2020 for reviews and syntheses, conducted a grey literature search, and hand searched reference lists of included studies. We selected reviews that synthesised evidence on any type of treatment or intervention that reported substance use outcomes for people who reported being homeless. We appraised the quality of included reviews using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. Our search identified 843 citations, and 25 reviews met the inclusion criteria. Regarding substance use outcomes, there was evidence that harm reduction approaches lead to decreases in drug-related risk behaviour and fatal overdoses, and reduce mortality, morbidity, and substance use. Case management interventions were significantly better than treatment as usual in reducing substance use among people who are homeless. The evidence indicates that Housing First does not lead to significant changes in substance use. Evidence regarding housing and other outcomes is mixed. CONCLUSIONS: People who are homeless and use drugs experience many barriers to accessing healthcare and treatment. Evidence regarding interventions designed specifically for this population is limited, but harm reduction and case management approaches can lead to improvements in substance use outcomes, whilst some housing interventions improve housing outcomes and may provide more stability.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 12 June 2019) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2019, week 23). We also handsearched conference reports and trial registries. There was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants of any age and menopausal status who had undergone surgery for EOC and, after diagnosis and treatment, used any regimen and duration of HRT compared with placebo or no hormone therapy. We also included trials comparing different regimens or duration of administration of HRT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently identified studies that met the inclusion criteria. They used Covidence to extract study characteristics, outcome data and to assess methodological quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 2617 titles, of which 2614 titles were excluded. Three studies, involving 350 women, met our inclusion criteria. Two of the studies included pre and postmenopausal women, and the third only included premenopausal women. The overall age range of those women included in the studies was 20 to 89.6 years old, with a median follow-up ranging from 31.4 months to 19.1 years. The geographical distribution of participants included Europe, South Africa and China. All stages and histological subtypes were included in two of the studies, but stage IV disease had been excluded in the third. The three included studies used a variety of HRT regimens (conjugated oestrogen with or without medroxyprogesterone and with or without nylestriol) and HRT administrations (oral, patch and implant), In all studies, the comparisons were made versus women who had not received HRT. The studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and reporting bias, and at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias. The certainty of the evidence was low for overall survival and progression-free survival, and very low for quality-of-life assessment, incidence of breast cancer, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analysis of these studies showed that HRT may improve overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.93; 350 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). Quality-of-life assessment by use of the EORTC-C30 questionnaire was performed only in one study. We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces quality of life as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low (mean difference (MD) 13.67 points higher, 95% CI 9.26 higher to 18.08 higher; 1 study; 75 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Likewise, HRT may make little or no difference to progression-free survival (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.01; 275 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces the incidence of breast cancer (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 225 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence); TIA (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 102.42; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); CVA (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.88; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); and MI (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.10; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of gallstones was not reported in the included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hormone replacement therapy may slightly improve overall survival in women who have undergone surgical treatment for EOC, but the certainty of the evidence is low. HRT may make little or no difference to quality of life, incidence of breast cancer, TIA, CVA and MI as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. There may be little or no effect of HRT use on progression-free survival. The evidence in this review is limited by imprecision and incompleteness of reported relevant outcomes and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed RCTs are required as this is an important area to women experiencing menopausal symptoms following surgical treatment for ovarian cancer, especially as doctors are often reluctant to prescribe HRT in this scenario. The evidence in this review is too limited to support or refute that HRT is very harmful in this population.","output":"Hormone replacement therapy after surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis (CACP) syndrome leads to diarthrodial joint arthropathy and is caused by the absence of lubricin (proteoglycan 4-PRG4), a surface-active mucinous glycoprotein responsible for lubricating articular cartilage. In this study, mice lacking the orthologous gene Prg4 served as a model that recapitulates the destructive arthrosis that involves biofouling of cartilage by serum proteins in lieu of Prg4. This study hypothesized that Prg4-deficient mice would demonstrate a quadruped gait change and decreased markers of mitochondrial dyscrasia, following intra-articular injection of both hindlimbs with recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4). Prg4-/- (N = 44) mice of both sexes were injected with rhPRG4 and gait alterations were studied at post-injection day 3 and 6, before joints were harvested for immunohistochemistry for caspase-3 activation. Increased stance and propulsion was shown at 3 days post-injection in male mice. There were significantly fewer caspase-3-positive chondrocytes in tibiofemoral cartilage from rhPRG4-injected mice.

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. The gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.

Easily available modalities like X-ray can be used to detect specific symptoms associated with COVID-19. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks are widely used for computer-aided detection of diseases from smaller datasets. This paper investigates the effectiveness of multi-CNN, a combination of several pre-trained CNNs, for the automated detection of COVID-19 from X-ray images. The method uses a combination of features extracted from multi-CNN with correlation based feature selection (CFS) technique and Bayesnet classifier for the prediction of COVID-19. The method was tested using two public datasets and achieved promising results on both the datasets. In the first dataset consisting of 453 COVID-19 images and 497 non-COVID images, the method achieved an AUC of 0.963 and an accuracy of 91.16%. In the second dataset consisting of 71 COVID-19 images and 7 non-COVID images, the method achieved an AUC of 0.911 and an accuracy of 97.44%.

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were entered into meta-analyses performed separately for each indication. Efficacy analyses were based on changes in disease-specific symptom scores. Safety was analyzed based on the pooled data from all eligible trials, by comparing the incidence of adverse events between flavonoids and the control. RESULTS: In this study, thirty RCTs (n = 5,166) were included. In common cold, results showed that the flavonoids group decreased total cold intensity score (CIS), the sum of sum of symptom intensity differences (SSID) of CIS, and duration of inability to work vs. the control group. In influenza, the flavonoids group improved the visual analog scores for symptoms. In COVID?19, the flavonoids group decreased the time taken for alleviation of symptoms, time taken for SARS-CoV?2 RT-PCR clearance, the RT-PCR positive subjects at day 7, time to achievement of the normal status of symptoms, patients needed oxygen, patients hospitalized and requiring mechanical ventilation, patients in ICU, days of hospitalization, and mortality vs. the control group. In acute non-streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, the flavonoids group decreased the tonsillitis severity score (TSS) on day 7. In acute rhinosinusitis, the flavonoids group decreased the sinusitis severity score (SSS) on day 7, days off work, and duration of illness. In acute bronchitis, the flavonoids group decreased the bronchitis severity score (BSS) on day 7, days off work, and duration of illness. In bronchial pneumonia, the flavonoids group decreased the time to symptoms disappearance, the level of interleukin?6 (IL?6), interleukin?8 (IL?8), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-). In upper respiratory tract infections, the flavonoids group decreased total CIS on day 7 and increased the improvement rate of symptoms. Furthermore, the results of the incidence of adverse reactions did not differ between the flavonoids and the control group. CONCLUSION: Results from this systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that flavonoids were efficacious and safe in treating viral ARTIs including the common cold, influenza, COVID?19, acute non-streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, acute rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, bronchial pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infections. However, uncertainty remains because there were few RCTs per type of ARTI and many of the RCTs were small and of low quality with a substantial risk of bias. Given the limitations, we suggest that the conclusions need to be confirmed on a larger scale with more detailed instructions in future studies.

METHODS A total of 100 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy completed a nocturia quality of life questionnaire score and a frequency-volume chart before and after surgery. These patients were divided into two groups by continence status (continent and incontinent) according to the number of pad exchanges per day and the 1-h pad test after surgery. Assessment was carried out before surgery, and then at 3 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS The Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire total score and the Bother/Concern subscore were significantly lower in incontinent patients at 3 and 12 months after surgery (Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire total score: Bother/Concern subscores P = 0.006: P = 0.04 at 3 months after surgery; and P = 0.04: P = 0.02 at 12 months). Both nocturnal maximum voided volume and nocturnal frequency were not significantly different between continent and incontinent patients. On multivariate analysis, nocturnal urinary frequency (P = 0.01) and urinary incontinence (P = 0.005) were significantly associated with nocturia-specific quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Although the number of nocturia episodes was not significantly different between the continent and incontinent patients after surgery, the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire score was significantly worse in incontinent patients. In these patients, other than the number of nocturia episodes, psychological stress might worsen the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire score. Therefore, prevention of post-prostatectomy incontinence might be important to avoid aggravating the Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire score.","output":"Postoperative urinary incontinence exacerbates nocturia-specific quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-2019 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (aka 2019-nCoV) has raised significant health concerns in China and worldwide.

In this study, we presented a novel network based drug repurposing platform to identify potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-2019.

This study examined both D2B and clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).Methods and Results:This was a retrospective study of 303 STEMI patients who presented directly or were transferred to a tertiary hospital in Singapore for PPCI from October 2019 to March 2020. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients admitted before (BOR) and during (DOR) the COVID-19 outbreak response. The study outcomes were in-hospital death, D2B, cardiogenic shock and 30-day readmission. For direct presentations, fewer patients in the DOR group achieved D2B time <90 min compared with the BOR group (71.4% vs. 80.9%, P=0.042). This was more apparent after exclusion of non-system delay cases (DOR 81.6% vs. BOR 95.9%, P=0.006). Prevalence of both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (9.5% vs. 1.9%, P=0.003) and acute mitral regurgitation (31.6% vs. 17.5%, P=0.006) was higher in the DOR group. Mortality was similar between groups.

However, a few recent studies have demonstrated that repetitive feedback at final recall can reverse the long-term advantage of testing over restudy. The result that feedback at long-term tests can dramatically decrease the relative effectiveness of retrieval-based learning could be important for both theoretical and practical reasons. Considering that these earlier studies administered low retrieval success at retrieval practice, we investigated whether the effect of feedback on the testing effect is modulated by the level of retrieval success during practice. In three experiments the level of success at retrieval practice was manipulated by multiple pre-practice learning trials, and multiple tests with feedback were applied after a 1-week retention interval at final recall. Our results have demonstrated that a feedback-induced reversed testing effect was present only at low retrieval success during practice (Experiment 1), whereas with moderate (Experiment 2) and high retrieval success (Experiment 3) during practice a significant testing effect emerged and no reversed testing effect was found even after repeated cycles of feedback. These results point to the conclusion that the level of retrieval success was the key factor in reversing the testing effect in earlier studies.

In an intracranial glioma model, Y6-pepVIII showed a 62 and 31% improvement in median survival compared to control animals and pepVIII-vaccinated mice.

We identified 10 peptides that bound human and murine MHC class I. Nine were PCPS products and only one peptide was colinear with EGFRvIII, indicating that PCPS fragments may be a component of MHC class I recognition. Despite not being colinear with EGFRvIII, two of three PCPS products tested were capable of increasing survival when administered independently as vaccines.

This is evident from the surging number of commercial nanoproducts and their corresponding revenue generated in different industry sectors. However, it is important to recognize that sustainable growth of nanotechnology is heavily dependent on government funding and relevant national incentive programs. Consequently, proper analyses on publicly available nanotechnology data sets comprising information on the past two decades can be illuminating, facilitate development, and amend previous strategies as we move forward. Along these lines, classical statistics and machine learning (ML) allow processing large data sets to scrutinize patterns in materials science and nanotechnology research. Herein, we provide an analysis on nanotechnology progress and investment from an unbiased, computational vantage point and using orthogonal approaches. Our data reveal both well-established and surprising correlations in the nanotechnology field and its actors, including the interplay between the number of research institutes-industry, publications-patents, collaborative research, and top contributors to nanoproducts. Overall, data suggest that, supported by incentive programs set out by stakeholders (researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and industry), nanotechnology could experience an exponential growth and become a centerpiece for economical welfare. Indeed, the recent success of COVID-19 vaccines is also likely to boost public trust in nanotechnology and its global impact over the coming years.","output":"Facts and Figures on Materials Science and Nanotechnology Progress and Investment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Both the political appetite for a science-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) policy and its acceptability to the public are little understood, at a time of sharp distrust not only of governments but also of scientists and their journals' review practices. We studied the case of France, where the independent Scientific Council on COVID-19 was appointed by President Macron on March 12, 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey on a representative sample of the French adult population. METHODS: Our data were collected by the French Institute of Public Opinion using a self-administered online questionnaire. This was completed by a sample of 1016 people stratified to match French official census statistics for gender, age, occupation, and so on. We conducted statistical analysis using Python (Pandas-SciPy-Statsmodels) with Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to control for statistical significance. RESULTS: Intense media coverage has given the council a very high public profile, with three respondents out of four (73%) having heard about it. Perceptions are positive but complex. French citizens expect science to be important in political decision-making. Four of five (81.5%) want political decisions, in general, to be based on scientific knowledge. But one in two (55%) says that the government has not relied enough on science and only 36% are satisfied with the government's crisis management to date. Although most feel that the council has a legitimate advisory role even in situations of uncertainty (only 15% disagree), it is not perceived as fully independent. Only 44% think that it directly represents the scientific community, and only one of three people considers it completely independent from the government (39%) and the pharmaceutical industry (36%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that while the transparency of scientific advice is important, it alone cannot ensure public confidence in political decision-making. We suggest that efforts made today to instill a 'science-savvy' public culture-one that allows the complex articulation between scientific knowledge, uncertainty, and political decision-making to be understood and accounted for would greatly benefit evidence-based policy in future crises.","output":"Public perceptions of scientific advice: toward a science savvy public culture?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has seriously affected the world By the end of November 2020, the global number of new coronavirus cases had already exceeded 60 million and the number of deaths 1,410,378 according to information from the World Health Organization (WHO) To limit the spread of the disease, mandatory face-mask rules are now becoming common in public settings around the world Additionally, many public service providers require customers to wear face-masks in accordance with predefined rules (e g , covering both mouth and nose) when using public services These developments inspired research into automatic (computer-vision-based) techniques for face-mask detection that can help monitor public behavior and contribute towards constraining the COVID-19 pandemic Although existing research in this area resulted in efficient techniques for face-mask detection, these usually operate under the assumption that modern face detectors provide perfect detection performance (even for masked faces) and that the main goal of the techniques is to detect the presence of face-masks only In this study, we revisit these common assumptions and explore the following research questions: (i) How well do existing face detectors perform with masked-face images? (ii) Is it possible to detect a proper (regulation-compliant) placement of facial masks? and iii) How useful are existing face-mask detection techniques for monitoring applications during the COVID-19 pandemic? To answer these and related questions we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of several recent face detectors for their performance with masked-face images Furthermore, we investigate the usefulness of multiple off-the-shelf deep-learning models for recognizing correct face-mask placement Finally, we design a complete pipeline for recognizing whether face-masks are worn correctly or not and compare the performance of the pipeline with standard face-mask detection models from the literature To facilitate the study, we compile a large dataset of facial images from the publicly available MAFA and Wider Face datasets and annotate it with compliant and non-compliant labels The annotation dataset, called Face-Mask-Label Dataset (FMLD), is made publicly available to the research community","output":"How to Correctly Detect Face-Masks for COVID-19 from Visual Information?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An in-depth annotation of the newly discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) genome has revealed differences between 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-like coronaviruses.

A public class of IGHV3-53-using SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies5,6 typically fails to neutralize variants carrying mutations in the receptor-binding motif7-11, including Omicron. As antibodies from this class are likely elicited in most people following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, their subsequent affinity maturation is of particular interest. Here, we isolated IGHV3-53-using antibodies from an individual seven months after infection and identified several antibodies capable of broad and potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, extending to Omicron without loss of potency. By introducing select somatic hypermutations into a germline-reverted form of one such antibody, CAB-A17, we demonstrate the potential for commonly elicited antibodies to develop broad cross-neutralization through affinity maturation. Further, we resolved the structure of CAB-A17 Fab in complex with Omicron spike at an overall resolution of 2.6 [A] by cryo-electron microscopy and defined the structural basis for this breadth.

Here, we studied the effect of ORF3 deletion on the proliferation of PEDV in Vero cells. To this end, four recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were rescued using targeted RNA recombination, three carrying the full-length ORF3 gene from different PEDV strains, and one from which the ORF3 gene had been deleted entirely. Our results showed that PEDVs with intact or naturally truncated ORF3 replicated to significantly higher titers than PEDV without an ORF3. Further characterization revealed that the extent of apoptosis induced by PEDV infection was significantly lower with the viruses carrying an intact or C-terminally truncated ORF3 than with the virus lacking ORF3, indicating that the ORF3 protein as well as its truncated form interfered with the apoptosis process. Collectively, we conclude that PEDV ORF3 protein promotes virus proliferation by inhibiting cell apoptosis caused by virus infection.

For uncemented prosthesis, alternative antimicrobial approaches are necessary in order to prevent PJI; however, despite elution of drug from the surface of the device being shown one of the most promising approach, no effective antimicrobial eluting uncemented device is currently available on the market. Consequently, there is a clinical need for non-antibiotic antimicrobial uncemented prosthesis as these devices present numerous benefits, particularly for young patients, over cemented artificial joints. Moreover, non-antibiotic approaches are driven by the need to address the growing threat posed by antibiotic resistance. We developed a multilayers functional coating on titanium surfaces releasing chlorhexidine, a well-known antimicrobial agent used in mouthwash products and antiseptic creams, embedding the drug between alginate and poly-beta-amino-esters. Chlorhexidine release was sustained for almost 2 months and the material efficacy and safety was proven both in vitro and in vivo. The coatings did not negatively impact osteoblast and fibroblast cells growth and were capable of reducing bacterial load and accelerating wound healing in an excisional wound model.

Despite their vital role in viral infection, the contribution of NK cells in fighting SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been directly investigated. Insights into pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities can therefore be inferred from studies assessing NK cell phenotype and function during SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. These studies suggest a reduction in circulating NK cell numbers and/or an exhausted phenotype following infection and hint toward the dampening of NK cell responses by coronaviruses. Reduced circulating NK cell levels and exhaustion may be directly responsible for the progression and severity of COVID-19. Conversely, in light of data linking inflammation with coronavirus disease severity, it is necessary to examine NK cell potential in mediating immunopathology. A common feature of coronavirus infections is that significant morbidity and mortality is associated with lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from an exaggerated immune response, of which NK cells are an important component. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how NK cells respond in both early and late coronavirus infections, and the implication for ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials. Using this immunological lens, we outline recommendations for therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 in clearing the virus while preventing the harm of immunopathological responses.","output":"Flattening the COVID-19 Curve With Natural Killer Cell Based Immunotherapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nuclear receptor REV-ERB is an overexpressed oncoprotein that has been used as a target for cancer treatment. The metal-complex nature of its ligand, iron protoporphyrin IX (Heme), enables the REV-ERB to be used for multiple therapeutic modalities as a photonuclease, a photosensitizer, or a fluorescence imaging agent. The replacement of iron with cobalt as the metal center of protoporphyrin IX changes the ligand from an agonist to an antagonist of REV-ERB. The mechanism behind that phenomenon is still unclear, despite the availability of crystal structures of REV-ERB in complex with Heme and cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP). This study used molecular dynamic simulations to compare the effects of REV-ERB binding to Heme and CoPP, respectively. The initial poses of Heme and CoPP in complex with agonist and antagonist forms of REV-ERB were predicted using molecular docking. The binding energies of each ligand were calculated using the MM/PBSA method. The computed binding affinity of Heme to REV-ERB was stronger than that of CoPP, in agreement with experimental results. CoPP altered the conformation of the ligand-binding site of REV-ERB, disrupting the binding site for nuclear receptor corepressor, which is required for REV-ERB to regulate the transcription of downstream target genes. Those results suggest that a subtle change in the metal center of porphyrin can change the behavior of porphyrin in cancer cell signaling.

Expert commentary: The type of therapeutic approach in pediatric CAP is chosen considering the risk of bacterial etiology and the pathogens most frequently detected in the different pediatric ages. Fear of the potential negative course of unrecognized and untreated bacterial CAP is the main reason for the large use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the antibiotic prescription is unnecessary in most of the cases as it can favor the emergence of resistant strains and can increase the number of drug-related adverse events.

METHODS This retrospective, single-center study was performed in an Italian teaching hospital. All adult subjects admitted to the ICU between February 24, 2020, and June 30, 2020, treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 were included.

The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.

We aimed to characterize and compare consent rates for neonatal randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries versus high-income countries, and to evaluate the influence of study characteristics on consent rates. METHODS In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials of neonatal interventions in low- and lower middle-income countries or high-income countries published 01/01/2013 to 01/04/2018. Our primary outcome was consent rate, the proportion of eligible participants who consented amongst those approached, extracted from the article or email with the author. Using a generalised linear model for fractional dependent variables, we analysed the odds of consenting in low- and lower middle-income countries versus high-income countries across control types and interventions. FINDINGS We screened 3523 articles, yielding 300 eligible randomized controlled trials with consent rates available for 135 low- and lower middle-income country trials and 65 high-income country trials. Median consent rates were higher for low- and lower middle-income countries (95.6%; interquartile range (IQR) 88.2-98.9) than high-income countries (82.7%; IQR 68.6-93.0; p<0.001). In adjusted regression analysis comparing low- and lower middle-income countries to high-income countries, the odds of consent for no placebo-drug/nutrition trials was 3.67 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.87-7.19; p = 0.0002) and 6.40 (95%CI 3.32-12.34; p<0.0001) for placebo-drug/nutrition trials. CONCLUSION Neonatal randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries report consistently higher consent rates compared to high-income country trials. Our study is limited by the overrepresentation of India among randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries.

Staff symptoms, previous swab testing, and antibody prevalence were correlated with patient admissions to investigate this assumption. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: Staff working in critical care. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care. Other staff, other areas of the hospital, and the wider community are more likely sources of infection. These findings indicate that personal protective equipment was effective at preventing transmission from patients.

Several novel ultra-minimally invasive surgical treatments (uMISTs) for BPH/benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) have become available over the past 5 yr. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the perioperative and functional outcomes of recently introduced uMISTs for BPH/BPO, including Urolift, Rezm, temporary implantable nitinol device, prostatic artery embolization (PAE), and intraprostatic injection. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was conducted in December 2020 using Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), Scopus, and Web of Science (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42021225014). The search strategy used PICO criteria and article selection was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The risk of bias and the quality of the articles included were assessed. A dedicated data extraction form was used to collect the data of interest. Pooled and cumulative analyses were performed to compare perioperative and functional outcomes between study groups. A random-effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method was used to evaluate heterogeneity. Stata version 15.0 software was used for all statistical analyses. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The initial electronic search identified 3978 papers, of which 48 ultimately met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Pooled analysis revealed a uMIST benefit in terms of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS; ?9.81 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] ?11.37 to ?8.25 at 1 mo; ?13.13 points, 95% CI ?14.98 to ?11.64 at 12 mo), maximum flow rate (from +3.66 ml/s, 95% CI 2.8C4.5 to +4.14 ml/s, 95% CI 0.72C7.56 at 12 mo), and postvoid residual volume (?10.10 ml, 95% CI ?27.90 to 7.71 at 12 mo). No negative impact was observed on scores for the International Index of Erectile Function-5, Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculatory Dysfunction bother and function scales (overall postintervention change in pooled median score of 1.88, 95% CI 1.34C2.42 at the start of follow-up; and 1.04, 95% CI 0.28C1.8 after 1 yr), or the IPSS-Quality of Life questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Novel uMISTs can yield fast and effective relief of LUTS without affecting patient quality of life.

Cervical cancer is one such type that can be monitored for a sufficiently long period toward invasive cancer phenotype. Herein, we report a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotag (SERS-tag) for the simultaneous detection of p16/K-i67, a dual biomarker persisting in the progression of squamous cell carcinoma of human cervix. A nanoflower-shaped SERS-tag, constituted of hybrid gold nanostar with silver tips to achieve maximum fingerprint enhancement from the incorporated reporter molecule, was further functionalized with the cocktail monoclonal antibodies against p16/K-i67. The recognition by the SERS-tag was first validated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell line SiHa as a foot-step study and subsequently implemented to different grades of clinically confirmed exfoliated cells including normal cell (NC), high-grade intra-epithelial lesion (HC), and squamous cell carcinoma (CC) samples of the cervix. Precise Raman mapped images were constituted based on the average intensity gradient of the signature Raman peaks arising from different grades of exfoliated cells. We observed a distinct intensity hike of around 10-fold in the single dysplastic HC and CC samples in comparison to NC specimen, which clearly justify the prevalence of p16/Ki-67. The synthesized probe is able to map the abnormal cells within 20 min with high reproducibility and stability for 1 mm  1 mm mapping area with good contrast. Amidst the challenges in Raman image-guided modality, the technique was further complemented with the gold standard immunocytochemistry (ICC) dual staining analysis. Even though both are time-consuming techniques, tedious steps can be avoided and real-time readout can be achieved using the SERS mapping unlike immunocytochemistry technique. Therefore, the newly developed Raman image-guided SERS imaging emphasizes the approach of uplifting of SERS in practical utility with further improvement for clinical applications for cervical cancer detection in future.","output":"Elucidating Raman Image-Guided Differential Recognition of Clinically Confirmed Grades of Cervical Exfoliated Cells by Dual Biomarker-Appended SERS-Tag."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We wish to highlight the continued impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) (filtering facemask and powered respirators) as a barrier to communication when used during aerosol generating procedures such as pediatric airway surgery in the operating theatre during the endemic phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and present our multi-cadre staff survey to emphasize an ongoing potential patient safety issue inherent to current guidance.","output":"We still cannot hear: Staff perceptions of personal protective equipment impact on speech and communication in the operating theater during pediatric airway surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We live in a technologically advanced era with a recent and marked dependence on digital technologies while also facing increasingly frequent extreme and global crises Crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, are significantly impacting our societies, organizations and individuals and dramatically shifting the use of, and dependence on, digital technology The way digital technology is used to cope with crises is novel and not well understood theoretically To explore the varied uses and impact of digital technologies during crises, we propose to view crisis as (1) opportunity, (2) disruption, and (3) exposure Examining crisis as opportunity reveals how digital technologies enable experimentation and accelerate innovation while raising coordination challenges and risky implementation Viewing crisis as disruption highlights how digital technologies enable the rapid shifting of organizational and occupational practices to new digital spaces, allowing work continuity, yet potentially distorting work practices and raising challenges of over-dependence Finally, crisis exposes the societal implications in making visible and exposing digital inequalities and producing moral dilemmas for us all We use these three perspectives to shed light on the varied uses of digital technologies in the COVID-19 crisis and suggest new avenues for research on crises more broadly","output":"Crisis as opportunity, disruption and exposure: Exploring emergent responses to crisis through digital technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of the new artificial systems with unique characteristics is very challenging task.

Case fatality rate (CFR) indicator of the disease is one of the most important indices noticed by experts, policymakers, and managers, based on which daily evaluations and many judgments are made. CFR can change during epidemics. This study aimed to estimate the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran and to calculate the early CFR for the disease based on official statistics. Methods: This was a descriptive study whose data were obtained from the website of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran from February 20, 2020 until March 26, 2020. CFR has been obtained by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of confirmed cases at one point in time. In this study, the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran was estimated based on the mortality model in 4 scenarios. Excel 2013 software was used to analyze the data. Results: According to the findings of this study, In Iran, until March 26, 2020, a total of 27 017 people have been infected by COVID-19 and 2077 died of it. However, CFR indicator had a descending trend in Iran: 100%, 18.6%, 8.8%, 3.3%, 6.9%, and 7.7% on days 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 35, respectively.

Conclusion: In emerging epidemics, CFR indicator must not be used as a basis to judge the performance of a health system unless that epidemic condition has been clarified. Moreover, it is suggested that in the outbreak of an epidemic, specifically emerging diseases, CFR must not be the base of judgment. Making judgments, specifically in the outbreak of emerging epidemics, based on fatality rate can lead to information bias. It is also possible to estimate the total number of patients based on the CFR in circumstances where little information is available on the disease.","output":"Can judgments according to case fatality rate be correct all the time during epidemics?

The esterases of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains S and JHM and puffinosis virus (PV) specifically hydrolysed 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac2) as well as the synthetic substrates p-nitrophenyl acetate, 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate and fluorescein diacetate. The K(m) values of the MHV-like esterases for the latter substrates were two- to tenfold lower than those of the sialate-9-O-acetylesterases of influenza C viruses. Another unspecific esterase substrate, alpha-naphthyl acetate, was used for the in situ detection of the dimeric HE proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. MHV-S, MHV-JHM and PV bound to horse serum glycoproteins containing Neu4,5Ac2. De-O-acetylation of the glycoproteins by alkaline treatment or incubation with the viral esterases resulted in a complete loss of recognition, indicating a specific interaction of MHV-like coronaviruses with Neu4,5Ac2. Combined with evidence for distinct phylogenetic lineages of group 2 coronaviruses, subdivision into subgroups 2a (MHV-like viruses) and 2b (bovine coronavirus-like viruses) is suggested.","output":"The sialate-4-O-acetylesterases of coronaviruses related to mouse hepatitis virus: a proposal to reorganize group 2 Coronaviridae."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public transportation vehicles, with their confined spaces and limited ventilation, are considered among the primary factors in the spread of COVID-19 As a measure to slow the spread of the virus during the pandemic, governments have applied passenger capacity restrictions to ensure physical distancing On the other hand, the increase in the risk of disease transmission associated with passengers waiting together at stops is omitted In this study, we consider the risk of disease transmission as a travel cost and formulate a risk minimization problem as a transit network frequency setting problem We develop a bi-level optimization model minimizing the total infection risk occurring at stops, namely, the cumulative disease transmission risk cost The Differential Evolution algorithm is employed to cope with the NP-hard bi-level transportation network design problem We propose a novel objective function for the upper-level model, considering the infection risk cost based on passenger traffic at public transportation stops A congested user-equilibrium transit assignment model is utilized to determine passenger movement The proposed model is applied to a small-size hypothetical network, and a mid-size test network Experimental studies provide evidence that the model can produce optimal solutions Optimization results show significant improvements in the reduction of disease transmission risk compared to the optimizations depending on the traditional practice of transportation network planning based on user and operator costs The proposed model provides risk cost reductions of 51% and 22% compared to the optimal solutions based on user cost minimization in the hypothetical network and Mandls network, respectively ? 2021, TU Delft All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 transmission risk minimization at public transportation stops using differential evolution algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of research on technical assistance (TA) interventions in low- and middle-income countries. Variation in local contexts requires tailor-made approaches to TA that are structured and replicable across intervention sites whilst retaining the flexibility to adapt to local contexts. We developed a systematic process of TA using multidisciplinary roving teams to provide support across the various elements comprising local HIV services. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of targeting specific HIV and TB programme indicators for improvement using roving teams. METHOD: We conducted a cluster-randomised stepped-wedge evaluation of a TA support package focussing on clinical, managerial and pharmacy services in the Mopani district of the Limpopo province, South Africa (SA). Three roving teams delivered the intervention. Seventeen primary and community healthcare centres that had 400C600 patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were selected for inclusion. The TA package was implemented for six consecutive months across facilities until all had received the same level of support. Data were collected from the relevant health management information systems for 11 routine indicators. RESULTS: The mean proportion of PLWH screened for tuberculosis (TB) at ART initiation increased from 85.2% to 87.2% (P = 0.65). Rates of retention in care improved, with the mean proportion of patients retained in care at three months post-ART initiation increasing from 79.9% to 87.4% (P < 0.001) and from 70.3% to 77.7% (P < 0.01) after six months. Finally, the mean proportion of patients with TB who completed their treatment increased from 80.6% to 82.1% (P = 0.75). CONCLUSION: Tailored TA interventions in SA using a standardised structure and process led to a significant improvement in retention-in-care rates and to non-significant improvements in the proportion of PLWH screened for TB and of those who completed their treatment.","output":"Indicator-focussed technical assistance in South Africas HIV programme: A stepped-wedge evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a game-theoretic model describing the voluntary social distancing during the spread of an epidemic. The payoffs of the agents depend on the social distancing they practice and on the probability of getting infected.

For the modeling of the epidemic outbreak, a variant of the SIR model is considered, involving populations of susceptible, infected, and recovered persons of vulnerable and non-vulnerable types. The Nash equilibria of this social distancing game are studied. We then analyze the case where the players, desiring to achieve a low social inequality, pose a bound on the variance of the payoffs. In this case, we introduce a notion of Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for games with a continuum of players and characterize the GNE. We then present some numerical results. It turns out that inequality constraints result in a slower spread of the epidemic and an improved cost for the vulnerable players. Furthermore, it is possible that inequality constraints are beneficial for non-vulnerable players as well.","output":"Nash Social Distancing Games with Equity Constraints: How Inequality Aversion Affects the Spread of Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the physical and mental health of individuals and communities worldwide.

The goal of this paper is to review the literature on previous infectious disease outbreaks to better understand and identify effective interventions that may help mitigate the psychological impact and collective trauma on a given community. Five strategies are recommended for developing a plan of action: (1) engage and partner with community leaders and community-based organizations; (2) establish (and re-establish) community support networks including self-help groups; (3) conduct community outreach, education, and training on the signs and symptoms of mental health issues, how to access mental health resources, and effective supportive and coping skills; (4) deploy Community Health Workers to access, engage, and educate community members; and (5) use a community capacity-building and community empowerment-oriented approach. When implemented together, these strategies have been shown to help communities reduce the mental health impact and heal from the collective trauma of an infectious disease outbreak and increase the collective efficacy of a community, resulting in increased resiliency and preparedness for future outbreaks.

The lack of daily commuting, improved eating habits, and more time available for a family were the main reported advantages of WFH. The main issues, highlighted by respondents, were higher stress levels, lower study/work efficiency, and poorer working environment at home. When comparing the online educational process with the traditional one, the absence of traditional laboratory work, inadequate social interactions, and limitations of online knowledge assessment were identified as drawbacks by both students and educators. A significant difference between students and educators was observed in their opinion on the efficiency of online lectures compared to traditional ones, with the former being significantly more favored by students than educators.

Elucidations of the RT structures trapping and detailing the enzyme at various functional and conformational states by X-ray crystallography have been instrumental for understanding RT activities, inhibition, and drug resistance. The structures have contributed to anti-HIV drug development. Currently, two classes of RT inhibitors are in clinical use. These are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). However, the error-prone viral replication generates variants that frequently develop resistance to the available drugs, thus warranting a continued effort to seek more effective treatment options. RT also provides multiple additional potential druggable sites.

We aimed to: 1) summarize MRI methods of published studies investigating T2 and T1 relaxation time in participants at risk for but without radiographic knee OA; and 2) compare T2 and T1 relaxation between participants at-risk for knee OA and healthy controls. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting T2 and T1 relaxation data that included both participants at risk for knee OA and healthy controls. Participant characteristics, MRI methodology, and T1 and T2 relaxation data were extracted. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated within each study. Pooled effect sizes were then calculated for six commonly segmented knee compartments. RESULTS 55 articles met eligibility criteria. There was considerable variability between scanners, coils, software, scanning protocols, pulse sequences, and post-processing. Moderate risk of bias due to lack of blinding was common. Pooled effect sizes indicated participants at risk for knee OA had lengthened T2 relaxation time in all compartments (SMDs from 0.33 to 0.74; p < 0.01) and lengthened T1 relaxation time in the femoral compartments (SMD from 0.35 to 0.40; p < 0.001).

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyle at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portugese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included into a general analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all intensities of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Conversely, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 hours per day. Additionally, food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of meals) were more unhealthy during confinement with only alcohol binge drink decreasing significantly. Conclusion While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, our results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a direction that would compromise health. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups which will help develop bespoke interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 confinement.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 home confinement on physical activity and eating behaviour Preliminary results of the ECLB-COVID19 international online-survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multirotor drones are becoming increasingly popular in a number of application fields, with a unique appeal to the scientific community and the general public. Applications include security, monitoring and surveillance, environmental mapping, and emergency scenario management: in all these areas, two of the main issues to address are the availability of appropriate software architectures to coordinate teams of drones and solutions to cope with the short-term battery life. This article proposes the novel concepts of Social Drone Sharing (SDS) and Social Charging Station (SCS), which provide the basis to address these problems. Specifically, the article focuses on teams of drones in pre- and post-event monitoring and assessment. Using multirotor drones in these situations can be difficult due to the limited flight autonomy when multiple targets need to be inspected. The idea behind the SDS concept is that citizens can volunteer to recharge a drone or replace its batteries if it lands on their property. The computation of paths to inspect multiple targets will then take into account the availability of SCSs to find solutions compatible with the required inspection and flight times. The main contribution of this article is the development of a cloud-based software architecture for SDS mission management, which includes a multi-drone path-optimization algorithm taking the SDS and SCS concepts into account.

The inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice, hamsters, and ferrets stymied initial attempts to generate small animal models. Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (hDPP4) as the receptor for MERS-CoV infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice. Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles, and limited MERS-CoV susceptibility to tissues that naturally express mDPP4, notably the lower respiratory tract wherein MERS-CoV elicits severe pulmonary pathology.

We maintain that 'aftercare' positions post-residential care as being less important than other treatment modalities, rather than as integral to a continuum of care. It is a term that implies that care should be acute, like much treatment delivered through a medical model, and assumes that people follow linear pathways in managing their AOD use. Assumptions embedded in the term 'aftercare' such as these may disincline governments from funding ongoing services for people exiting intensive programs. Alternative terms including 'continuing coordinated care' more aptly signal the integrated and ongoing service provision that should be available to support people in sustaining changes initiated through other AOD interventions.","output":"Why we stopped using the term 'aftercare'."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study examined the criterions that school principals used to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of distance learning tools in the COVID-19 pandemic by school teachers.

Inflammatory changes of the vasculature and blood mediate the course and outcome of the pathology in the tissue site of insult, remote organs and systemically. Endothelial cells lining the luminal surface of the vasculature play the key regulatory functions in the body, distinct under normal vs. pathological conditions. In theory, pharmacological interventions in the endothelial cells might enable therapeutic correction of the overzealous damaging pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic changes in the vasculature. However, current agents and drug delivery systems (DDS) have inadequate pharmacokinetics and lack the spatiotemporal precision of vascular delivery in the context of acute inflammation. To attain this level of precision, many groups design DDS targeted to specific endothelial surface determinants. These DDS are able to provide specificity for desired tissues, organs, cells, and sub-cellular compartments needed for a particular intervention. We provide a brief overview of endothelial determinants, design of DDS targeted to these molecules, their performance in experimental models with focus on animal studies and appraisal of emerging new approaches. Particular attention is paid to challenges and perspectives of targeted therapeutics and nanomedicine for advanced management of acute inflammation.","output":"Targeting vascular inflammation through emerging methods and drug carriers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Treatment of children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a difficult balance between hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenism. Biochemical monitoring of treatment is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: Cluster analysis of the urinary steroid metabolome obtained by targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for treatment monitoring of children with CAH. METHODS: We evaluated 24-h urinary steroid metabolome analyses of 109 prepubertal children aged 7.0a?a?1.6a?years with classic CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. 24-h urinary steroid metabolite excretions were transformed into CAH-specific z-scores. Subjects were divided into groups (metabotypes) by k-means clustering algorithm. Urinary steroid metabolome and clinical data of patients of each metabotype were analyzed. RESULTS: Four unique metabotypes were generated. Metabotype 1 (Na?=a?21 (19%)) revealed adequate metabolic control with low cortisol metabolites (mean: -0.57z) and suppressed androgen and 17&#945;-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) metabolites (-0.79z). Metabotype 2 (Na?=a?23 (21%)) showed overtreatment consisting of a constellation of elevated urinary cortisol metabolites (0.62z) and low metabolites of androgens and 17OHP (-0.75z). Metabotype 3 (Na?=a?32 (29%)) demonstrated undertreated patients with low cortisol metabolites (-0.69z) and elevated metabolites of androgens and 17OHP (0.50z). Metabotype 4 (Na?=a?33 (30%)) presented patients with treatment failure reflected by unsuppressed androgen- and 17OHP metabolites (0.71z) despite elevated urinary cortisol metabolites (0.39z). CONCLUSION: Metabotyping, which means grouping metabolically similar individuals, helps to monitor treatment of children with CAH using GC-MS urinary steroid metabolome analysis. This method allows classification in adequately-, over-, or undertreated children as well as identification of patients with treatment failure.","output":"Urinary GC-MS Steroid Metabotyping in treated Children with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States, there are over 4.5 million people who have special health, developmental, or behavioral health concerns.

The virus requires structural and non-structural proteins for its multiplication that are produced from polyproteins obtained by translation of its genomic RNA. These polyproteins are converted into structural and non-structural proteins mainly by the main protease (Mpro). A systematic screening of a drug library (having drugs and diagnostic agents which are approved by FDA or other world authorities) and the Asinex BioDesign library was carried out using pharmacophore and sequential conformational precision level filters using the Schrodinger Suite. From the screening of approved drug library, three antiviral agents ritonavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir were predicted to be the most potent Mpro inhibitors. Apart from these pralmorelin, iodixanol and iotrolan were also identified from the systematic screening. As iodixanol and iotrolan carry some limitations, structural modifications in them could lead to stable and safer antiviral agents. Screenings of Asinex BioDesign library resulted in 20 molecules exhibiting promising interactions with the target protein Mpro. They can broadly be categorized into four classes based on the nature of the scaffold, viz. disubstituted pyrazoles, cyclic amides, pyrrolidine-based compounds and miscellaneous derivatives. These could be used as potential molecules or hits for further drug development to obtain clinically useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19.

We have examined the impact of CG168 on referral practice for patients with bleeding varicose veins from primary to secondary care in a local NHS service. METHODS: Referrals to a local vascular service in the 6 years before (Group 1) and 6 years after (Group 2) publication of CG168 were analysed to assess patients' management following a bleed, with particular reference to a patient's initial presentation and delays in referral to the vascular service. This was done by retrospective electronic database and case-note interrogation of patients presenting with bleeding varicose veins. Relevant data was collected onto an Excel spread sheet in relation to demographic information, comorbidities, clinical presentation and treatment pathway. RESULTS: 73 patients presented with bleeding varicose veins during the period studied. Their mean age was 66 and 56% were men. Their mean BMI was 28. Of note Thirty-three patients (45%) initially self-treated, before going to see their General Practitioner (GP), another 18 (25%) went to the Emergency department (ED). In 51 patients (70%) the underlying superficial pathology involved the great saphenous vein (GSV) and most patients (73%) were treated with foam sclerotherapy with or without truncal thermal ablation. 45 patients (Group 1) were treated in the 6 years before CG168 and 28 patients, allowing 6 months for dissemination, were treated in the 6 years after CG168 (Group 2). Mean time from index bleed to referral to the vascular service was faster after CG168 (84 days pre and 20 days post CG168). P=0.00842. Publication of CG168 was also associated with reduced mean bleed to intervention times (194 vs 60 days P=0.00097). CONCLUSIONS: Publication of UK NICE guidelines CG 168 has been associated with a significant reduction in the delay to referral of patients presenting with bleeding varicose veins however the goal of immediate referral to a vascular service is not being met. CG168 is likely to have been a significant component of the factors that have led to the improvements seen thus far.","output":"The recommended goal in the United Kingdom's National Institute of Care and Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline 168 for immediate referral of patients with bleeding varicose veins is not being achieved"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objectives of this study were to profile the landscape of women's alcohol use programs in Canada.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine changes in traffic injuries distribution and outcomes among patients seeking emergency medical transport before, during, and after the COVID-19 restrictions were imposed in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a nationwide retrospective study of all injuries reported to the Saudi Red Crescent Authority (SRCA) between January 1(st), 2020, and May 31(st), 2021. The cases in the study were categorized based on the following three time periods: (1) Pre-restriction (January 1 to March 23, 2020), (2) restriction (March 24 to June 21, 2020), and (3) post-restriction (June 22, 2020, to May 31, 2021). RESULTS: A total of 142,763 cases of traffic-related injuries were recorded at the SRCA during the study period: pre-restriction, 27,811 (19.5%); restriction, 14,414 (10.1%); post-restriction, 100,538 (70.4%). Males accounted for most cases throughout the study period, but a significant increase in the number of females was observed in the post-restriction period compared with the first two timeframes (12.2% vs. 3.4% and 3.4%, respectively; P < 0.01). During the restriction period, the rate of mortality was the highest, and rollover crashes were significantly higher (18.2% vs. 14.0% and 14.6%; P < 0.01).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between September 2009 and August 2010 a total of 24 children underwent a laparoscopic pyloromyotomy, 12 in SILS technique. The single incision was carried through the center of the umbilicus. The working instruments were introduced in a two-dimensional direction into the peritoneal cavity via the same umbilical incision. The two groups were compared for patients' demographics, operative report and early postoperative outcomes. RESULTS All SILS procedures were performed successfully with no conversion rate. There were no differences in the preoperative parameters between the two groups regarding age before surgery and body weight at operation. Operative time and time of full enteral intake was similar to comparable procedures with usage of a standard laparoscopic approach. There were no operative or postoperative complications.

This study was carried out to investigate microbial contamination of mobile phones of HCWs and environmental samples from the hospital unit using a combination of phenotypic and molecular methods. METHODS: This point prevalence survey was carried out at the Emergency unit of a tertiary care facility. The emergency unit has two zones, a general zone for non-COVID-19 patients and a dedicated COVID-19 zone for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Swabs were obtained from the mobile phones of HCWs in both zones for bacterial culture and shotgun metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic sequencing of pooled environmental swabs was conducted. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection was carried out. RESULTS: Bacteria contamination on culture was detected from 33 (94.2%) mobile phones with a preponderance of Staphylococcus epidermidis (n/N = 18/35), Staphylococcus hominis (n/N = 13/35), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n/N = 7/35). Two methicillin-sensitive and three methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and one pan-drug-resistant carbapenemase producer Acinetobacter baumannii were detected. Shotgun metagenomic analysis showed high signature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mobile phone and environmental samples with preponderance of P. aeruginosa bacteriophages. Malassezia and Aspergillus spp. were the predominant fungi detected. Fourteen mobile phones and one environmental sample harbored protists. P. aeruginosa antimicrobial resistance genes mostly encoding for efflux pump systems were detected. The P. aeruginosa virulent factor genes detected were related to motility, adherence, aggregation, and biofilms. One mobile phone from the COVID-19 zone (n/N = 1/5; 20%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 detection while all other phone and environmental samples were negative. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that mobile phones of HCWs are fomites for potentially pathogenic and highly drug-resistant microbes. The presence of these microbes on the mobile phones and hospital environmental surfaces is a concern as it poses a risk of pathogen transfer to patients and dissemination into the community.","output":"Metagenomic Sequencing and Reverse Transcriptase PCR Reveal That Mobile Phones and Environmental Surfaces Are Reservoirs of Multidrug-Resistant Superbugs and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts is an edited collection of original essays on Asias legal and policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, which, in a matter of months, swept around the globe, infecting millions.

To determine the amount of genetic divergence within and between these species, allozyme analyses were conducted on 14 populations distributed from Pennsylvania to eastern Texas. Seventeen loci were surveyed, 13 of which were polymorphic, with all populations being polymorphic at one or more loci. Interspecific genetic identities ranged from 0.560 (C. willdenowii and C. basiantha) to 0.807 (C. basiantha and C. superata).

Current research indicates that Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, and other LGBT+ people suffer the highest rates of bullying, while other studies suggest that this bullying does not occur based on the victims actual sexual orientation or gender identity, but because they do not fit into the traditional gender roles. The aim of the present study was to carry out a meta-analytical study on the prevalence of gender-based bullying against LGBT+ schoolchildren and adolescents in Spain. Methods: The review was carried out following the recommendations of the PRISMA group and allowing us to identify a total of 24 studies. All of these studies were published since 2008, and most of them conducted cross-sectional survey-type research. It was also found that the instrument used to assess bullying varied greatly among studies, resulting in an enormous heterogeneity of research on this topic. Different meta-analyses were carried out according to the profile of involvement in bullying: victimisation, perpetration, and observation. In addition, three target populations were detected in the victimisation research: the general population, pre-identified bullying victims reporting the reasons behind the victimisation, and LGBT+ people. Results: The meta-analyses conducted with R have estimated the prevalence of observation of gender-based school bullying in Spain at 77.3%, perpetration at 13.3%, and victimisation at 8.6% among the general population. When the research focuses on previously identified victims, the rate was 3.6%, while if LGBT+ people are approached directly, the percentage increases to 51%.

Following the first reported case of GBS after Zika virus infection in 2013, there has been a considerable increase in the incidence of GBS in endemic countries such as French Polynesia and Latin American countries. The association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and GBS is another emerging research hotspot. Electrophysiological studies have suggested that GBS patients associated with Zika virus infection or COVID-19 tend to manifest acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, rather than acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Causative autoantibodies, such as anti-ganglioside antibodies in AMAN associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, have not been identified in GBS associated with these emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested molecular mimicry between these viruses and human proteins related to GBS. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of new vaccines, containing artificial messenger RNA encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV2, against COVID-19. These vaccines are now available in many countries and massive vaccination campaigns are currently ongoing. Although there are long-standing concerns about the increased risk of GBS after inoculation of conventional vaccines, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit administration of currently available vaccines because the benefits outweigh the risks.","output":"Emerging infectious diseases, vaccines, and Guillain-Barr syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The pp-Whipple procedure requires extensive preparation.

This study aimed to evaluate the dynamic of humoral immune response as well as the short-term side effects resulting from the booster dose of BNT162b2 following completion of a CoronaVac double-dose in Thai HCWs. METHODS: This study was conducted at a teaching hospital in Northern Thailand during August and September 2021. The participants were 50 HCWs who were vaccinated with 2 doses of CoronaVac and were scheduled to receive a booster dose of BNT162b2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies levels and short-term side effects were assessed. The anti-RBD level was determined using Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott). RESULT: Of the 50 participants, 37 were female. The median age was 33.0 years old. The average time between the second CoronaVac shot and the BNT162b2 booster shot was 81.7 days (SD = 25.0). The median anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level on booster vaccination date, as well as day 14, and day 28 after the booster were 335.5 AU/ml, 31,613.5 AU/ml, and 20,311.9 AU/ml, respectively. Fourteen days after the booster, 94% of participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels higher than 50.0 AU/ml. Being female, higher log anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies prior to booster vaccination, and longer interval between the second shot and the booster shot were found to be significantly associated with higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at both day 14 and day 28 after the booster. There were no reports of serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: A booster dose of BNT162B2 promoted a high level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among HCWs who received 2 doses of CoronaVac.

(Family: Spongiidae) is a coastal sponge that possesses a broad variety of natural-products. However, the exact chemical constituents and cytotoxic activity of the extract are still undefinable. METHODOLOGY: In the present study, the metabolomic profiling of Coscinoderma sp. dereplicated 20 compounds, utilizing liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRESIMS). Coscinoderma-derived crude extract, before and after encapsulation within nanosized liposomes, was in vitro screened against hepatic, breast, and colorectal carcinoma human cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, and Caco-2, respectively). RESULTS: The identified metabolites were fit to diverse chemical classes, covering diterpenes, an indole alkaloid, sesterterpenoid, sterol, and methylherbipoline salt. Comprehensive in silico experiments predicted several compounds in the sponge-derived extract (eg, compounds 1C15) to have an anticancer potential via targeting multiple targets. The crude extract showed moderate antiproliferative activities towards studied cell lines with IC(50) values range from 10.7 to 12.4 g/mL. The formulated extract-containing liposomes (size 14112.3nm, PDI 0.222, zeta potential 20.8  2.3), significantly enhanced the in vitro anticancer activity of the entrapped extract (IC(50) values ranged from 1.7 to 4.1 g/mL). DISCUSSION: Encapsulation of both the hydrophilic and the lipophilic components of the extract within the lipid-based nanovesicles enhanced the cellular uptake and accessibility of the entrapped cargo. This study introduces liposomal nano-vesicles as a promising approach to improve the therapeutic potential of sponge-derived extracts.","output":"Cytotoxic Potential, Metabolic Profiling, and Liposomes of Coscinoderma sp.

Between December 2016 and August 2018, we retrospectively reviewed the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation. Thirteen patients underwent preparative ECMO for bridging to lung transplantation, and seven patients successfully underwent bridging to lung transplantation. The average age of the patients was 45.7 years (range, 19C62 years). The ECMO support period lasted 3C55 days (mean, 18.7 days; median, 13 days). In seven patients, bridging to lung transplantation was performed successfully. The mean age of patients was 49.8 years (range 42C62). Bridging time was 3C55 days (mean, 19 days; median, 13 days). Two patients died in the early postoperative period. Five patients survived until discharge from the hospital. One-year survival was achieved in four patients.

Such studies have never been performed in the conditions of a pandemic caused by a new, unknown coronavirus. Therefore, the objective of the study was to identify the sources of their stress in the course of the studies, with reference to the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 334 dentistry students of the Institute of Dentistry at the Jagiellonian University Medical College were invited to take part in the study. They represented a range from the first to the fifth year of studies in the 2019/2020 academic year. The tool employed in the study was the Dental Environmental Stress (DES) questionnaire and 11 supplementary questions related to the pandemic. The study was carried out on June 1-25, 2020. RESULTS: The participation rate was 72%. Academic work presented the highest level of stress. A comparison of the overall levels of stress in particular domains as well as questions included in the DES survey revealed significant differences between students of individual years of studies in the 2019/2020 academic year. The strongest positive relationships between the supplementary questions and the DES domains appeared in the area of clinical factors. These concerned returning to clinical classes and contact with patients with regard to SARS-CoV-2 (rs = 0.50, p < 0.001), contact with patients in connection with SARS-CoV-2 (rs = 0.47, p < 0.001), and a lack of practical classes with patients in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic (rs = 0.42, p < 0.001).

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In China, the pandemic was controlled after 2 mo through effective policies and containment measures. Describing the detailed policies and containment measures used to control the epidemic in Chongqing will provide a reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in other areas of the world. AIM: To explore the effects of different policies and containment measures on the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing. METHODS: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Chongqing were prospectively collected from January 21 to March 15, 2020. The policies and prevention measures implemented by the government during the epidemic period were also collected. Trend analysis was performed to explore the impact of the main policy measures on the effectiveness of the control of COVID-19 in Chongqing. RESULTS: As of March 15, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Chongqing was 1.84/100000 (576 cases) and the infection fatality rate was 1.04% (6/576). The spread of COVID-19 was controlled by effective policies that involved establishing a group for directing the COVID-19 epidemic control effort; strengthening guidance and supervision; ensuring the supply of daily necessities and medical supplies and equipment to residents; setting up designated hospitals; implementing legal measures; and enhancing health education. Medical techniques were implemented to improve the recovery rate and control the epidemic. Policies such as the lockdown of Wuhan, initiating a first-level response to major public health emergencies, and implementing the closed management of residential communities significantly curbed the spread of COVID-19. Optimizing the diagnosis process, shortening the diagnosis time, and constructing teams of clinical experts facilitated the provision of one team of medical experts for each patient treatment for severe patients, which significantly improved the recovery rate and reduced the infection fatality rate. CONCLUSION: The prevention policies and containment measures implemented by the government and medical institutions are highly effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic and increasing the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Effects of policies and containment measures on control of COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD52 is a small surface glycoprotein composed of 12 amino acids. CD52 is found mostly on the surface of mature immune cells, such as lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and dendritic cells, as well as the male genital tract: within the epididymis and on the surface of mature sperm. Low CD52 expression is also found in neutrophils. CD52 function is not fully understood, although experiments with anti-CD52 antibodies have shown that CD52 is essential for lymphocyte transendothelial migration and may contribute to costimulation of CD4(+) T cells and T-cell activation and proliferation.

In multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab is registered for adult patients with the relapsingCremitting form of the disease defined by clinical and imaging features. Despite the high efficacy of the drug, the main issue is its safety. The main adverse effects of alemtuzumab are associated with drug infusion due to cytokine release and cytotoxic effects of antibodies associated with lymphocyte depletion, which leads to immunosuppression, and secondary autoimmunity that may be the effect of excessive B-cell repopulation and cancer.

AIMS: To identify the rates of probable mental health disorder in staff working in ICUs in nine English hospitals during June and July 2020. METHODS: An anonymized brief web-based survey comprising standardized questionnaires examining depression, anxiety symptoms, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), well-being and alcohol use was administered to staff. RESULTS: Seven hundred and nine participants completed the surveys comprising 291 (41%) doctors, 344 (49%) nurses and 74 (10%) other healthcare staff. Over half (59%) reported good well-being; however, 45% met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of the following measures: severe depression (6%), PTSD (40%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%). Thirteen per cent of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past 2 weeks. Within the sample used in this study, we found that doctors reported better mental health than nurses across a range of measures. CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial rates of probable mental health disorders, and thoughts of self-harm, amongst ICU staff; these difficulties were especially prevalent in nurses.

One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. Based on available studies, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown. The findings suggest that this route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Importance Immune surveillance of viral or bacterial infections is largely mediated by neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are produced after vaccination or infection, but their titers only partly reflect the degree of protection against infection. To identify protective antibodies, a neutralization test with replicating viruses or pseudoviruses (PVs) is required. This study developed lentiviral-based PV neutralization assays that, unlike similar systems reported earlier, enable quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell cocultures. Using both PVs and replication-competent virus, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection is considerably more resistant to serum neutralization than infection with purified viral particles. The tests are easy to set up in many labs, and are believed to be more informative for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 collective immunity or entry inhibitor screening.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection is resistant to neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we focus on a detailed bioinformatics analysis of hyBpox genes, mainly within the genomes of Sclerotiniaceae (Ascomycota, Leotiomycetes), which is a specifically evolved fungal family of necrotrophic host generalists and saprophytic or biotrophic host specialists.

Grief is a natural consequence. Many mental health concerns, which can be identified as grief outcomes (e.g. anxiety and depression) in those who have experienced a bereavement, can be improved through physical activity. The objective of this review was to identify from the existing literature if physical activity can benefit grief outcomes in individuals who have been bereaved. METHODS: A systematic review of nine databases was performed. Included studies (qualitative and quantitative) explored physical activity to help individuals (of any age) who had experienced a human bereavement (excluding national loss). RESULTS: From 1299 studies screened, 25 met the inclusion criteria, detailing eight types of bereavement (parental (n = 5), spousal (n = 6), patient (n = 4), pre-natal (n = 3), later life (n = 1), caregiver (n = 1), multiple (n = 4) and non-defined (n = 1). Activities including yoga, running, walking and martial arts were noted as beneficial. Physical activity allowed a sense of freedom, to express emotions, provided a distraction and an escape from grief, whilst enhancing social support. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that physical activity may provide benefit for the physical health and psychological wellbeing of those who have been bereaved, including when the loss has happened at a young age. This review is timely, given the wide-scale national loss of life due to COVID-19 and extends knowledge in this area.

Patients of all ages could be affected, although there is a predilection for middle-aged people. Results?There were no significant co-morbidities or immunodeficiencies in the affected patients. COVID-19 related myelopathy started roughly within the first month after COVID-19 onset, either concomitantly with COVID-19 symptoms or within 10 days after their remission. The vast majority of cases fulfilled our criteria for postinfectious transverse myelitis. However, some cases were considered to have had parainfectious or infectious myelitis or, in one case, vascular myelopathy. Motor, sensory and bowel and/or bladder symptoms predominated the clinical presentation of myelopathies, explained mainly by centrally localized and longitudinally extensive lesions within the cervical and/or thoracic segments of the spinal cord. Occasionally lesions were complicated by necrosis and hemorrhages. Treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange was offered mostly a mild to marked improvement within a period of some weeks. Conclusions?

These studies are part of a broad category termed two-phase studies. Common examples include the nested case-control and the case-cohort designs. For two-phase studies, appropriate weighted survival estimates have been derived; however, no estimator of cumulative incidence accounting for competing events has been proposed. This is relevant in the presence of multiple types of events, where estimation of event type specific quantities are needed for evaluating outcome. METHODS: We develop a non parametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function of events accounting for possible competing events. It handles a general sampling design by weights derived from the sampling probabilities. The variance is derived from the influence function of the subdistribution hazard. RESULTS: The proposed method shows good performance in simulations. It is applied to estimate the crude incidence of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in groups defined by a genotype not available for everyone in a cohort of nearly 2000 patients, where death due to toxicity acted as a competing event. In a second example the aim was to estimate engagement in care of a cohort of HIV patients in resource limited setting, where for some patients the outcome itself was missing due to lost to follow-up. A sampling based approach was used to identify outcome in a subsample of lost patients and to obtain a valid estimate of connection to care.

In Poland, a possibility of employment in 2 or more workplaces arose with the socio-political changes and the reform of the health care system. In Poland, the scale of the phenomenon, as well as its motifs and potential effects influencing both employees and the whole health care system, are still not known despite numerous studies being conducted to that end. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 1023 nurses (males and females) employed in public and non-public health care facilities in the territory of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. The research tool was the authors' poll questionnaire. In the statistical elaboration, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and the 2 independence test were used. For all the analyses, the maximum permissible error of type I,  = 0.05, was accepted, and p  0.05 was recognized as statistically significant. RESULTS Work experience of the nurses studied ranged 1-43 years, on average it was 23.1 years (SD = 11.1). Persons aged >40 years accounted for 77.5% (N = 793), out of whom 38.2% (N = 391) were aged 41-years and 39.3% (N = 402) >50 years.

A decisive reason to take up an additional job (93.3% of the study group) were financial matters. CONCLUSIONS Financial matters are the main reason for which almost half of the studied nurses undertake additional employment, in the scope twice as high as the work load. Research suggests the need to verify the Central Registry of Nurses and Midwives in order to precisely estimate the number of dual practice positions and the number of persons employed as nurses not only in the south of Poland but also in whole country.

The majority of the queries were directed to the department of cornea (58.93%) followed by retina (16.26%), cataract (13.04%), glaucoma (10.14%) & pediatric ophthalmology (1.61%). The most common advice given to the patient was related to medications (47.66%) followed by appointment-related queries (31.72%) & fixing of surgical appointment (20.61%). Among the 356 preterm babies that were screened, 57 (16.01%) were diagnosed with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Of them 3 required laser and 3 were given injection. Conclusion: Teleconsultation is here to stay beyond the pandemic. WhatsApp was the preferred modality of communication for us. Teleophthalmology has given us insights to use this evolving technology to reach out to the population at large to provide eye care services. We believe that this mode of teleophthalmology has helped us in providing feasible eye care to the patients.","output":"Impact of teleophthalmology during COVID-19 lockdown in a tertiary care center in South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On account of the national closedown, the economy has suffered a severe slump. The reduced purchase of goods and services has lead to slow down of domestic manufacturing and agricultural sectors, leading to severe unemployment in urban industrial areas and contraction of the rural economy. This lockdown has influenced economy and business circumstance in India as it has occurred in other nations. The ongoing lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak affects the Indian economy in many ways, including sharp declines in domestic demand, lower tourism and business travel, trade and production linkages, supply disruptions, and health effects. There are certain sectors that have been affected due to the outbreak of corona virus. This research paper, anticipates indicative measures that may be taken to revive the economy as well as affected sectors to some extent. First, this paper provides an overview of effect of this lockdown on Indian economy. With no manufacturing activity, it is likely that growth of gross domestic product (GDP) will be slowed down. This will be followed listing of the sectors affected due to COVID-19, which carries the risk of global supply chain disruptions. This includes five import items that are heavily dependent on China - electrical machinery, mechanical appliances, organic chemicals, plastics and surgical instruments - that make up about 28% of India's import basket could be the mostly affected ones due to this potential shutdown. Next, the paper will present some of the indicative measures to revive the economy and rejuvenate the affected sectors. Protection of workers at the workplace must be given utmost priority followed by adapting to new work arrangements such as work-from-home (WFH). This will be followed by measures to stimulate the economy and labour demand by making and implementing active fiscal policy. Making expenditure on purchasing domestic goods and services will be the best way to push the economy. As a matter of fact, it is now may be required to evaluate on what can be produced here (in India) and give a deliberate thought to it towards implanting the same. Further, India will be at advantage by having domestically based and well established 'pharma industry'. This sector may act as 'catalyst sector' towards economic growth of the country.","output":"Addressing The Post Covid-19 Economic Consequences Of Lockdown In India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The current intensive longitudinal study aimed at examining the association between daily rumination (i.e., intrusive rumination and deliberate rumination) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) associated with the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD: Final participants were 71 adults who were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants responded to daily questions regarding ruminations they engaged in and PTG they experienced that day for a total of 29 days. RESULTS: As expected, there was no significant association between intrusive rumination and PTG, but a significant positive association was found between deliberate rumination and PTG. In addition, a person of color and those who reported as religious experienced higher levels of PTG. Furthermore, there was a significant between-person variability on the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG. CONCLUSIONS: The current study supports previous findings between rumination and PTG. It also raises the importance of acknowledging that the levels of one's PTG following deliberate rumination may differ greatly from the typical individual, indicating the need to be mindful of individual experience.

The reason is unclear, but few cases of MIS-C have been reported in Asian countries, including Japan. No treatment has been established for MIS-C. In this study, we report the case of a young boy treated with IVIg for MIS-C by measuring the cytokine profile over time. A 4-year-old boy presented with Kawasaki disease-like symptoms 28 days after a positive result from polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), meeting the World Health Organization criteria for MIS-C diagnosis. Blood tests showed lower levels of C-reactive protein and ferritin, and no decrease in lymphocyte count (<1000/L) or more increase in fibrinogen than those reported in Japan for MIS-C in school-aged children and older. Neopterin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNF-R)I and sTNF-RII were all high at disease onset, but neopterin, IL-6, and sTNF-RII rapidly decreased with fever resolution after the second dose of IVIg, while IL-18 and sTNF-RI decreased bimodally. As far as we can determine, this case represents the youngest identified in Japan. The key point of difference between MIS-C and Kawasaki disease is older age in MIS-C, but attention is also needed in infants.","output":"A young child with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome successfully treated with high-dose immunoglobulin therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Care homes have been severely affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid antigen testing could identify most SARS-CoV-2 infected staff and visitors before they enter homes. We explored implementation of staff and visitor testing protocols using lateral flow devices (LFDs). METHODS: An evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 LFD-based testing protocol in 11 care homes in Liverpool, UK, including staff and visitor testing, plus a qualitative exploratory study in nine of these homes. The proportion of pilot homes with outbreaks, and outbreak size, were compared to non-pilot homes in Liverpool. Adherence to testing protocols was evaluated. Fifteen staff were interviewed, and transcript data were thematically coded using an iterative analysis to identify and categorize factors influencing testing implementation. RESULTS: In total, 1,638 LFD rapid tests were performed on 407 staff. Protocol adherence was poor with 8.6% of staff achieving >75% protocol adherence, and 25.3% achieving [Formula: see text] 50%. Six care homes had outbreaks during the study. Compared to non-pilot care homes, there was no evidence of significant difference in the proportion of homes with outbreaks, or the size of outbreaks. Qualitative data showed difficulty implementing testing strategies due to excessive work burden. Factors influencing adherence related to test integration and procedural factors, socio-economic factors, cognitive overload and the emotional value of testing. CONCLUSION: Implementation of staff and visitor care home LFD testing protocols was poorly adhered to and consequently did not reduce the number or scale of COVID-19 outbreaks.

Stakeholder engagement for dementia care research has been identified as a national priority, though evaluation of engagement strategies and their impact has been limited. In dementia care research, stakeholders can include individuals living with dementia, family care partners, and health and social care professionals in dementia care. A Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC) was established to identify priorities for dementia care research that are most important to stakeholders. Strategies to build capacity for research and facilitate engagement among the SAC were used to identify the research priorities. This study describes the experiences of SAC members engaged in the research process. METHODS: To evaluate stakeholder engagement, semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of the SAC to understand their experiences and perspectives on the strategies used to facilitate engagement and build capacity for research. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Findings were presented to members of the SAC to determine whether they felt their perspectives and experiences were accurately represented. Final domains and themes presented here were approved by the SAC. RESULTS: Interviews (N = 11) were conducted with members of the SAC representing each stakeholder group; persons living with dementia (n = 2); family care partners (n = 4), and health and social care professionals in dementia care (n = 5). Ten themes were categorized into four overarching domains: accessibility, council infrastructure, values and environment, and benefits of involvement.

It results in sick leave, disability, producing significant restrictions on usual activity and participation among many office workers. The working style of bank workers is sedentary mostly and the alignment of their chairs, table, and computers is not designed based on their health aspects which exposes them to low back pain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of low back pain among bank workers in Gondar city. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 20th October to 10th November 2020 at banks in Gondar city. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select 296 bank workers. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were entered in epi-info version 7, analyzed using SPSS version 21, and presented by frequencies, percentages, and tables. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were employed using a binary logistic regression model. Variables with a p-value < 0.05 were considered as factors significantly associated and the odds ratio with a 95% CI was used to determine the strength of association. RESULTS: The prevalence of low back pain among bank workers in the last 12 months was 55.4%. Being female, work-related stress, lack of physical activity, using a fixed chair and a chair without an armrest, and lifting heavy objects increases the risk of developing low back pain. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of low back pain among bank workers in Gondar city was high.

There is a need to understand the impact on different health care professionals in different countries. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychological impact of the pandemic among dental staff in Norway in relation to background characteristics, work situation and preparedness of the service. METHODS: A structured questionnaire sent electronically to dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants inquired information about the lockdown period in Norway (13 March-17 April 2020). Distributions of background characteristics, perceptions of preparedness and psychological impact were calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was performed, and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) were used to compare psychological impact between dental professionals treating patients versus not during lockdown. RESULTS: Among the 1237 respondents, 58.8% worked clinically with patients. The majority were concerned of becoming infected (71.9%), of infecting others (85.4%) and/or of their family becoming infected (76.9%). Respondents who treated patients felt significantly more insecure about whether having become infected or not. The minority felt discriminated (6.7%), worried about death (11.7%), felt that life was threatening (9.8%) or felt loss of control of their lives (8.9%). More than 80% agreed that their workplace handled the situation well. Four factors were retrieved from the factor analysis. SEMs showed that gender and work experience had a significant effect on the factors Instability, Infection and Concerns. Respondents with work experience &#8805;10 years were less likely to express fear about Instability and Infection. Personnel reporting that their workplace had adequate equipment were also less concerned, however having adequate equipment did not reduce the factor Loss of control. CONCLUSION: The present study showed a considerable psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental personnel in Norway regardless of working clinically with patients or not. However, working with patients increased the insecurity about own infection status and of infecting people close to them.

Notable patient-related barriers reported were forgetfulness and a poor state of health. Notable institution-related barriers included suboptimal information received from health care service providers, poor referral management by the organisation delivering retinal screening services, as well as the inaccessibility of the main NTSS hospital via telephone calls. All these factors were confirmed by the key informants of the current study.

To combat these, novel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying degrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular global health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost the whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one invisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication, healing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or any other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and future are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so severe, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease spread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all of these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to facilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we report results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated real-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for COVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available data from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the pandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored correlations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and environmental factors.

As a result, age-stratified modeling for COVID-19 dynamics is the key to study how to reduce hospitalizations and mortality from COVID-19. By taking advantage of network theory, we develop an age-stratified epidemic model for COVID-19 in complex contact networks. Specifically, we present an extension of standard SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) compart-mental model, called age-stratified SEAHIR (susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-hospitalized-infectious-removed) model, to capture the spread of COVID-19 over multitype random networks with general degree distributions. We derive several key epidemiological metrics and then propose an age-stratified vaccination strategy to decrease the mortality and hospitalizations. Through extensive study, we discover that the outcome of vaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number R0. Specifically, the elderly should be prioritized only when R0 is relatively high. If ongoing intervention policies, such as universal masking, could suppress R0 at a relatively low level, prioritizing the high-transmission age group (i.e., adults aged 20-39) is most effective to reduce both mortality and hospitalizations. These conclusions provide useful recommendations for age-based vaccination pri-oritization for COVID-19.

In some countries, women are at much higher risk. We examined risk factors for VAW in countries with the highest 12-month prevalence estimates of intimate partner violence (IPV) to develop understanding of this increased risk. METHODS: For this systematic review, we searched PUBMED, CINAHL, PROQUEST (Middle East and North Africa; Latin America and Iberia; East and South Asia), Web of Science, EMBASE and PsycINFO (Ovid) for records published between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2021 in English, French and Spanish. Included records used quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods, reported original data, had VAW as the main outcome, and focused on at least one of 23 countries in the highest quintile of prevalence figures for womens self-reported experiences of physical and/or sexual violence in the past 12 months. We used critical interpretive synthesis to develop a conceptual model for associations between identified risk factors and VAW. RESULTS: Our search identified 12 044 records, of which 241 were included for analysis (2 80 360 women, 40 276 men, 274 key informants). Most studies were from Bangladesh (74), Uganda (72) and Tanzania (43). Several quantitative studies explored community-level/region-level socioeconomic status and education as risk factors, but associations with VAW were mixed. Although fewer in number and representing just one country, studies reported more consistent effects for community-level childhood exposure to violence and urban residence. Theoretical explanations for a countrys high prevalence point to the importance of exposure to other forms of violence (armed conflict, witnessing parental violence, child abuse) and patriarchal social norms. CONCLUSION: Available evidence suggests that heightened prevalence of VAW is not attributable to a single risk factor. Multilayered and area-level risk analyses are needed to ensure funding is appropriately targeted for countries where VAW is most pervasive.

Surgery is a mainstay therapy unfortunately burdened by complications as severe postoperative pain. Regional anesthesia may play a role in a multimodal strategy for prevention and treatment of postoperative pain. The main purpose of this survey was to investigate the rate of use of regional anesthesia techniques in patients undergoing breast surgery in the Italian public hospital system. METHODS We designed an online survey that consisted of 22 questions investigating the anesthesia management of breast surgery, particularly focused on regional anesthesia. The survey lasted from November 18, 2019 to February 28, 2020. Directors of anesthesia departments of 168 Italian public health system hospitals were contacted and invited to forward the survey to every anesthesiologist in their unit. RESULTS A total of 935 anesthesiologists received the survey; among them 460 entered the final analysis. Regional anesthesia was not used by 44.6% of the anesthesiologists and lack of experience/training was the main cause (75.6%). Logistic regression models revealed that anesthesiologists with more than 15 years of experience (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.93) or working most of their days in intensive care unit (ICU) compared to operating theater (OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14-0.43) were less likely to perform regional anesthesia techniques. CONCLUSIONS Low implementation of regional anesthesia techniques in breast surgery emerges from our survey and the major reason cited is a lack of proper training. An improved training program in regional anesthesia, especially in residents' curricula, could be useful to increase its rate of use and to standardize its practice.","output":"Breast Regional Anesthesia Practice in the Italian Public Health System (BRA-SURVEY): A Survey-Based National Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biologically active interferon-, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of 3-week-old cesarian-derived colostrum-deprived pigs inoculated with H1N1 influenza virus.

The participants were randomly allocated into the control group (CG) and experimental group (EG) and completed pre-tests and post-tests of specific CS tests using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU). The CS was assessed by the bent knee fall out (BKFO), the active straight leg raise (ASLR) tests and the pelvic tilt test, all performed on the right and left sides. The EG (n = 23) performed an eight-week functional CST program based on rhythmic gymnastics (RG) technical requirements added to the traditional RG training sessions. Meanwhile, the CG (n = 22) received the traditional RG training sessions. Results: Mixed model analysis showed non-significant interaction effects; however, the ANOVA omnibus test showed a time effect (p < 0.05) in right BKFO (F(1,42) = 4.60; p = 0.038) and both pelvic tilt tests (right F(1,42) = 22.01, p < 0.001; left F(1,42) = 19.13, p < 0.001).

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges in the contexts both of older peoples' lives, wellbeing, and health, and also within prison settings, and thus it is timely to reflect on the links between older people, prisons, and cities, at a time of ongoing change. Just as there is an extensive body of ongoing research exploring age-friendly cities and communities, there is extensive published research on older people's experiences of imprisonment, and a growing body of research on ageing in the prison setting. However, these two research and policy fields have evolved largely independently and separately, leading to a lack of visibility of prisons and prisoners within AFCC research and policy and, similarly, the omission of consideration of the relevance of AFCC research and policy to older prisoners and ex-prisoners. Existing checklists and tools for assessing and measuring the age-friendliness of cities and communities may be of limited relevance in the context of prisons and prisoners.

The availability of high-resolution crystal structures of functionally essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including 3CLpro, supports the development of target-specific therapeutics. 3CLpro, the main protease responsible for the processing of viral polypeptide, plays a vital role in SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and translation and is an important target in other coronaviruses. Additionally, 3CLpro is the target of repurposed drugs, such as lopinavir and ritonavir. In this study, target proteins were retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB IDs: 6 M03, 6LU7, 2GZ7, 6 W63, 6SQS, 6YB7, and 6YVF) representing different open states of the main protease to accommodate macromolecular substrate. A hydroxyethylamine (HEA) library was constructed from harvested chemical structures from all the series being used in our laboratories for screening against malaria and Leishmania parasites. The database consisted of 1000 structure entries, of which 70% were new to ChemSpider at the time of screening. This in-house library was subjected to high throughput virtual screening (HTVS), followed by standard precision (SP) and then extra precision (XP) docking (Schrodinger LLC 2021). The ligand strain and complex energy of top hits were calculated by Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) method. Promising hit compounds (n = 40) specifically binding to 3CLpro with high energy and average MM/GBSA scores were then subjected to (100-ns) MD simulations. Using this sequential selection followed by an in-silico validation approach, we found a promising HEA-based compound (N,N'-((3S,3S)-piperazine-1,4-diylbis(3-hydroxy-1-phenylbutane-4,2-diyl))bis(2-(5-methyl-1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)-3-phenylpropanamide)), which showed high in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Further to reduce the size of the otherwise larger ligand, a pharmacophore-based predicted library of 42 derivatives was constructed, which were added to the previous compound library and rescreened virtually. Out of several hits from the predicted library, two compounds were synthesized, tested against SARS-CoV-2 culture, and found to have markedly improved antiviral activity.","output":"Antiviral evaluation of hydroxyethylamine analogs: Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro), a virtual screening and simulation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We draw on a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research on regulating fake news content during COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore this, we inspected, used, and replicated survey data from Pew Research Center and Statista, performing analyses and making estimates regarding finding reliable news and information for updates on COVID-19 and role of social media companies according to Internet users Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data and test the proposed conceptual model","output":"Regulating Fake News Content during COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence-based Reality, Trustworthy Sources, and Responsible Media Reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Much attention has been paid to developing methods capable of synchronous removal of pollutants from swine wastewater.

Here, the renal ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) was performed in Fc gamma receptor 2b deficient (Fcgr2b-/-) lupus mice and the in vitro experiments. At 24 h post-renal I/R injury, NETs in peripheral blood neutrophils and in kidneys were detected using myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE) and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), as well as kidney apoptosis (activating caspase-3), which were prominent in Fcgr2b-/- mice more compared to wild-type (WT). After 120 h renal-I/R injury, renal NETs (using MPO and NE) were non-detectable, whereas glomerular immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition and serum anti-dsDNA were increased in Fcgr2b-/- mice. These results imply that renal NETs at 24 h post-renal I/R exacerbated the lupus nephritis at 120 h post-renal I/R injury in Fcgr2b-/- lupus mice. Furthermore, a Syk inhibitor attenuated NETs, that activated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; a NETs activator) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a potent inflammatory stimulator), more prominently in Fcgr2b-/- neutrophils than the WT cells as determined by dsDNA, PAD4 and MPO. In addition, the inhibitors against Syk and PAD4 attenuated lupus characteristics (serum creatinine, proteinuria, and anti-dsDNA) in Fcgr2b-/- mice at 120 h post-renal I/R injury.

This paper studies how emojis, as non-verbal cues in online communications, can be used for such purposes and how the emotional signals in emoji usage can be used to predict future behavior of workers. In particular, we present how the developers on GitHub use emojis in their work-related activities. We show that developers have diverse patterns of emoji usage, which can be related to their working status including activity levels, types of work, types of communications, time management, and other behavioral patterns. Developers who use emojis in their posts are significantly less likely to dropout from the online work platform. Surprisingly, solely using emoji usage as features, standard machine learning models can predict future dropouts of developers at a satisfactory accuracy.

The aim of the present manuscript is to review the main relevant mechanisms possibly contributing to worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 in T2D. RESULTS: Poor glucose control, high glycaemic variability and diabetes-related comorbidities at baseline, particularly cardiovascular diseases and obesity, contribute in worsening the prognosis in the above-mentioned cluster of patients. Moreover, both a lower efficient innate immune system response and cytokine dysregulation predispose patients with T2D to impaired viral clearance and more serious pulmonary and systemic inflammation once the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. Inconclusive data are currently available for specifically indicate or contraindicate concurrent medications for managing T2D and its comorbidities in infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: T2D individuals should be considered as more vulnerable to COVID-19 than general population, and thus require adequate advices about hygienic tips to protect themselves during the pandemic. A careful management of glucose levels and diabetes-related comorbidities remains essential for avoiding further complications, and patient monitoring during the pandemic should be performed also at distance by means of telemedicine.

Our previous study showed that the non-structural (NS) protein 1 (NS1) is the essential factor for RO creation by hydrophobic insertion into the ER membrane. Here, we found that the association of NS1 with the membrane can be facilitated by the electrostatic interaction between NS1 and negatively charged lipids. NS1 binds to a series of negatively charged lipids, including PI4P, and a positively charged residue, R31, located on the membrane-binding face of NS1, plays important roles in this interaction. The NS1 R31E mutation significantly impairs NS1 association with negatively charged membrane and its ER remodeling ability in the cells. To interfere with the electrostatic interaction between NS1 and negatively charged lipids, intracellular phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) level was downregulated by the overexpression of Sac1 or treatment with PI3K and PI4K inhibitors to attenuate flavivirus replication.

The elderly and persons with chronic diseases are especially vulnerable to health problems due to heat. This article is devoted to the question of the extent to which the effects of heat waves in Germany are changing over time, and whether preventive health measures are working. METHODS We use a statistical model to quantify the effect of high mean temperatures on mortality. Within this model, different exposure-response curves for the three temporal intervals 1992-2000, 2001-2010, and 2011-2017 are estimated. Attention is also paid to the delayed effect on mortality of high mean temperatures in the preceding week. RESULTS Our analysis reveals a clear, systematic association of the mean temperature in the current week, as well as the mean temperature in the preceding week, with weekly mortality. This association is more pronounced for higher age groups and decreases over the years under analysis, with the exception of a relatively weak effect of heat in southern Germany in 1992-2000. The strongest effects were related to the heat waves in 1994 and 2003, with approximately 10 200 and 9600 fatalities, respectively. Approximately 7800 fatalities were estimated for the summer of 2006, and 4700 and 5200 for 2010 and 2015, respectively. CONCLUSION In Germany, as elsewhere, climate change has been causing more frequent, more intense, and longer periods of heat in the summer.

Objective: To estimate incremental costs per day of hospitalization for a patient with influenza or viral pneumonia, as a proxy for COVID-19; ICU costs associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) were also determined. Methods: Retrospective analysis of claims-based data was conducted using the IBM MarketScan? Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Care and the Medicare Fee-for-Service claims databases for hospitalizations due to influenza/viral pneumonia between January 2018 and June 2019. Cases were stratified as uncomplicated hospitalizations or with ICU. Ordinary least squares regression, excluding LOS or costs exceeding the 99th percentile (base case), was used to estimate incremental costs per day; a sensitivity analysis included all qualified hospitalizations. Additional sensitivity analyses used weighting methodology. Results: Among 6055 and 118,419 hospitalizations in the commercially insured and Medicare databases, respectively, 5958 and 116,552 hospitalizations, respectively, represented the base case. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional inpatient day were $2158 and $3900 in the commercial population for uncomplicated hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU, respectively, and $475 and $668, respectively in the Medicare population. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional ICU day were $5254 and $608 for Commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. Higher absolute costs were estimated in the sensitivity analysis on all qualified hospitalizations; the weighted sensitivity analyses generally showed that estimates were stable. Use of iMV increased costs by $35,482 and $13,101 in the commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. Conclusion: The incremental daily cost of a hospitalization is substantial for US patients with commercial insurance and for Medicare patients. These findings may help quantify the economic value of COVID-19 treatments that reduce LOS.","output":"Incremental Costs Associated with Length of Hospitalization Due to Viral Pneumonia: Impact of Intensive Care and Economic Implications of Reducing the Length of Stay in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses have a unique place in redesigning the future of healthcare, particularly after experiencing health policy failures with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Nurses consistently outperform other professions to enjoy a decades\\\\long reputation as the most trusted profession. Nevertheless, the nursing voice is missing at a public level; representation in governments and boardrooms negligible. While nurses carry out health policy, rarely are they involved informing policy. While substantial dialog on health system reform, regulatory changes, care coordination, and health information technology occurs, nursing's presence is absent. The barriers are many: a lack of political sophistication, family, and work demands limiting time, and a lack of confidence.

When the majority of the family members are working online, the bitrate experienced by the average user may drop, especially if some members have to work in rooms that suffer from weak coverage. Benefiting from the emerging concept of Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), the network coverage in our houses can be greatly improved. This paper presents a study of an RIS-assisted system for an indoor scenario operating at 2.4GHz. We propose an RIS placement approach that is based on minimizing the pathloss of the channel, to enhance the rate of bad coverage rooms, while taking into consideration their user occupancies. The proposed approach, which we refer to as the Weighted RIS Placement, is modeled and simulated for a single RIS. The problem is then extended to a two-RIS scenario. Our results show that the Weighted RIS placement provides significant rate gains. Also, this is the first work that models the communication channels for the individual rooms, using corresponding Rician K-factor values that reflect the indoor layout. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Using Reflective Intelligent Surfaces for Indoor Scenarios: Channel Modeling and RIS Placement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable livelihood ensures proper human development providing with the basic necessities of everyday life. India is a country of multi-ethnic groups having more than 500 tribal communities along with different religious groups. Among these tribal groups more than 80% people live in different forest environment. Forest environment-based tribal communities fulfil most of their basic needs from the surrounds. In general, these tribal people preserve good notions of health among them as per their perceptions. Overtime they are facing crisis due to non-sustainability of production, consumption and uses of forest goods. Bestowing to the welfare approach adopted since independence for the tribal communities, a special human value loaded attitude is shown to them for shielding their human rights, however, protection of their rights in nature has continuously being ignored. However, sustainable development helps to preserve the natural resources from the environment for its economic growth and social viability from present generation to future generation. To be more precise, the tribals are the sources of the indigenous knowledge of the medicinal plants used for healing and curing diseases for better living and solving problems of day to day life. Therefore, medicinal plants should be protected and be used by them for sustaining their rights as humans. In this article, by emphasizing on the significance of the sustainability of medicinal plants and its importance in tribal life, the authors focus on an alternative development method which can improve the social environment in general and the tribal development in particular.","output":"Tribal Health and Sustainable Development: Traditional Knowledge Practice and Medicinal Plant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a new technique for rapid modeling and construction of scientifically accurate mesoscale biological models.

Our new technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we learn statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, spatial properties and distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in 3D model construction. Once all imaging evidence is incorporated in the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, their distances and orientations to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization and modeling feedback loop. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle ultrastructure.

Few cases of pericarditis in COVID-19 infection were reported. Case: A 55-year-old Hispanic male with recent flu-like symptoms presented with abdominal pain. CT abdomen showed large pericardial effusion with 4cm thickness. An inferior echo showed effusion without signs of tamponade. He was discharged with NSAID and diuretics. Eleven days later, he returned with worsening dyspnea due to bilateral pulmonary emboli. Repeat echo significant for right atrial and ventricular collapse. Emergent pericardial window was performed with 1.2L dark bloody pericardial fluid was drained. Fluid cytology and cultures were negative. Cell analysis suggested transudative effusion. SARS-COVID-19 IgG antibody was positive. The etiology of the effusions is likely to be viral pleuropericarditis from recent COVID-19 infection. Decision-making: Multiple case reports had been published showing a high risk for pericardial effusion to convert into tamponade requiring emergent intervention. There has also been a higher risk for biventricular failure on COVID-19 patients.

Despite the studies done in different laboratory stages, some adverse drug reactions are recognized after being released, such as Rosiglitazone. Due to such experiences, pharmacists are now more interested in using computational methods to predict adverse drug reactions. In computational methods, finding and representing appropriate drug and adverse reaction features are one of the most critical challenges. Here, we assess fingerprint and target as drug features; and phenotype and unified medical language system as adverse reaction features to predict adverse drug reaction. Meanwhile, we show that drug and adverse reaction features represented by similarity vectors can improve adverse drug prediction. In this regard, we propose four frameworks. Two frameworks are based on random forest classification and neural networks as machine learning methods called F_RF and F_NN, respectively. The rest of them improve two state-of-art matrix factorization models, CS and TMF, by considering target as a drug feature and phenotype as an adverse reaction feature. However, machine learning frameworks with fewer drug and adverse reaction features are more accurate than matrix factorization frameworks. In addition, the F_RF framework performs significantly better than F_NN with ACC = %89.15, AUC = %96.14 and AUPRC = %92.9. Next, we contrast F_RF with some well-known models designed based on similarity vectors of drug and adverse reaction features. Unlike other methods, we do not remove rare reactions from the data set in our frameworks.

Methods: In September 2020, Public Health England (PHE) recruited staff and students in secondary schools to provide nasal swabs, oral fluid and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody testing. Students aged 11-18 years in five London schools completed a short questionnaire about their perception of the pandemic, returning to school, risk to themselves and to others and infection control measures, and participating in school testing. Results: A questionnaire was completed by 64% (297/462) participants. Students were generally not anxious at all (19.7%;58/294) or not really anxious (40.0%, 114/295) about returning to school, although 5.4% (n=16/295) were extremely nervous. Most students were very worried about transmitting the virus to their family (60.2%;177/294) rather than other students (22.0%;65/296) or school staff (19.3%;57/296), or catching the infection themselves (12.5%;37/296). Students better maintained physical distancing in the presence of school staff (84.6%;247/292) and in public places (79.5%;233/293) but not when with other students (46.8%;137/293) or friends (40.8%;120/294). A greater proportion of younger students (school years 7-9) reported not being anxious at all than 16-18 year olds (47/174 [27.0%] vs 3/63 [4.8%];p=0.001). They were also less likely to adhere to physical distancing and wearing face masks. Most students reported positive experiences with testing in schools, with 92.3% (262/284) agreeing to have another blood test in future visits.Conclusions: Younger students were less concerned about catching and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 and were less likely to adhere to protective measures. Greater awareness of the potential risks of COVID-19 transmission between secondary school students potentially leading to increased risk of infection in their teachers and their household members may increase adherence to infection control measures within and outside schools.","output":"Perceptions of Adolescents on the COVID-19 Pandemic and Returning to School: Qualitative Questionnaire Survey, England 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has resulted in substantial healthcare resource consumption. Since patients hospital length of stay (LoS) is at stake in the process, an investigation of COVID-19 patients LoS and its risk factors becomes urgent for a better understanding of regional capabilities to cope with COVID-19 outbreaks. METHODS: First, we obtained retrospective data of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Sichuan province via National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and field surveys, including their demographic, epidemiological, clinical characteristics and LoS. Then we estimated the relationship between LoS and the possibly determinant factors, including demographic characteristics of confirmed patients, individual treatment behavior, local medical resources and hospital grade. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox Proportional Hazards Model were applied for single factor and multi-factor survival analysis. RESULTS: From January 16, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 538 human cases of COVID-19 infection were laboratory-confirmed, and were hospitalized for treatment, including 271 (50%) patients aged  45, 285 (53%) males, and 450 patients (84%) with mild symptoms. The median LoS was 19 (interquartile range (IQR): 14C23, range: 3C41) days. Univariate analysis showed that age and clinical grade were strongly related to LoS (P<0.01). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that the longer LoS was associated with those aged  45 (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60C0.91), admission to provincial hospital (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54C0.99), and severe illness (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48C0.90). By contrast, the shorter LoS was linked with residential areas with more than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1,000 population (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05C1.65). Neither gender factor nor time interval from illness onset to diagnosis showed significant impact on LoS. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding COVID-19 patients hospital LoS and its risk factors is critical for governments efficient allocation of resources in respective regions. In areas with older and more vulnerable population and in want of primary medical resources, early reserving and strengthening of the construction of multi-level medical institutions are strongly suggested to cope with COVID-19 outbreaks.","output":"What are the risk factors of hospital length of stay in the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) patients?

The ability to predict the progress of this pandemic has been crucial for decision making aimed at fighting this pandemic and controlling its spread. In this work we considered four different statistical/time series models that are readily available from the forecast package in R. We performed novel applications with these models, forecasting the number of infected cases (confirmed cases and similarly the number of deaths and recovery) along with the corresponding 90% prediction interval to estimate uncertainty around pointwise forecasts. Since the future may not repeat the past for this pandemic, no prediction model is certain. However, any prediction tool with acceptable prediction performance (or prediction error) could still be very useful for public-health planning to handle spread of the pandemic, and could policy decision-making and facilitate transition to normality. These four models were applied to publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemic for both the USA and Italy. We observed that all models reasonably predicted the future numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. However, for the majority of the analyses, the time series model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and cubic smoothing spline models both had smaller prediction errors and narrower prediction intervals, compared to the Holt and Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation (TBATS) models. Therefore, the former two models were preferable to the latter models. Given similarities in performance of the models in the USA and Italy, the corresponding prediction tools can be applied to other countries grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to any pandemics that can occur in future.","output":"Forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries: Revisiting established time series modeling through novel applications for the USA and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory infections with RNA viruses, such as rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, are a major cause of asthma exacerbation, accompanied by enhanced neutrophilic and/or eosinophilic inflammation of the airways. We studied the effects of dsRNA synthesized during RNA virus replication, and of its receptor, TLR3, on the synthesis of eosinophilic chemokines in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMC). Synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic-cystidic acid (poly(I:C)), induced the synthesis of eosinophilic chemokines, eotaxin-1/CCL11 and RANTES/CCL5, from primary cultures of human BSMC, and IL-4 increased synergistically the synthesis of poly(I:C)-induced CCL11. A robust eosinophil chemotactic activity was released from BSMC stimulated with poly(I:C) and IL-4, which was mostly inhibited by preincubation with an anti-CCL11, but not with an anti-CCL5 Ab. Although the immunoreactivity of TLR3 was detectable on the cellular surface of BSMC by flow cytometric analysis, pretreatment with an anti-TLR3-neutralizing Ab failed to block the poly(I:C)-induced synthesis of CCL11. We have determined by confocal laser-scanning microscopy that the immunoreactivity of TLR3 was aggregated intracellularly in poly(I:C)-stimulated BSMC, colocalizing with fluorescein-labeled poly(I:C). The synthesis of CCL11 was prominently inhibited by the transfection of TLR3-specific small interfering RNA or by bafilomycin A1, an endosomal acidification inhibitor, further supporting the essential role played by intracellular TLR3 in the synthesis of poly(I:C)-induced CCL11 in BSMC. In conclusion, these observations suggest that, by activating intracellular TLR3 in BSMC, respiratory RNA virus infections stimulate the production of CCL11 and enhance eosinophilic inflammation of the airways in the Th2-dominant microenvironment.","output":"TLR3-mediated synthesis and release of eotaxin-1/CCL11 from human bronchial smooth muscle cells stimulated with double-stranded RNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy is an important mechanism for organisms to eliminate viruses and other intracellular pathogens.

But the role of autophagy in Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus (SCRV) infection is not clearly understood. In this study, we identified that SCRV infection triggered autophagy in CPB cells, which was demonstrated by the appearance of the membrane vesicles, GFP-LC3 punctuate pattern, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and the co-localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes. The changes of autophagy flux in SCRV infection indicated that autophagy was inhibited at the early stage of SCRV infection, but was promoted at the late stage. UV-inactivated SCRV can induce autophagy, suggesting that SCRV replication is not essential for the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, we found inducing autophagy with Rapa inhibited SCRV proliferation, but inhibiting autophagy with 3-MA or CQ increased SCRV production in CPB cells. Then we assessed the effects of PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway on SCRV induced autophagy. We found that SCRV infection activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway at 4 hpi, but inhibited it at 8 hpi. SCRV-N mRNA and protein level were decreased by inhibiting PI3K with LY294002, but increased by activating PI3K with 740YCP.

After the analysis of gut microbial profile in zebrafish male and female at three-month age, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria dominated the main composition of zebrafish intestinal microflora. However, the relative richness of them was different base on gender variance. Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. belonging to Proteobacteria phylum of bacteria were isolated from zebrafish gut, and their potential capacities to trigger innate immunity were investigated. In gut microbiota absence, the expression levels of the innate immunity genes in the GF group were not significantly changed compared to the CV group.

Four different fibers were developed by varying the concentrations of Aloe vera (0.5%, 1.5%, 2.5%, and 3%) while maintaining the concentration of PVA constant. The developed samples were subjected to different characterization techniques such as SEM, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and ICP studies. After that, the antimicrobial activity of the developed Aloe Vera/PVA electrospun nanofibers was checked against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. The developed nanofibers had high profile antibacterial activity against both bacteria, but showed excellent results against S. aureus bacteria as compared with E. coli. These nanofibers have potential applications in the development of surgical gowns, gloves, etc.","output":"Fabrication of Promising Antimicrobial Aloe Vera/PVA Electrospun Nanofibers for Protective Clothing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most evidential behavioral results for two memory processes comes from Gardiner and Java (Memory & Cognition, 18, 23C30 1990).

The patient started with a febrile headache that progressed to impaired consciousness after 20 days, and she finally died after treatment with vancomycin combined with rifampicin. C. cellulans was isolated from her blood cultures for 3 consecutive days after her admission; however, there was only evidence of C. cellulans sequences for two samples in the second-generation sequencing data generated from her peripheral blood, which were ignored by the technicians.

Alveolar fluid clearance is required for recovery and effective gas exchange, and higher rates of AFC are associated with reduced mortality. Thyroid hormones play multiple roles in lung function, and L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) has multiple effects on lung AT2 cells. T3 enhances AFC in normal adult rat lungs when administered intramuscularly and in normal or hypoxia-injured lungs when given intratracheally. The safety of a commercially available formulation of liothyronine sodium (synthetic T3) administered intratracheally was assessed in an IND-enabling toxicology study in healthy rats. Instillation of the commercial formulation of T3 without modification rapidly caused tracheal injury and often mortality. Intratracheal instillation of T3 that was reformulated and brought to a neutral pH at the maximum feasible dose of 2.73 g T3 in 300 L for five consecutive days had no clinically relevant T3-related adverse clinical, histopathologic or clinical pathology findings. There were no unscheduled deaths that could be attributed to the reformulated T3 or control articles, no differences in the lung weights, and no macroscopic or microscopic findings considered to be related to treatment with T3. This preclinical safety study has paved the way for a phase I/II study to determine the safety and tolerability of a T3 formulation delivered into the lungs of ARDS patients, including COVID-19-asssociated ARDS, and to measure the effect on extra-vascular lung water in these patients Significance Statement There is growing interest in treating lung disease with thyroid hormone (T3) in pulmonary edema and ARDS. However, there is not any published experience on the impact of direct administration of T3 into the lung. An essential step is to determine the and safety of multiple doses of T3 administered in a relevant animal species.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide are known to have an increased risk of contracting the disease within the working environment and, therefore, the seroprevalence in this population is of particular interest. We thus aimed to analyse SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody dynamics in Vorarlberg HCWs. DESIGN Prospective cohort study of HCWs including testing at three different time points for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). SETTING All five state hospitals of Vorarlberg. PARTICIPANTS A total of 395 HCWs, enrolled in June 2020 (time point 1 (t1)), 2 months after the end of the first wave, retested between October and November at the beginning of the second wave (time point 2 (t2)) and again at the downturn of the second wave in January 2021 (time point 3 (t3)). MAIN OUTCOMES We assessed weak and strong seropositivity and associated factors, including demographic and clinical characteristics, symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, infections verified by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and vaccinations. RESULTS At t1, 3% of HCWs showed strong IgG-specific responses to either NP or RBD. At t2, the rate had increased to 4%, and at t3 to 14%. A strong response was found to be stable for up to 10 months. Overall, only 55% of seropositive specimen had antibodies against both antigens RBD and NP; 29% had only RBD-specific and 16% only NP-specific antibodies. Compared with the number of infections found by RT-PCR, the number of HCWs being seropositive was 38% higher. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Serological testing based on only one antigen implicates the risk of missing infections; thus, the set of antigens should be broadened in the future. The seroprevalence among participating HCWs was comparable to the general population in Austria. Nevertheless, in view of undetected infections, monitoring and surveillance should be reconsidered.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific and NP-specific antibody response of healthcare workers in the westernmost Austrian state Vorarlberg: a prospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied the lung-protective effect and mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of ultra-short-wave diathermy (USWD) in a rat model of LPS-induced acute lung injury.

But what does clear communication look like if the evidence keeps changing? Along with the known problems of fake news, disengagement and science scepticism, there is the problem of scientists presenting conflicting views on the same topic. Alternatively, changing evidence can lead to scientists saying something but, in the light of new evidence, revising their conclusions and the scientific message. In the case of COVID-19, the lack of clear scientific messaging in the early days of the pandemic opened the debate to politics and culture, lowering trust in science and politicizing mitigation measures such as mask wearing.

Design: A systematic review of published and grey literature following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligibility Criteria for study selection: Global research reporting the use of social media by migrants and/or ethnic minority groups in relation to COVID-19. Data extraction: We extracted data on key outcomes, study design, country, population under study, and sample size. Results: 1849 unique records were screened, and 21 data sources included in our analysis involving migrant and ethnic minority populations in the UK, US, China, Jordan, Qatar, and Turkey. We found evidence of consistent use of a range of social media platforms for COVID-19 information in some migrant and ethnic minority populations (including WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube), which may stem from difficulty in accessing COVID-19 information in their native languages or from trusted sources. There were positive and negative associations with social media use reported, with some evidence suggesting circulating misinformation and social media use may be associated with lower participation in preventative health measures, including vaccine intent and uptake, findings of which are likely relevant to multiple population groups. Conclusions: Social media platforms are an important source of information about COVID-19 for some migrant and ethnic minority populations. Urgent actions and further research are now needed to better understand the use of social media platforms for accessing health information by different population groups - particularly groups who are marginalised from health systems - effective approaches to tackling circulating misinformation, and to seize on opportunities to make better use of social media platforms to support public health communication and improve vaccine uptake.

METHODS: All patients over 28 days old testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and September 30, 2020, were retrospectively identified and characterized through electronic analysis at Stanford. A sub-cohort was followed prospectively to evaluate long-term COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: 168,190 patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 6,976 (4.15%) tested positive. In a multivariate analysis, asthma was not an independent risk factor for hospitalization (OR 1.12 [95% CI 0.86, 1.45], p = .40). Among SARS-CoV-2-positive asthmatics, allergic asthma lowered the risk of hospitalization and had a protective effect compared with non-allergic asthma (OR 0.52 [0.28, 0.91], p = .026); there was no association between baseline medication use as characterized by GINA and hospitalization risk. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease had lower eosinophil levels during hospitalization compared with patients with mild or asymptomatic disease, independent of asthma status (p = .0014). In a patient sub-cohort followed longitudinally, asthmatics and non-asthmatics had similar time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms, particularly lower respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is not a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease. Allergic asthmatics were half as likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with non-allergic asthmatics. Lower levels of eosinophil counts (allergic biomarkers) were associated with a more severe COVID-19 disease trajectory.

This case report presents a patient who came in with non-specific symptoms and generalized lymphadenopathy with a diagnosis of cryptococcus with pleuroscopy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47 year old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and previous COVID 19 infection presents with weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy and shortness of breath to a tertiary care center. Initial work up including chest imaging showed a right sided pleural effusion. Further imaging via computed tomography of the chest showed a free flowing moderate to large pleural effusion and right sided pleural thickening. This effusion was drained without complication, which showed an exudative etiology. Cultures and cytology from the pleural fluid showed were non diagnostic. Although the patient had a comprehensive infectious work up, and biopsy of a lymph node, both were non diagnostic for an infectious or malignant etiology. A pleuroscopy was performed, which showed multiple white deposits along the inferior portion of the right lung and the diaphragm, which were biopsied. These biopsies grew cryptococcus neoformans, with further history correlating with cave exploration and exposure to endemic fungi. DISCUSSION: Cryptococcus grows readily in soil contaminated with bird excretions, and is transmitted via inhalation of the contaminated aerosol. Here, we presented a rare case of Cryptococcal infection diagnosed via pleuroscopy and pleural biopsy. The patient had blood cultures, respiratory cultures, gram stain, along with culture data from pleural fluid which showed no growth. Furthermore, the patient also had testing via Cryptococcal antigen, which was negative. The patient had no known immunodeficiency condition such as HIV, diabetes, renal failure, liver failure, use of steroids, or other immunosuppressive drugs. Furthermore, the patient had excisional lymph node biopsies which ruled out malignancy. The aim of this report is to utilize pleuroscopy and pleural biopsy in those patients with a high likelihood of an infectious etiology with pleural disease. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal meningitis should be a diagnostic consideration even when dealing with meningitis in immunocompetent patients. Cryptococcal antigen test can help us clinch the diagnosis in time though culture would be a better diagnostic tool if available. However, in the setting of this test being negative, and other non diagnostic infectious work up, biopsy of the pleura involved can aid in the diagnosis of a fungal infection if the likelihood is high.

Considering the recent role out of Covid-19 vaccine's to the general public there is a growing concern of COVID-19 related myocarditis being linked to the vaccine. Here we present a case of a young patient who presented with symptoms of COVID-19 after his second shot of COVID-19 vaccine, with subsequent development of myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: This patient is a 21 year old male with past medical history significant of mitral valve prolapse, and resting tachycardia, presented with a 2 day history of fevers, nausea, accompanied by shortness of breath, and chest pain. Patient had his 2nd shot of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine 3 days prior to admission, symptom onset was after the administration of vaccine. Vitals on admissionm were within normal limits, EKG did not show any acute ischemic changes, no evidence pericarditis and or pulmonary embolism related changes. Troponins were trended, 460, 637, 832, significant for acute myocardial injury but with no evidence of MI based on character of chest pain and EKG changes. 2D echocardiogram showed Left Ventricular (LV) Ejection Fraction of 43%, with mildly reduced LV systolic function. CTA chest with IV contrast showed no aortic dissection., or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac MRI showed findings suggestive of acute myocarditis. Patient was treated symptomatically, troponins trended down, with resolution of chest pain. DISCUSSION: Myocarditis associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, is a potential rare side effect. Even though a casual link has not been established. Considering the sequence of events for this patient, there is potentially a link between the two. Recently there have been 62 cases in Israel diagnosed after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, incidentally most of these cases were in individuals under the age of 30, coinciding with our case. Investigations will be needed to determine what is making the younger population more prone to myocarditis after receiving the covid 19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis has been associated with COVID-19 infection. But the link with Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is less established, with few cases providing a causal link. Recent studies have started to link the two, but further investigations are necessary to better understand the causal link, and what propogates the younger population to develop myocarditis after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine.

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly impacted PR programs and their delivery to patients. Owing to fears of viral transmission and resultant outbreaks of COVID-19, institution-based PR programs have been forced to significantly reduce enrolment or in some cases completely shut down during the pandemic. As a majority of COPD patients are elderly and have multiple co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, they are notably susceptible to severe complications of COVID-19. As such, patients have been advised to stay at home and avoid social contact to the maximum extent possible. This has increased patients' vulnerability to physical deconditioning, depression, and social isolation. To address this major gap in care, some traditional hospital or clinic-centered PR programs have converted some or all of their learning contents to home-based telerehabilitation during the pandemic. There are, however, some significant barriers to this approach that have impeded its implementation in the community. These include variable access and use of technology (by patients), a lack of standardization of methods and tools for evaluation of the program, and inadequate training and resources for health professionals in optimally delivering telerehabilitation to patients. There is a pressing need for high-quality studies on these modalities of PR to enable the successful implementation of PR at home and via teleconferencing technologies.

Continuous evolution and emergence of new variants of this virus are the major challenges for controlling the disease with routine vaccination. Successful vaccination usually requires the use of a homologous vaccine, which in turn necessitates continuous investigation of the circulating strains. Herein, we performed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction- (RT-PCR-) based investigation in broiler chicken flocks of the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. IBV was detected in 36.5% of the tested flocks (42 out of 115) from January 2012 to March 2014. Direct sequencing of hypervariable region-3 (HVR-3) of the Spike (S)-1 gene was performed, followed by phylogenetic analysis to determine the circulating IBV genotypes. Four lineages appear to coexist in this region, including the GI-13 or 4/91 IBV (31%), GI-16 or CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV (28.6%), GI-1 or Mass IBV (19%), and GI-23 or Middle East IBV (21.4%).

Based on the spatial scan statistic, the cylindrical scan method is a widely used spaceCtime cluster detection method. This method enables concurrent detection of the location and time of a cluster occurrence. However, this method cannot capture spatial changes in a cluster over time. When applying the existing method to a cluster whose shape changes over time, the number of calculations required becomes extremely large, and the analysis may become difficult.

The P272L mutation in SARS-Cov-2 S-protein is known to be highly relevant to the viral escape associated with the second pandemic wave in Europe. Epitope-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition is a key factor in determining the T-cell immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Although several data-driven methods for predicting epitope-specific TCR recognition have been proposed, they remain challenging owing to the enormous diversity of TCRs and the lack of available training data. Self-supervised transfer learning has recently been demonstrated to be powerful for extracting useful information from unlabeled protein sequences and increasing the predictive performance of the fine-tuned models in downstream tasks. Here, we present a predictive model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), employing self-supervised transfer learning, to predict SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitope-specific TCR recognition. The fine-tuned model showed notably high predictive performance for independent evaluation using the SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCR CDR3 sequence datasets. In particular, we found the proline at position 4 corresponding to the P272L mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein269-277 epitope (YLQPRTFLL) may contribute substantially to TCR recognition of the epitope through interpreting the output attention weights of our model.

Medical records were used to evaluate demographics, inflammatory markers, imaging, severity, management, histology, length of stay (LOS), complications and 90-day outcomes. RESULTS: There were 149 and 125 patients in the 2019 and 2020 cohort, respectively. 14 patients (9.4%) had NOM in 2019 versus 31 patients (24.8%) in 2020 (p = 0.001). In the 2019 OM group 125 patients (92.6%) had laparoscopic appendicectomy versus 69 (73.4%) in 2020. 59 patients (39.6%) had a CT in 2019 versus 70 (56%) in 2020. The median LOS was 4 days (interquartile range (IQR) 3 to 6 days) in 2019 and 3 days (IQR 2 to 5 days) in 2020 (p = 0.03). Two patients in each year who received NOM had treatment failure (14.3% in 2019 and 6.5% in 2020). Three patients in 2019 who had OM had treatment failure (2.2%). Of 95 patients tested for COVID-19 all but one was negative. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was no observed increase in severity of AA, patients had a shorter LOS and were more likely to have imaging. NOM proportionally increased with no observed change in outcomes.","output":"P61 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and management of acute appendicitis: a single-centre analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020 resulted in a spike in the demand for face masks and respirators. Due to their effectiveness at filtering aerosols that could potentially contain viruses, the N95-type filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are frequently used by healthcare workers and first responders. However, due to a shortage of domestic N95 FFRs in the US at the beginning of the pandemic, internationally produced respirators were imported and deployed under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. Due to concerns raised at the time, there was an urgent need to verify their effectiveness and usability. In this study, we summarize our characterization of the nanoparticulate filtration performances of 136 such respirators, measured between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Our results indicate that about 42% of the respirators showed filtration efficiencies better than 90% (10% penetration), but only 17% performed better than 95% (5% penetration). On the other hand, about 35% showed filtration efficiencies below 80% (20% penetration). A representative subset of devices was analyzed for the origin of such variations in filtration performance. We found that filtration efficiency increased with the level of electrostatic charge on the FFRs and that the poor performance of the internationally sourced FFRs could be traced to a lack of electrostatic filtration mechanisms. Furthermore, electrostatics shifted the particle size at which aerosol penetration through the FFR was maximal from around 200 nm to less than 100 nm for the highest-performing FFRs, a size range that largely goes undetected in standardized tests. ? 2021 American Chemical Society.","output":"Examination of Nanoparticle Filtration by Filtering Facepiece Respirators during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Binding of calcium ion to calcium-binding proteins (CBP) triggers a large number of biological processes in a cell. CBP are known to play important roles in various diseases, such as cancer, alzheimer, and neuronal problems. However, the calculation of the binding affinity of calcium ion to CBP still possesses a significant challenge to the computational investigators. One of the main reasons for this difficulty is the polarization of CBP due to the binding of calcium. In the current work, we have used the implicit polarization method of Leontyev et al. (PCCP, 13.7 (2011): 2613-2626) to calculate the binding free energy of calcium ion binding to calmodulin, an important CBP. We have used the widely used MM-PBSA method to find a good protocol of calculation with implicit polarization. We have also optimized the best value of the calcium radius to match the experimental results. Our results show incorporation of polarization improves the agreement between the calculated and experimental results, although still, some discrepancy remains. On the whole, this work shows implicit polarization when combined with the MM-PBSA method can give results better than calculation without any polarization, and further improvement is necessary to get a quantitative match with experiments.

Methods: All consenting HCWs were invited to have their circulating IgG levels measured before vaccination and at 6 subsequent timepoints. All HCWs with suspected COVID-19 were PCR tested. We described trends in circulating IgG geometric mean concentration by age, ethnicity, timing of boosting and previous infection status and compared strata using Kruskall-Wallis tests. Results: Among 985 vaccinated HCWs. IgG titres gradually decreased in all groups over the study duration. Younger or previously infected individuals had higher initial IgG levels (p<0.001 in both cases); differences substantially decreased or disappeared at 7-9 months, before boosting. Pre-infection IgG levels in infected participants were similar to levels measured at the same timepoint in HCWs who remained uninfected (p>0.3). IgG GMC in those boosted 6-7 months after dose 2 was lower compared with those boosted 8-9 months after (1999-vs 2736, p=0.02). Conclusions: Immunity waned 6 months post-priming in all age groups and in previously infected individuals, reversed by boosting. IgG titres decrease among previously infected individuals and the proportion of reinfected individuals in this group, comparable to the proportion of breakthrough infection in previously uninfected individuals suggests individuals with hybrid immunity (infection+vaccination) may also require further doses.

Proteasome inhibitors, such as ixazomib, impact multiple aspects of HIV biology including latency, transcription initiation, viral replication, and infected cell killing through the HIV protease C Casp8p41 pathway, resulting in latency reversal and reduced measures of HIV reservoir size ex vivo. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1b/2a dose escalating, open label trial of weekly oral ixazomib for 24 weeks in antiretroviral (ART)-suppressed, HIV positive adults (NCT02946047). The study was conducted from March 2017 to August 2019 at two tertiary referral centers in the United States. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability of oral ixazomib. Secondary outcomes included changes in immunologic markers and estimates of HIV reservoir size after ixazomib treatment. FINDINGS: Sixteen participants completed the study. Ixazomib up to 4mg weekly was safe and well-tolerated, yielding no treatment-emergent events above grade 1. In exploratory analyses, ixazomib treatment was associated with detectable viremia that was below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) in 9 participants, and viremia that was above LLQ in 4 of 16 participants. While treatment was associated with reduced CD4 counts [baseline 783 cells/ mm(3) vs. week-24 724 cells/ mm(3) p=0.003], there were no changes in markers of cellular activation, exhaustion or inflammation. Total HIV DNA and proviral sequencing were not altered by ixazomib treatment. Intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) identified intact proviruses in 14 patients pre-treatment, and in 10/14 of those subjects post treatment values were reduced (P=0.068), allowing a calculated intact proviral half life of 0.6 years (95% CI 0.3, 2.5), compared to 7.1 years (95% CI 3.9, 18, p=0.004) in historical controls. Differentiation Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assays (dQVOA) identified measurable proviruses in 15 subjects pre-treatment; post-treatment values were numerically reduced in 9, but overall differences were not significantly different. INTERPRETATION: Our study successfully met its primary endpoint of demonstrating the safety of ixazomib for 24 weeks in HIV infected persons. Exploratory analyses suggest that the effects observed ex vivo of latency reversal and reductions in HIV reservoir size, also occur in vivo. Future controlled studies of ixazomib are warranted.

The aim of this study, was to retrospectively examine the presence and the role of EV109 in respiratory samples from two patients populations; infants below the age of 2 years, hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. RESULTS: A total of 1149 nasopharingeal aspirates were collected and tested for the presence of EV109 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). In positive samples, the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated. Samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for EV109 RNA (0.2%) and belonged to patients with lower ARDs; co-infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases. In transplant recipients, one out of the 175 samples analyzed, from a patients with upper respiratory simptoms tested positive for HEV 109 in the absence of co-infecting viruses. Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic regions, showed only a few nucleotide differences when compared with the Nicaraguan strains. CONCLUSIONS: Overall these results indicate that HEV109 variants have circulated and differentiated in different lineages worldwide. Although more cases and larger studies are needed, HEV109 infection may be associated to ARDs both in infants and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients.

METHODS: The training workloads and heart rate variability (assessed through the log-transformed root mean square of successive R-R intervals) of 7 elite badminton players were registered daily during 4 weeks of normal training (baseline), 7 to 10 weeks of lockdown, and 6 to 8 weeks of retraining. Physical performance was assessed at baseline and after each phase by means of a countermovement jump and the estimated squat 1-repetition maximum. RESULTS: A reduction in training workloads was observed in all participants during the lockdown (-63.7%), which was accompanied by a reduced heart rate variability in all but one participant (-2.0%). A significant reduction was also observed for countermovement jump (-6.5%) and 1-repetition maximum performance (-11.5%), which decreased in all but one participant after the lockdown. However, after the retraining phase, all measures returned to similar values to those found at baseline. At the individual level, there were divergent responses, as exemplified by one athlete who attenuated the reduction in training workloads and increased her performance during the lockdown and another one who markedly reduced his workload and performance, and got injured during the retraining phase. CONCLUSIONS: Although there seems to be a large interindividual variability, COVID-19 lockdown is likely to impose negative consequences on elite athletes, but these detrimental effects might be avoided by attenuating reductions in training workloads and seem to be overall recovered after 6 to 8 weeks of retraining.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown and a Subsequent Retraining Period on Elite Athletes' Workload, Performance, and Autonomic Responses: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and over 80 million cases and over 1.8 million deaths were reported in 2020.

Over half of transmissions occur from presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. Although several vaccines are currently available for emergency use, there are uncertainties regarding the duration of protection and the efficacy of preventing asymptomatic spread. Thus, personal protective health behaviour and measures against COVID-19 are still widely recommended after immunization. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of these measures, and the results may provide valuable guidance to policymakers to educate the general public about how to reduce the individual-level risk of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 24 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from Centro Hospitalar Conde de Sao Januario (C.H.C.S.J.), which was the only hospital designated to manage COVID-19 patients in Macao SAR, China, and 1113 control participants who completed a 14-day mandatory quarantine in 12 designated hotels due to returning from high-risk countries between 17 March and 15 April 2020.

We examined prasugrel use and outcomes according to PCI complexity, as well as analyzing treatment effects according to thienopyridine type. METHODS PROMETHEUS was a multicentre observational study that compared clopidogrel vs prasugrel in acute coronary syndrome patients who underwent PCI (n = 19,914). Complex PCI was defined as PCI of the left main, bifurcation lesion, moderate-severely calcified lesion, or total stent length  30 mm. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned revascularization. Outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression for effect of PCI complexity and propensity-stratified analysis for effect of thienopyridine type. RESULTS The study cohort included 48.9% (n = 9735) complex and 51.1% (n = 10,179) noncomplex patients. Second generation drug-eluting stents were used in 70.1% complex and 66.2% noncomplex PCI patients (P < 0.0001). Complex PCI was associated with greater adjusted risk of 1-year MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.39; P < 0.001). Prasugrel was prescribed in 20.7% of complex and 20.1% of noncomplex PCI patients (P = 0.30). Compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel significantly decreased adjusted risk for 1-year MACE in complex PCI (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92) but not noncomplex PCI (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.08), albeit there was no evidence of interaction (P interaction = 0.281).

The normative data specific to the context of videoconference administration is essential, particularly that consider sociodemographic characteristics. AIMS: This study had for objective to develop French-Quebec normative data for videoconference-administration of the MoCA that consider sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: A total of 230 community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and older taking part in clinical trials completed the MoCA by videoconference. Regression analyses were run with sex, education, and age as predictors of the total MoCA scores, based on previously published norms. As an exploratory analysis, a second regression analysis was also run with cardiovascular disease as a predictor. RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that older age and lower education were associated with poorer total MoCA scores, for medium effect size (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.17). Neither sex nor cardiovascular disease, were significant predictors in our analyses. For clinicians, a regression equation was proposed to calculate Z scores.

For this one often considers the reproduction number which measures the amount of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual. While estimates of this quantity are readily available on the national level, subnational estimates, e.g. on the county level, pose more difficulties since only few incidences occur there. However, as countermeasures to the pandemic are usually enforced on the subnational level, such estimates are of great interest to assess the efficacy of the measures taken, and to guide future policy. We present a novel extension of the well established estimator of the country level reproduction number to the county level by applying techniques from small-area estimation. This new estimator yields sensible estimates of reproduction numbers both on the country and county level.

Exome data were compared in terms of overall characteristics and coverage of specific genes and nucleotide positions. The sets of genes examined included genes in Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) (n = 17723), a subset of genes clinically relevant to epilepsy (n = 108), and genes that are recommended for reporting of secondary findings (n = 57; excludes X-linked genes). RESULTS The average exome nucleotide coverage (20) of each laboratory varied at 96.49% (CV = 3%), 96.54% (CV = 1%), and 91.68% (CV = 4%), for laboratories A, B, and C, respectively.

Although data is limited on the scale of health care worker (HCW) displacement in conflict zones, it is widely acknowledged that conflict conditions result in the displacement of a significant portion of qualified HCWs from their country of origin. While voluntary HCW return is integral to health system rebuilding in conflict-affected and post-conflict settings, there has been little exploration of the nature of national or international policies which encourage HCW return and reintegration to their home countries in the post-conflict period. METHODS We conducted a systematic review to identify policies and policy recommendations intended to facilitate the return of displaced HCWs to their home countries and acknowledge their contribution to rebuilding the post-conflict health system. We searched three bibliographic databases and a range of organisational and national health agency websites to identify peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published in English or Arabic between 1 January 1990 to 24 January 2021, and extracted relevant information. We classified policies and policy recommendations using an adapted version of the UNHCR 4Rs Framework. RESULTS We identified nine peer-review articles and four grey literature reports that fit our inclusion criteria, all of which were published in English. These covered issues of repatriation (n = 3), reintegration (n = 2), health system rehabilitation and reconstruction (n = 2); six documents covered several of these themes. Information was available for nine conflict contexts: Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Lebanon, Namibia, Northern Uganda, South Sudan, Timor Leste, and Zimbabwe. Findings demonstrate that health system rebuilding and rehabilitation serve as precursors and reinforcers of the successful return, repatriation, and reintegration of displaced HCWs. CONCLUSIONS Despite the significant numbers of HCWs displaced by conflict, this study identified few specific policies and limited information explicitly focused on the repatriation and reintegration of such workers to their home country in the post-conflict period. Additional research is needed to understand the particular barriers faced by conflict-displaced HCWs in returning to their home country. Conflict-affected and post-conflict states should develop policies and initiatives that address factors within and beyond the health sector to encourage displaced HCW return and provide sustainable reintegration solutions for those who return to post-conflict health systems.","output":"Policies on return and reintegration of displaced healthcare workers towards rebuilding conflict-affected health systems: a review for The Lancet-AUB Commission on Syria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common and debilitating neurological condition whose treatments, including burr hole drainage and craniotomy, suffer from high rates of recurrence and complication.

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 39 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in an experienced ECMO center at a tertiary hospital during March/April 2020. Among the recruited participants, 10 (25.6%) required ECMO (ICU-ECMO group) and 29 (74.4%) did not have ECMO support (ICU group). Immunological parameters were assessed both at ICU admission and on a daily basis for 7 consecutive days. RESULTS: The absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly in the ICU-ECMO group compared to the ICU group in which it remained relatively stable: ? for the time variable was 127.1 [95% CI 68.9 - 185.3], p < 0.001 and for the interaction term -141.36 [-208.95 - -73.77], p < 0.001. On the other hand, globally, no significant differences were observed over time for the lymphocyte percentage, although it was higher in the ICU patients.

Data on stress levels, sleep duration, exercise, total diet, snacks, and prepared food intake were obtained from the questionnaires. Changes in the values of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight from 3 months before the administration of the questionnaire to the time the study questionnaire was administered (pandemic year), and those from 15 months before to 12 months before the administration of the questionnaire (pre-pandemic year) were evaluated. Results: Increased stress levels and decreased exercise volumes were observed in approximately 60% and 50% of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Decreased sleep duration was associated with changes in the body weight for 3 months during pandemic year (r = - 0.40, p = 0.043).

However, besides major successes achieved worldwide in infectious diseases control, most elimination/control programs remain frustrating in many tropical countries where specific biological and socio-economical features prevented implementation of disease control over broad spatial and temporal scales. Emblematic examples include malaria, yellow fever, measles and HIV. There is consequently an urgent need to develop affordable and sustainable disease control strategies that can target the core of infectious diseases transmission in highly endemic areas. DISCUSSION: Meanwhile, although most pathogens appear so difficult to eradicate, it is surprising to realize that human activities are major drivers of the current high rate of extinction among upper organisms through alteration of their ecology and evolution, i.e., their niche. During the last decades, the accumulation of ecological and evolutionary studies focused on infectious diseases has shown that the niche of a pathogen holds more dimensions than just the immune system targeted by vaccination and treatment. Indeed, it is situated at various intra- and inter- host levels involved on very different spatial and temporal scales. After developing a precise definition of the niche of a pathogen, we detail how major advances in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology of infectious diseases can enlighten the planning and implementation of infectious diseases control in tropical countries with challenging economic constraints. SUMMARY: We develop how the approach could translate into applied cases, explore its expected benefits and constraints, and we conclude on the necessity of such approach for pathogen control in low-income countries.","output":"The niche reduction approach: an opportunity for optimal control of infectious diseases in low-income countries?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers a multistage dynamic R&D race in which the competitors strategically publish research findings.

The complex nature of this infectious lung disease has proven difficult to treat, and significant research efforts are now evaluating the feasibility of host-directed, adjunctive therapies. An attractive approach in host-directed therapy targets host epigenetics, or gene regulation, to redirect the immune response in a host-beneficial manner. Substantial evidence exists demonstrating that host epigenetics are dysregulated during TB and that epigenetic-based therapies may be highly effective to treat TB. However, the caveat is that much of the knowledge that exists on the modulation of the host epigenome during TB has been gained using in vitro, small-animal, or blood-derived cell models, which do not accurately reflect the pulmonary nature of the disease. In humans, the first and major target cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are alveolar macrophages (AM). As such, their response to infection and treatment is clinically relevant and ultimately drives the outcome of disease.

Key ion channels (mainly the funny channel, HCN4) and Ca2+-handling proteins in the SN are responsible for its function. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression through inhibition or activation and microRNAs (miRs) do this through inhibition. There is high expression of macrophages and mast cells within the SN connective tissue. 'Novel'/unexplored TFs and miRs in the regulation of ion channels and immune cells in the SN are not well understood. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics, the expression profile and predicted interaction of key TFs and cell markers with key miRs in the adult human SN vs. right atrial tissue (RA) were determined. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: 68 and 60 TFs significantly more or less expressed in the SN vs. RA respectively. Among those more expressed were ISL1 and TBX3 (involved in embryonic development of the SN) and 'novel' RUNX1-2, CEBPA, GLI1-2 and SOX2. These TFs were predicted to regulate HCN4 expression in the SN. Markers for different cells: fibroblasts (COL1A1), fat (FABP4), macrophages (CSF1R and CD209), natural killer (GZMA) and mast (TPSAB1) were significantly more expressed in the SN vs. RA.

The study includes patients discussed in multidisciplinary tumor board(MDT)(421 in ECE Vs 31 in PCE) and those who underwent surgery(192 in ECE Vs 26 in PCE). The presentation and outcomes of oral carcinoma were compared between the two eras. There was a significant drop in the number of patients who presented during ECE. Though mean age and gender remained comparable between groups, there was a statistical difference in relation to demographic profile of patient (p value < 0.001). Among operated during ECE, 80% had a significantly advanced tumor stage (p value < 0.034) and advanced composite stage (p value < 0.049). Among patients discussed in MDT during ECE, 38.7% were deemed inoperable which is double the number when compared with PCE (p value < 0.009). Results of our study showed a higher incidence of advanced stage disease during ECE, with many patient turning inoperable.

Brazil's social, health and economic crises are aggravated by strong societal inequities and persisting political disarray. This complex scenario motivates careful study of the clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors contributing to increased risk of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil specifically. Methods: We consider the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe catalog, a very rich respiratory infection dataset which allows us to estimate the importance of several non-laboratorial and socio-geographic factors on COVID-19 mortality. We analyze the catalog using machine learning algorithms to account for likely complex interdependence between metrics. Findings: The XGBoost algorithm achieved excellent performance, producing an AUC-ROC of 0.813 (95%CI 0.810-0.817), and outperforming logistic regression. Using our model we found that, in Brazil, socioeconomic, geographical and structural factors are more important than individual comorbidities. Particularly important factors were: The state of residence and its development index; the distance to the hospital (especially for rural and less developed areas); the level of education; hospital funding model and strain. Ethnicity is also confirmed to be more important than comorbidities but less than the aforementioned factors. Interpretation: Socioeconomic and structural factors are as important as biological factors in determining the outcome of COVID-19. This has important consequences for policy making, especially on vaccination/non-pharmacological preventative measures, hospital management and healthcare network organization.","output":"Comparing COVID-19 risk factors in Brazil using machine learning: the importance of socioeconomic, demographic and structural factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has precipitated multiple variants resistant to therapeutic antibodies. In this study, 12 high-affinity antibodies were generated from convalescent donors in early outbreaks using immune antibody phage display libraries. Of them, two RBD-binding antibodies (F61 and H121) showed high-affinity neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, whereas three S2-target antibodies failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Following structure analysis, F61 identified a linear epitope located in residues G446CS494, which overlapped with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding sites, while H121 recognized a conformational epitope located on the side face of RBD, outside from ACE2 binding domain. Hence the cocktail of the two antibodies achieved better performance of neutralization to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, these two antibodies also showed efficient neutralizing activities to the variants including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and reacted with mutations of N501Y, E484K, and L452R, indicated that it may also neutralize the recent India endemic strain B.1.617.

Here we report the crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation, stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain. The structure of the F protein shows that there are profound conformational differences between the pre- and postfusion states, involving transformations in secondary and tertiary structure. The positions and structural transitions of key parts of the fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and two helical heptad repeat regions, clarify the mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by the F protein.

Inside enterprises, financial constraints will affect the degree of capital adequacy and thus affect the environmental behavior of enterprises. Externally, the fulfillment of corporate environmental responsibility will be affected by external regulatory pressure.

This papers findings show that both financial constraints and physical regulatory distance were positively correlated with corporate environmental irresponsibility in China, and that the positive correlation between physical regulatory distance and corporate environmental irresponsibility was more significant in non-state-owned enterprises. In addition, financial constraints and regulatory distance have a complementary effect on corporate environmental irresponsibility.

Mifepristone is a competitive glucocorticoid receptor antagonist that is approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration to control hyperglycemia secondary to endogenous hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) in patients who have glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Herein, we describe 6 patients with CD who received mifepristone as adjunct/bridge therapy in the following clinical settings: to assess clinical benefits of treatment for suspected recurrent disease, to control hypercortisolism preoperatively for severe disease, to control hypercortisolism during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide adjunctive treatment to radiation therapy. The patients were treated at multiple medical practice settings. Mifepristone treatment in each of the described cases was associated with clinical improvements, including improvements in overall glycemia, hypertension, and weight loss. In addition, in one case where biochemical and radiological evidence of disease recurrence was uncertain, clinical improvement with mifepristone pointed toward likely disease recurrence. Adverse events associated with mifepristone reported in the 6 cases were consistent with those previously reported in the pivotal trial and included cortisol withdrawal symptoms, antiprogesterone effects (vaginal bleeding), hypothyroidism (treated with levothyroxine), and hypokalemia (treated with spironolactone). These cases show how mifepristone can potentially be utilized as a therapeutic trial in equivocal cases of CD recurrence; as a presurgical treatment strategy, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; and as bridge therapy, while awaiting the effects of radiation.","output":"Mifepristone as Bridge or Adjunct Therapy in the Management of Challenging Cushing Disease Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally, and no proven treatments are available.

However, the comparative effectiveness of CT and ICA in the management of CAD to reduce the frequency of major adverse cardiovascular events is uncertain. METHODS We conducted a pragmatic, randomized trial comparing CT with ICA as initial diagnostic imaging strategies for guiding the treatment of patients with stable chest pain who had an intermediate pretest probability of obstructive CAD and were referred for ICA at one of 26 European centers. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) over 3.5 years. Key secondary outcomes were procedure-related complications and angina pectoris. RESULTS Among 3561 patients (56.2% of whom were women), follow-up was complete for 3523 (98.9%). Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 38 of 1808 patients (2.1%) in the CT group and in 52 of 1753 (3.0%) in the ICA group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 1.07; P = 0.10).

Here, we develop a predictive model of COVID-19-related death using longitudinal clinical data from patients in metropolitan Detroit. METHODS: All individuals included in the analysis had a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirty-six pre-existing conditions with a false discovery rate p<0.05 were combined with other demographic variables to develop a parsimonious prediction model using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. The model was then prospectively validated in a separate set of individuals with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 15 502 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. The main prediction model was developed using data from 11 635 individuals with 709 reported deaths (case fatality ratio 6.1%). The final prediction model consisted of 14 variables with 11 comorbidities. This model was then prospectively assessed among the remaining 3867 individuals (185 deaths; case fatality ratio 4.8%). When compared with using an age threshold of 65 years, the 14-variable model detected 6% more of the individuals who would die from COVID-19. However, below age 45 years and its risk equivalent, there was no benefit to using the prediction model over age alone.

According to its theorization, there are two types of Studyholic: Engaged and Disengaged Studyholics, which are characterized, respectively, by high and low levels of Study Engagement. This study aims to shed light on the role of internalizing and externalizing features as antecedents and outcomes of Studyholism and Study Engagement. Moreover, it aims to analyze the differences in psychopathology and sensation seeking between students demonstrating Disengaged and Engaged Studyholism. We performed four path analyses, MANOVAs, and MannCWhitney tests on 1,223 Italian college students (M(age) = 22.56  3.53). Among the main findings, Studyholism is associated with psychological and academic impairment, while Study Engagement predicts better mental health and academic functioning; though, the  values are lower for Study Engagement. Moreover, Studyholism is positively predicted by internalizing symptoms and negatively predicted by externalizing variables. Finally, students showing Engaged Studyholism have lower levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms than those demonstrating Disengaged Studyholism. In conclusion, this study shows the critical importance of implementing preventive interventions aimed at reducing Studyholism levels in college students. Moreover, it provides support to the conceptualization of problematic overstudying as a new potential OCD-related disorder and to the value of distinguishing between Engaged and Disengaged Studyholics for tailored clinical interventions. Finally, it highlights the need to use two different theorizations and operationalizations for problematic overworking and overstudying. However, the literature on problematic overstudying is too scant to reach any firm conclusion. Hence, future studies should deepen the analysis of problematic overstudying, possibly using longitudinal designs, to unveil its internalizing and/or externalizing nature.","output":"Studyholism: A New Obsessive-Compulsive Related Disorder?

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in 30C45 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic sequence. RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from actual COVID-19 patients was also tested. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 in both simulated patient samples and clinical specimens. This test was performed in 30C45 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.","output":"Rapid detection of novel coronavirus/Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the world was affected by an unprecedented health crisis.

BACKGROUND: Most existing AI systems only focus on viral pneumonia (e.g., COVID-19), specifically, ignoring other similar lung diseases: e.g., bacterial pneumonia (BP), which should also be detected during CT screening. In this paper, we propose a unified sequence-based pneumonia classification network, called SLP-Net, which utilizes consecutiveness information for the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia (VP), BP, and normal control cases from chest CT volumes. METHODS: Considering consecutive images of a CT volume as a time sequence input, compared with previous 2D slice-based or 3D volume-based methods, our SLP-Net can effectively use the spatial information and does not need a large amount of training data to avoid overfitting. Specifically, sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multi-scale receptive fields are first utilized to extract a set of higher-level representations, which are then fed into a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) module to construct axial dimensional feature maps. A novel adaptive-weighted cross-entropy loss (ACE) is introduced to optimize the output of the SLP-Net with a view to ensuring that as many valid features from the previous images as possible are encoded into the later CT image. In addition, we employ sequence attention maps for auxiliary classification to enhance the confidence level of the results and produce a case-level prediction. RESULTS: For evaluation, we constructed a dataset of 258 chest CT volumes with 153 VP, 42 BP, and 63 normal control cases, for a total of 43,421 slices. We implemented a comprehensive comparison between our SLP-Net and several state-of-the-art methods across the dataset. Our proposed method obtained significant performance without a large amount of data, outperformed other slice-based and volume-based approaches. The superior evaluation performance achieved in the classification experiments demonstrated the ability of our model in the differential diagnosis of VP, BP and normal cases.","output":"Automatic Sequence-Based Network for Lung Diseases Detection in Chest CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 remained the largest challenge for the Indonesian economy in 2021. In particular, Covid-19 case numbers hit a new high of about 50,000 cases per day in mid-July. In response, the government increased the contact tracing and testing of suspected positive cases, expanded its Covid-19 vaccination drive and introduced stricter mobility and activity restrictions (PPKM Darurat/PPKM Levels 1C4). By the end of October, more than 57% of the target population had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. The economy also improved in the first half of 2021. Building on the trough in GDP in the second quarter of 2020, economic growth returned in the second and third quarters of 2021 after contractions in the previous four quarters. Macroeconomic circumstances were also generally favourable, though significant longer-term risks remain. In terms of real wages, however, the recovery tended to benefit the formal sector and well-educated workers, while real wages in the informal sector and for low-educated workers continued to decline. At the same time, the rise in Covid-19 cases and the implementation of stricter mobility and activity restrictions have lowered expectations for economic growth in the second half of 2021. To mitigate the social and economic impact of the pandemic, the government has re-expanded its social protection programs. We find that these programs have mitigated the impact of Covid-19 on the poverty rate by four percentage points, or by about three-quarterspoverty increased to nearly 10%, rather than the 14% that would have been likely without the increased social assistance.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL; Google Scholar, SAGE journals, Science Direct and PubMed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers read and systematically extracted data from the included papers. Papers were appraised for methodological rigour using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: We identified 3483 unique records, 404 full-texts were assessed against the inclusion criteria and 79 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. First responders (FRs) identified in studies were police and ambulance staff. Main factors influencing response are persistent stigmatised attitudes among FRs, arbitrary training and the triadic interactions between FRs, people with mental illness and third parties present at the crisis. In addition, FR personal experience of mental illness and focused training can help create a more empathetic response, however lack of resources in mental health services continues to be a barrier where frequent attenders are repeatedly let down by mental health services. CONCLUSION: Lack of resources in mental healthcare and rise in mental illness suggest that FR response to MHC is inevitable. Inconsistent training, complexity of procedures and persistent stigmatisation make this a very challenging task. Improving communication with family carers and colleagues could make a difference.

During the first wave, a total of 22 cases with 368 close contacts were traced, identified, tested, quarantine and isolated. Due to the effective and robust outbreak control measures put in place such as early case detection, active screening, extensive contact tracing, testing and prompt isolation/quarantine, the outbreak was successfully contained and controlled. The SEIR model estimated the R(0) at 0.9 which further supports the decreasing disease dynamics and early termination of the outbreak.

METHODS: In total, 45 surgical masks and 69 respirators were decontaminated. Visual integrity, air permeability, burst resistance, pressure differential and particulate filtration efficiency of new and decontaminated surgical masks and respirators were evaluated. In addition, 14 used respirators were analysed after work shifts before and after decontamination using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culturing. Finally, reprocessed respirators were evaluated by users in terms of functionality and comfort. RESULTS: Oven decontamination (75 C for 45 min) was found to be the simplest decontamination method. Physical and filtration assays indicated that all reprocessing methods were safe after one cycle. Oven decontamination maintained the characteristics of surgical masks and respirators for at least five reprocessing cycles. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in two of the 14 used respirators.

In particular the early events causing ammonia-induced toxicity to astrocytes are not well understood. Using established cellular HE models, we show that mitochondria rapidly undergo fragmentation in a reversible manner upon hyperammonemia. Further, within a timescale of minutes mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were hampered which occurred in a pH-independent manner. Using metabolomics an accumulation of numerous amino acids, including branched chain amino acids and glucose was observed. Metabolomic tracking of 15N-labeled ammonia showed rapid incorporation of 15N into glutamate and glutamate-derived amino acids. Downregulating human GLUD2, encoding mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (GDH2), inhibiting GDH2 activity by SIRT4 overexpression, and supplementing cells with glutamate or glutamine alleviated ammonia-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Metabolomic tracking of 13C-glutamine showed that hyperammonemia can inhibit anaplerosis of TCA-cycle intermediates. Contrary to its classical anaplerotic role, we show that under hyperammonemia GDH2 rather catalyzes the removal of ammonia by reductive amination of &#945;-ketoglutarate which efficiently and rapidly inhibits the TCA-cycle. Overall, we propose a critical GDH2-dependent mechanism in HE models that on the one hand helps to remove ammonia but on the other hand impairs energy metabolism in mitochondria rapidly.","output":"Ammonia inhibits energy metabolism in astrocytes in a rapid and glutamate dehydrogenase 2-dependent manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Simultaneous quantitation of two orchid viruses, cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) and odontoglossum ringspot tobamovirus (ORSV), were carried out using the TaqMan? real-time RT-PCR, a novel detection technique that combines RT-PCR with the power of fluorescent detection.

Nevertheless, the squalene (oil) in previous attempts suffered from limited oxidation resistance, thus, safety and stability were compromised. From a clinical translational perspective, it is imperative to screen the optimal oils for enhanced emulsion adjuvants. Here, because of the varying oleic to linoleic acid ratio, soybean oil, peanut oil, and olive oil were utilised as oil phases in the preparation of aluminium hydrogel-stabilised squalene-in-water emulsions, which were then screened for their stability and immunogenicity. Additionally, the underlying mechanisms of oil phases and emulsion stability were unravelled, which showed that a higher oleic to linoleic acid ratio increased anti-oxidative capabilities but reduced the long-term storage stability owing to the relatively low zeta potential of the prepared droplets. As a result, compared with squalene-in-water ASEs, soybean-in-water ASEs exhibited comparable immune responses and enhanced stability.

METHODS Thirty SARS patients were treated at our hospital for over 3 weeks since March to May 2003. The course and dosage of glucocorticoid, counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+), electrolytes, blood routine, and sera albumin before and after the treatment were analysed. RESULTS Before treatment by methylprednisolone, the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of 27 SARS patients were (401 +/- 203), (340 +/- 187), (756 +/- 383) cells/ microl. Twenty-nine of the 30 SARS patients were treated by methylprednisolone. The dosage for 24 patients was 80 - 160 mg/d with the largest being 1,000 mg/d before admission to the hospital. The count of WBC was increased after treatment (P < 0.01). No obvious effect was observed on the potassium, sodium and chlorine of blood (P > 0.05). Glucocorticoid increased the level of blood glucose (P = 0.01), decreased the level of sera albumin (P < 0.01), and its large dosage decreased the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+). Three severe patients had secondary infection after administration of a large dose of glucocorticoid. CONCLUSIONS In the early stage of the disease, the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of SARS patients may reduce markedly indicating the immunity is suppressed. A large dose of glucocorticoid may aggravate the suppression and make the body in an active metabolic state (the increase of blood glucose and the decrease of sera albumin). Thus the disease is aggravated and patients are likely to suffer from severe secondary infection.

Methods: A sample of 95 patients were admitted to an orthopedics department with an emergent hand injury within half a year of the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected between January 23 rd , 2020 and July 23 rd , 2020. Information was collected regarding demographics, type of injury, location, side of lesions, mechanism of injuries, place where the injuries occurred, surgical management, and outcomes. Results: The number of total emergency visits due to hand injury during the COVID-19 outbreak decreased 37% when compared to the same period in the previous year. At the same time, work resumption injuries increased 40%. In comparison to the corresponding period in the previous year, most injured patients during the COVID-19 outbreak were women (60%) with a mean age of 56.7, while during the work resumption stage, most were men (82.4%) with a mean age of 44.8. The majority of injuries within the resumption period occurred at work (64.7%), significantly more than in the same period in 2019 (37.3%) ( P < 0.001). Machine injuries were the most frequent (58.8%). Data show that different degrees of cutting injuries comprised the majority of total cases (82.4%), far more than simple fractures and dislocations, with fingers the most commonly injured body part. The majority of injuries were classified as either minor or moderate (90%) during the outbreak while major (40%) during the resumption of work. The proportion of major injuries during the work resumption stage in this year (40%) have been almost double that of the previous year (pre-pandemic) (21.8%) ( P = 0.006). Conclusion: The resumption of work following the COVID-19 outbreak is a time of high risk for hand injuries. The overall number of patients with hand injuries admitted into our department has decreased compared to the corresponding period last year. Workplace injuries, especially machine related ones, increased greatly during the six months after the outbreak of COVID-19. The proportion of major injuries increased by a large margin.

Supply chain finance (SCF), responsible for financing the supply chain components and improving supply chain performance, received a significant impact of COVID-19 consequences. Financial providers are the leading resource for supply chain finance. The banking sector is known as the main element of financing among financial providers. Any disruption in the banking system procedures can have a significant impact on the financing process. In this paper, we have tried to understand the essential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the banking sector. A hybrid approach consists of a novel and extended intuitionistic fuzzy best-worst method (IFBWM) to determine the critical factors weights, and a fuzzy inference system to get the performance index of the banking sector is utilized. The proposed method investigates the banking sectors role in supply chain finance, specifies the principal risks of this sector in emergencies such as pandemics. The Turkish banking sectors performance in three different periods is considered to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach.

Though fully clad in personal protective equipment, the concern is that sampling in close proximity to the patient poses as a major health hazard. The present study sought to verify if saliva or faeces could become a possible surrogate for pharyngeal samples for SARS-CoV 2 testing in suspected Ghanaian COVID-19 patients. ObjectivesTo ascertain if there is SARS-CoV 2 viral shedding in the saliva and faecal samples of Ghanaian COVID-19 patients, their sensitivity and specificity as compared to pharyngeal samples. MethodFifty (50) recruited COVID-19 patients who have been confirmed via RT-PCR using their nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples and twenty (20) SARS-CoV 2 negative suspected patients each provided some faecal and saliva sample for RT-PCR analysis for SARS-CoV 2.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare McIsaac criteria obtained during face-to-face (f2f) and non-f2f encounters. METHODS: This retrospective study compared the percentage of positive GAS tests by McIsaac score for scores calculated during nurse protocol phone encounters, e-visits (electronic visits), and in person f2f clinic visits. RESULTS: There was no difference in percentages of positive strep tests between encounter types for any of the McIsaac scores. There were significantly more phone and e-visit encounters with any missing score components compared with f2f visits. For individual score components, there were significantly fewer e-visits missing fever and cough information compared with phone encounters and f2f encounters. F2f encounters were significantly less likely to be missing descriptions of tonsils and lymphadenopathy compared with phone and e-visit encounters. McIsaac scores of 4 had positive GAS rates of 55% to 68% across encounter types. There were 4 encounters not missing any score components with a McIsaac score of 0. None of these 4 encounters had a positive GAS test. CONCLUSIONS: McIsaac scores of 4 collected during non-f2f care could be used to consider empiric treatment for GAS without testing if significant barriers to testing exist such as the COVID-19 pandemic or geographic barriers. Future studies should evaluate further whether non-f2f encounters with McIsaac scores of 0 can be safely excluded from GAS testing.","output":"Use of the McIsaac Score to Predict Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis in Outpatient Nurse Phone Triage and Electronic Visits Compared With In-Person Visits: Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, novel metal-organic framework/polyimide (MOF/PI) composite films possessing dielectric properties were synthesized via a solution blending method.

Compared with pure PI, the dielectric properties of the MOF/PI composites were substantially enhanced. The amine functionalization gave UiO-66-NH2/PI composite films better dielectric properties in comparison with UiO-66/PI composite films because of improved interaction between PI and UiO-66-NH2.

Various nutrition societies have recently published their guidelines in context of the pandemic, and several points emphasize the impact of these GI manifestations on nutrition therapy. In patients with COVID-19, the normal intestinal mucosa can be disrupted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, and this could result in GI symptoms and a compromise in nutrient absorption. Optimization of oral diet is still recommended. However, given the GI effects of COVID-19, a fraction of infected patients have poor appetite and would not be able to meet their nutrition goals with oral diet alone. For this at-risk group, which includes those who are critically ill, enteral nutrition is the preferred route to promote gut integrity and immune function. In carrying this out, nutrition support practices have been revised in such ways to mitigate viral transmission and adapt to the pandemic. All measures in the GI and nutrition care of patients are clustered to limit exposure of healthcare workers. Among patients admitted to intensive care units, a significant barrier is GI intolerance, and it appears to be exacerbated by significant GI involvement specific to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

For the sake of practical implementation, we describe tools that facilitate Data Augmentation such as the use of consistency regularization, controllers, and offline and online augmentation pipelines, to preview a few. Finally, we discuss interesting topics around Data Augmentation in NLP such as task-specific augmentations, the use of prior knowledge in self-supervised learning versus Data Augmentation, intersections with transfer and multi-task learning, and ideas for AI-GAs (AI-Generating Algorithms).

SARS-CoV-2 transmission being responsible for the current pandemic, appears through airborne aerosols and droplets, thus, there has been an intense focus on such aerosol-generating procedures, and their reduction. Hence the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate available data on three major measures: rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinse, and high-volume evacuators (HVE) aimed at reducing bio-aerosols. METHOD: PubMed via Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched between 01 January 1985 and 30 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 156 records in English literature were identified, and 17 clinical studies with 724 patients included in the final analysis. Eligible articles revealed the inadequacy of three principle approaches used in contemporary dental practice to minimize such bio-aerosols, rubber dam application, pre-procedural oral rinses, and HVE. The latter is an extremely effective method to reduce bio-aerosols in dentistry, although no single method can provide blanket cover. CONCLUSION: Present systematic review indicates that employing combination strategies of rubber dam, with a pre-procedural antimicrobial oral rinse, and HVE may contain bio-aerosols during operative procedures.","output":"The efficacy of bio-aerosol reducing procedures used in dentistry: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020.

Methods The study was cross-sectional and involved 469 participants from 1st July to 31st August 2020. A 36-item questionnaire with Cronbach alpha of 0.753 was adapted and administered through an online survey tool. A snowball sampling approach was employed whereby the questionnaire link was distributed through social media networks including WhatsApp?, Facebook? and Instagram?. Data was analysed using SPSS 23 and a statistical significance level of 0.05 was used. Bivariate and multivariate analysis were employed to determine factors affecting the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 transmission and prevention. Results The mean age of participants was 3911.29years. Majority (54%) of the participants heard about COVID-19 through mass and social media. The study found that 71.6% of the participants had good knowledge, just 31.3% had a good attitude while 84.9% of them had good practices towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. The high rates of the knowledge and practices were driven by income, age, education and marital status. Conclusions Majority of the study participants showed correct knowledge and adhered to recommended practices towards COVID- 19. However, there were gaps in the understanding of the underlying realities and beliefs in certain myths about COVID-19. Hence, interventions such as jingles and posters in various languages that would serve to correct the negative perceptions and myths about COVID-19 instituted through mass media and social media are recommended.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices towards COVID-19 Transmission and Preventive Measures among Residents of Nigeria: A Population-Based Survey through Social Media."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan, China, was caused by a single-stranded RNA virus which has kept the entire world stranded.

This increasing adoption has led to rapid growth in the number, size (number of participants/parties) and diversity (intermittent vs. active parties) of FL jobs. Many existing FL systems, based on centralized (often single) model aggregators are unable to scale to handle large FL jobs and adapt to parties' behavior. In this paper, we present a new scalable and adaptive architecture for FL aggregation. First, we demonstrate how traditional tree overlay based aggregation techniques (from P2P, publish-subscribe and stream processing research) can help FL aggregation scale, but are ineffective from a resource utilization and cost standpoint. Next, we present the design and implementation of AdaFed, which uses serverless/cloud functions to adaptively scale aggregation in a resource efficient and fault tolerant manner. We describe how AdaFed enables FL aggregation to be dynamically deployed only when necessary, elastically scaled to handle participant joins/leaves and is fault tolerant with minimal effort required on the (aggregation) programmer side.

PSGL-1 involvement in core molecular programs, such as SYK, PLC2, PI3K or MAPK pathways, suggests additional functions beyond the modulation of cell trafficking. Recently, several studies identified a novel mechanism responsible for PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment and proved a novel concept of PSGL-1 as a critical checkpoint molecule for tumor immunotherapy. The immunotherapeutic approach has gained an ever-growing interest in the treatment of several hematological malignancies, and in particular, novel targets for immunotherapy are still highly sought-after in T-cell lymphomas. Based on our results obtained through gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical analysis, PSGL-1, already suggested as a potential target in multiple myeloma humoral immunotherapy, could be considered noteworthy among the candidates. ABSTRACT: Due to the high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in lymphoproliferative disorders and in multiple myeloma, it has been considered as a potential target for humoral immunotherapy, as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor in T-cells. By investigating the expression of SELPLG in 678 T- and B-cell samples by gene expression profiling (GEP), further supported by tissue microarray and immunohistochemical analysis, we identified anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL) as constitutively expressing SELPLG at high levels. Moreover, GEP analysis in CD30+ ALCLs highlighted a positive correlation of SELPLG with TNFRSF8 (CD30-coding gene) and T-cell receptor (TCR)-signaling genes (LCK, LAT, SYK and JUN), suggesting that the common dysregulation of TCR expression in ALCLs may be bypassed by the involvement of PSGL-1 in T-cell activation and survival. Finally, we evaluated the effects elicited by in vitro treatment with two anti-PSGL-1 antibodies (KPL-1 and TB5) on the activation of the complement system and induction of apoptosis in human ALCL cell lines. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that PSGL-1 is specifically enriched in ALCLs, altering cell motility and viability due to its involvement in CD30 and TCR signaling, and it might be considered as a promising candidate for novel immunotherapeutic approaches in ALCLs.","output":"Constitutive PSGL-1 Correlates with CD30 and TCR Pathways and Represents a Potential Target for Immunotherapy in Anaplastic Large T-Cell Lymphoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine heterogeneity in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across eight European countries.

However, a large number of infectious asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (\\\\textit{ACC}s) are still making the breaking up of the transmission chains very difficult. Efforts by epidemiological researchers in many countries have thrown light on the clinical features of ACCs, but there is still a lack of practical approaches to detect ACCs so as to help contain the pandemic. To address the issue of ACCs, this paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory for COVID-19 (\\\\textit{STEM-COVID}) to identify ACCs from contact tracing data. Based on the fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (\\\\textit{ART}), the model encodes a collective spatio-temporal episodic memory of individuals and incorporates an effective mechanism of parallel searches for ACCs. Specifically, the episodic traces of the identified positive cases are used to map out the episodic traces of suspected ACCs using a weighted evidence pooling method. To evaluate the efficacy of STEM-COVID, a realistic agent based simulation model for COVID-19 spreading is implemented based on the recent epidemiological findings on ACCs. The experiments based on rigorous simulation scenarios, manifesting the current situation of COVID-19 spread, show that the STEM-COVID model with weighted evidence pooling has a higher level of accuracy and efficiency for identifying ACCs when compared with several baselines. Moreover, the model displays strong robustness against noisy data and different ACC proportions, which partially reflects the effect of breakthrough infections after vaccination on the virus transmission.","output":"Who Are the \`Silent Spreaders'?: Contact Tracing in Spatio-Temporal Memory Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electronic nose (E-nose) and hyperspectral image (HSI) were combined to evaluate mutton total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), which is a comprehensive index of freshness.

Immediate instillation of intravesical chemotherapy (IC) can reduce recurrence, is guideline-recommended but is under-utilized. Continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) immediately post-TURBT is postulated to prevent re-implantation, and may provide a simple, cheap and practical alternative. We undertook a systematic review to assess the effect of CBI on NMIBC recurrence. METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines, relevant publications were identified by online search of databases, including Ovid Medline and EMBASE (1980-2019). All published prospective randomized controlled trials comparing CBI post-TURBT to a control group were included. The primary end-point was recurrence. RESULTS Our search yielded 514 studies, of which six met inclusion criteria. Two studies (935 participants), albeit without peer-reviewed publication, comparing CBI to no CBI both showed a reduction in recurrence at 2 years. Four publications from three trials (331 participants) compared CBI to IC, showing similar recurrence rates at 1 year (odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 0.78-2.13) but a lower risk of adverse events (6-34% versus 27-48%).

To combat HCC effectively research is directed towards its early detection and the development of targeted therapies. Given the fact that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important mitogen for hepatocytes we searched for disease regulated proteins to improve an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of EGF induced HCC. Disease regulated proteins were studied by 2DE MALDI-TOF/TOF and a transcriptomic approach, by immunohistochemistry and advanced bioinformatics. RESULTS: Mapping of EGF induced liver cancer in a transgenic mouse model identified n = 96 (p < 0.05) significantly regulated proteins of which n = 54 were tumour-specific. To unravel molecular circuits linked to aberrant EGFR signalling diverse computational approaches were employed and this defined n = 7 key nodes using n = 82 disease regulated proteins for network construction. STRING analysis revealed protein-protein interactions of > 70% disease regulated proteins with individual proteins being validated by immunohistochemistry. The disease regulated network proteins were mapped to distinct pathways and bioinformatics provided novel insight into molecular circuits associated with significant changes in either glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, argine and proline metabolism, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, Hif- and MAPK signalling, lipoprotein metabolism, platelet activation and hemostatic control as a result of aberrant EGF signalling. The biological significance of the findings was corroborated with gene expression data derived from tumour tissues to evntually define a rationale by which tumours embark on intriguing changes in metabolism that is of utility for an understanding of tumour growth. Moreover, among the EGF tumour specific proteins n = 11 were likewise uniquely expressed in human HCC and for n = 49 proteins regulation in human HCC was confirmed using the publically available Human Protein Atlas depository, therefore demonstrating clinical significance.

Although renal IRI has been induced in pig models in many ways, simultaneous bilateral ischemia or unilateral ischemia along with contralateral nephrectomy models only provide data on the renal response to a single ischemia time. Moreover, it has been reported that prolonged renal ischemia time in pigs for 120 min or more can cause irreversible renal damage and increase animal mortality. Methods: We developed a model that induces prolonged ischemia time and subsequent reperfusion injury without threatening the lives of pigs by subjecting the left and right kidneys to ischemia for 120 and 60 min, respectively. Using this novel model, we investigated whether hydrogen gas inhalation could alleviate renal IRI. Results: All animals (n=4) survived until the end of the observation period of 3 months in this model. Evaluation of the left and right kidneys immediately before and after IRI could be performed separately by blood sampling from each renal vein and renal biopsy during surgery, although the results of peripheral blood sampling during the follow-up were the mixed results of bilateral kidneys. The release of degraded DNA from the kidneys immediately after IRI and subsequent renal fibrosis at 3 months increased in response to ischemia time. Although the effect of hydrogen gas on pathological findings was not obvious, the release of degraded DNA from the kidney, an acute marker of IRI, appeared to be suppressed. Conclusions: We have developed a novel model in which IRI of different ischemia times is induced in the bilateral kidney that provides two-fold information and allows for safe long-term observation experiments in pigs.

METHODS: A cohort of 257 convalescent COVID-19 patients (131 male and 126 females) were included. Group-based multi-trajectory modelling was applied to identify different trajectories in terms of pneumonia lesion percentage and lymphocyte counts covering the time from onset to post-discharge follow-ups. We studied the basic characteristics and disease severity associated with the trajectories. RESULTS: We characterised four distinct trajectory subgroups. (1) Group 1 (13.9%), pneumonia increased until a peak lesion percentage of 1.9% (IQR 0.7C4.4) before absorption. The slightly decreased lymphocyte rapidly recovered to the top half of the normal range. (2) Group 2 (44.7%), the peak lesion percentage was 7.2% (IQR 3.2C12.7). The abnormal lymphocyte count restored to normal soon. (3) Group 3 (26.0%), the peak lesion percentage reached 14.2% (IQR 8.5C19.8). The lymphocytes continuously dropped to 0.75  10(9)/L after one day post-onset before slowly recovering. (4) Group 4 (15.4%), the peak lesion percentage reached 41.4% (IQR 34.8C47.9), much higher than other groups. Lymphopenia was aggravated until the lymphocytes declined to 0.80  10(9)/L on the fourth day and slowly recovered later. Patients in the higher order groups were older and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes (all P values < 0.05), and have more severe disease.

In this paper the human security concept will be used to explain COVID-19 as a health security problem due to the existence of an existential threat. However, the same approach is not applicable in looking at COVID-19 as an economic security problem. Because the existential threat is less visible in human economic security aspects it tends to be more appropriate to look at COVID-19 as the stressor that strengthens human vulnerabilities. This paper uses a qualitative descriptive approach by using the conceptual framework to analyses news reports books and academic journals as the sources of data. The writers analyses and group the data by types of security as well as based upon the root causes that contribute to human vulnerability then compare both sectors. This paper argues that in the pandemic situation human health is threatened whereas the economy is at a vulnerable position due to COVID-19. This paper also argues that COVID-19 has not yet threatened human economic security in the early stage but soon it will.

The tight links that necessarily exist between the virus as it multiplies and the metabolism of its host are systematically ignored. Here we show that the metabolism of all cells is coordinated by the availability of a core building block of the cell's genome, cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This metabolite is also the key to the synthesis of the viral envelope and to the translation of its genome into proteins. This unique role explains why evolution has led to the early emergence in animals of an antiviral immunity enzyme, viperin, that synthesizes a toxic analogue of CTP. The constraints arising from this dependency guide the evolution of the virus. With this in mind, we explored the real-time experiment taking place before our eyes using probabilistic modelling approaches to the molecular evolution of the virus. We have thus followed, almost on a daily basis, the evolution of the composition of the viral genome to link it to the progeny produced over time, particularly in the form of blooms that sparked a firework of viral mutations. Some of those certainly increase the propagation of the virus. This led us to make out the critical role in this evolution of several proteins of the virus, such as its nucleocapsid N, and more generally to begin to understand how the virus ties up the host metabolism to its own benefit. A way for the virus to escape CTP-dependent control in cells would be to infect cells that are not expected to grow, such as neurons. This may account for unexpected body sites of viral development in the present epidemic.","output":"[Biochemical and statistical lessons from the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: paths for novel antiviral warfare]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policy dialogs are deliberative dialogue that gather policy makers and relevant stakeholders from across disciplines to discuss a topic of mutual interest. They typically serve as a single element in a broader policymaking cycle, either informing the content of new policy or forming a component of policy evaluation and review. In the joint action CHRODIS PLUS, national policy dialogs were conducted in fourteen EU Member States. The aim of the dialogs was to identify new policies or changes to existing policies and legislation that are capable of tackling major risk factors for chronic disease, to strengthen health promotion and prevention programs and to ensure health systems are equipped to respond to priority issues within the chronic diseases field. In this paper, we present the CHRODIS PLUS policy dialog methodology, as well as results and lessons learnt from three national policy dialogs held in Ireland, Portugal and Spain. After discussion of the results, we conclude that the CHRODIS PLUS methodology is an effective mechanism to provoke deliberative discussion around chronic disease prevention and management in different countries. However, it is essential to ensure adequate human and financial resourcesas well as political commitmentto accomplish objectives set out during the policy dialogs.

Some physicians have chosen to use elastomeric face masks (EFMs), traditionally used in non-healthcare industries. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians working at a Level 1 Trauma Center who chose to use self-supplied EFMs for PPE. All subjects used commercial EFMs with disposable filters (N95, P95, or P100). All subjects chose their mask size independently with no input from employee health regarding appropriate fit. Per study protocol, subjects were fit tested periodically during clinical shifts over the course of the 6-week study period. All investigators performing fit testing underwent OSHA qualitative fit testing training. Data collected included mask/filters age, subjective assessment of mask seal quality, and fit test results. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 105 fit tests were performed on physicians wearing EFMs over the course of 49 shifts. Physicians felt their fit was adequate for all tests performed. There were no fit test failures in any subjects. CONCLUSIONS: EFMs have an extremely low failure rate. Physicians are able to assess the adequacy of fit and accurately choose EFM size.","output":"The pragmatic use of industrial elastomeric facemasks in health care practice during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, making more use of remote medical solutions has been advertised. The purpose of this study was to assess the willingness of orthopedic trauma patients to conduct an online video consultation (OVC) during the coronavirus pandemic compared to before. METHODS: A survey amongst orthopedic and trauma outpatients from three European trauma centers was conducted via paper-based questionnaires, composed of participants demographics and five open and closed questions between June and November 2019 and between April and July 2020 during Covid-19. The main outcome was the difference between the cohorts regarding the willingness to use an OVC, reasons for and against usage as well as advantages and disadvantages. Sub-analysis was performed for gender, participants occupation and three age groups ( 30 years; 31C55 years; > 55 years). RESULTS: 1400 participants (780 preCovid-19 and 620 Covid-19) were included. There was no difference in willingness to conduct an OVC between the cohorts (57.6% versus 63.9%; p = 0.053). The highest disposition towards an OVC in both cohorts was seen in patients below 30 years of age, followed by 31C55 years and over 55 years. Women were significantly more likely in the Covid-19-group than in the preCovid-19-group to conduct an OVC (p = 0.032). Use of the OVC for personal questions to the physician was more often stated in the Covid-19-cohort (p = 0.007). No danger of an infection (p = 0.001) and availability from anywhere (p = 0.032) as advantages of an OVC were more often stated in the Covid-19-cohort. No direct contact with the doctor (p = 0.001) and relationship to the doctor could change (p = 0.024) as disadvantages of the OVC were less often stated in the Covid-19-cohort. CONCLUSION: The majority of the assessed outpatients would use an OVC. Fear of infections have increased, and direct physical contact is less important since the Covid-19 pandemic, but have not increased the disposition for an OVC significantly.","output":"The effect of Covid-19 on the willingness to use video consultations among orthopedic and trauma outpatients: a multi-center survey in 1400 outpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several Canadian and international scholars offer commentaries on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for governments and public service institutions, and fruitful directions for public administration research and practice.

Objective: To assess maternal and neonatal neutralizing antibody levels against both wildtype and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants after maternal mRNA vaccination. Study Design: This cohort study was conducted 29 pregnant women who were vaccinated at least one dose of Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine. Both neutralizing antibody (wildtype and Delta variant) and S1 receptor binding domain IgG antibody levels were evaluated in maternal and cord blood on the day of delivery. Results: Superiority of antibody level was significant in fully vaccinated women compared with the one-dose group (maternal sera, median, 97.46%; cord sera, median, 97.37% versus maternal sera, median, 4.01%; cord sera, median, 1.44%). No difference in antibody level was noted in relation to interval of second immunization to delivery in the two-dose group (95.99% in 0C2 weeks, 97.45% in 2C4 weeks, 97.48% in 4C8 weeks, 97.72% in 8C10 weeks). The most pronounced reduction was observed for the Delta variant. The wildtype neutralizing antibody level of full-vaccinated women was not influenced by the pertussis vaccination. Conclusion: The data underscore the importance of full vaccination in pregnancy and support the recommendation of COVID-19 immunization for pregnant women. The lower level of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies for the Delta variant indicates insufficient protection for mother and newborn and highlights the need for development of effective vaccine strategies.","output":"Evaluation of Transplacental Antibody Transfer in SARS-CoV-2-Immunized Pregnant Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we examine the stock markets response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To gain insight into the specific Hsp70 that modulates TDP-43, we investigated the relationship between TDP-43 and the Hsp70s using proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and discovered several Hsp70 isoforms associated with TDP-43 in the nucleus, raising the possibility of an interaction with native TDP-43. We further found that HspA5 bound specifically to the RNA-binding domain of TDP-43 using recombinantly expressed proteins. Moreover, in a Drosophila strain that mimics ALS upon TDP-43 expression, the mRNA levels of the HspA5 homologue (Hsc70.3) were significantly increased. Similarly we observed upregulation of HspA5 in prefrontal cortex neurons from human ALS patients. Finally, overexpression of HspA5 in Drosophila rescued TDP-43-induced toxicity, suggesting that upregulation of HspA5 may have a compensatory role in ALS pathobiology.","output":"Heat shock protein Grp78/BiP/HspA5 binds directly to TDP-43 and mitigates toxicity associated with disease pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The CoronaVac vaccine was found to be effective against symptomatic COVID-19 and protective against severe disease in phase 3 studies.

Non-MIS-A COVID-19 hospitalizations were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision encounter code U07.1. We calculated the ratio of MIS-A to COVID-19 hospitalizations, compared demographic characteristics of the two cohorts, and described clinical characteristics of MIS-A patients. RESULTS: We identified 11 MIS-A cases, none of which were diagnosed by the treatment team, and 5,755 COVID-19 hospitalizations (ratio 1: 523). Compared with patients with COVID-19, patients with MIS-A were more likely to be younger than 50 years (72.7% vs. 26.1%, p < 0.01) and to be non-Hispanic Black persons (81.8% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.04).

In this article, we focus on two jurisdictions with distinct paths of development - England and France - to examine if they have drawn from their own legal history to craft solutions to this challenge and to consider if either has bettersuited tools to address it. Notably, the UK has refrained from intervening in the area of contract law, thus relying on long-standing common law doctrines and equitable remedies, while, in France, the government has intervened with a series of ordonnances providing contracting parties with new tools tackling difficulties of performance, which add to the existing arsenal in the Code civil. The article demonstrates that the responses to the COVID-19 challenge by England and France have historic roots and illustrate important legal cultural differences vis- vis state intervention in the area of contract in trying times. Moreover, even though, at first glance, parties contracting under French law have more tools balancing freedom of contract and fairness, a closer look reveals that over protection or under protection may lead to the same outcome for contractual relationships on both sides of the Channel. Ultimately, in both countries, parties seem better off settling their disputes themselves, away from the courts. ? 2020 Kluwer Law International.

As a collaborative and self-guided, inquiry-based learning method, it focuses on learners' intrinsic motivation while working on real world problems organised in projects (\\"Challenges\\" in \\"CBL\\") with an experiential and progressive approach to apply acquired knowledge in real world scenarios, ideate solution concepts and build innovative digital products. To overcome limitations of spiral curriculum or elaboration theory, the authors applied narrative theory to design the program's educational experience for the academic year 2019/2020 as a cohesive journey within a communal learning environment with a coherent and connected structure of narratively driven learning Challenges. The authors present concepts to develop their approach further towards an emergent narrative experience design system to manage the educational journey as it develops, rather than scripting it. This paper evolves the authors' Narrative Experience Design Canvas to model educational experience design that encourages unscripted, emergent narratives for experiential education with the goal of fostering learners' engagement, agency and creativity. Derived in part by models developed for digital interactive storytelling or educational video games, it categorises the components for designing an educational experience that allows the learning progression to be driven by learners as co-authors and describes mechanisms that allow unscripted narratives to emerge based on intrinsic motivation. Additionally, the authors present considerations for synchronous and asynchronous learning to evolve their framework for application in blended or remote learning scenarios. Drawing upon findings for remote learning and experiential e-learning - ee-learning - presented by scholars as well as implications identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting switch to remote learning within the program at University of Naples Federico II in 2020, it is shown how combining narrative elements with experiential e-learning principles can result in increased engagement, motivation and sense of community in learners. Using the example of an individual learning unit - a Challenge - considerations from overall course design down to day-to-day learning activities within the course are presented. For the future, the authors indicate action points to develop this model into an Emergent Narrative System for designing narratively driven and experiential software development education programs and indicate areas of further research on learning activity design for blended or remote learning experiences.","output":"Emergent Narratives in Remote Learning Experiences for Project Based Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melanin is the basis of coloration in many animals, and although it is often used in communication, thermoregualtion or camouflage, melanin has many other physiological functions. For example, in polluted habitats, melanin can have a detoxifying function. Melanic coloration would help to sequester in the skin the heavy metals contaminants from inside the body, which will be expulsed to the exterior when the skin is sloughed. Moreover, animals should have evolved more melanic colorations in more polluted habitats (\\"industrial melanism\\" hypothesis). We examined whether the fossorial amphisbaenian reptile, Trogonophis wiegmanni, is able to eliminate heavy metals, derived from soil pollution by seagulls depositions, through sloughing its skin. Our results suggest a covariation between levels of soil pollution by heavy metals and the concentration of heavy metals in the sloughed skins of amphisbaenians. This suggests that amphisbaenians may expel heavy metals from their bodies when they slough the skins. We also tested whether amphisbaenians inhabiting soils with higher levels of heavy metal pollution had darker (melanin-dependent) body colorations. However, contrary to predictions from the \\"industrial melanization\\" hypothesis, we found a negative relationship between soil pollution and proportions of melanic coloration. This contradictory result could, however, be explained because heavy metals have endocrine disruption effects that increase physiological stress, and higher stress levels could result in decreased melanogenesis. We suggest that although amphisbaenians might have some detoxifying mechanism linked to melanin in the skin, this process might be negatively affected by stress and result ineffective under conditions of high soil pollution.

METHOD: Participants in the EAT 2010-2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C-EAT (COVID-19 EAT) survey in April-May 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7  2.0 years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined as cross-sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open-ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. RESULTS: Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic-related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re-emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. DISCUSSION: Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions that target stress management, depressive symptoms, and financial strain and provide tools to develop a routine may be particularly effective for emerging adults at risk of developing disordered eating during public health crises.","output":"Disordered eating in a population-based sample of young adults during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiologists model the dynamics of epidemics in order to propose control strategies based on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (contact limitation, lock down, vaccination, etc). Hand-designing such strategies is not trivial because of the number of possible interventions and the difficulty to predict long-term effects. This task can be cast as an optimization problem where state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as deep reinforcement learning, might bring significant value. However, the specificity of each domain -- epidemic modelling or solving optimization problem -- requires strong collaborations between researchers from different fields of expertise. This is why we introduce EpidemiOptim, a Python toolbox that facilitates collaborations between researchers in epidemiology and optimization. EpidemiOptim turns epidemiological models and cost functions into optimization problems via a standard interface commonly used by optimization practitioners (OpenAI Gym). Reinforcement learning algorithms based on Q-Learning with deep neural networks (DQN) and evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) are already implemented. We illustrate the use of EpidemiOptim to find optimal policies for dynamical on-off lock-down control under the optimization of death toll and economic recess using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for COVID-19. Using EpidemiOptim and its interactive visualization platform in Jupyter notebooks, epidemiologists, optimization practitioners and others (e.g. economists) can easily compare epidemiological models, costs functions and optimization algorithms to address important choices to be made by health decision-makers.","output":"EpidemiOptim: A Toolbox for the Optimization of Control Policies in Epidemiological Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This strain of coronavirus is a new one and scientists do not yet know all there is to know about it.

However, there is not yet a standard protocol to guide its implementation. In this paper, we attempt to propose a technical framework of relative quantification for determining the virus abundance in wastewater and estimating the infection rate in corresponding communities, which is expected to achieve horizontal and vertical comparability in virtue of human-specific biomarkers as internal references. A comprehensive theoretical framework for relative quantification of viruses by qPCR is provided and discussed in detail. Critical factors affecting the virus detectability in wastewater and the estimation of infection rate include virus concentration methods, lag-period, per capita virus shedding amount, sewage generation rate, temperature-related decay kinetics of virus/biomarkers in wastewater, and hydraulic retention time (HRT), etc. Theoretical simulation shows that the main factors affecting the detectability of virus in sewage are per capita virus shedding amount and sewage generation rate. While the decay of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage is a relatively slow process, which has limited impact on its detection. Under the ideal condition of high per capita virus shedding amount and low sewage generation rate, WBE can give early warning for single infected person among 400,000 people.","output":"Technical framework for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 based on relative quantification via qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient clinics throughout the US shifted toward virtual care to limit viral transmission in the office.

Empirical data from the pH1N1 virus were used to validate our SEIR model. Time to entry to the U.S. during the early stages of a prototypical novel communicable disease was predicted based on the aviation network patterns and the epidemiology of the disease. For example, approximately 96% of origins (R 0 of 1.53) propagated a disease into the U.S. in under 75 days, 90% of these origins propagated a disease in under 50 days. An R 0 of 1.53 reproduced the pH1NI observations.

However, factors such as various contraindications, refusal of informed consent and limited technical support may stop the biopsy process. It is thus of great importance to explore approaches that could deduce probable pathologic changes. METHODS: A total of 81 biopsy-proven D-ATIN patients were enrolled from a prospective cohort of ATIN patients at Peking University First Hospital. The systemic inflammation score (SIS) was developed based on the CRP and ESR levels at biopsy, and patients were divided into high-SIS, median-SIS, and low-SIS groups. The demographic data, clinicopathologic features, and renal outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The SIS was positively correlated with inflammatory cell infiltration and was inversely correlated with interstitial fibrosis. The number of interstitial inflammatory cells increased significantly with increasing SISs. The proportions of neutrophils and plasma cells were the highest in the high-SIS group compared with the other two groups. Prednisone (30-40 mg/day) was prescribed in all patients. The high-SIS group tended to have more favorable renal restoration than the other two groups.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how self-compassion and professional self-concept mediate the relationship between perceived social support and PWB to explain the theoretical mechanisms of the relationship. DESIGN: This study is the analytical cross-sectional research based on online self-reports and completed validated measures of perceived social support, PWB, self-compassion, and professional self-concept. METHODS: The Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to estimate the mediation effects on the relationship between perceived social support and PWB. To examine the directionality of effects, this study also tested the reverse serial mediation model. Multigroup SEM was used to test gender differences in the mediation model. RESULTS: The results of an empirical study involving 487 undergraduate nursing students verified an integrative model of social support. In addition, no gender difference was found in these associations. These findings suggest that self-compassion and professional self-concept accounted for the association between perceived social support and PWB, and self-compassion was a significant predictor of professional self-concept. CONCLUSION: There is a pathway of self-compassion and professional self-concept through which perceived social support may improve PWB. Also, improving nursing students perceived social support, self-compassion and professional self-concept are beneficial for promoting their mental health. It is meaningful for nursing educators to take measures to develop nursing students PWB and enhance their professional self-concept.","output":"Perceived Social Support Promotes Nursing Students Psychological Wellbeing: Explained With Self-Compassion and Professional Self-Concept"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many scientific meetings online.

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of our understanding of tumor immunotherapy, immunotherapeutics, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have gradually become a hot spot for tumor treatment. Amongst these, programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) related inhibitors, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab have been shown to exhibit a high level of efficacy in several types of tumors. It has been confirmed that these inhibitors play an important role in the anti-tumor process, significantly improving the survival rate of patients and delaying the progress of the underlying cancer. However, its method of therapeutic interference and potential for damaging the immune system has caused concern regarding its suitability. As these adverse effects are caused by an immune response to endogenous tissues, they are designated as immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

COVID-19 related ARDS can be complicated by neurological involvement with mechanisms of direct central nervous system (CNS) infection and with overlapping para-infective mechanisms of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). We aimed to evaluate the possible involvement of the brainstem and PNS in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS and difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation.

Viewing a given population of individuals or groups of individuals with given health state attributes as living in and moving between the nodes of a graph, we use Monte-Carlo Markov Chain techniques to simulate the movements and health state changes of the individuals according to given probabilities of stay that have been preassigned to each of the nodes. We utilize this model to either capture and predict the future geographic evolution of an epidemic in time, or the evolution of an epidemic inside a heterogeneous population which is divided into homogeneous sub-populations, or, more generally, its evolution in a combination or superposition of the previous two contexts. We also prove that when the size of the population increases and a natural hypothesis is satisfied, the stochastic process associated to our model converges to a deterministic process. Indeed, when the length of the time step used in the discrete model converges to zero, in the limit this deterministic process is driven by a differential equation yielding the evolution of the expectation value of the number of infected as a function of time. In the second part of the paper, we apply our model to study the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic. We deduce a decomposition of the function yielding the number of infectious individuals into \\"wavelets\\", which allows to trace in time the expectation value for the number of infections inside each sub-population.

Emergency surgeries such as mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for AIS must be performed without any delay even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce morbidity and mortality. Besides the focus on patients health, the safety of healthcare workers must also be considered.

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in malarious areas of southern Iran and the incidence of disease in people previously infected with malaria. Materials and Methods: We conducted an ecological study during the Covid-19 epidemic period in a malaria-endemic area, Hormozgan province, by including all critically ill patients with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals in different counties. The malaria cases were matched in the Covid patient's list. Also, the cumulative incidence and mortality rate of the Covid-19 were calculated in all counties. Results: The results show that malaria-endemic regions have a lower cumulative incidence and mortality rate than the others. Moreover, it was found that people with a history of malaria were not infected with Covid 19. Conclusion: It seems that malaria endemicity may positively affect the lower incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in malaria-endemic regions.

The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using the case study of Mexico, including the states of the country as stakeholders. We involve several parameters to guide the allocation, such as the size, risk profiles, and fraction of vulnerable groups in the population. Furthermore, different scenarios of the availability of potential COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated. The social welfare approach is the most commonly used scheme for the allocation of resources. However, we demonstrate that this scheme yields non-unique or multiple solutions (through the social welfare II approach). These social welfare approaches provide inequalities in the allocations that become critical when resources are scarce. Specifically, the social welfare scheme favors large stakeholders (greater population) in all scenarios. We also observe how the complexity of the allocation increases with the higher availability of vaccines. Hence, it is relevant to consider allocation schemes to identify fair solutions.","output":"Fair Allocation of Potential COVID-19 Vaccines Using an Optimization-Based Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study treatment effect modifiers for causal analysis in a social network, where neighbors' characteristics or network structure may affect the outcome of a unit, and the goal is to identify sub-populations with varying treatment effects using such network properties.

Working at the front line, emergency department (ED) HCWs are uniquely at high risk. It is unknown if seropositivity in this population is similar to community levels or is substantially higher as a result of work-based exposure to infectious children who may demonstrate mild symptoms. Further, the experience of pediatric HCWs may be disparate from adult focused facilities because prior to implementation of social distancing, children presented for care at pediatric facilities in high numbers with mild illness. Many were evaluated in pediatric EDs which may have put pediatric HCWs at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic before universal personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization became standard practice. The milder nature of COVID-19 in children has also led some to believe that children are not affected, although the emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) refutes this notion. However, this belief and the lack of data may result in lax utilization to PPE in pediatric settings. Data describing seropositivity among pediatric HCWs is not yet available. Study Objective: Determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric HCWs. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study, analyzing data from the baseline visit of a prospective cohort to determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs at a large pediatric health care facility in April-May 2020. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and level of anxiety about COVID-19 was determined. Symptomatic or febrile HCWs were excluded. Metrics were analyzed overall and by HCW roles and tested for differences using chi-square estimates of independence. Prevalence of IgG antibodies were compared in ED vs. non-ED HCWs. Results: Of 300 HCWs enrolled from April 16-May 18, 2020, their mean age range is 41-50 years, 83% are female and 75% have no comorbidities. HCWs include 33% physicians, 25% nurses 10% respiratory therapists, 7% advance practice providers, and 25% other. Forty-seven percent were emergency department (ED) staff, 13% worked in pediatric intensive care, 40% elsewhere. Half of all HCWs had children in their home, 45% had traveled outside the state, and 47% reported an illness since January. Overall, 28% had a known COVID-19+ exposure. Most participants (90%) believed they were at high risk to develop COVID-19 as HCWs, and 70% reported high anxiety due to the pandemic. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity in this cohort is 4.7%. Of the 14 HCWs with positive serology, only 3 (21%) had a history of any prior COVID-19 testing, all of which were positive;43% (6/14) had no prior flu-like illness or symptoms. Eighty-six percent of antibody-positive HCWs were ED-based staff;SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were identified in 9% of ED HCWs enrolled compared to 1% in non-ED based HCWs, p=0.003. Conclusions: Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is low in pediatric HCWs living in a region with high COVID-19 activity. Most cases were found in HCWs from the pediatric ED, and nearly half were asymptomatic. ED-based pediatric HCWs may be uniquely at higher risk of exposure to children with COVID-19, and particularly may have been at higher risk of infection before awareness of the evolving pandemic;ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential.","output":"321 Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Pediatric Health Care Workers in Atlanta, Georgia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Estimate incidence of and risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home staff in the state of Georgia during the 2020/2021 Winter COVID-19 Surge in the U.S. Design Serial survey and serologic testing at two time points with 3-month interval exposure assessment. Setting and Participants 14 nursing homes in the state of Georgia. 203 contracted or employed staff members from 14 participating nursing homes who were seronegative at first timepoint and provided a serology specimen at second timepoint, at which time they reported no COVID-19 vaccination or only very recent vaccination (4 weeks). Methods Interval infection was defined as seroconversion to antibody presence for both nucleocapsid protein and spike protein. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) by job type, using multivariable logistic regression, accounting for community-based risks including interval community-incidence and interval change in resident infections per bed. Results Among 203 eligible staff, 72 (35.5%) had evidence of interval infection. In multivariable analysis among unvaccinated staff, staff SARS-Cov-2 infection induced seroconversion was significantly higher among nurses and certified nursing assistants accounting for race and interval infection incidence in both the community and facility (aOR 5.3, 95% CI 1.0-28.4).

These health behaviors are severely compromised in parts of the world that lack secure water supplies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used empirical data gathered in 2017-2018 from 8,297 households in 29 sites across 23 LMICs to address the potential implications of water insecurity for COVID-19 prevention and response. These data demonstrate how household water insecurity presents many pathways for limiting personal and environmental hygiene and impeding physical distancing, exacerbating existing social and health vulnerabilities that can lead to more severe COVID-19 outcomes. In the four weeks prior to the survey, 45.9% of households in our sample either were unable to wash their hands or reported borrowing water from others, which may undermine hygiene and physical distancing. Further, 70.9% of households experienced one or more water-related problems that potentially undermine COVID-19 control strategies or disease treatment, including insufficient water for bathing, laundering, or taking medication; drinking unsafe water; going to sleep thirsty; or having little-to-no drinking water. These findings help identify where water provision is most relevant to managing COVID-19 spread and outcomes.","output":"Household Water Insecurity Will Complicate the Ongoing COVID-19 Response: Evidence from 29 Sites in 23 Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil was considered one of the emerging epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic in 2021, experiencing over 3000 daily deaths caused by the virus at the peak of the second wave. In total, the country had more than 20.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including over 582,764 fatalities. A set of emerging variants arose in the country, some of them posing new challenges for COVID-19 control. The goal of this study was to describe mutational events across samples from Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly obtainable on Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data-EpiCoV (GISAID-EpiCoV) platform and to generate indexes of new mutations by each genome. A total of 16,953 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained, which were not proportionally representative of the five Brazilian geographical regions. A comparative sequence analysis was conducted to identify common mutations located at 42 positions of the genome (38 were in coding regions, whereas two were in 5 and two in 3 UTR). Moreover, 11 were synonymous variants, 27 were missense variants, and more than 44.4% were located in the spike gene. Across the total of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) identified, 32 were found in genomes obtained from all five Brazilian regions. While a high genomic diversity has been reported in Europe given the large number of sequenced genomes, Africa has demonstrated high potential for new variants. In South America, Brazil, and Chile, rates have been similar to those found in South Africa and India, providing enough space for new mutations to arise. Genomic surveillance is the central key to identifying the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and has shown that the country is one of the hotspots in the generation of new variants.","output":"High Rate of Mutational Events in SARS-CoV-2 Genomes across Brazilian Geographical Regions, February 2020 to June 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are effective in treating COVID-19 but the mechanism of immune protection is not fully understood.

A US representative sample (5,023) completed measures including the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8. Analyses controlled for age, sex, race, marital status, education level, working status, household income, and COVID-19 exposure. Results were consistent with prediction. First, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with above average COVID-19 fear (? = 0.19). Second, the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 fear; one SD increase on the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was associated with almost a twofold risk of reaching above average levels of COVID-19 (OR = 1.93). Third, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with higher anxiety (? = 0.22) and depression (? = 0.20).

Importantly, none of the participants was hospitalized. Altogether, we studied this specific, non-commonly addressed cohort for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, uncovering intrinsic features of great demographic interest. The overall rate of IgG seropositivity was 33.69% (95% CI: 29.27 C 38.21). This seroprevalence was comparable between different occupations performed by the participants. However, contacts with confirmed cases associated positively with IgG+ results, with stronger correlation if being a household member. The number of symptoms also correlated positively with IgG+ prevalence. Ageusia/anosmia, pneumonia and cutaneous manifestations were the top-three symptoms that most strongly associated with IgG+ seroprevalence. However, while pneumonia and cutaneous manifestations were barely present in our cohort, fever, ageusia/anosmia and asthenia were the most frequently symptoms described within IgG+ subjects. Therefore, our data illustrate how specific cohorts display heterogeneous characteristics that should be taken into account when identifying population seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 and key defining symptoms for COVID-19.","output":"IgG seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 449 non-hospitalized, high-risk exposure individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to broadband communications in different parts of the world has become a priority for some governments and regulatory authorities around the world in recent years.

Since gathering water is essential, shared water sites may act as an important COVID-19 transmission pathway, despite stay-at-home recommendations. This analysis explores conditions under which shared water facility utilization may influence COVID-19 transmission.Methods: We developed two SEIR transmission models to explore COVID-19 dynamics. The first describes an urban setting, where multiple water sites are shared within a community, and the second describes a rural setting, where a single water site is shared among communities. We explored COVID-19 mitigation strategies including social distancing and adding additional water sites.Findings: Increased water site availability and social distancing independently attenuate attack rate and peak outbreak size through density reduction. In combination, these conditions result in interactive risk reductions. When water sharing intensity is high, risks are high regardless of the degree of social distancing. Even moderate reductions in water sharing, can enhance the effectiveness of social distancing. In rural contexts, we observe similar but weaker effects.Interpretation: Enforced social distancing and density reduction at shared water sites can be an effective and relatively inexpensive mitigation effort to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Building additional water sites is more expensive but can increase the effectiveness of social distancing efforts at the water sites. As respiratory pathogen outbreaks  and potentially novel pandemics  will continue, infrastructure planning should consider the health benefits associated with respiratory transmission reduction when prioritizing investments.

INTRODUCTION The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of CO-RADS scoring system in our patients with COVID-19 as well as to examine its correlation with clinical and laboratory findings. METHOD The CO-RADS category of all patients included in the study was determined by a radiologist who did not know the rtRT-PCR test result of the patients, according to the Covid-19 reporting and data system of Mathias Prokop et al. Results: A total of 1338 patients were included. CT findings were positive in 66.3%, with a mean CO-RADS score of 3,4  1,7. 444 (33.1%) of the patients were in the CO-RADS 1-2, 894 (66.9%) were in the CO-RADS 3-5 group. There were positive correlations between CO-RADS score and age, CMI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary diseases presence of symptoms, symptom duration, presence of cough, shortness of breath, malaise, CRP, and LDH, while CO-RADS score was negatively correlated with lymphocyte count. The results of the ROC analysis suggested that those with age 40 years, symptom duration >2 days, CMI score >1 and/or comorbid conditions were more likely to have a CO-RADS score of 3-5.

Mental accounting generally shows people's attitudes to profit and loss. Richard Thaller created four rules of his theory. The article focuses on one of the rules of this theory, the rule of distribution incomes, which says that people are more satisfied with several smaller incomes than with one larger, which is the sum of the smaller ones. Research purpose: The research goal was to check if the rule of distributing incomes is used to a group of people randomly selected. Methods: The research was made using a survey method, which was available online on 9-20.04.2020. 156 respondents took part in the survey. The respondents were chosen randomly. The survey consisted of seven questions. Three of them referred to the respondents, the others described various life situations, which was described the distribution of incomes. The respondents were grouped according to gender, age and education. Then, in each of the four described situations, they answered exactly the same question, if they prefer several smaller incomes or one larger being the sum of the smaller ones. Conclusions: The results of the research showed that randomly selected renspodents prefer one larger income being the sum of smaller incomes than several smaller incomes of exactly the same value. The same results were confirmed by respondents regardless of gender, age or education. The results may have been affected by the situation during the tests were performed. This time was the beginning of quarantine during a worldwide coronavirus pandemic.

Glires species play an important role in the ecosystem and provide valuable animal models for genetic studies and animal testing. Thus, it is important to reliably determine their evolutionary relationships and identify molecular characteristics that are specific for different species groups within the Glires. In this work, we have constructed a phylogenetic tree for >30 genome sequenced Glires species based on concatenated sequences of 25 conserved proteins. In this tree, members of different orders, suborders, and families within Glires formed strongly supported clades, and their interrelationships were also generally reliably resolved. In parallel, we conducted comparative analyses on more than 1500 protein sequences from Glires species to identify highly conserved molecular markers. These markers were comprised of conserved signature indels (CSIs) in proteins, which are specific for different Rodentia/Glires clades. Of the 41 novel CSIs identified in this work, some are specific for the entire Glires, Rodentia, or Lagomorpha clades, whereas many others reliably demarcate different family/suborder level clades of Rodentia (viz. Myomorpha, Castorimorpha, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha, and Muroidea). Additionally, some of the CSIs also provide information regarding the interrelationships among Rodentia subgroups. Our analysis has also identified one CSI that is commonly shared by the Glires and Scandentia species (tree shrew), however, its evolutionary significance is unclear. Several of the identifed rodents-specific CSIs are present in conserved disease-related proteins.

Also, to describe a detailed protocol for SARS-CoV-2 culture and immunofluorescence confirmation based on our experience with other respiratory viruses. STUDY DESIGN: 100 consecutive respiratory samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from different subjects were inoculated into VERO E6 cells. RESULTS: Viral isolation was successful in 58% of samples. The median number of days from symptom onset for culture-positive samples was 2, and 15 for culture-negative samples. Six positive cultures were obtained in patients 14 days after symptom onset, all of whom were immunocompromised or with severe COVID-19. The mean Ct value was 12.64 units higher in culture-negative than in culture-positive samples. The probability of successfully isolating SARS-CoV-2 in samples with a Ct value <22 was 100%, decreasing to 3.1% when >27. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a significant positive correlation between the probability of isolating SARS-CoV-2 in culture, fewer days of symptoms and a lower RT-PCR Ct value. SARS-CoV-2 infectivity lasts no more than 14 days from symptom onset in immunocompetent individuals. In contrast, in immunocompromised patients or those with severe COVID-19 infectivity may remain after 14 days.

The rapid transition over a short period of time has exposed challenges and limitations of virtual visits, especially with regards to performing an effective and efficient physical examination. Within months, orthopedic telemedicine guides were published for patient education and facilitating the musculoskeletal examination. These publications, however, included only a short video clip to explain to the patient how to participate in the examination during a telemedicine visit. In the foot and ankle subspecialty, the closely adjacent complex anatomy compared to other areas of the body presents unique challenges for physical exam. Methods: To optimize the efficiency and efficacy of the examination portion of the visit for both patients and providers, we designed and recorded an instructional video that is sent to all patients by email a minimum of 1 week prior to their appointment. This video consists of a step-by-step guide on how to take suitable photos and videos of their feet and ankles for the physical examination portion of their visit. These media files are then directly uploaded by the patients into their EMR or emailed to the physician's office to be uploaded for access by the provider before and during the virtual visit. Along with the video, patients are given a link to test their microphone and camera in advance of the visit to ensure adequate functionality and positioning. Results: Our pre-appointment instructional video has been effective to methodically replicate the most important aspects of an in-person foot and ankle evaluation. Both physicians and patients appear to benefit from the tutorial video by having more time during the telemedicine visit to focus on history, assessment, and plan. Patients are more actively involved in the clinical data collection process because they are educated on what to expect and how to best prepare and participate in telemedicine visits. Moreover, having a set of systematic and detailed photos and recordings of the patient's foot and ankle beforehand better focuses interaction and discussion with the patient during the telemedicine encounter. Additionally, these are saved into the patient's electronic medical record, available for reference and later review. Conclusion: Physical examination plays a critical role in diagnosis and treatment in the orthopedic foot and ankle subspecialty. More research is needed to discern how best to utilize virtual modalities as they become more commonplace, not just from the imposition from the COVID pandemic but also from the standpoint of patient convenience and time efficiency.

However, this group was not included in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, and limited postauthorization vaccine effectiveness (VE) data are available for this critical population (3). It is not known how well COVID-19 vaccines protect SNF residents, who typically are more medically frail, are older, and have more underlying medical conditions than the general population (1). In addition, immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be lower in adults aged 65-85 years than in younger adults (4). Through the CDC Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, SNF residents and staff members in Connecticut began receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020 (5). Administration of the vaccine was conducted during several on-site pharmacy clinics. In late January 2021, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH) identified two SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks among residents and staff members that occurred after each facility's first vaccination clinic. CT DPH, in partnership with CDC, performed electronic chart review in these facilities to obtain information on resident vaccination status and infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Partial vaccination, defined as the period from >14 days after the first dose through 7 days after the second dose, had an estimated effectiveness of 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33%-79%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) among residents within these SNFs. This is similar to estimated effectiveness for a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in adults across a range of age groups in noncongregate settings (6) and suggests that to optimize vaccine impact among this population, high coverage with the complete 2-dose series should be recommended for SNF residents and staff members.","output":"Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Among Residents of Two Skilled Nursing Facilities Experiencing COVID-19 Outbreaks - Connecticut, December 2020-February 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 445,000 deaths worldwide. There is an urgent need for effective treatment. Studies suggest that a hyper-inflammatory response is a major cause of disease severity and death. Using precision medicine to rapidly identify patients with COVID-19 with hyper-inflammation may be key for identify subgroups who may benefit from targeted immunomodulatory treatments. Methods: In combination with a diagnostic point-of-care test (POCT), we used a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, IL-1, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IFN- in 101 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at admission to University Hospital Southampton. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were collected for all patients. Findings: Age over 70 years was the strongest predictor of death (OR 28, 95% CI 5.94, 139.45). Cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, IL-1 and IL-33 were significantly associated with adverse outcome in COVID-19. Clinical parameters at admission were predictive of poor outcome (AUROC 0.71), with addition of a combined cytokine panel significantly improving the predictability (AUROC 0.85). In those < 70 years, IL-33 and TNF- were predictive of poor outcome (AUROC 0.84 and 0.83), and addition of a combined cytokine panel demonstrated greater predictability of poor outcome than clinical parameters alone (AUROC 0.92 vs 0.77). Interpretation: A combined cytokine panel improves the accuracy of the predictive value for adverse outcome beyond standard clinical data alone. Rapid identification of specific cytokines may help to stratify patients towards trials of specific immunomodulatory treatments to improve outcomes in COVID-19.Funding Statement: No external funding was received for this work.

Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms based on NIH criteria.1 Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, e.g. household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls and across patient subgroups at all taxonomic levels. Results: There were 52 patients and 20 controls. Compared with controls, patients had significantly less bacterial diversity, a lower abundance of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium as well as some other bacteria, and a higher abundance of Bacteroides at the genus level. Additionally, there was an inverse association between disease severity and both bacterial diversity and Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium abundance. Conclusion: We hypothesize that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced pro-immune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic. This particular dysbiosis pattern may be a susceptibility marker for severe symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be amenable to pre-, intra-, or post infection intervention.","output":"The missing microbes: Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium depletion and loss of microbiome diversity as potential susceptibility markers for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salvia miltiorrhiza Burge (Danshen), a member of the Lamiaceae family, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many centuries as a valuable medicinal herb with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic potential.

Unfortunately, increasing numbers of nations are ruled by autocratic regimes which have characteristically failed to adopt investments in public health infrastructure, education, and prevention measures to keep pace with population growth and density. Autocratic leaders have a direct impact on health security, a direct negative impact on health, and create adverse political and economic conditions that only complicate the crisis further.

We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) who die in intensive care units (ICU) have a lower viral clearance in the respiratory tract than ICU patients discharged alive, and that protracted viral shedding in respiratory samples is associated with patterns of fibroproliferation on lung CT. We, therefore, conducted a retrospective observational study, in 2 ICU of Lyon university hospital. RESULTS: 129 patients were included in the study, of whom 44 (34%) died in ICU. 432 RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were performed and 137 CT scans were analyzed. Viral load was significantly higher in patients deceased as compared to patients alive at ICU discharge (p < 0.001), after adjustment for the site of viral sampling and RT-PCR technique. The median time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation on RT-PCR was 19 days [CI95 %:15-21] in patients alive at ICU discharge and 26 days [CI95 %:17-infinity] in non-survivors at ICU discharge. Competitive risk regression identified patients who died in ICU and age as independent risk factors for longer time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation on RT-PCR, while antiviral treatment was independently associated with shorter time. None of the CT scores exploring fibroproliferation (i.e., bronchiectasis and reticulation scores) were significantly associated with time to SARS-CoV-2 negativation.

Many countries and airlines have implemented travel restrictions to limit the spread of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.

A more recent travel mandate for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin M serology testing was instituted by the Chinese government on October 29, 2020. Pretravel testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 raises complications in terms of cost, turnaround time, and follow-up of positive results. In this report, we describe the experience of a multidisciplinary collaboration to develop a workflow for pretravel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin M serology testing at an academic medical center. The workflow primarily involved self-payment by patients and preferred retrieval of results by the patient through the electronic health record patient portal (Epic MyChart). A total of 556 unique patients underwent pretravel reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, with 13 (2.4%) having one or more positive results, a rate similar to that for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing performed for other protocol-driven asymptomatic screening (eg, inpatient admissions, preprocedural) at our medical center. For 5 of 13 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive samples, the traveler had clinical history, prior reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive, and high cycle thresholds values on pretravel testing consistent with remote infection and minimal transmission risk. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin M was performed on only 24 patients but resulted in 2 likely false positives.

A total of 184 HIV infected patients were retrospectively examined and the results of FCA collected and compared to those obtained in 110 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, examined during the actual outbreak. We observe a comparable reduction in B cells in both diseases and a more severe reduction in the total amount of T cells in COVID-19 as compared to AIDS patients. The analysis of the T cells subpopulations indicates that there is a comparable reduction in the CD4+ cells count. Conversely, a remarkable difference between them is observed in the CD8+ counts. In AIDS patients the CD8+ cells are slightly higher than normal, while in COVID-19 patients the CD8+ cell count is markedly reduced. As a result, the CD4+/CD8+ ratios, is very low in AIDS and higher than normal in COVID-19 patients. The NK cells are reduced in both diseases, but SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a more severe reduction compared to HIV infection. In conclusion, both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses induce major changes in the lymphocytes count, with remarkable similarities and differences between them. The total absolute numbers of T cells and, in particular of the CD8+ subpopulation, are lower in COVID-19 patients compared to AIDS ones, while the CD4+ are reduced in both at similar levels. These results indicate that the host immune system reacts differently to the two infection, but they are responsible of a comparable dropping effect on the serum levels of CD4+ T cell population. The meaning of the similarities and of the differences in terms of T cells activation and serum depletion are discussed.

To address this challenge, we developed a not-for-profit interactive mobile application that provides a disease-specific educational background and a structured exercise regimen to patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rak Kao (English translation: Love-Your-Knee) mobile application was designed to analyze the questionnaire data to assess the stage of knee OA and generate a personalized recommendation of treatment and exercise type using rule-based and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. A single-blinded study was conducted with patients (n = 82) who were randomly assigned to the mobile application group (M-group) and the handout group (H-group). Patient groups were controlled for age, gender, BMI, onset of pain, grade of disease, education level, and occupation. Accuracy in performance of three prescribed knee exercises (catch-bend-down, stretch-touch-feet, and sit-stretch-hold) was evaluated. Clinical outcomes were evaluated before and after the 4-weeks program to assess the range of motion, symptoms, pain, physical activity, and quality of life via the KOOS and KSS scores. RESULTS: Completion of the study led to significantly more overall exercise accuracy in the M-group (76.2%) than the H-group (52.5%). Activities of daily life, quality of life, ability to do sports and recreational activities were significantly more improved in the M-group than the H-group (p < .01).

Comparable across young and older adults, fake news detection accuracy was higher for news unrelated to COVID, and non-COVID fake news detection was predicted by individual differences in analytic reasoning. Examination of chronological age effects further revealed that detection of fake news among older adults aged over 70 years depended on interactions between individual CISDA components and news content. Collectively, these findings suggest that age-related susceptibility to fake news may only be apparent in later stages of older adulthood, but vulnerabilities are context dependent.

Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May 2020 that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy. We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social distancing within the wider community. We predicted that reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases. Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June 2020 was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.

Recent RCOG/BSGE recommendations have recommended retrieval of ovarian masses via the umbilical port with resultant less postoperative pain and a faster retrieval time than with retrieval through lateral ports of the same size. This is a prospective observational study reviewing the Hasson entry technique and the introduction of retrieval of specimens via the umbilicus in patients scheduled for a laparoscopy procedure at our day surgery unit. We found no immediate or major surgical complications and all specimens were successfully retrieved through the umbilicus. Pain scores were low. We recommend the technique for extirpative gynaecological surgery. Impact Statement This study confirms that conversion from the closed Veress to the open Hasson technique is achievable in a university hospital setting. Operator confidence during the learning phase is enhanced by the use of ultrasound to locate and measure the depth of the umbilical ligament.

The aim of this study was to describe the association between nutritional risk and length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. METHODS: a retrospective cohort of ventilated, critically ill patients. We assessed nutrition risk at baseline using NUTRIC-score. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze the association between NUTRIC-score and clinical outcomes (days on mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality). A survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: a total of 112 patients were included, 39.3 % were overweight and 47.3 % were obese. Based on NUTRIC-Score, 66 % and 34 % of patients were at high and low nutritional risk, respectively. High nutritional risk was associated with increased mortality risk (OR: 2.4, 95 % CI, 1.06-5.47, p = 0.036) and higher 28-day mortality (HR: 2.05, 95 % CI, 1.01-4.23, p = 0.04) in comparison with low risk. CONCLUSION: high nutritional risk is related to mortality in SARS-COV-2 critically ill patients. Overweight and obesity are common in this sample.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of postoperative high-load long-duration inspiratory muscle training on pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity after mitral valve replacement surgeries. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A total of one hundred patients (mean age 38.33.29years) underwent mitral valve replacement surgery were randomized into experimental (n = 50) and control (n = 50) groups. The control group received conventional physiotherapy care, while experimental group received conventional care in addition to inspiratory muscle training, with 40% of the baseline maximal inspiratory pressure targeting a load of 80% by the end of the 8 weeks intervention protocol. Inspiratory muscle training started on the patients first day in the inpatient ward. Lung functions, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity were evaluated using a computer-based spirometry system, maximal inspiratory pressure measurement and 6MWT respectively at 5 time points and a follow-up assessment was performed 6 months after surgery. Repeated measure ANOVA and post-hoc analyses were used (p <0.05). RESULTS: Group-time interactions were detected for all the studied variables (p<0.001). Between-group analysis revealed statistically significant postoperative improvements in all studied variables in the experimental group compared to the control group (p <0.001) with large effect size of (2) ?0.14. Within-group analysis indicated substantial improvements in lung function, inspiratory pressure and functional capacity in the experimental group (p <0.05) over time, and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. CONCLUSION: High intensity, long-duration postoperative inspiratory muscle training is highly effective in improving lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity after mitral valve replacement surgeries.","output":"Effect of postoperative high load long duration inspiratory muscle training on pulmonary function and functional capacity after mitral valve replacement surgery: A randomized controlled trial with follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the use of digital technology in healthcare, telemedicine has not been readily adopted.

To appropriately allocate resources and prevent virus exposure while maintaining effective patient care, our orthopaedic surgery department rapidly introduced a robust telemedicine program during a 5-day period. Implementation requires attention to patient triage, technological resources, credentialing, education of providers and patients, scheduling, and regulatory considerations.

However, the receptor for NeoCoV, the closest MERS-CoV relative yet discovered in bats, remains enigmatic5. In this study, we unexpectedly found that NeoCoV and its close relative, PDF-2180-CoV, can efficiently use some types of bat Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and, less favorably, human ACE2 for entry. The two viruses use their spikes S1 subunit carboxyl-terminal domains (S1-CTD) for high-affinity and species-specific ACE2 binding. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed a novel coronavirus-ACE2 binding interface and a protein-glycan interaction, distinct from other known ACE2-using viruses. We identified a molecular determinant close to the viral binding interface that restricts human ACE2 from supporting NeoCoV infection, especially around residue Asp338. Conversely, NeoCoV efficiently infects human ACE2 expressing cells after a T510F mutation on the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Notably, the infection could not be cross-neutralized by antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. Our study demonstrates the first case of ACE2 usage in MERS-related viruses, shedding light on a potential bio-safety threat of the human emergence of an ACE2 using MERS-CoV-2 with both high fatality and transmission rate.","output":"Close relatives of MERS-CoV in bats use ACE2 as their functional receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease severity of influenza is highly variable in humans, and one genetic determinant behind these differences is the IFITM3 gene. As an effector of the interferon response, IFITM3 potently blocks cytosolic entry of influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we reveal a novel level of inhibition by IFITM3 in vivo: We show that incorporation of IFITM3 into IAV particles competes with incorporation of viral hemagglutinin (HA). Decreased virion HA levels did not reduce infectivity, suggesting that high HA density on IAV virions may be an antagonistic strategy used by the virus to prevent direct inhibition. However, we found that IFITM3-mediated reduction in HA content sensitizes IAV to antibody-mediated neutralization. Mathematical modeling predicted that this effect decreases and delays peak IAV titers, and we show that, indeed, IFITM3-mediated sensitization of IAV to antibody-mediated neutralization impacts infection outcome in an in vivo mouse model.

An empirical study conducted with the use of corresponding psychodiagnostic techniques (Extended Life orientation test;SACS) found that people who are optimistic about restrictions and atypical life situations are prone to use assertive actions and enter into social contacts. Whereas people who are pessimistic about the future have a less pronounced tendency to seek social support. The study confirmed that proactive coping in atypical life situations (including forced isolation) is associated with the relevant individual psychological characteristics, which are important for motivating social activities. Such personality expressions can contribute to the implementation of proactive coping and they are key factors in the pre-actional phase of goal-setting because proactive people focus not on the obstacles, but on solving problems. It is also suggested that proactive instructions can be a resource that enhances an individual's desire for a higher standard of living.","output":"Coping Strategies for Overcoming Stress in Atypical Situations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media have become a valuable source for extracting data about societal crises and an important outlet to disseminate official information.

It appears that such preventive measures are critical to \\"flattening the curve\\" of the spread of COVID-19. The public's adoption of such behaviors is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the \\"invisible enemy.\\" OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors among US college students. The Health Belief Model has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors, but it is not without its purported shortcomings. This study identifies a more optimal and defensible combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 because of the relative reluctance of college students to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible to or fearful of COVID-19. METHODS: For this study, 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS macro (Model 6) was used to test our conceptual model, including predictions involving sequential mediation. RESULTS: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy; this is key to driving preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based on this study's newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek out COVID-19-related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, their self-efficacy, and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.","output":"Improving Predictions of COVID-19 Preventive Behavior: Development of a Sequential Mediation Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, metabolic syndrome has become a global health problem.

These mediators can be activated by metabolic inflammation and microvascular disorders and may further cause damage to the white matter and impair cognitive function. These alterations can result in serious changes in cognitive abilities. The association between cognitive changes and metabolic syndrome has been independently evaluated in several studies.

Subsequently, we predicted the most immunogenic epitope for the T-cell and B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules.

Drug repurposing strategy is applied by using the library of antiviral and FDA approved drugs retrieved from the Selleckchem Inc. (Houston, TX, http://www.selleckchem.com) and DrugBank database respectively. Computational methods like molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were used. The molecular docking calculations were performed using LeadIT FlexX software. The molecular dynamics simulations of 100 ns were performed to study conformational stability for all complex systems. Mitoxantrone and Leucovorin from FDA approved drug library and Birinapant and Dynasore from anti-viral drug libraries interact with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at higher efficiency as a result of the improved steric and hydrophobic environment in the binding cavity to make stable complex. Also, the molecular dynamics simulations of 100 ns revealed the mean RMSD value of 2.25 ? for all the complex systems. This shows that lead compounds bound tightly within the Mpro cavity and thus having conformational stability. Glutamic acid (Glu166) of Mpro is a key residue to hold and form a stable complex of reported lead compounds by forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridge.

METHODS Sixty three single port laparoscopic TEP hernia repairs were performed in sixty patients from June 2010 to March 2011 at Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, with the use of a glove single-port device and standard laparoscopic instruments. Demographic and clinical data, intraoperative findings, and postoperative course were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 63 hernias treated, 31 were right inguinal hernias, 26 were left inguinal hernias and 3 were both inguinal hernias. There was one conversion to conventional three port laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty. Mean operative time was 62 minutes (range, 32 to 150 minutes). There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications occurred in two cases (wound seroma and urinary retension) and were successfully treated conservatively.

We also consider key parameters that are concerned with the disease. An epidemiological threshold, R0, is computed using next-generation matrix approach. This is used to establish the existence and global stability of equilibria. We identify the most sensitive parameters which effectively contribute to change the disease dynamics with the help of sensitivity analysis. Our results reveal that increasing contact tracing of the exposed individuals who are tested for COVID-19 and hospitalizing them, largely has a negative impact on R0. Results further reveal that transmission rate between low-risk/high-risk susceptible individuals and symptomatic infectious individuals  and incubation rate of the exposed individuals  have positive impact on R0. Numerical simulations show that there are fewer high-risk susceptible individuals than the general public when R0<1. This may be due to the fact that high-risk susceptible individuals may prove a bit more difficult to control than the low-risk susceptible individuals as a result of inherited underlying diseases present in them.

METHODS: We conducted a computational approach to screened all commonly used clinical oral hypoglycemic drugs to identify the potential inhibitors for the main protease (Mpro ) of SARS-CoV-2, which is one of the key drug targets for anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. RESULTS: Six antidiabetic drugs with docking scores higher than 8.0 (cutoff value), including repaglinide, canagliflozin, glipizide, gliquidone, glimepiride, and linagliptin, were predicted as the promising inhibitors of Mpro . Interestingly, repaglinide, one of the six antidiabetic drugs employed the highest docking score for Mpro , was similar to a previously predicted active molecule-nelfinavir, which is a potential anti-HIV and anti-COVID-19 drug. Moreover, we found repaglinide shared similar docking pose and pharmacophores with reported ligand (N3 inhibitor) and nelfinavir, demonstrating that repaglinide would interact with Mpro in a similar way.
