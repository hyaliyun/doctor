The diagnosis of PRS not only requires a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt management, but it is often fatal due to rapidly progressive clinical deterioration despite aggressive treatment. The authors, therefore, share the real-world experience of PRS presenting to tertiary care pulmonary center in north India. AIMS: The objectives of the study were to identify etiology, clinical manifestations, treatment modalities and outcomes of patients presenting with PRS. MATERIALS & METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study undertaken at Metro Centre for Respiratory Diseases of patients diagnosed with PRS during the last two years between 2019 and 2021. The patients diagnosed with PRS based on clinical manifestations, serology and biopsies were included in the study. All cases of non-immunological causes of PRS were excluded from the study. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were done to look for associations obtained between survivors and non-survivors. Cox regression analysis was done to estimate the hazard ratios of clinical variables on survival in PRS patients. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients of PRS were included in the study and diagnosis was made based on clinical manifestations, serology as well as biopsies. The mean age of presentation was 45.4 ( 17.8) years and 66.7% of the patients were females. The most common etiology was anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) seen in 83.3% of the cases. The most common symptoms were coughing and fever (80%) followed by dyspnea and hemoptysis (70%) with the mean duration of symptoms being 17.1 (8.9) days. The mortality of PRS patients in our study was 41.6% and these patients had a higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) score (median-26) compared to those patients who survived (median - 15.8). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of PRS, although rare, presents with rapid clinical deterioration leading to a high mortality rate. AAV was the most common cause of PRS as observed in our study. Early recognition and prompt aggressive management strategies with immunosuppressant therapies are essential for better outcomes for the patients.","output":"Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome: A Real-World Experience From a Tertiary Care Pulmonary Center in North India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With more than 100 million confirmed COVID-19 cases as of March 2021, reinfection is still considered to be rare. In light of increasing reports of reinfected COVID-19 patients, the need to better understand the real risk for reinfection is critical, with potential effects on public health policies aimed at containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this descriptive preliminary report, we conducted a large-scale assessment on the country level of the possible occurrence of COVID-19 reinfection within the members of a large healthcare provider in Israel. Out of 149,735 individuals with a documented positive PCR test between March 2020 and January 2021, 154 had two positive PCR tests at least 100 days apart, reflecting a reinfection proportion of 1 per 1000.

Climate change has become a subject of major interest for different levels of our society, such as national governments, businesses, local administration, or citizens. While national and local policies propose mitigation and adaptation strategies for different sectors, public perception is a key component of any implementation plan. This study investigates the CC perception in Romania, based on a national-scale online survey performed in the spring of 2020, aiming to outline the prominence of environmental and CC issues, level of information and interest, perceived causes, changes perceived in meteorological phenomena at the regional scale, perceived impacts, and the psychological representation of the CC. The study investigates single causal factors of perception. We found that particularly (i) the regional differences on climate change intensity strongly bias the perception of CC causes;(ii) age is very likely to influence the acceptance of CC, the importance of environmental issues, and the levels of information and interest;while (iii) age, gender, and place of residence (ruralCurban) are very likely to control the changes perceived in the occurrence of various meteorological phenomena, and their impact. This research is the first statistically relevant analysis ( 4%, statistical significance) developed at national and regional scales and the only study of climate change perception performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania.

However, it has been unclear whether oral FMT was effective for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in dogs. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-month-old, intact male French bulldog was presented with a 4-month history of intermittent large bowel diarrhoea. Physical and clinical examinations did not identify any specific causes for diarrhoea. Real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography detected C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins in a faecal sample. Based on these findings, diarrhoea in the dog was considered to be induced by C. difficile-associated colitis. The dog was treated with oral FMT, in which a faecal solution obtained from a healthy beagle was orally administered to the subject. Stool consistency and frequency and faecal blood and mucus became normal 2C3 days after oral FMT, and real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography was negative for C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B genes and proteins. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: The present case report demonstrated that oral FMT was an effective treatment for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in a dog.

The current report summarizes the challenges and solutions of the transition from an in-person (ie, face-to-face) to a videoconference intervention delivery approach in response to the Coronavirus Disease pandemic. METHOD: Participants included patient-family caregiver dyads who were enrolled in ongoing yoga trials and 2 certified yoga therapists who delivered the yoga sessions. We summarized their experiences using recordings of the yoga sessions and interventionists' progress notes. RESULTS: Out of 7 dyads participating in the parent trial, 1 declined the videoconferenced sessions. Participants were between the ages of 55 and 76 and mostly non-Hispanic White (83%). Patients were mainly male (83%), all had stage III or IV cancer and were undergoing radiotherapy. Caregivers were all female. Despite challenges in the areas of technology, location, and setting, instruction and personal connection, the overall acceptability was high among patients, caregivers, and instructors. Through this transition process, solutions to these challenges were found, which are described here. CONCLUSION: Although in-person interventions are favored by both the study participants and the interventionists, videoconference sessions were deemed acceptable. All participants had the benefit of a previous in-person experience, which was helpful and perhaps necessary for older and advanced cancer patients requiring practice modifications. In a remote setting, the assistance of caregivers seems particularly beneficial to ensure practice safety.

Meanwhile, companies are struggling to cope with the new and evolving security threats in telecommuting using old control methods. Specifically, there is an increased danger of hacking attacks in telecommuting environments. Furthermore, corporate concerns regarding telecommuting security have led to a questioning of existing control methods that no longer seem adequate. Significant research has been conducted on the factors that improve the effectiveness of corporate security policies, such as formal control, informal control, and extrarole behaviors. However, these studies did not consider telecommuting environments, which surged after the COVID-19 outbreak. Telecommuting loosens the physical control over employees and eliminates the collegial environment in which employees encourage each other to protect system information. This study determined how the factors that influence the effectiveness of existing information security policies behave in a telecommuting environment. Our study shows that specification and mandatoriness are the most important factors for an effective telecommuting security policy. We conclude that this sudden change in the working environment has rendered existing security controls obsolete, and specification and mandatoriness are likely to receive increasingly more attention in the growing field of telecommuting security policy.","output":"Factors Affecting Corporate Security Policy Effectiveness in Telecommuting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: Anganwadi centers are the epicenters of health services for many Indian children. The study aims to assess the oral health status, treatment needs, and association with demographic variables, oral health behaviors, and parents' perception among preschoolers in these Anganwadis. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 1200, 3-5-year-old preschoolers from 48 Anganwadis in Belagavi. They were examined in accordance with the WHO Oral Health Pro forma (2013). A self-administered questionnaire assessed their parents' perception of their oral health. SPSS software (version 20) was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square test computed categorical data. One-Way ANOVA test was used for multiple group comparisons. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of dental caries was found to be 76.1% and gingival bleeding was found in 30.4% participants. The most common oral mucosal lesions were ulcers (5.1%) followed by abscess in 4.5% of children. About 67% of the parents perceived their child's oral health as good. A staggering 98.5% of parents had not taken their children to the dentist ever. About 76.8% of the children required prompt treatment. Conclusion: Poor oral health status necessitates prompt action with age-specific targeted interventions for the curtailment of the prevalent oral maladies along with preventive strategies for the rejuvenation and resurrection of the plummeted oral health status for restoring the quality of life, coupled with motivation meted out to utilize the abundant dental services available in Belagavi.

Perineal hernias were repaired bilaterally, incorporating internal obturator muscle transposition and the sacro-tuberal ligament, combined with colopexy, vas deferens pexy with or without cystopexy. Preoperative pattern of defaecation, pattern of micturition and rectal alignment were recorded. Surgical time, bilateral surgical perineal findings, postoperative complications, short-, middle- and long-term (>24 months) scores and recurrence rate were documented. RESULTS A hernia with ectopic tissue and weakness of the pelvic diaphragm was identified bilaterally in all dogs despite the unilateral clinical presentation. The procedure combination was achieved uneventfully in all dogs in 56 to 113 minutes (mean 73 minutes).

Securing water will require more work and time, burdening women and children the most. Currently, the consequences of this time burden to children's development remain understudied. To address this gap, we examine the tradeoff between children's household water collection responsibilities and learning achievement. Using nationally representative data from India, we measure the effect of daily fetching time on primary school children's learning achievement in a two-stage regression model, with rainfall as the instrument. Our analyses indicate that higher fetching times predict lower mathematics (-1.23 standard deviations, 95CI[-2.32, -0.14]), reading (-1.13 standard deviations, 95CI[-2.07, -0.19]), and writing (-1.21 standard deviations, 95CI[-1.89, -0.51]) test scores. These effects are heterogeneous across sex and infrastructure type. For example, we find girls' mathematical and reading skills profit more from reductions in fetching time than boys' (score less affected for boys by  amount: mathematics: =0.26 points, 95CI[0.095, 0.42]; reading: =0.27 points, 95CI[0.054, 0.49]).

The past medical history of our elderly patient (75-year-old female) includes rectum resection with intraoperative cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. In January 2020, the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and concomittant pulmonary embolism. Following 6 weeks of therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, the cancerous colonic section was resected. The patient arrested intraoperatively but was successfully resuscitated. On post-operative day 15, the patient developed arterial anastomosis bleed, which necessitated acute right-sided hemicolectomy. Post-operatively she became pyrexial and COVID-19 was confirmed, but later became apyrexial with symptomatic treatment. Subsequently, the patient developed partial anastomosis insufficiency, which resolved with conservative management. Following three negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, she was successfully discharged from hospital. It is worthy of note that due to the active anastomosis bleed the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor treatment was stopped, and later the patient got infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli were measured preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 4, and 7. A miRNA microarray analysis was used to detect the miRNA expression profiles in injured L5 DRG from SNL, DRT, and VRT on POD 7. Validation of miRNA expression was performed by qPCR and in situ hybridization. Rats receiving SNL displayed significantly higher mechanical hypersensitivity, but those receiving DRT developed higher thermal hypersensitivity. The number of miRNAs that were significantly upregulated in L5 DRG was 49 (7.2%), 25 (3.7%), and 146 (21.5%) following SNL, DRT, and VRT, respectively. On the other hand, 35 (5.1%) miRNAs were significantly downregulated in the SNL group, 21 (3.1%) miRNAs in the DRT group, and 41 (6.0%) miRNAs in the VRT group. Of the four miRNAs that were mutually aberrant in all three models, two were significantly upregulated (twofold), miR-21 and miR-31, and two were significantly downregulated, miR-668 and miR-672. Using in situ hybridization, miRNA-21, miRNA-31, miRNA-668, and miRNA-672 were found to localize to neurons in the DRG. Collectively, the mutual abnormal miRNA expression of miR-21, miR-31, miR-668, and miR-677 implied that these miRNAs may be therapeutic targets for alleviating multiple forms of neuropathic pain.","output":"miRNA Expression Change in Dorsal Root Ganglia After Peripheral Nerve Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Full genome sequences are increasingly used to track the geographic spread and transmission dynamics of viral pathogens.

Nafamostat has recently been reported as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19. However, there is a lack of information on the compatibility of nafamostat with the aforementioned drug classes. This study evaluated the physical compatibility of nafamostat with these drug classes. METHODS: Nafamostat was combined with 1-3 target drugs (fentanyl, morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and rocuronium). Fifteen physical compatibility tests were conducted. Nafamostat was dissolved in 5% glucose solution; the final concentration was 10 mg/mL. All other medications were diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain clinically relevant concentrations. The power of hydrogen (pH) of all medications was measured during each test. Compatibility tests were conducted with four test solutions wherein nafamostat and the target drugs were compounded at equal volume ratios (1:1, 1:1:1, or 1:1:1:1). Visual appearance, turbidity, and pH were evaluated immediately after mixing and at 1 and 3 hours. Physical incompatibilities were defined as gross precipitation, cloudiness, appearance of the Tyndall effect, or a turbidity change of 0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) based on nafamostat. RESULTS: The mean pH of nafamostat was 3.13  0.03. The combination of nafamostat, fentanyl, and dexmedetomidine had the highest pH (3.39  0.01; 3 hours after mixing).

This article sheds light on polio vaccine as a possibility on COVID-19 prophylaxis because this vaccine was developed through a rigorous process of the various phases of development. The polio vaccine could provide another option to combat COVID-19 and if we have more options, we can fight more effectively against the pandemic. The polio vaccine is utilized globally with a highly satisfactory retort and very good immune responses. By seeing a satisfactory cross-protective immune response, the polio vaccination could be repurposed and offered against COVID-19 for an effective immuno-prophylaxis and protection. This article focusses on the repurposing of vaccines/drugs for COVID-19 and discusses the scientific rationale behind the suggestive use of the polio vaccine against COVID-19 because the polio vaccine is FDA-approved less expensive, readily available, easy to administer, and highly safe.","output":"Repurposing of Polio Vaccine in Prevention of Covid-19: Thinking towards More Options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes several emerging molecular assays that have potential applications in the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory viral infections.

Its influence reaches all organs and cell types, representing an integral component of approximately 10% of the human proteome, and encompassing hundreds of key enzymes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency is strikingly common, affecting up to a quarter of the population in developing countries, but also affecting distinct populations in the developed world as a result of lifestyle, age, and disease-mediated factors. Consequently, zinc status is a critical factor that can influence antiviral immunity, particularly as zinc-deficient populations are often most at risk of acquiring viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes current basic science and clinical evidence examining zinc as a direct antiviral, as well as a stimulant of antiviral immunity. An abundance of evidence has accumulated over the past 50 y to demonstrate the antiviral activity of zinc against a variety of viruses, and via numerous mechanisms. The therapeutic use of zinc for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and the common cold has stemmed from these findings; however, there remains much to be learned regarding the antiviral mechanisms and clinical benefit of zinc supplementation as a preventative and therapeutic treatment for viral infections.","output":"The Role of Zinc in Antiviral Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral particles in the lung epithelium, the concentration of glycosylated angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in the lung epithelium, and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset, which may be related to both.

It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.","output":"Hyperglycemia, hydroxychloroquine, and the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND : Since the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 began, our understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to this virus has continued to evolve.

Moreover, the protective effects of antibodies against new SARS-CoV-2 variants still remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence and associated demographic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in anti-nucleocapsid IgG-positive and anti-nucleocapsid IgG-negative healthcare workers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in Peshawar Medical College group of hospitals of Prime Foundation. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG sero-positive and anti-nucleocapsid IgG sero-negative healthcare workers were followed for a period of 6 months (from 1 Aug 2020 to 31 Jan 2021), and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: A total number of 555 cohorts were followed for a period of 6 months; of them 365 (65.7%) were anti-nucleocapsid-negative (group A) and 190 (34.3%) were anti-nucleocapsid-positive (group B) healthcare workers.

COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and the emergence was especially concerning to the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) stationed in the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea), which remains vital to peace and security of the East Asian region. The first wave of cases emerged in South Korea from China before a globally established response, which forced USFK into a challenging position to combat a novel virus with countless unknowns regarding effective control and portended impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As cases began to emerge in South Korea, USFK in early February began to proactively formulate peninsula-wide preventative health measures to protect the force. Eventually, USFK spearheaded a uniquely proactive Operation Kill the Virus that targeted COVID-19 as an enemy that must be rigorously defended against. Through the operation, USFK systematically employed eight key principles to successfully combat the pandemic, which are documented in this article. RESULTS: The operations eight principles focused on (1) Treat it like a combat operation, (2) Protect the force to protect the mission, (3) Stay one step ahead of the curve by exercising an abundance of caution, (4) Use predictive analysis, (5) Maintain open and transparent dialog with the community every day, (6) Be empathetic but prepare the community for lifestyle and culture changes, (7) Follow and enforce rules, and finally (8) Keep your foot on the gas and fight complacency. By closely collaborating with the ROK government, especially the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USFK effectively limited the number of locally acquired cases, including service members, families, and civilians, to 24 by April 2020. Vital to that success was ensuring a sufficient capability and capacity to test, trace, treat, and logistically support with personal protective equipment and sufficient infrastructure for quarantine and isolation. As the pandemic shifted to the USA and Europe, new cases in the ROK shifted from locally acquired to imported from international travelers. Fundamental to USFKs sustained preservation of readiness and training included aggressive quarantine and testing of all arrivals from the United States of America (USA), identification of hotspots in all installations, and perpetual fine-tuning of the operations principles in collaboration with the ROKs aggressive approach to eradicate COVID-19 from the peninsula. CONCLUSIONS: In successfully executing the operation, USFK imparts three main lessons for future outbreaks. First, a military command should execute a health response similar to how it executes combat operations against a battlefield enemy. Second, the command should maintain flexibility to new changes or risks that alter courses of action. And finally, engagement with the local community, host nation, and international partners should not be compromised when formulating strategies. The USFKs immediate recognition of the public health threat by all levels of leadership and medical personnel enabled a unique and highly effective Operation Kill the Virus that engaged all members of the community, both local and international.","output":"Responding to COVID-19 Among U.S. Military Units in South Korea: The U.S. Forces Koreas Operation Kill the Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fungi contribute to upwards of 1.5 million human deaths annually, are involved in the spoilage of up to a third of food crops, and have a devastating effect on plant and animal biodiversity. Moreover, this already significant issue is exacerbated by a rise in antifungal resistance and a critical requirement for novel drug targets. Quadruplexes are four-stranded secondary structures in nucleic acids which can regulate processes such as transcription, translation, replication, and recombination. They are also found in genes linked to virulence in microbes, and quadruplex-binding ligands have been demonstrated to eliminate drug resistant pathogens. Using a computational approach, we identified putative quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in 1362 genomes across the fungal kingdom and explored their potential involvement in virulence, drug resistance, and pathogenicity. Here we present the largest analysis of PQS in fungi and identified significant heterogeneity of these sequences throughout phyla, genera, and species. Moreover, PQS were genetically conserved. Notably, loss of PQS in cryptococci and aspergilli was associated with pathogenicity. PQS in the clinically important pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans were located within genes (particularly coding regions), mRNA, repeat regions, mobile elements, tRNA, ncRNA, rRNA, and the centromere. Genes containing PQS in these organisms were found to be primarily associated with metabolism, nucleic acid binding, transporter activity, and protein modification. Finally, PQS were found in over 100 genes associated with virulence, drug resistance, or key biological processes in these pathogenic fungi and were found in genes which were highly upregulated during germination, hypoxia, oxidative stress, iron limitation, and in biofilms. Taken together, quadruplexes in fungi could present interesting novel targets to ameliorate fungal virulence and overcome drug resistance.","output":"Cross kingdom analysis of putative quadruplex-forming sequences in fungal genomes: novel antifungal targets to ameliorate fungal pathogenicity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought new challenges for global health systems.

In silico methods for comprehensively estimating abundances across all proteins are still missing. RESULTS: We propose a novel method using deep learning to extrapolate the observed protein expression values in label-free MS experiments to all proteins, leveraging gene functional annotations and RNA measurements as key predictive attributes. We tested our method on four datasets, including human cell lines and human and mouse tissues. Our method predicts the protein expression values with average R2 scores between 0.46 and 0.54, which is significantly better than predictions based on correlations using the RNA expression data alone. Moreover, we demonstrate that the derived models can be \\"transferred\\" across experiments and species. For instance, the model derived from human tissues gave a R2 = 0.51 when applied to mouse tissue data.

In a world of global supply chains and complex industrial development processes, seaports and port operators play an integral role of utmost importance and act as an incentive to the development of the marine economy and particularly, the national economy in general. Most importantly, the supply chain and demand shocks of Covid-19 on container ports and the container shipping industry have intensified competition among terminal operators. Thus, it is imperative that managers evaluate competitiveness by measuring their past and current performance efficiency indexes. In so doing, we present a hybrid data envelopment analysis (DEA) model that combines the DEA Malmquist method and the epsilon-based measure (EBM) for the first time to address the issue of performance evaluation of seaport terminal operators. The applicability of the proposed hybrid approach is illustrated with a case study of the top 14 seaport companies in Vietnam. First, the Malmquist model is used to assess the total productivity growth rates of the companies, and its decomposition into technical efficiency change (catch-up) and technological investment (frontier-shift). Second, the EBM model is used to calculate the efficiency and inefficiency score of each company. Besides indicating the best-performing companies from certain aspects during the research period (2015C2020), the results reflect that the gap of applying the EBM method in the field of the maritime industry was successfully addressed, and together with the Malmquist model, the integrated framework can be an effective and equitable evaluation model for any area.

Results Out of 281 study participants, 95 (33.8%) were detected to have COVID-19 and 42 (14.9%) died. Among COVID-positive study subject's death rate was 28.4%. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis; increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.02 [1.00-1.03]), gender (males) (AOR = 2.51 [1.27-4.96]), presenting symptom (cough) (AOR = 2.88 [1.46-5.70]), co-morbidity (hypothyroidism) (AOR = 4.59 [1.45-14.56]) and delay between symptom onset and admission (>2 days) (AOR = 2.46 [1.19-5.07]) were significant predictors of COVID-19 infection among study participants adjusted with other co-morbidities (diabetes and hypertension). Similarly, place of residence (outside Patna district) (AOR = 2.38 [1.03-5.50]), co-morbidity (diabetes) (AOR = 3.08 [1.12-8.50]), intensive care unit (ICU) requirement at admission (yes) (AOR = 9.47 [3.98-22.52]) and COVID status (positive) (AOR = 6.33 [2.68-14.96]) were significant predictors of death among the study participants whereas place of residence (outside Patna district) (AOR = 4.04 [1.33-12.28]) and ICU requirement at admission (yes) (AOR = 7.22 [2.54-20.52]) were attributes affecting death of COVID-positive study participants. Conclusion Risk of COVID-19 infection among the study participants was high. Age, gender and co-morbidities increased the risk of infection. COVID-19 infection negatively impacted the treatment outcome of the study participants. Age, co-morbidity and ICU requirement were the other attributes affecting mortality.","output":"Epidemiological determinants of COVID-19 infection and mortality: A study among patients presenting with severe acute respiratory illness during the pandemic in Bihar, India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aging of our society is associated with an increasing number of insufficiency fractures of the pelvis and the current standard of care is pain control and early mobilization.

The positive-sense RNA from the 5' end to nucleotide (nt) 2327, which covers the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and a part of the coding region of HCV structural proteins, interacted with HCV core protein, while no interaction was observed in the same region of negative-sense RNA and in other regions of viral and antiviral sense RNAs. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) exists around the 5'UTR of HCV; therefore, the interaction of the core protein with this region of HCV RNA suggests that there is some effect on its cap-independent translation. Cells expressing HCV core protein were transfected with reporter RNAs consisting of nt 1 to 709 of HCV RNA (the 5'UTR of HCV and about two-thirds of the core protein coding regions) followed by a firefly luciferase gene (HCV07Luc RNA). The translation of HCV07Luc RNA was suppressed in cells expressing the core protein, whereas no significant suppression was observed in the case of a reporter RNA possessing the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus followed by a firefly luciferase. This suppression by the core protein occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of the E1 envelope protein of HCV or beta-galactosidase did not suppress the translation of both HCV and EMCV reporter RNAs. We then examined the regions that are important for suppression of translation by the core protein and found that the region from nt 1 to 344 was enough to exert this suppression. These results suggest that the HCV core protein interacts with viral genomic RNA at a specific region to form nucleocapsids and regulates the expression of HCV by interacting with the 5'UTR.","output":"Interaction of hepatitis C virus core protein with viral sense RNA and suppression of its translation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consensus is still lacking on the ideal treatment of turbinate hypertrophy concurrent with rhinoseptoplasty.

We evaluated a screening strategy combining chest computed-tomography (CT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) in our cancer center located in a COVID-19 French hotspot during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Chest CT images were proposed during the radiotherapy CT simulation. Images were reviewed by an expert radiologist according to the CO-RADS classification. Nasal swabs with RT PCR assay were initially proposed in case of suspicious imaging or clinical context and were eventually integrated into the systematic screening. A dedicated radiotherapy workflow was proposed for COVID-19 patients to limit the risk of contamination. RESULTS: From March 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020, 480 patients were screened by chest CT, with 313 patients having both chest CT and RT-PCR (65%). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 5.4%, 95%CI [3.6, 7.8] (26 patients out of 480). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made before RT for 22 patients (84.6%) and during RT for 4 patients (15.3%). Chest CT directly aided the diagnosis of 7 cases for whom the initial RT-PCR was negative or not feasible; out of a total of 480 patients (1.5%) and 517 chest CT acquisition. Four patients with COVID-19 at the time of the chest CT screening had a false negative CT. Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT screening in patients with both RT-PCR and chest CT testing were estimated to be 0.82, 95% CI [0.60, 0.95] and 0.98, 95% CI [0.96, 0.99] respectively.Adaptation of the radiotherapy treatment was made for all the patients with seven postponed treatments (median=5 days, IQR [1.5, 14.8]).

She was referred to our department because of a large hepatic tumor. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen was 27.1 ng/mL upon laboratory examination. CT scanning showed a large low-density tumor (90  70 mm) in the right lobe of the liver, and MRI revealed a multilobulated and fibrous tumor, which was observed as high signal intensity on T2- and diffusion-weighted images and low signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Positron emission tomography-CT revealed peritoneal dissemination and cancer spread to the muscles of the back. Finally, she was diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with dissemination and metastases. We performed a tumor biopsy to determine a treatment plan for chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For hybridoma production, mice were injected by intramuscular-electroporation with GP DNA vaccines, and boosted with GP vaccines. The spleen cells were used for producing GP-specific hybridoma. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot assay, flow cytometry, and virus-neutralizing assay were used to test the ability of monoclonal IgG antibodies to recognize GP and neutralize Ebola virus. RESULTS: Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the presence of both IgG heavy and light chains by Western blot assay, were chosen as a possible IgG producer. Among these, five clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) were identified to secrete monoclonal IgG antibodies. When the monoclonal IgG antibodies from the 5 clones were tested for their antigen specificity, they recognized GP in an antigen-specific and IgG dose-dependent manner. They remained reactive to GP at the lowest tested concentrations (1.953C7.8 ng/mL). In particular, IgG antibodies from clones D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 recognized the native forms of GP expressed on the cell surface. These antibodies were identified as IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b kappa types and appeared to recognize the native forms of GP, but not the denatured forms of GP, as determined by Western blot assay. Despite their GP-binding activity, none of the IgG antibodies neutralized Ebola virus infection in vitro, suggesting that these antibodies are unable to neutralize Ebola virus infection.

As a result, the pressure on the healthcare system increased exponentially, exceeding its capacities and leaving hospitals in near collapse. This scenario caused multiple constraints, particularly for hospital medical staff. Previous studies conducted at different moments during the pandemic reported that COVID-19 has had significant negative impacts on healthcare workers psychological health, including stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and sleep disturbances. However, there are many uncertainties regarding the professional quality of life of hospital nurses and physicians. To address gaps in previous research on secondary traumatic stress, we focused on healthcare workers working in hospitals affected by a major traumatic event: the third wave of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to identify the contribution of personal and work-related contextual variables (gender, age, parental status, occupation, years of experience, working with patients affected by COVID-19) on professional quality of life of healthcare workers. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with a web-based questionnaire given to physicians and nurses working in a hospital setting. A total of 853 healthcare professionals (276 physicians and 586 nurses; median age 37 years old) participated in the survey assessing professional quality of life compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout. Factors of professional quality of life were assessed using regression analysis. RESULTS: Most of the participants showed moderate (80%; n = 684) or high (18%; n = 155) levels of compassion satisfaction, whereas the majority of them experienced moderate levels of burnout (72%; n = 613) and secondary traumatic stress (69%; n = 592). The analyzed variables demonstrated no differences between professionals who were directly or not involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. Parental status was found to be a significant factor in compassion satisfaction. Female gender was significantly associated with more susceptibility to secondary traumatization. Factors that may potentially contribute to burnout include years of professional experience and the number of work hours per week. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new challenge for the healthcare system. Burnout and secondary traumatic stress can lead to medical errors and impact standards of patient care, particularly compromising compassionate care. It is therefore recommended that hospitals develop psychoeducational initiatives to support professionals in dealing with barriers to compassion.","output":"Professional Quality of Life Among Physicians and Nurses Working in Portuguese Hospitals During the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diet is one of the strongest modifiable risk factors for hypertension.

Older adults completed an anonymous online survey to collect data including personal characteristics, behaviors, and health conditions during May-September 2020. Sleep Health was assessed with a survey of satisfaction, timing, efficiency, and duration of sleep along with daytime alertness. Pearson correlations were used to explore relationships between age, education, socioeconomic status, pain, depression, and QOL. Participants (N=509) were primarily female (n=392, 77%), white (n=466; 92%), college educated (n=471, 93%) and with a mean age of 75.6 years (SD=5.0; range 63-93 years). Mean Sleep Health score was 7.4 (SD=2.1; range 0-10).

Poorer Sleep Health among older adults during the initial months of the pandemic were associated with depression, pain, and reduced QOL. Sleep, depression, and pain have reciprocal relationships that may have lasting consequences on physical and mental health among older adults.

We outline some of the key evolutionary genetic aspects of viral emergence. We emphasize that, although the high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide them with great adaptability and explain why they are the main cause of emerging diseases, their limited genome size means that they are also subject to major evolutionary constraints. Understanding the mechanistic basis of these constraints, particularly the roles played by epistasis and pleiotropy, is likely to be central in explaining why some RNA viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries. Viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV, with the suggestion that this virus is a recombinant between mammalian and avian coronaviruses.

The translation of the best fit model yielded two scores composed of 11 criteria: contact with a COVID-19 positive case (+3 points for COVID-19; 0 point for dengue), return from travel abroad within 15 days (+3/-1), previous individual episode of dengue (+1/+3), active smoking (?3/0), body ache (0/+5), cough (0/-2), upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (?1/-1), anosmia (+7/-1), headache (0/+5), retro-orbital pain (?1/+5), and delayed presentation (>3 days) to hospital (+1/0). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.79 (95%CI 0.76C0.82) for COVID-19 score and 0.88 (95%CI 0.85C0.90) for dengue score. Calibration was satisfactory for COVID-19 score and excellent for dengue score. For predicting COVID-19, sensitivity was 97% at the 0-point cut-off and specificity 99% at the 10-point cut-off. For predicting dengue, sensitivity was 97% at the 3-point cut-off and specificity 98% at the 11-point cut-off. CONCLUSIONS: COVIDENGUE scores proved discriminant to differentiate COVID-19 and dengue from OFIs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 testing center during a co-epidemic.","output":"Differentiating COVID-19 and dengue from other febrile illnesses in co-epidemics: Development and internal validation of COVIDENGUE scores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information on the cardiac manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is scarce. We performed a systematic and comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation within 24 hours of admission and were compared with reference values. Echocardiographic studies included left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and valve hemodynamics and right ventricular (RV) assessment, as well as lung ultrasound. A second examination was performed in case of clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (32%) had a normal echocardiogram at baseline. The most common cardiac pathology was RV dilatation and dysfunction (observed in 39% of patients), followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). Patients with elevated troponin (20%) or worse clinical condition did not demonstrate any significant difference in LV systolic function compared with patients with normal troponin or better clinical condition, but they had worse RV function. Clinical deterioration occurred in 20% of patients. In these patients, the most common echocardiographic abnormality at follow-up was RV function deterioration (12 patients), followed by LV systolic and diastolic deterioration (in 5 patients). Femoral deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 5 of 12 patients with RV failure. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic function and RV function are impaired. Elevated troponin and poorer clinical grade are associated with worse RV function. In patients presenting with clinical deterioration at follow-up, acute RV dysfunction, with or without deep vein thrombosis, is more common, but acute LV systolic dysfunction was noted in &#8776;20%.","output":"Spectrum of Cardiac Manifestations in COVID-19: A Systematic Echocardiographic Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic placed an unprecedented demand on the NHS. In response, high-intensity rotas were implemented with short notice. This project aimed to fairly and safely step down the COVID response rota as normal working patters resumed.A cross-sectional survey was distributed to doctors on the medical COVID rota. It explored their views on the step-down process. The majority of respondents (68%) had concerns including discrepancy between on calls and lack of opportunity to plan leave. A document of key themes in the feedback was prepared and presented to senior clinical managers.Intervention and ImprovementThe new rota produced ensured an even distribution of shifts and honoured pre-existing leave. The new rota was compliant and ran to completion for every trainee. Comparison of stepping down to the trust rota vs our new rota reduced inter-trainee shift variation. Night shift discrepancy SD reduced from 2.89 to 0.97, long day (ward cover) on-calls reduced from SD 3.57 to 1.12 and long day (take) shifts SD 0.98 to 0.56.Following implementation a second cross-sectional survey was distributed. 85% agreed or strongly agreed that there was sufficient staffing levels on call and 80% agreed or strongly agreed that there was sufficient staffing levels on the wards. 95% found they were able to take their annual leave and 80% agreed or strongly agreed that there was an even distribution of on-call and night shifts.ConclusionThe success of our project relied on good engagement with colleagues to collect a representative view for leverage in discussions with seniors, and produced a result that was fairer for trainees, sustainable, and preferable for rota coordinators and senior clinical management.

Innate immunity activation plays a central role in the development of ALI. Innate immunity is activated through families of related pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved microbial motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors were the first major family of PRRs discovered in mammals. Recently, NACHTCleucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors and retinoic acidCinducible geneClike receptors have been added to the list. It is now understood that in addition to recognizing infectious stimuli, both Toll-like receptors and NACHT-LRR receptors can also respond to endogenous molecules released in response to stress, trauma and cell damage. These molecules have been termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It has been clinically observed for a long time that infectious and noninfectious insults initiate inflammation, so confirmation of overlapping receptor-signal pathways of activation between PAMPs and DAMPs is no surprise. This review provides an overview of the PRR-dependent mechanisms of ALI and clinical implication.

Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene products are produced following HIV-1 infection to limit viral replication, but viral proteins and RNAs counteract their effect. One such mechanism is specifically directed against the IFN-induced Protein Kinase PKR, which is centrally important to the cellular antiviral response. In the presence of viral RNAs, PKR is activated and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2. This shuts down the synthesis of both host and viral proteins, allowing the cell to mount an effective antiviral response. PACT (protein activator of PKR) is a cellular protein activator of PKR, primarily functioning to activate PKR in response to cellular stress. Recent studies have indicated that during HIV-1 infection, PACT's normal cellular function is compromised and that PACT is unable to activate PKR. Using various reporter systems and in vitro kinase assays, we establish in this report that interactions between PACT, ADAR1 and HIV-1-encoded Tat protein diminish the activation of PKR in response to HIV-1 infection.

Discuss whether prepubertal depression shows longitudinal continuity with depression in adulthood.? Summarize existing literature on adult emotional and functional outcomes of prepubertal depression and internalizing problems. BACKGROUND Adolescent- and young adult-onset depression are common, recurrent, and can cause significant distress and psychosocial impairment across the life span, but recognition of prepubertal internalizing problems and depression, along with their prevalence, clinical course, and long-term outcomes, remains elusive. OBJECTIVE To examine whether prepubertal depression, which can manifest differently from adult depression, shows longitudinal continuity with depression in adulthood, and to summarize existing literature on adult emotional and functional outcomes of prepubertal depression and internalizing problems. METHODS A scoping review was conducted for peer-reviewed cohort articles published between 2000 and 2020 using PubMed and PsycINFO. From 4309 identified references, 17 articles were included. RESULTS Prepubertal depression confers increased risk of recurrence of depression in adulthood, with similar findings for prepubertal internalizing problems. No studies found prepubertal depression or internalizing problems predicting adult substance abuse, and no studies asked about adult bipolar diagnoses. More research is needed to draw clear conclusions regarding their implications for other psychiatric, medical, or psychosocial outcomes. CONCLUSION The reviewed studies provide limited evidence that prepubertal depression onset predicts adult depression. The small evidence base and heterogeneous methodological assessments may limit, however, the ability to draw meaningful conclusions about the long-term course of prepubertal-onset depression. Well-designed studies with longer follow-up and multiple assessments in adulthood are needed to clarify and assess the potential effects of prepubertal depression on adult health and functioning.

While blanket measures are slowly being lifted and infection numbers are monitored, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and the freedom necessary for a functioning society long-term in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Here, we propose a regional strategy with locally triggered containment measures that can largely circumvent this trade-off and substantially lower the magnitude of restrictions the average individual will have to endure in the near future. For the simulation of future disease dynamics and its control, we use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, taking into account the regional structure of each country and their past lockdown efficiency. Overall, our analysis shows that tight regional control in the short term can lead to long-term net benefits due to small-number effects which are amplified by the regional subdivision and crucially depend on the rate of cross-regional contacts. We outline the mechanisms and parameters responsible for these benefits and suggest possible was to gain access to them, simultaneously achieving more freedom for the population and successfully containing the epidemic.

DON is not common in GO patients, reportedly occurring in only about 5% of patients. The pathogenesis of severe DON is considered to involve both muscular nerve strangulation and impaired blood flow. There is some objective grading of physical examination findings and the severity of GO, including a clinical activity score (CAS) and EUropean Group On Graves Orbitopathy (EUGOGO), but no specialized protocol completely characterizes DON. Most clinicians have decided that the combination of clinical activity findings, including visual acuity, color vision, and central critical fusion frequency, and radiological findings, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to diagnose DON. MRI has the most useful findings, with T2-weighted and fat-suppressed images using short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences enabling detection of extraocular changes including muscle and/orbital fat tissue swelling and inflammation and, therefore, disease activity. The first-choice treatment for DON is intravenous administration of steroids, with or without radiotherapy. Unfortunately, refractoriness to this medical treatment may indicate the need for immediate orbital decompression within 2 weeks. Especially in the acute phase of DON, thyroid function is often unstable, and the surgeon must always assume the risk of general anesthesia and intra- and post-operative management. In addition, there are currently many possible therapeutic options, including molecular-targeted drugs. The early introduction and combination of these immunomodulators, including Janus kinase inhibitors and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor antibody (teprotumumab), may be effective for GO with DON.

Effective patient risk stratification is essential to guiding hospitalization decisions and the clinical management of AHF. Clinical decision support systems can be used to improve predictions of mortality made in emergency care settings for the purpose of AHF risk stratification. In this study, several models for the prediction of seven-day mortality among AHF patients were developed by applying machine learning techniques to retrospective patient data from 236,275 total emergency department (ED) encounters, 1881 of which were considered positive for AHF and were used for model training and testing. The models used varying subsets of age, sex, vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was compared to the Emergency Heart Failure Mortality Risk Grade (EHMRG) model, a commonly used system for prediction of seven-day mortality in the ED with similar (or, in some cases, more extensive) inputs. Model performance was assessed in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: When trained and tested on a large academic dataset, the best-performing model and EHMRG demonstrated test set AUROCs of 0.84 and 0.78, respectively, for prediction of seven-day mortality. Given only measurements of respiratory rate, temperature, mean arterial pressure, and FiO(2), one model produced a test set AUROC of 0.83. Neither a logistic regression comparator nor a simple decision tree outperformed EHMRG. CONCLUSIONS: A model using only the measurements of four clinical variables outperforms EHMRG in the prediction of seven-day mortality in AHF.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 72 patients with IHIS and 3330 patients with OHIS. RESULTS: IHIS accounted for 2% of all patients with ischemic stroke and occurred more often in cardiology and orthopedic surgery wards. Infection, cardiac disease, and pulmonary disorder were the most common causes of hospitalization. Compared with those with OHIS, patients with IHIS had higher levels of immune-inflammatory markers, initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, longer hospital stays, higher rates of heart disease, large-artery atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, received more intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or endovascular thrombectomies (EVTs), more complications, unfavorable outcomes, and mortality. Every immune-inflammatory marker exhibited positive correlations with initial NIHSS scores and discharge modified Rankin Scale scores among patients with OHIS. NLR and SII were higher among patients with a fatal outcome in both groups. Among patients receiving IVT, most of treatment time intervals were shorter for those with IHIS than those with OHIS. Significant factors for mortality were NLR >5.5, atrial fibrillation, and complications, with a C-statistic of 0.897 in those with IHIS; in those with OHIS, these factors were an initial NIHSS score of >10, NLR >6.0, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, cancer history, and complications with a C-statistic of 0.902. The results were similar after replacing the NLR with SII. CONCLUSION: Patients with IHIS had more complicated clinical features, higher levels of immune-inflammatory markers, and higher rates of mortality than patients with OHIS. The most significant predictor for mortality among those with OHIS was NIHSS score >10, and the predictors among patients with IHIS were NLR >5.5 and SII >2120.","output":"Comparison of Clinical Features, Immune-Inflammatory Markers, and Outcomes Between Patients with Acute In-Hospital and Out-of-Hospital Ischemic Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization has declared the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world a global public health emergency. It is well-known that the spread of the disease is influenced by peoples willingness to adopt preventative public health behaviors, which are often associated with public risk perception. In this study, we present the first assessment of public risk perception of COVID-19 around the world using national samples (total N = 6,991) in ten countries across Europe, America, and Asia. We find that although levels of concern are relatively high, they are highest in the UK compared to all other sampled countries. Pooled across countries, personal experience with the virus, individualistic and prosocial values, hearing about the virus from friends and family, trust in government, science, and medical professionals, personal knowledge of government strategy, and personal and collective efficacy were all significant predictors of risk perception. Although there was substantial variability across cultures, individualistic worldviews, personal experience, prosocial values, and social amplification through friends and family in particular were found to be significant determinants in more than half of the countries examined. Risk perception correlated significantly with reported adoption of preventative health behaviors in all ten countries.

As cases rise, increased pressure on health services, combined with severe disruption to people's everyday lives, can adversely affect individuals living with chronic illnesses, including people with epilepsy. Stressors related to disruption to healthcare, finances, mental well-being, relationships, schooling, physical activity, and increased isolation could increase seizures and impair epilepsy self-management. We aim to understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on the health and well-being of people with epilepsy focusing on exposure to increased risk of seizures, associated comorbidity, and mortality. We designed two online surveys with one addressing people with epilepsy directly and the second for caregivers to report on behalf of a person with epilepsy. The survey is ongoing and has yielded 463 UK-based responses by the end of September 2020. Forty percent of respondents reported health changes during the pandemic (na?=a?185). Respondents cited a change in seizures (19%, na?=a?88), mental health difficulties (34%, na?=a?161), and sleep disruption (26%, na?=a?121) as the main reasons. Thirteen percent found it difficult to take medication on time. A third had difficulty accessing medical services (na?=a?154), with 8% having had an appointment canceled (na?=a?39). Only a small proportion reported having had discussions about epilepsy-related risks, such as safety precautions (16%, na?=a?74); mental health (29%, na?=a?134); sleep (30%, na?=a?140); and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP; 15%, na?=a?69) in the previous 12a?months. These findings suggest that people with epilepsy are currently experiencing health changes, coupled with inadequate access to services. Also, there seems to be a history of poor risk communication in the months preceding the pandemic.

COVID-19, as a pandemic, has led many researchers from different biomedical fields to find solutions or treatments to manage the pandemic. However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date. Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy. In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patients immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment.

Among cases of TIBOLA, a case of scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after tick bite (SENLAT) is diagnosed when an eschar is present on the scalp, accompanied by peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP). Only a few cases of SENLAT caused by Bartonella henselae have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male sought medical advice while suffering from high fever and diarrhea. Three weeks before the visit, he had been hunting a water deer, and upon bringing the deer home discovered a tick on his scalp area. Symptoms occurred one week after hunting, and a lump was palpated on the right neck area 6 days after the onset of symptoms. Physical examination upon presentation confirmed an eschar-like lesion on the right scalp area, and cervical palpation revealed that the lymph nodes on the right side were non-painful and enlarged at 2.5  1.5 cm. Fine needle aspiration of the enlarged lymph nodes was performed, and results of nested PCR for the Bartonella internal transcribed spacer (ITS) confirmed B. henselae as the causative agent.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research is to determine whether video consultations are noninferior to face-to-face consultations in treating chronic headache patients referred to a specialist in Northern Norway. METHODS: Patients included in the study were recruited from general practice referrals to a specialist at a neurological department in Northern Norway (Troms?) and diagnosed according to the International Headache Society classification system. In a randomized controlled design, the 1-year remission rate of chronic headache (change from 15 to <15 headache days per month during the last 3 months), patient satisfaction with a specialist consultation, and need for follow-up consultations by general practitioners were compared between groups consulted by video and face-to-face in a post hoc analysis. Data were collected by interview (baseline) and questionnaire (follow-up). RESULTS: From a baseline cohort of 402 headache patients consecutively referred from general practice to a specialist over 2.5 years, 58.0% (233/402) were classified as chronic headache and included in this study. Response rates were 71.7% (86/120) in the video group and 67.3% (76/113) in the face-to-face group. One-year remission from chronic headache was achieved in 43.0% (37/86) in the video group and 39.5% (30/76) in the face-to-face group (P=.38). Patient satisfaction with consultations were 86.5% (32/37; video) and 93.3% (28/30; face-to-face; P=.25). A total of 30% (11/37) in the video group and 53% (16/30) in the face-to-face group consulted general practitioners during the follow-up period (P=.03), and median number of consultations was 1 (IQR 0-13) and 1.5 (IQR 0-15), respectively (P=.19). CONCLUSIONS: One-year remission rate from chronic headache was about 40% regardless of consultation form. Likewise, patient satisfaction with consultation and need for follow-up visits in general practice post consultation was similar. Treating chronic headache patients by using video consultations is not inferior to face-to-face consultations and may be used in clinical neurological practice.

We also oversampled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk mitigation behaviors among this population. RESULTS: Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic White individuals) included at the state-level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0C6.0).

Methods As part of Testing Denmark, a nationwide sero-epidemiological surveillance survey, we conducted a study between January 8th and January 31st, 2021 with recruitment in 13 selected SH areas in Denmark. Participants were offered a point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody test and a questionnaire concerning previous testing (viral throat- and nasopharyngeal swab or antibody test), test results for COVID-19, demographics, household characteristics, employment, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and history of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Data on seroprevalence from Danish blood donors in same period using a total Ig ELISA assay were used as a proxy for the general Danish population. Findings Of the 13,279 included participants, 2,296 (17.3%) were seropositive (mean age 46.6 (SD 16.4) years, 54.2% female), which was 3 times higher than in the general Danish population (mean age 41.7 (SD 14.1) years, 48.5% female) in the same period (5.8%, risk ratios (RR) 2.96, 95% CI 2.78-3.16, p>0.001). Seropositivity was higher among males than females (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.05-1.22%, p=0.001) and increased with age, with an OR seropositivity of 1.03 for each 10-year increase in age (95% CI 1.00-1.06, p=0.031). Close contact with COVID-19-infected individuals was associated with a higher risk of infection, especially among members of the same households (OR 5.0, 95% CI 4.1-6.2 p<0,001). Adjusted for age, gender and region living at least 4 people in a household significantly increased the OR of seropositivity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p=0.02) as did living in a multi-generational household (OR 1.3 per generation, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p=0.007).

To gain a broader understanding of the association between Mu rhythm and visuomotor skill performance, a study design that considers both a control moderator (the difference in skill level) and the ability to manipulate Mu rhythm (i.e., either increase or decrease Mu rhythm) is required. To achieve this, we recruited 30 novice golfers who were randomly assigned to either the increased Mu rhythm group (IMG), decreased Mu rhythm group (DMG), or sham group (SG) and used electroencephalographic-neurofeedback training (EEG-NFT) to manipulate Mu rhythm during a golf putting task (complex visuomotor skill). The aim was to determine whether the complexity of the motor skill was a potential moderator of Mu rhythm.

INTERVENTION: Compare the Nutrition Impact and Positive Practice (NIPP) approach to a NIPP+ approach. The NIPP approach involves nutrition education and SBC, whereas the NIPP+ adds agricultural inputs, training, and tools to support improved farm and water quality practices. The intervention effect will be measured through lower levels of aflatoxin in grain, lower water contamination, and improved knowledge on nutrition and health. DESIGN: This is a three-arm cluster-randomized controlled superiority trial (cRCT). The study arms include the following: group 1: NIPP; group 2: NIPP+, and group 3: control. Groups 1 and 2 will receive a 12-week intervention (NIPP or NIPP+) with active monitoring and longitudinal follow-up at 2, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Additionally, an in-depth process and performance evaluation of each intervention arm will be undertaken using quantitative and qualitative methods. A total of 60 clusters from 5 subcounties of the Agago district will be randomly selected, and 15 households per cluster will be recruited using specific inclusion/exclusion criteria for a total of 900 households (300/arm). Respondents for the qualitative portion will be purposely selected. ANALYSIS: We will collect data from all participants at 3 time points: baseline, endline, and 12 months post-intervention. The analysis will utilize intent-to-treat (ITT) using the initial randomization of the treatment arms to determine the overall impact of having the NIPP vs. NIPP+ vs. control. Mixed effects models will be used to determine the role of time-variant and invariant individual household, and community characteristics, as well as measures of exposure and integration on key outcome indicators.

Studying the effects of evolving personal technology helps researchers understand both the detriments of widespread adoption and the benefits that accompany the technology. One such area of concern is the relationship of technology with loneliness. Emerging adulthood is described as the period of transition from adolescence to adulthood, taking place from age 18-25. This period is characterized by change, exploration, but also a vulnerability to psychological distress. Young adults are not only at greater risk of loneliness compared to other developmental stages, but report greater distress about being lonely (Rokach, 2000). Previous research has found support for the hypothesis that use of social communication on the Internet has a bidirectional relationship with loneliness (Nowland et al., 2018); use of the Internet can support relationships and decrease loneliness, but if used as a compensation for social skill deficits, the Internet can also displace quality time spent in relationships, and thereby increase loneliness. This study examines loneliness and its relationship with smartphone use, while also accounting for individual differences in facets of neuroticism, communication apprehension, emotional support, and nomophobia for emerging adults. Participants (N = 302; MAGE = 18.85) completed self-report measures of loneliness and the individual differences variables. They also reported average daily smartphone data of screen time, pickups, and application (app) use, which was measured by their personal devices. Correlations indicated loneliness was positively associated with screen time, social media app use, neuroticism, social recognition, communication anxiety, and nomophobia. Loneliness was negatively associated with smartphone pickups, communication application use, need for affiliation, and emotional support. A regression analysis revealed that neuroticism, need for affiliation, social recognition, emotional support, and smartphone pickups were significant predictors of loneliness, when taking into account all the individual difference and smartphone use variables. Neuroticism and loneliness have a strong relationship, but a hierarchical regression showed that over and above neuroticism and its facets, smartphone screen time and pickups predict loneliness. Overall, the results for this sample of emerging adults supported the hypotheses by Nowland et al. (2018) about social use of the Internet, but applied to smartphone use. More time spent on one's smartphone and on social media apps is related to increased loneliness, and is discussed in context of identity development. More frequent use (pickups) and use of communication apps is related to decreased loneliness and is discussed with respect to development of relationship intimacy. These results suggest that loneliness in young adults is related to different types of smartphone use, even when accounting for stable characteristics such as personality. Finally, neuroticism remains a significant variable in understanding loneliness, and further examination of lower-order facets help define a more nuanced profile in individual differences.","output":"Loneliness unlocked: Associations with smartphone use and personality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Audiovisual distraction (AVD) is an expanding anxiety-minimising technique for patients undergoing surgery under regional anaesthesia (RA). We evaluated patient satisfaction with AVD in the setting of conscious RA for limb surgery using patient reported experience measures (PREMs). Service evaluation using PREMs, via standardised post-operative patient questionnaire, in a single tertiary referral centre for orthopaedic and plastic surgery over an 18-month period. Outcome measures included impact of AVD on peri-operative anxiety, comfort, satisfaction and comparison with previous general anaesthesia (GA) experiences. 50 adult patients undergoing elective limb surgery under RA  sedation were provided with a wifi-enabled tablet device peri-operatively and completed a post-operative questionnaire regarding their AVD experience. 100% were satisfied with AVD and would recommend to others. 78% were anxious before or during the procedure, of which 97% felt that AVD improved their anxiety levels. Of the 94% with previous experience of GA, 89% reported a 'better' experience with RA + AVD. PREMs regarding AVD were encouraging and lay a foundation for further clinical service development and research into incorporation of this technique for appropriate RA patient groups.

We propose to elucidate the implications of SARS-CoV2 copies in concurrent nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), whole mouth fluid (WMF) and respiratory droplet (RD) samples on disease pathogenesis/transmission. METHODS: SARS-CoV2 copies quantified by RT-PCR in concurrent NPS, WMF and RD samples from 80 suspected COVID-19 patients were analysed with demographics, immune response and disease severity. RESULTS: Among the 55/80 (69 %) NPS-positive patients, SARS-CoV2 was detected in 44/55 (80 %) WMF (concordance with NPS-84 %; p = 0.02) and 17/55 (31 %) RD samples. SARS-CoV2 copies were similar in NPS (median:8.74  10^5) and WMF (median:3.07  10^4), but lower in RD (median:3.60  10^2). The 25-75 % interquartile range of SARS-CoV2 copies in the NPS was significantly higher in patients who shed the virus in WMF (p = 0.0001) and RD (p = 0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that hospitalized patients shed significantly higher virus copies in the WMF (p = 0.01). Hospitalized patients with more severe disease (p = 0.03) and higher IL-6 values (p = 0.001) shed more SARS-CoV2 virus in the RD. CONCLUSIONS: WMF may be used reliably as a surrogate for diagnosis. High copy numbers in the NPS probably imply early disease onset, while in the WMF and RD may imply more severe disease and increased inflammation.","output":"Implications in the quantification of SARS-CoV2 copies in concurrent nasopharyngeal swabs, whole mouth fluid and respiratory droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate immunity involves direct interactions between the host and microorganisms, both pathogenic and symbiotic, so natural selection is expected to strongly influence genes involved in these processes.

The paper proposes the Investment Multiplier (IM) as such a tool. The author's model was generated based on a detailed description of developing multiplier processes to analyze its action. The study aims to estimate the IM values of the economies of Kurgan, Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk, the most industrially developed Russian regions, and identify the main points of their economic growth. The key research method was regression analysis. The present study establishes interconnectivity between marginal propensity and savings, marginal propensity and imports, marginal tax rate, and investment accelerator, and their influence on the regional multiplier. From a position of investment multiplier, the authors try to narrow the research gap in how investment policies influence the economic growth of the Russian regions. The study results determine IM values for the analyzed regions, identifying their differences and reasons. The key points of economic growth in these regions were identified. The scientific novelty involves applying changes in regional multiplier processes' dynamics to determine the key development points. The practical significance is that the IM value is an analytical tool that will identify existing key points of regional economic development and, by managing the IM value, create new points for investments with a large-scale multiplier effect, thus developing the regional economy. ? 2022 by the authors.

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

Patients' demographic characteristics and clinical CP outcomes were documented in detail. Genetic testing was performed. The effect of SPINK1 mutations on the clinical development of PC was explored using Cox proportional hazards regression. Subgroup analyses conducted included the consideration of gender, onset age of CP (early- and late-onset), etiologies of CP, smoking, and alcoholic drinking status. RESULTS: PC was diagnosed in 2.5% (24/965) of patients, and the cumulative incidence rates were 0.2%, 0.8%, and 1.5% at 3, 5, and 10 years since the onset of CP, respectively. In this cohort, SPINK1 c.194+2T > C was the most common variant with a proportion of 39.1%.

Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were analyzed. ICH rates among all strokes were compared to the same time period in 2019 in two-week time intervals. Correlation of systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to clinical outcomes were performed. RESULTS: Of 324 patients who presented with stroke, 65 (20%) were diagnosed with non-traumatic ICH: 8 had confirmed and 3 had highly suspected COVID-19. Nine (82%) had at least one associated risk factor for ICH. Three ICHs occurred during inpatient anticoagulation.

Several experimental studies have shown that this treatment has been used effectively to treat RH. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of ablation parameters (i.e., electrode length, applied voltage, ablation time, and blood flow) on the temperature distribution using a balloon-based array electrodes system. A simplified three-dimensional model including four electrodes and a balloon was established. The balloon diameter was 3 mm and placed in a 5 mm diameter renal artery for forming intra-arterial occlusion. Four electrodes were mounted on the balloon and distributed in the same plane to mimic circumferential RF ablation. Computer simulations were conducted to investigate the thermal performances of the device by setting different electrode configurations, treatment protocols, and physiological factors. The thermal performances including the thermal distribution, maximum lesion depth, length, and area were analyzed. The lesion shape of the array RF electrodes was approximately a sphere with a 100% circumference coverage rate of the renal artery. The lesion depth and length increase with each factor except for blood velocity. Increasing the electrode length from 2 to 4 mm or 2 to 6 mm, the lesion depth increases by 1.15 mm and 0.54 mm at 60 s. The corresponding lesion length increases by 2.65 mm and 2.34 mm, respectively. The range of effective lesion depth is 1.90-4.90 mm, at a voltage of 15-30 V. But the peak temperature at the arterial outer wall exceeded 100 C when the voltage is above 25 V. In tissue, the degree of thermal injury in the 2 mm area reached 100%, but in blood was not more than 5%. There was no significant difference at different flow conditions because the difference value in lesion depth was not exceeded 0.5 mm. The results showed that the balloon-based four electrodes system is expected to overcome the difficulty of incomplete ablation. In clinical application, 2 mm-electrode is recommended to avoid long wall damage as much as possible and control the voltage below 25 V. This treatment has little thermal injury on the blood, which means it may avoid coagulation formation.

HCoV-EMC was found to infect the human respiratory tract (polarized airway epithelium cell line Calu-3, embryonic fibroblast cell line HFL, and lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549), kidney (embryonic kidney cell line HEK), intestinal tract (colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2), liver cells (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7), and histiocytes (malignant histiocytoma cell line His-1), as evident by detection of high or increasing viral load in culture supernatants, detection of viral nucleoprotein expression by immunostaining, and/or detection of cytopathic effects. Although an infected human neuronal cell line (NT2) and infected monocyte and T lymphocyte cell lines (THP-1, U937, and H9) had increased viral loads, their relatively lower viral production corroborated with absent nucleoprotein expression and cytopathic effects. This range of human tissue tropism is broader than that for all other HCoVs, including SARS coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, which may explain the high mortality associated with this disease. A recent cell line susceptibility study showed that HCoV-EMC can infect primate, porcine, and bat cells and therefore may jump interspecies barriers.

STUDY DESIGN: : This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who had a medication abortion up to 77 days gestation at the University of Hawaii between April and November 2020. Patients had the option of traditional in clinic care or telemedicine with either in clinic pickup or mailing of medications. During this time, a no-test protocol for medication abortion without prior labs or ultrasound was in place for eligible patients. The primary outcome was the rate of successful medication abortion without surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes included abortion-related complications. RESULTS: : A total of 334 patients were dispensed mifepristone and misoprostol, 149 (44.6%) with telemedicine with in-person pickup of medications, 75 (22.5%) via telemedicine with medications mailed, and 110 (32.9%) via traditional in person visits. The overall rate of complete medication abortion without surgical intervention was 95.8%, with success rates of 96.8, 97.1, and 93.6% for the clinic pickup, mail, and clinic visit groups, respectively. Success for those without an ultrasound performed prior to the procedure was 96.6%, compared to 95.5% for those with ultrasound. We obtained follow up data for 87.8% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: : Medication abortion was safe and effective while offering multiple modes of care delivery including telemedicine visits without an ultrasound performed prior to dispensing medications. IMPLICATIONS: : Incorporating telemedicine and a no-test protocol for medication abortion is safe and has the potential to expand access to abortion care. All care models had low rates of adverse events, which contradicts the idea that the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy increases the safety of medication abortion.","output":"Provision of medication abortion in Hawaii during COVID-19: Practical experience with multiple care delivery models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study classified the severity of aphasia through the Western Aphasia Battery and determined the optimal cut-off value for each Language-Related White Matter fiber and their combinations, we further examined the correlations between Language-Related White Matter and Western Aphasia Battery subscores.

We studied how their serum levels were associated with allergy status, intratonsillar/nasopharyngeal virus detection and intratonsillar expression of T cell- and innate immune response-specific cytokines, transcription factors and type I/II/III interferons in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. METHODS: 110 elective tonsillectomy patients participated. Serum levels of vitamins A, 25(OH)D, and E, LL-37 and allergen-specific IgE as well as nasopharyngeal/intratonsillar respiratory viruses were analyzed. The mRNA expression of IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet in tonsils were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 16 years (range 3C60), 28% of subjects had atopy, and 57% carried 1 respiratory virus in nasopharynx. Detection of viruses decreased by age. Higher vitamin A levels showed borderline significance with less viral detection (P = 0.056). Higher 25(OH)D was associated with less allergic rhinitis and atopy (P < 0.05) and higher vitamin E with less self-reported allergy (P < 0.05). In gene expression analyses, 25(OH)D was associated with higher IL-37, vitamin A with higher IFN- and vitamin E with less IL-28 (P < 0.05). LL-37 was associated with less FOXP3, RORC2 and IL-17 in tonsils (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D and E levels were associated with less allergic disorders.

Tests without portable air purifiers produced an air exchange rate of 3.8-7.4. The transportation time between the start of aerosol injection and detection at other sensors was 1.3 - 3.6 minutes indicating that even smaller droplets would be well-dispersed in the room before being removed by the ventilation system or settling. Short curtains surrounding the beds had little effect on aerosol distribution while long curtains helped in increasing both the Air Changes per Hour (ACH) and transportation time. The best configuration was 4 purifiers (effective ACH: 11.6) in the corners of the room (with curtains) and exhausting towards the ceiling.

In 2018, the Puerto Rico Department of Health included the HPV vaccine as a school-entry requirement for children ages 11-12. Currently, the requirement extends to students ages 11-16. Since the announcement in 2017 of the new school-entry requirement as a preventive cancer strategy, many groups have expressed opposition. Although studies have documented the barriers and facilitators for implementing this policy on the island, qualitative studies assessing stakeholders' views against the implementation of the new requirement are lacking. We aimed to describe stakeholders' perspectives who opposed the HPV vaccine and the implementation as a school-entry requirement in PR. Methods: In-depth interviews (n=8) were conducted between March 2019-January 2020. Healthcare providers, religious leaders, and coalition spokespersons were interviewed. The Consolidated Framework for Research Implementation (CFIR) was used to develop the semi-structured interview guide. CFIR domains (and constructs) included were characteristics of individuals (knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the HPV vaccination, school-entry requirement, and exemptions), intervention characteristics (current practices, advantages and disadvantages of the implementation), and implementation procedures (planning, commitment of implementers and evaluation). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in Spanish. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Additional constructs were derived from CFIR constructs and emergent codes were included. Results: The most common CFIR domain observed was individual characteristics (knowledge and beliefs), of which HPV hesitancy and vaccine distrust were emergent themes. Arguments against the policy also cited the adverse effects of the vaccine under the intervention characteristics domain (evidence strength and quality). Lastly, excessive government interference was discussed by stakeholders in which concerns regarding the HPV vaccine school-entry requirement and how this policy does not align with their values of religious freedom, parental, educational and sexual rights were mentioned. Conclusion: Despite the recent documented positive impact of the school-entry requirement in HPV immunization rates in PR, many continue to oppose the vaccine mandate. Stakeholders' arguments against the HPV vaccine policy, including knowledge and beliefs, and excessive government interference, echo concerns of other mandated vaccines reported in the literature. Understanding arguments against school-entry requirements is necessary to tailor educational campaigns to increase vaccination rates, which were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prevent HPV-related cancers, and reduce the hesitancy in of school-entry policies in the future.","output":"Understanding views against the HPV vaccine school-entry requirement in Puerto Rico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants of the progression and severity of COPD.

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are at highest thrombotic risk. The incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients is not definitely established, with studies reporting an incidence rate of 25-27%. Discussion: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, studies are reporting increased incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU. But there are not many studies reporting the incidence of DVT in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Elevated levels of D-dimer indicate hypercoagulability, but it can also indicate inflammation. 68% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had elevated D-dimer levels. Thus, D-dimer level at the time of admission does not co-relate with the development of VTE or its related complications in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that out of the total number of non-ICU COVID-19 patients who had signs or symptoms suggestive of DVT, 50% were detected to be positive on compression ultrasound scan. While some studies and international guidelines recommend the administration of LMWH in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, some studies recommend that the physicians should closely monitor patients for development of signs and symptoms of DVT, and perform prompt diagnostic tests to aid early diagnosis and initiate anticoagulation. Hence, the treatment protocols vary widely across institutions, and the decision of thromboprophylaxis is also made on a case-by-case basis. Conclusion: Further studies are needed to establish the incidence of DVT in non-ICU patients, the predictive value of d-dimer levels to detect DVT risk, and an optimal therapeutic regimen of prophylactic anti-coagulant therapy in these patients.","output":"Deep vein thrombosis in non-icu covid-19 patients: An additional risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The threat caused by the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus pandemic has thrown everyone into a panic mode including scientists, medical practitioners and pharmaceutical firms trying to discover a drug for its treatment.

The following preoperative variables were independently related to an increased odds of AUD after bariatric surgery: male sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.14 [95% CI, 1.51-3.01]; P < .001), younger age (age per 10 years younger with preoperative AUD: AOR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.68], P = .03; age per 10 years younger without preoperative AUD: AOR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.65-2.30], P < .001), smoking (AOR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.19-5.58]; P = .02), regular alcohol consumption ( 2 drinks/week: AOR, 6.37 [95% CI, 4.17-9.72]; P < .001), AUD (eg, at age 45, AOR, 11.14 [95% CI, 7.71-16.10]; P < .001), recreational drug use (AOR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.37-4.14]; P = .01), lower sense of belonging (12-item Interpersonal Support Evaluation List score per 1 point lower: AOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.15]; P = .01), and undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure (AOR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.40-3.08]; P < .001; reference category: laparoscopic adjustable gastric band procedure). CONCLUSION In this cohort, the prevalence of AUD was greater in the second postoperative year than the year prior to surgery or in the first postoperative year and was associated with male sex and younger age, numerous preoperative variables (smoking, regular alcohol consumption, AUD, recreational drug use, and lower interpersonal support) and undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure.","output":"Prevalence of alcohol use disorders before and after bariatric surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the dynamics of cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing using the Richards model.

Mining terms and revealing the semantic relationships between terms can help biomedical researchers find solutions to some major health problems and motivate researchers to explore innovative biomedical research issues. However, how to mine terms from biomedical literature remains a challenge. At present, the research on text segmentation in natural language processing (NLP) technology has not been well applied in the biomedical field. Named entity recognition models usually require a large amount of training corpus, and the types of entities that the model can recognize are limited. Besides, dictionary-based methods mainly use pre-established vocabularies to match the text. However, this method can only match terms in a specific field, and the process of collecting terms is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Many scenarios faced in the field of biomedical research are unsupervised, i.e. unlabelled corpora, and the system may not have much prior knowledge. This paper proposes the TermInformer project, which aims to mine the meaning of terms in an open fashion by calculating terms and find solutions to some of the significant problems in our society. We propose an unsupervised method that can automatically mine terms in the text without relying on external resources. Our method can generally be applied to any document data. Combined with the word vector training algorithm, we can obtain reusable term embeddings, which can be used in any NLP downstream application. This paper compares term embeddings with existing word embeddings. The results show that our method can better reflect the semantic relationship between terms.

Increased knowledge about this important mechanism will confer greater control over related processes and enable a more efficient and green degradation method. DFT calculations showed that in the presence of Fe(IV), OH are formed under acidic conditions and that both the iron and hydroxyl species function as oxidation reagents in the degradation process. The structure of the formed Fe(IV) embedded in the solid matrix was not the typical tetravalent structure. Entrapment in the sol-gel matrix stabilized the catalyst, enhanced its efficiency and enabled it to be recycled. Sol-gel matrices constitute a simple method for the degradation of stable and toxic compounds under extreme pH conditions.

The Omicron variant has been shown to be more transmissible and less virulent than previously circulating variants (2,3). To better understand the severity of disease and health care utilization associated with the emergence of the Omicron variant in the United States, CDC examined data from three surveillance systems and a large health care database to assess multiple indicators across three high-COVID-19 transmission periods: December 1, 2020-February 28, 2021 (winter 2020-21); July 15-October 31, 2021 (SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 [Delta] predominance); and December 19, 2021-January 15, 2022 (Omicron predominance). The highest daily 7-day moving average to date of cases (798,976 daily cases during January 9-15, 2022), emergency department (ED) visits (48,238), and admissions (21,586) were reported during the Omicron period, however, the highest daily 7-day moving average of deaths (1,854) was lower than during previous periods. During the Omicron period, a maximum of 20.6% of staffed inpatient beds were in use for COVID-19 patients, 3.4 and 7.2 percentage points higher than during the winter 2020-21 and Delta periods, respectively. However, intensive care unit (ICU) bed use did not increase to the same degree: 30.4% of staffed ICU beds were in use for COVID-19 patients during the Omicron period, 0.5 percentage points lower than during the winter 2020-21 period and 1.2 percentage points higher than during the Delta period. The ratio of peak ED visits to cases (event-to-case ratios) (87 per 1,000 cases), hospital admissions (27 per 1,000 cases), and deaths (nine per 1,000 cases [lagged by 3 weeks]) during the Omicron period were lower than those observed during the winter 2020-21 (92, 68, and 16 respectively) and Delta (167, 78, and 13, respectively) periods. Further, among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from 199 U.S. hospitals, the mean length of stay and percentages who were admitted to an ICU, received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and died while in the hospital were lower during the Omicron period than during previous periods. COVID-19 disease severity appears to be lower during the Omicron period than during previous periods of high transmission, likely related to higher vaccination coverage,? which reduces disease severity (4), lower virulence of the Omicron variant (3,5,6), and infection-acquired immunity (3,7). Although disease severity appears lower with the Omicron variant, the high volume of ED visits and hospitalizations can strain local health care systems in the United States, and the average daily number of deaths remains substantial. This underscores the importance of national emergency preparedness, specifically, hospital surge capacity and the ability to adequately staff local health care systems.

RESULTS Thirty patients were treated with BTM and delayed split skin grafting. The % graft take had a mean of 81.9% and % BTM take had a mean of 88.6%, demonstrating effective integration of BTM. When managed appropriately, it was possible for BTM to integrate successfully despite findings suggestive of infection. Scar quality improved over time. DISCUSSION These results provide additional clinical evidence on the safety and performance of BTM as an effective dermal substitute in the treatment of patients with deep burn injuries.","output":"Wound healing and dermal regeneration in severe burn patients treated with NovoSorb?

METHODS: Residual sera from 177 symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, and 163 non-COVID-19 patients were tested for antibody with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Chicago, US). Clinical records for COVID-19 patients were reviewed to determine the time from onset of clinical illness to testing. RESULTS: Specificity of the assay was 100.0% (95% CI: 97.1 C 100.0%). The clinical sensitivity of the assay varied depending on time from onset of symptoms, increasing with longer periods since onset of clinical illness. The clinical sensitivity at 6 days was 8.6% (7/81; 95% CI: 3.8 C 17.5%), 7-13 days: 43.6% (17/39; 95% CI: 28.2 C 60.2%), 14-20 days: 84.0% (21/25; 95% CI: 63.1 C 94.7%), and 21 days: 84.4% (27/32; 95% CI: 66.5 C 94.1%). Clinical sensitivity was higher in the 14 days group compared to <14. There were no differences between the 14-20 days and 21 days group; the combined clinical sensitivity for these groups (14 days) was 84.2% (49/57; 71.6 C 92.1%). CONCLUSION: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test has high specificity.

The principal aim of the study was to assess the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infections and sinus rhythm restoration among patients who arrived at the ED with AF. Secondary aims included determining whether patients arriving at the ED principally due to AF delayed their presentations and whether the frequency of successful cardioversion for AF was decreased during the pandemic period. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of medical records of patients admitted to two hospital EDs due to AF during JulyCDecember 2019 (pre-pandemic period) versus JulyCDecember 2020 (pandemic period) was performed. Results: During the study periods, 601 ED visits by 497 patients were made due to the primary diagnosis of AF. The patients were aged 71.2+/?13.5 years and 51.3% were male. The duration of an AF episode before the ED admission was 10 h (4.5C30 h) during the pandemic period vs. 5 h (3C24 h) during the non-pandemic period (p = 0.001). A shorter duration of the AF episode before ED admission was associated with the successful restoration of the sinus rhythm. During the pandemic period, among patients with short-lasting AF who were not treated with Phenazolinum, the restoration of the sinus rhythm was more frequent in the Copernicus Memorial Hospital than in the University Hospital (p = 0.026). A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was found in 5 (1%) patients, while 2 other patients (0.5%) had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 disease noted in their medical history. Conclusions: 1. The number of AF episodes treated in these two EDs was lower during the pandemic than non-pandemic period. 2. The patients with AF appeared at the ED later after AF onset in the pandemic period. 3. Successful cardioversion of atrial fibrillation was more frequent during the pre-pandemic period in one of the two hospitals. 4. A difference of approaches to the treatment of short-lasting AF episodes between EDs during the pandemic period may exist between these two EDs. 5. The patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a small percentage of the patients admitted to EDs due to an AF episode.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Admissions and Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Episodes in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of the building blocks of life such as amino acids and nucleotides are chiral, i.e., different from their mirror image. Contemporary life selects and synthesizes only one of two possible handednesses. In an abiotic environment, however, there are usually equally many left- and right-handed molecules. If homochirality was a prerequisite of life, there must have been physical or chemical circumstances that led to the selection of a certain preference. Conversely, if it was a consequence of life, we must identify possible pathways for accomplishing a transition from a racemic to a homochiral chemistry. After a discussion of the observational evidence, I will review ideas where homochirality of any handedness could emerge as a consequence of the first polymerization events of nucleotides in an emerging RNA world. These mechanisms are not limited to nucleotides, but can also occur for peptides, as a precursor to the RNA world. The question of homochirality is, in this sense, intimately tied to the origin of life. Future Mars missions may be able to detect biomolecules of extant or extinct life.

However, the quantitative and high accuracy bioassays in large hospitals and laboratories usually require trained technicians and equipment that is both bulky and expensive. In addition, the multistep bioassays and long turnaround time could severely affect the disease surveillance and control especially in pandemics such as influenza and COVID-19. In view of this, a portable, quantitative bioassay device will be valuable in regions with scarce medical resources and help relieve burden on local healthcare systems. Herein, we introduce the MagiCoil diagnostic device, an inexpensive, portable, quantitative, and rapid bioassay platform based on the magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) technique. MPS detects the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses the harmonics from oscillating MNPs as metrics for sensitive and quantitative bioassays. This device does not require trained technicians to operate and employs a fully automatic, one-step, and wash-free assay with a user friendly smartphone interface. Using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a model, we show that the detection limit of the current portable device for streptavidin is 64 nM (equal to 5.12 pmole). In addition, this MPS technique is very versatile and allows for the detection of different diseases just by changing the surface modifications on MNPs. Although MPS-based bioassays show high sensitivities as reported in many literatures, at the current stage, this portable device faces insufficient sensitivity and needs further improvements. It is foreseen that this kind of portable device can transform the multistep, laboratory-based bioassays to one-step field testing in nonclinical settings such as schools, homes, offices, etc.","output":"A Portable Magnetic Particle Spectrometer for Future Rapid and Wash-Free Bioassays."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pre-COVID-19, most of the supply chains functioned with more capacity than demand.

Initially, a multiperiod, multiobjective supply chain network is designed that incorporates prices discounts, customer prioritization, and outsourcing strategies. The main objectives are profit and prioritization maximization and time minimization. The introduction of the prioritization objective function having customer ranking as a parameter and considering less capacity than demand and outsourcing differentiates this model from the literature.

We aimed to develop a machine learning-based prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis and design a graphical user interface (GUI) to diagnose COVID-19 cases by recording their symptoms and demographic features. METHODS: We implemented different classification models including support vector machine (SVM), Decision tree (DT), Na?ve Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to predict the result of COVID-19 test for individuals. We trained these models by data of 16973 individuals (90% of all individuals included in data gathering) and tested by 1885 individuals (10% of all individuals). Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) algorithms used to score features for prediction of result of COVID-19 test. A user-friendly GUI was designed to predict COVID-19 test results in individuals. RESULTS: Study results revealed that coughing had the highest positive correlation with the positive results of COVID-19 test followed by the duration of having COVID-19 signs and symptoms, exposure to infected individuals, age, muscle pain, recent infection by COVID-19 virus, fever, respiratory distress, loss of smell or taste, nausea, anorexia, headache, vertigo, CT symptoms in lung scans, diabetes and hypertension.

We measured quantitative lung computed tomography, esophageal pressure swings and total lung stress. RESULTS: Patients were divided in five subgroups based on their baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) (day 1): non-CARDS (median PaO(2)/FiO(2) 361 mmHg, IQR [323C379]), mild (224 mmHg [211C249]), mild-moderate (173 mmHg [164C185]), moderate-severe (126 mmHg [114C138]) and severe (88 mmHg [86C99], p < 0.001). Each subgroup had similar median lung weight: 1215 g [1083C1294], 1153 [888C1321], 968 [858C1253], 1060 [869C1269], and 1127 [937C1193] (p = 0.37).

Treatment failure of CPAP/NIV occurred in 34 patients (24.3%). Only three variables, at day one, distinguished patients with negative outcome: PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (OR 0.99 [0.98C0.99], p = 0.02), esophageal pressure swing (OR 1.13 [1.01C1.27], p = 0.032) and total stress (OR 1.17 [1.06C1.31], p = 0.004).

The aim of this study was to investigate key factors for cellular susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the ocular surface cells. Methods: We combined co-expression and SARS-CoV-2 interactome network to predict key genes at COVID-19 in ocular infection based on the premise that genes underlying a disease are often functionally related and functionally related genes are often co-expressed. Results: The co-expression network was constructed by mapping the well-known angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), TMPRSS2, and host susceptibility genes implicated in COVID-19 genomewide association study (GWAS) onto a cornea, retinal pigment epithelium, and lung. We found a significant co-expression module of these genes in the cornea, revealing that cornea is potential extra-respiratory entry portal of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, both co-expression and interaction networks show a significant enrichment in mitochondrial function, which are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis, inflammation, and innate immune response. We identified a corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of 14 mitochondrial genes by integrating ACE2 co-expression cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome. The gene ECSIT, as a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, exhibits the strongest correlation with ACE2 in CMSM, which has shown to be an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis.

Biobank samples were collected at baseline, day 3 and day 9. The primary end point was admission to the intensive care unit or death during hospitalization, and the prognostic performance of baseline and serial GDF-15 concentrations were compared with that of established infectious disease and cardiovascular biomarkers. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients enrolled, 35 (28%) reached the primary end point; these patients were older, more often had diabetes, and had lower oxygen saturations and higher National Early Warning Scores on baseline. Baseline GDF-15 concentrations were elevated (>95th percentile in age-stratified healthy individuals) in 97 (79%), and higher concentrations were associated with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viremia and hypoxemia (both P<0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had higher concentrations of GDF-15 (median, 4225 [IQR, 3197-5972] pg/mL versus median, 2187 [IQR, 1344-3620] pg/mL, P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70-0.86). The association between GDF-15 and the primary end point persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (P<0.001) and was superior and incremental to interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Increase in GDF-15 from baseline to day 3 was also greater in patients reaching the primary end point (median, 1208 [IQR, 0-4305] pg/mL versus median, -86 [IQR, -322 to 491] pg/mL, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 is elevated in the majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and higher concentrations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, hypoxemia, and worse outcome.

By regulating gene expression, TFs control a plethora of developmental and physiological processes, and their abnormal function commonly leads to various developmental defects and diseases in humans. Normal TF function often depends on gene dosage, which can be altered by copy-number variation or loss-of-function mutations. This explains why TF haploinsufficiency (HI) can lead to disease. Since aberrant TF numbers frequently result in pathogenic abnormalities of gene expression, quantitative analyses of TFs are a priority in the field. In vitro single-molecule methodologies have significantly aided the identification of links between TF gene dosage and transcriptional outcomes. Additionally, advances in quantitative microscopy have contributed mechanistic insights into normal and aberrant TF function. However, to understand TF biology, TF-chromatin interactions must be characterised in vivo, in a tissue-specific manner and in the context of both normal and altered TF numbers.

A cohort approach was used to assess the association between biologics use and steroids treatment and COVID-19 severity and 90-day mortality. Results Overall, 8,242 out of 80,602 tested asthmatics had positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Both biologics and systemic corticosteroids were not associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate analyses revealed that biologics were not associated with a significant increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19, nor with the composite endpoint of moderate-severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality within 90 days. Chronic systemic corticosteroids use was associated with significant increased risk of all tested outcome. Recent (within the prior 120 days) systemic corticosteroids use, but not former use, was significantly associated with increased risk of both moderate-severe COVID-19 and the composite of moderate-severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality.

This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hfner number and the cardiac output). In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles. Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection.The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation. If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff. A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected. In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times. If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO2.","output":"Positionspapier zur praktischen Umsetzung der apparativen Differenzialtherapie der akuten respiratorischen Insuffizienz bei COVID-19./ [Position Paper for the State of the Art Application of Respiratory Support in Patients with COVID-19 - German Respiratory Society]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gold nanoparticles stabilize chymotrypsin (ChT) against denaturation at the air-water interface through catenation and preferential localization of the nanoparticles at the air-water interface with concomitant decrease in interfacial energy.","output":"Stabilization of -chymotrypsin at air-water interface through surface binding to gold nanoparticle scaffolds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued a declaration reflecting what many already realized: racism is a threat to public health and a fundamental cause of health inequity in the United States.

METHODS: We used a stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics and plausible control measures. RESULTS: When no control interventions were in place, we estimated that an outbreak of COVID-19 in New Zealand would occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1,000 population per week, crews of 20 with a voyage length of 10 days and 1 day of shore leave per crew member both in New Zealand and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example, the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combination of PCR testing on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing and mask use during shore leave increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years, or a 49% probability within a year). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks, even with crews of only 5 members. CONCLUSION: This modelling work suggests that the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages.

Several tumour tracking techniques require the implantation of fiducial markers around the tumour, a procedure that involves unnecessary risks and costs. Markerless tumour tracking (MTT) negates the need for implanted markers, potentially enabling accurate and optimal radiotherapy in a non-invasive way. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a phase I interventional trial called MArkerless image Guidance using Intrafraction Kilovoltage x-ray imaging (MAGIK) to investigate the technical feasibility of the MTT technology developed at the University of Sydney (sponsor). 30 participants will undergo the current standard of care lung stereotactic ablative radiation therapy, with the exception that kilovoltage X-ray images will be acquired continuously during treatment delivery to enable MTT. If MTT indicates that the mean lung tumour position has shifted >3 mm, a warning message will be displayed to indicate the need for a treatment intervention. The radiation therapist will then pause the treatment, shift the treatment couch to account for the shift in tumour position and resume the treatment. Participants will be implanted with fiducial markers, which act as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of MTT. MTT is considered feasible if the tracking accuracy is <3 mm in each dimension for >80% of the treatment time. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The MAGIK trial has received ethical approval from The Alfred Human Research Ethics Committee and has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with the Identifier: NCT04086082.

For each customer and separately for years 2014 and 2015, we model the relationship between aggregate measures of cash withdrawals for each year, total inter-terminal distance traversed by the customer for the specific year and reported customer income group. Results reveal that the model was able to predict the corresponding income groups with 80% accuracy, with high precision and recall values in comparison to the baseline model, across both the years. Shapley values suggest that the total inter-terminal distance traversed by a customer in each year differed significantly between customer income groups. Kruskal-Wallis test further showed that customers in the lower-middle class income group, have significantly high median values of inter-terminal distances traversed (7.21 Kms for 2014 and 2015) in comparison to high (2.55 Kms and 0.66 Kms for years 2014 and 2015), and low (6.47 Kms for 2014 and 2015) income groups. Although no major shocks were noted in 2014 and 2015, our results show that lower-middle class income group customers, exhibit relatively high mobility in comparison to customers in low and high income groups.

In the current study, we address this question by investigating the association between existential threats and the certitude of societal discourse. According to appraisal theory, threats give rise to anxiety and perceptions of uncertainty;as such, it predicts that exposure to life-threatening events will increase expressions of uncertainty. An alternative possibility is that people will respond to threats by utilizing psychological compensation mechanisms that will give rise to greater expressions of certainty.

Such innate sensing is mainly controlled by the airway epithelium and the skin. The resulting release of epithelial-derived proinflammatory cytokines and innate alarmins such as GM-CSF, IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP mediates the activation of ILC2 cells and cDCs to promote Th2-biased inflammation. Significant progress in the elucidation of HDM innate immune activation has been made in the past decade and highlighted key roles of the LPS/TLR4 axis, chitin-dependent pathways together with HDM protease allergens. However, the precise mechanisms by which HDM allergens are sensed by the innate immune system remain largely unknown. Such investigations are made difficult for several reasons. Among these are (1) the natural association of HDM allergens with immunostimulators from the mite exoskeleton as well as from environmental microorganisms/pollutants or endosymbiotic bacteria; (2) the purification of individual HDM allergens from extracts in sufficient amounts and devoid of any microbial and protein impurities; (3) the production of correctly folded recombinant HDM allergens which could display the same biological activity than their natural counterparts; (4) the accessibility to human epithelial samples with cellular heterogeneities and inter-donor variations; (5) the translation of experimental data from mouse models to humans is almost missing. The goal of the present mini-review is to emphasize some important limitations and pitfalls in the elucidation of innate immunostimulatory properties of HDM allergens.","output":"Characterization of Innate Immune Responses to House Dust Mite Allergens: Pitfalls and Limitations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: An observational study based on an online survey to explore if the participant had experienced (1) cancellation or delay of scheduled health services (2) reduction of assistance provided by a caregiver (3) barriers to social participation and recreational activities. Three validated questionnaires to investigate well-being and symptoms of anxiety and depression were also administered. OBJECTIVES: Our main aim was to quantify the obstacles experienced by adults living with SCI in Italy during COVID-19 pandemic, to explore the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms and to quantify subjective well-being. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a Spinal Unit in Italy. METHODS: Online survey via direct contact and by e-mail lists. RESULTS: In total, 101 individuals completed the survey. Of, 82.2% participants reported a history of deferment or cancellation of non-COVID-19 health services. The majority (56.4%) revealed that, at least seldom, they have chosen to reduce their usual everyday activities and more than one third (37.6%) affirmed that they had been forced to renounce to one or more of their occupations. Discontinuation of assistance by caregivers was uncommon. The median score of questionnaires measuring depression and anxiety symptoms do not differ significatively when compared with prior studies. The variable that explored the limitations experienced in everyday activities showed a significant correlation with the results of the questionnaires measuring well-being and symptoms of anxiety.

Being a recent virus outbreak, there are still no available therapeutic regimens that have been approved in large randomised trials and so patients are currently being treated with multiple drugs. This raises concerns regarding drug interaction and their implication in arrhythmic burden. In fact, two of the actually used drugs against SARS-CoV2, such as chloroquine and the combination lopinavir/ritonavir, might determine a QT (the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) interval prolongation and they show several interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and antipsychotic medications, making them prone to an increased risk of developing arrhythmias.

METHODS Patients with biopsy-proven ocular MMP treated with RCI from 3 tertiary medical centers were evaluated. Medical records between January 2013 and January 2021 were reviewed and deidentified to retrieve relevant disease-related data. Primary outcome measures included conjunctival inflammatory activity, change in Foster clinical conjunctival scarring staging after RCI treatment, and the development of ocular and systemic complications. RESULTS Included were 15 patients (10 women and 5 men; 36-95 yrs of age) with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Most of the patients (80%) had Foster stage 3 at presentation, and all patients had active MMP. Each patient had failed to respond to at least 1 immunomodulatory drug during the follow-up, and 9 (60%) patients had treatment failure of at least 2 other agents before the use of RCI. The mean duration of RCI treatment was 21 months (range, 3-54 mo). Foster stage did not change in any of the 15 patients at the last follow-up. Nine patients continued RCI therapy at the last follow-up, and in all of them, the disease activity of MMP was well controlled. No serious adverse events because of RCI were documented during the follow-up in any treated patient. CONCLUSIONS RCI may serve as an alternative or an adjunctive treatment in patients with severe and refractory ocular MMP.

However, because of the lack of viable treatments and rapidity of spread, physicians around the world have used them in an attempt to improve survival in critically ill patients. One such drug is Tocilizumab, which was hypothesized to have a role in managing the cytokine release syndrome (Cytokine storm) associated with this illness. We report our experience with 2 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received Tocilizumab and subsequently developed intestinal perforation. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient A was a 74-year-old gentleman with COVID-19 pneumonia whose hospitalization was complicated by development of adynamic ileus presumed secondary to sepsis, that was conservatively managed. Due to worsening tachypnea, tachycardia and higher oxygen requirements, he was given Tocilizumab. 2 weeks into his hospital stay, his surveillance imaging demonstrated small bowel perforation with free intraperitoneal air and intrabdominal abscesses. He was started on antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition and obtained 2 intraperitoneal drains. His further hospital stay was complicated by development of hypotension and asystole cardiac arrest. Patient B was a 65-year-old renal transplant recipient with COVID-19 pneumonia who received Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, convalescent plasma and Tocilizumab. During his hospital stay, he had worsening hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, patient developed fevers with worsening leukocytosis and new pressor requirements. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and imaging demonstrated pneumatosis of ascending colon concerning for impending perforation. After discussion with family members, patient was transitioned towards comfort measures. DISCUSSION: Tocilizumab is an Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist which was used for the profound inflammatory state associated with COVID-19. Recent studies have demonstrated its ineffectiveness in preventing further clinical deterioration, intubation or death in moderately ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In prior studies in rheumatoid arthritis, Tocilizumab was noted to have a higher incidence of lower gastrointestinal perforations, especially with preexisting diverticulitis or steroid use. The exact mechanism of bowel perforation is unclear and is likely multifactorial. Early after bowel injury, there is a substantial increase in Interleukin-6 expression that stimulates epithelial proliferation. Absence of this, in combination with intestinal hypoperfusion seen in critically ill patients may potentially increase the risk of intestinal perforation. Our cases emphasize the importance of close monitoring and caution while using lesser known and more risky medications without clearly established guidelines.","output":"'toci associated toxicity' - a report of tocilizumab associated bowel perforation in two critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 would greatly improve care delivery and resource allocation and thereby reduce mortality risks, especially in less developed countries. Many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, affect disease severity and can be used to aid this prediction. OBJECTIVE: Because rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we aimed to investigate how data from the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 can be used to predict clinical outcomes. METHODS: We investigated clinical data sets of patients with COVID-19 with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and deep learning methods. RESULTS: Our work revealed that several clinical parameters that are measurable in blood samples are factors that can discriminate between healthy people and COVID-19-positive patients, and we showed the value of these parameters in predicting later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We developed a number of analytical methods that showed accuracy and precision scores >90% for disease severity prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We developed methodologies to analyze routine patient clinical data that enable more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. With this approach, data from standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood could be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of mortality, thus enabling optimization of hospital facilities for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Machine Learning Approach to Predicting COVID-19 Disease Severity Based on Clinical Blood Test Data: Statistical Analysis and Model Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 threatens the food security of vulnerable populations across the globe, there is an increasing need to identify places that are affected most in order to target aid.

We apply this approach to assess changes in food insecurity risk during the pandemic in Vietnam. Using national household survey data between 2010 and 2018, we first estimate that a 10% decrease in income leads to a 3.5% increase in food insecurity. We then use the 2019 national Labor Force Survey to predict changes in the share of food-insecure households caused by the income shocks during the pandemic for 702 districts. We find that the small, predicted change in food insecurity risk at the national level masks substantial variation at the district level, and changes in food insecurity risk are larger among young children.

This offers the opportunity to highlight the pathogenetic mechanisms common to COVID19 and several autoimmune diseases, in order to identify new therapeutic targets. In a supposed preliminary pathogenetic model, SARS-CoV-2 plays a direct role in triggering widespread microthrombosis and microvascular inflammation, because it is able to induce transient aPL, endothelial damage and complement activation at the same time. Hence, endothelium might represent the common pathway in which autoimmunity and infection converge.

METHODS Mutation testing in at least one of the eight genes (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], KRAS, ERBB2, AKT1, BRAF, MEK1, NRAS, and PIK3CA) using SNaPshot, mass spectrometry, Sanger sequencing+/- peptide nucleic acid and/or sizing assays, along with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and/or MET fluorescence in situ hybridization, were performed in six labs on 1007 patients from 14 institutions. RESULTS In all, 1007 specimens had mutation analysis performed, and 733 specimens had all 10 genes analyzed. Mutation identification rates did not vary by analytic method. Biopsy and cytology specimens were inadequate for testing in 26% and 35% of cases compared with 5% of surgical specimens. Among the 1007 cases with mutation analysis performed, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and ERBB2 alterations were detected in 22%, 25%, 8.5%, and 2.4% of cases, respectively. EGFR mutations were highly associated with female sex, Asian race, and never-smoking status; and less strongly associated with stage IV disease, presence of bone metastases, and absence of adrenal metastases. ALK rearrangements were strongly associated with never-smoking status and more weakly associated with presence of liver metastases. ERBB2 mutations were strongly associated with Asian race and never-smoking status. Two mutations were seen in 2.7% of samples, all but one of which involved one or more of PIK3CA, ALK, or MET.

Elevated cardiac troponin (cTn), suggestive for myocardial damage, was associated with increased mortality of COVID-19 patients (3,4). However, data addressing the role of cTn in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in COVID-19 patients is scarce. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the role of baseline cTnT and cTnT kinetics in the prediction of MACE and in - hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we assessed the association between cTnT kinetics and the need of cardiac imaging evaluation. METHODS: 310 patients were included prospectively (age 64.616.7 years, 180 (58.1%) males), between March 2020 and April 2020. Clinical data including demographics,medical history,comorbidities,clinical evaluation,laboratory exams,in-hospital treatment,complications and outcomes were collected at admission and during hospitalization by physicians in charge. Two hundred and two patients (65.1%) with at least two cTnT values assessed during hospitalization, at 24C48 hours interval were included in the final analysis. cTnT-values >0.011 micrograms/L were considered elevated, according to hospital laboratory cut-offs. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to cTnT kinetics profile: 1 C variable, 2 C descending and 3 C constant. cTnT slope was defined as the ratio of the cTnT change and the change in time. MACE were considered as the primary endpoint and were composed by all-cause mortality, acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, pericarditis, myocarditis, atrial fibrillation or flutter and pulmonary embolism. In-hospital mortality was considered as the secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Mean hospitalization was 13.90.9 days. MACE occurred in 60 patients (29.7%) and in-hospital mortality in 40 (19.8%) patients. Baseline cTnT independently predicted MACE, (p=0.047, HR 1.805, 95% CI 1.009C3.231) and in-hospital mortality (p=0.009, HR 2.322, 95% CI 1.234C4.369) (Figure 1A, 1B). An increased cTnT slope independently predicted in-hospital mortality (p=0.041, HR 1.006, 95% CI 1.000C1.011). Constant cTnT was associated with lower MACE and mortality rates (p=0,000, HR 3.080, 95% CI, 1.914C4.954, p=0.000, HR 2.851. 95% CI 1.828C4.447, respectively) (Figure 1C, 1D, 2). Cardiac imaging evaluation was performed in 8 (16%) patients with constant cTnT, 30 (60%) with variable cTnT, and 12 (24%) with descending cTnT.(p<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Increased baseline cTnT independently predicted MACE and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The magnitude of cTnT increase over time was associated with in-hospital mortality. On the contrary, patients with constant cTnT had lower MACE and in-hospital mortality rates.

To fill this gap, we systematically reviewed the published scientific literature on the bat fauna found in urban areas of Brazil. The knowledge of urban bats is still incipient and heterogeneously spatially distributed, mostly concentrated in the southeastern region of the country. The assembled list of 84 urban species, of which nineteen are new species records for urban areas (including one new family), represents 47% of the bat richness registered in the country.

Little is known about the disease burden in Laos. We aimed to evaluate the burden and outcomes of AKI as well as assess the availability of AKI treatment in Laos. METHODS: We performed a multicentric prospective observational study in adult patients who had been admitted to 5 intensive care units (ICU) in Laos. The data was serially collected on the first 28 days of ICU admission. Patients were diagnosed by the KDIGO 2012 criteria for AKI. We used AKI occurrence as the primary outcome and explored risk factors on the development and outcomes of AKI. RESULTS: We enrolled 1480 patients from 5 ICU centers across Laos from January to December 2016. After excluding patients with end-stage renal disease and those with incomplete data, AKI occurred in 508 of the 1460 enrolled patients (34.8%). Overall, the rates of maximum AKI staging were 4% for stage 1, 10.3% for stage 2, and 20.5% for stage 3. Risk factors for AKI were older age, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, renal diseases, oncologic diseases, and chronic kidney diseases. Only 1.8% of all participants received RRT. The mortality rate was 28.4% in non-AKI patients compared to 44.5% in AKI patients, which increased according to the stage of AKI (stage 1, 4.9%; stage 2, 28.3%; stage 3 66.8%; P < 0.001). There were 13.6% who were discharged against medical advice.

In contrast, comparatively few studies exists on the role of online activists, defined informally as users who actively participate in socially-minded online campaigns. Automatically discovering activists who can potentially be approached by organisations that promote social campaigns is important, but not easy, as they are typically active only locally, and, unlike influencers, they are not central to large social media networks. We make the hypothesis that such interesting users can be found on Twitter within temporally and spatially localised contexts. We define these as small but topical fragments of the network, containing interactions about social events or campaigns with a significant online footprint. To explore this hypothesis, we have designed an iterative discovery pipeline consisting of two alternating phases of user discovery and context discovery. Multiple iterations of the pipeline result in a growing dataset of user profiles for activists, as well as growing set of online social contexts. This mode of exploration differs significantly from prior techniques that focus on influencers, and presents unique challenges because of the weak online signal available to detect activists. The paper describes the design and implementation of the pipeline as a customisable software framework, where user-defined operational definitions of online activism can be explored. We present an empirical evaluation on two extensive case studies, one concerning healthcare-related campaigns in the UK during 2018, the other related to online activism in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A customisable pipeline for the semi-automated discovery of online activists and social campaigns on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 has had a major impact on the protection of childrens health.

This study aimed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur from presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.MethodsWe surveyed all directors of Japanese public health centers for index cases and secondary patients who possibly contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individual who came under their care before June 20, 2020. The professional staff at the centers routinely perform contact tracing of infected persons based on the guidelines of the Infection Control Act. Four authors independently reviewed reports of 9 index cases of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with 17 secondary patients from 8 prefectures and examined the cases to determine whether transmission from a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual in the presymptomatic or asymptomatic state occurred.ResultsWe reported 7 index cases with 13 secondary patients. 1) An elderly woman acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from her sustained asymptomatic granddaughter at home, 2) 4 guests and 1 accompanying child waiting at a hair salon acquired infection from the presymptomatic female hair stylist, 3) 2 inpatients acquired infection from a presymptomatic nurse while providing nursing care in close contact, 4) an elderly couple acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from their presymptomatic relative who was in the 50s during household care at their home, 5) a man acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic adult neighbor in an enclosed space with poor ventilation, 6) a presymptomatic man had transmitted infection to another man at a coffee shop while having a discussion on business, and 7) a man in his 50s acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection from a presymptomatic man during 50 minutes of close contact at their office and in a car. These secondary patients had no other likely routes of infection. The interval between the date of symptom onset in the presymptomatic index case and the secondary patient ranged from 2 to 6 days.

Data has shown that age, gender and obesity are strongly correlated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. Bariatric surgery is the only treatment that provides significant, sustained weight loss in the severely obese. OBJECTIVES: Examine if prior bariatric surgery correlates with increased risk of hospitalization and outcome severity after COVID-19 infection. SETTING: University Hospital METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 database from a single, NYC-based, academic institution was conducted. A cohort of COVID-19 positive patients with a history of bariatric surgery (n=124) were matched in a 1:4 ratio to a control cohort of COVID-19 positive patients who were eligible for bariatric surgery (BMI >40 kg/m(2) or BMI >35 kg/m(2) with a comorbidity at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis) (n=496). A comparison of outcomes, including mechanical ventilation requirements and deceased at discharge, was done between cohorts using Chi-square test or Fishers exact test. Additionally, overall length of stay and duration of time in ICU were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Conditional logistic regression analyses were done to determine both unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR). RESULTS: A total of 620 COVID-19 positive patients were included in this analysis. The categorization of bariatric surgeries included 36% Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB, n=45), 35% laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n=44), and 28% laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n=35). The body mass index (BMI) for the bariatric group was 36.1 kg/m(2) (SD=8.3), which was significantly lower than the control group, 41.4 kg/m(2) (SD=6.5) (p<0.0001). There was also less burden of diabetes in the bariatric group (32%) compared to the control group (48%) (p=0.0019). Patients with a history of bariatric surgery were less likely to be admitted through the emergency room (UOR=0.39, p=0.0001), less likely to require a ventilator during the admission (UOR=0.42, p=0.028), had a shorter length of stay in both the ICU (p=0.033) and overall (UOR=0.44, p=0.0002), and were less likely to be deceased at discharge compared to the control group (OR=0.42, p=0.028). CONCLUSION: A history of bariatric surgery significantly decreases the risk of emergency room admission, mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU stay, and death in patients with COVID-19. Even when adjusted for BMI and the comorbidities associated with obesity, patients with a history of bariatric surgery still have a significant decrease in the risk of emergency room admission.","output":"Prior Bariatric Surgery in COVID-19 Positive Patients May Be Protective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International medical school graduates (IMGs) play a vital role in the health care system of the United States. They constitute roughly one-quarter of the physician workforce, comprising a significant proportion of the primary care providers in high-need rural and urban areas, where they provide equal and, in some instances, better care than U.S. graduates. Nonetheless, they face a series of hurdles in entering U.S. residency programs and throughout their training experiences.IMGs must expend significant resources to obtain Education Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) certification, which includes Steps 1, 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK), and 2 Clinical Skills (CS) of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).

This included imaging every 1 h from day 0 to day 3, every 2 h from day 4 to day 7, and every 1 h for 24 h at days 14, 21, and 28. Samples also underwent scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, morphometric evaluations, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR. Live-cell imaging revealed an active amoeboid-like movement of gonocytes, assisted by the formation of extensive cytoplasmic projections, which, using scanning electron microscopy, were categorized into spike-like filopodia, leaf-like lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and cytoplasmic blebs. In the first week of culture, gonocytes formed loose attachments on top of a somatic cell monolayer and, in week 2, formed grape-like clusters, which, over time, grew in cell number. Starting at week 3 of culture, some of the gonocyte clusters transformed into large multinucleated embryoid body-like colonies (EBLCs) that expressed both gonocyte- and pluripotent-specific markers. The number and diameter of individual gonocytes, the number and density of organelles within gonocytes, as well as the number and diameter of the EBLCs increased over time (P < 0.05). In conclusion, cultured porcine gonocytes displayed extensive migratory behavior facilitated by their various cytoplasmic projections, propagated, and transformed into EBLCs that increased in size and complexity over time.","output":"Live-cell imaging and ultrastructural analysis reveal remarkable features of cultured porcine gonocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To systematically review clinical and biochemical characteristics associated with the severity of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2)\\\\related disease (COVID\\\\19).

CTX-M-producing GNB are resistant to most ?-lactam antibiotics and are frequently multidrug-resistant, which limits treatment options. Rapid diagnostic tests that can detect ESBL-producing GNB, particularly CTX-M producers, in the urine of patients with UTIs are needed. Results from such a test could direct the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy at the point-of-care (POC). In this study, we show that a chromogenic, dual enzyme-mediated amplification system (termed DETECT [dual-enzyme trigger-enabled cascade technology]) can identify CTX-M-producing GNB from unprocessed urine samples in 30 minutes. We first tested DETECT against a diverse set of recombinant ?-lactamases and ?-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to elucidate its selectivity. We then tested DETECT with 472 prospectively collected clinical urine samples submitted for urine culture to a hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. Of these, 118 (25%) were consistent with UTI, 13 (11%) of which contained ESBL-producing GNB.

In this article, we analyze the state-level correlation between COVID-19 risk and weather/climate factors in the USA. For this purpose, we consider a spatio-temporal multivariate time series model under a hierarchical framework, which is especially suitable for envisioning the virus transmission tendency across a geographic area over time. Briefly, our model decomposes the COVID-19 risk into: (i) an autoregressive component that describes the within-state COVID-19 risk effect; (ii) a spatiotemporal component that describes the across-state COVID-19 risk effect; (iii) an exogenous component that includes other factors (e.g., weather/climate) that could envision future epidemic development risk; and (iv) an endemic component that captures the function of time and other predictors mainly for individual states. Our results indicate that maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, the percentage of cloud coverage, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone have a strong association with the COVID-19 pandemic in many states. In particular, the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone demonstrate statistically significant associations with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading in almost all states. Furthermore, our results from transmission tendency analysis suggest that the community-level transmission has been relatively mitigated in the USA, and the daily confirmed cases within a state are predominated by the earlier daily confirmed cases within that state compared to other factors, which implies that states such as Texas, California, and Florida with a large number of confirmed cases still need strategies like stay-at-home orders to prevent another outbreak.","output":"Analysis of the Spread of COVID-19 in the USA with a Spatio-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we analyze the dynamics among past major pandemics, economic growth, inequality, and social unrest.

Immunosuppressive treatments can modify the disease course but do not effectively promote remyelination or prevent long term neurodegeneration. As a novel approach to mitigate chronic stage pathology, we tested transplantation of mouse induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) into the chronically demyelinated corpus callosum (CC) in adult mice. Male C57BL/6 mice fed 0.3% cuprizone for 12 weeks exhibited CC atrophy with chronic demyelination, astrogliosis, and microglial activation. Syngeneic iNSCs were transplanted into the CC after ending cuprizone and perfused for neuropathology 2 weeks later. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), diffusion-weighted imaging (T2), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantified CC pathology in live mice before and after iNSC transplantation. Each MRI technique detected progressive CC pathology. Mice that received iNSCs had normalized DTI radial diffusivity, and reduced astrogliosis post-imaging. A motor skill task that engages the CC is Miss-step wheel running, which demonstrated functional deficits from cuprizone demyelination. Transplantation of iNSCs resulted in marked recovery of running velocity. Neuropathology after wheel running showed that iNSC grafts significantly increased host oligodendrocytes and proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitors, while modulating axon damage. Transplanted iNSCs differentiated along astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages, without myelinating, and many remained neural stem cells. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of neuroimaging and functional assessments for pre-clinical interventional trials during chronic demyelination and detect improved function from iNSC transplantation.

The focus is on folded -hairpin mimetics, which are designed to mimic -hairpin motifs in biologically important peptides and proteins. An ever-growing number of protein crystal structures reveal how -hairpin motifs often play key roles in proteinCprotein and proteinCnucleic acid interactions. This review illustrates how using protein structures as a starting point for small-molecule mimetic design can provide novel ligands as proteinCprotein interaction inhibitors, as protease inhibitors, and as ligands for chemokine receptors and folded RNA targets, as well as novel antibiotics to combat the growing health threat posed by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The -hairpin antibiotics are shown to target a -barrel outer membrane protein (LptD) in Pseudomonas sp., which is essential for the biogenesis of the outer cell membrane. Another exciting prospect is that protein epitope mimetics will be of increasing importance in synthetic vaccine design, in the emerging field of structural vaccinology. Crystal structures of protective antibodies bound to their pathogen-derived epitopes provide an ideal starting point for the design of synthetic epitope mimetics. The mimetics can be delivered to the immune system in a highly immunogenic format on the surface of synthetic virus-like particles.

The ventilation system used to create the indoor environment would facilitate the transmission of the airborne infectious diseases. However, the existing ventilation systems in most buildings cannot supply sufficient clean outdoor air for diluting the virus concentration. To reduce the airborne infection risk and minimize energy consumption, especially in existing buildings with well-mixed ventilation systems, this investigation used an ultraviolet-C (UV-C) air disinfection device (Rheem's third generation products, RM3) with 99.9% disinfection efficiency to clean air carrying the COVID-19 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) which could help promote environmental sustainability and create healthy cities. This investigation assessed the impact of the RM3 UV-C units on the infection risk, the number of RM3 UV-C units required, and the strategy for decreasing the infection risk, with the use of computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) numerical simulations. An actual office building with a combination of individual offices and workstations was selected as an example for the research. According to the numerical results, the best strategy would be to use a combination of 100% outside air and UV-C in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) ducts with air disinfected by the RM3 UV-C units. The infection risk in the office building could thus be reduced to a negligible level.

The design of manufacturing processes to produce subunit vaccines depends, however, on the inherent biophysical traits presented by an individual antigen of interest. New candidate antigens typically require developing custom processes for each one and may require unique steps to ensure sufficient yields without product-related variants. Results We describe a holistic approach for the molecular design of recombinant protein antigensconsidering both their manufacturability and antigenicityinformed by bioinformatic analyses such as RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and sequence-based prediction tools. We demonstrate this approach by engineering the product sequences of a trivalent non-replicating rotavirus vaccine (NRRV) candidate to improve titers and mitigate product variants caused by N-terminal truncation, hypermannosylation, and aggregation. The three engineered NRRV antigens retained their original antigenicity and immunogenicity, while their improved manufacturability enabled concomitant production and purification of all three serotypes in a single, end-to-end perfusion-based process using the biotechnical yeast Komagataella phaffii. Conclusions This study demonstrates that molecular engineering of subunit antigens using advanced genomic methods can facilitate their manufacturing in continuous production. Such capabilities have potential to lower the cost and volumetric requirements in manufacturing vaccines based on recombinant protein subunits.","output":"Molecular engineering improves antigen quality and enables integrated manufacturing of a trivalent subunit vaccine candidate for rotavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the present work was to develop a simple, specific, and fast high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method to identify and quantify cordifolioside A, 20--hydroxyecdysone and columbin with HPTLC?electrospray ionization?tandem mass spectrometry (ESI?MS/MS) for characterization in Tinospora cordifolia stem extracts. Chromatographic development was performed using a HPTLC aluminum plate, pre-coated with silica gel 60 F(254) with hexane?chloroform?methanol?formic acid as the mobile phase. Densitometric quantification for 20--hydroxyecdysone and cordifolioside A was performed at 254 nm and for columbin at 600 nm after derivatization with anisaldehyde?sulfuric acid. The optimized mobile phase resulted in chromatographic separation of peaks for cordifolioside A, 20--hydroxyecdysone, and columbin at R(F) of 0.12, 0.47, and 0.86, respectively.

We hypothesize that these government-sponsored disinformation campaigns have been positively associated with infectious disease epidemics, including COVID-19, over the last two decades. By integrating global surveys from the Digital Society Project, Global Burden of Disease, and other data sources across 149 countries for the period 2001C2019, we examined the association between government-sponsored disinformation and the spread of respiratory infections before the COVID-19 outbreak. Then, building on those results, we applied a negative binomial regression model to estimate the associations between government-sponsored disinformation and the confirmed cases and deaths related to COVID-19 during the first 300 days of the outbreak in each country and before vaccination began. After controlling for climatic, public health, socioeconomic, and political factors, we found that government-sponsored disinformation was significantly associated with the incidence and prevalence percentages of respiratory infections in susceptible populations during the period 2001C2019. The results also show that disinformation is significantly associated with the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of cases of COVID-19.

During the late stages of infection, viral replication organelles are represented by large cytopathic vacuoles, where replicase complexes bind to membranes of endolysosomal origin. In addition to viral components, these organelles harbor an unknown number of host proteins. In this study, a fraction of modified lysosomes carrying functionally intact replicase complexes was obtained by feeding Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-infected HeLa cells with dextran-covered magnetic nanoparticles and later magnetically isolating the nanoparticle-containing lysosomes. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture combined with quantitative proteomics was used to reveal 78 distinct cellular proteins that were at least 2.5-fold more abundant in replicase complex-carrying vesicles than in vesicles obtained from noninfected cells. These host components included the RNA-binding proteins PCBP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K, which were shown to colocalize with the viral replicase. Silencing of hnRNP M and hnRNP C expression enhanced the replication of SFV, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Sindbis virus (SINV). PCBP1 silencing decreased SFV-mediated protein synthesis, whereas hnRNP K silencing increased this synthesis. Notably, the effect of hnRNP K silencing on CHIKV- and SINV-mediated protein synthesis was opposite to that observed for SFV.

We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. METHODS: We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. RESULTS: Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years, respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. CONCLUSION: Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years, there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics.

The outbreak magnitude and occurrence of multiple Ebola cases in at least seven countries beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, hinted at the possibility of broad-scale transmission of Ebola. MAIN TEXT: Using a modeling tool developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Ebola outbreak, we estimated the number of Ebola cases that might have occurred had the disease spread beyond the three countries in West Africa to cities in other countries at high risk for disease transmission (based on late 2014 air travel patterns). We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola. CONCLUSIONS: The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci. Health security requires robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak.

All patients received single lung dose of 0.5 Gy. Respiratory and systemic inflammatory parameters were evaluated before irradiation, at 24 h and 1 week after LD-RT. Primary endpoint was increased in the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2)) or the pulse oximetry saturation (SpO(2)) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio of at least 20% at 24 h with respect to the preirradiation value.

It is important to frequently evaluate the performance of these tests and this can be done first by an in silico approach. Previously, we reported some mismatches between the oligonucleotides of publicly available RT-qPCR assays and SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from GISAID and NCBI, potentially impacting proper detection of the virus. In the present study, 11 primers and probe sets investigated during the first study were evaluated again with 84,305 new SARS-CoV-2 unique genomes collected between June 2020 and January 2021. The lower inclusivity of the China CDC assay targeting the gene N has continued to decrease with new mismatches detected, whereas the other evaluated assays kept their inclusivity above 99%. Additionally, some mutations specific to new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were found to be located in oligonucleotide annealing sites. This might impact the strategy to be considered for future SARS-CoV-2 testing. Given the potential threat of the new variants, it is crucial to assess if they can still be correctly targeted by the primers and probes of the RT-qPCR assays. Our study highlights that considering the evolution of the virus and the emergence of new variants, an in silico (re-)evaluation should be performed on a regular basis.

Our aim was to describe and compare ultrasound and Doppler findings from pregnant women either SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative evaluated during the pandemic period. METHODS: One hundred and six (106) pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time or within one week of the ultrasound (US) scan were evaluated. There were 49 symptomatic and 57 asymptomatic women. US scans were performed either for routine fetal evaluation, or indicated due to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For comparison, 103 pregnant women (controls) matched for maternal age, parity, body mass index, and gestational age at the time of the US scan were evaluated. Control women did not refer symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the US scan, or when admitted for delivery, and had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test at the time of admission for delivery. Fetal biometry, fetal anatomy, amount of amniotic fluid, Doppler parameters including umbilical and middle cerebral arteries pulsatility indices, cerebro-placental ratio, and biophysical profile (BBP) were evaluated when indicated. All biometry and Doppler values were converted to z-scores for comparisons. Our primary outcome, an adverse prenatal composite outcome (APCPO) included: small for gestational age (SGA) fetus, oligohydramnios, abnormal BPP, abnormal Doppler velocimetry, and fetal death. Comorbidities, delivery information, and neonatal outcomes were registered and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of women SARS-CoV-2 positive, 82.1% had a BMI >25.0 and had a higher prevalence of diabetes (26/106 [24.5%] vs. 13/103[12.6%]; p=0.03), but not of preeclampsia (21/106 [19.8%] vs. 11/105 [10.4%]; p=0.08) as compared to controls. The prevalence of APCPO was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 positive women (19/106 [17.9%]) and controls (9/103 [8.7%]; p=0.06. No differences in the prevalence of SGA fetuses (12/106 [11.3%] vs. 6/103 [5.8%]; p=0.17), fetuses with abnormal Doppler evaluation (8/106 [7.5%] vs. 2/103 [1.9%]; p=0.08), and with abnormal BPP (4/106 [3.7%] vs. 0/103 [0%] between SARS-CoV-2 positive woman and controls were documented. Two fetal deaths and a higher rate of preterm delivery &#8804; 35 weeks of gestation (22/106 vs. 9/103; OR, 2.37 [1.14-4.91] p=0.01) were observed in women SARS-CoV-2 positive as compared to controls.

Gendered racism is a psychosocial stressor that has negative implications for Black women's mental and physical health. This study tested the association between lifetime experiences of gendered racism and subjective cognitive complaints, taking into account the extent to which depressive symptoms and coping styles may explain this association. Method: Data from 75 older Black women (Mage = 62.43, SD = 6.23 years) were collected using an online survey assessing lifetime experiences of gendered racism, depressive symptoms, coping styles (i.e. spirituality, social support, problem-oriented/engagement, and disengagement), and subjective cognitive complaints (i.e. memory, attention, executive functioning, language, and overall cognition). The association between gendered racism and subjective cognitive complaints was examined with simple linear regression. Two mediation models examined depressive symptoms and coping styles as independent mediators of this association. Results: More gendered racism across the lifetime was associated with more subjective cognitive complaints separately through depressive symptoms and disengagement coping, but no other coping styles. Conclusion: Gendered racism is linked to increased subjective cognitive complaints via depressive symptoms and disengagement coping. The study highlights the importance of taking into account lived experiences (gendered racism) that are inextricably linked to social positioning (race and gender) within neuropsychology.

The aim of the current review was to investigate the incidence and profile of cognitive impairments in patients with classical galactosemia. METHOD MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO were searched up to 23 October 2018 for studies examining information processing speed, attention, memory, language, visuospatial functioning, executive functioning and social cognition in patients with confirmed classical galactosemia utilizing standardized neuropsychological tests. Data synthesis followed a narrative approach, since the planned meta-analysis was not possible due to large variability between the neuropsychological assessments. RESULTS Eleven studies were included, including case-studies. The quality of most studies was moderate to low. As a group, patients with classical galactosemia exhibit below average to low scores on all cognitive domains. A large proportion of the patients perform on an impaired level on attention, memory and vocabulary. Evidence for impairments in information processing speed, language, visuospatial functioning and aspects of executive functioning was limited due to the small number of studies investigating these cognitive functions. Social cognition was not examined at all. CONCLUSIONS Given the moderate to low quality of the included studies and the limited evidence in many cognitive domains, the incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with classical galactosemia is not yet clear.

Under an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 state of emergency in Japan served as a nationwide social experiment to investigate the impact of quarantine or isolation on the incidence of KD. OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of droplet or contact transmission in the etiopathogenesis of KD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, longitudinal, cross-sectional study was conducted from 2015 to 2020 at Fukuoka Childrens Hospital and 5 adjacent general hospitals. The number of admissions for KD and infectious diseases were analyzed. Participants were pediatric patients admitted to the participating hospitals for KD or infectious diseases. EXPOSURES: Quarantine and isolation owing to the COVID-19 state of emergency. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end points were the ratios of patients with KD to patients with respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infections admitted from April to May in 2015 to 2019 and 2020. A Poisson regression model was used to analyze them. RESULTS: The study participants included 1649 patients with KD (median [interquartile range] age, 25 [13-43] months; 901 boys [54.6%]) and 15 586 patients with infectious disease (data on age and sex were not available for these patients). The number of admissions for KD showed no significant change between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (mean [SD], 24.8 [5.6] vs 18.0 [4.0] admissions per month; 27.4% decrease; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.10; P = .12). However, the number of admissions for droplet-transmitted or contact-transmitted respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 157.6 [14.4] vs 39.0 [15.0] admissions per month; 75.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17-0.35; P < .001) and gastrointestinal infections (mean [SD], 43.8 [12.9] vs 6.0 [2.0] admissions per month; 86.3% decrease; aIRR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; P < .001) showed significant decreases between April and May in 2015 to 2019 vs the same months in 2020 (total, 12 254 infections). Thus, the ratio of KD to droplet- or contact-transmitted respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections incidence in April and May 2020 was significantly increased (ratio, 0.40 vs 0.12; (2)(1) = 22.76; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the significantly increased incidence of KD compared with respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections during the COVID-19 state of emergency suggests that contact or droplet transmission is not a major route for KD development and that KD may be associated with airborne infections in most cases.","output":"Assessment of Pediatric Admissions for Kawasaki Disease or Infectious Disease During the COVID-19 State of Emergency in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately causes severe disease in older adults and only rarely in children. To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response could contribute to this disparity, we compared nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only relatively subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrated markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including TNF, IFN{gamma}, IL-2 and IL-4 production. Cell type deconvolution confirmed greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibited a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, the primary target for SARS-CoV-2, upon infection with the virus. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.","output":"Upper airway gene expression reveals a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children compared with older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with several neurological complications in adult patients. METHODS: We used a mouse model deficient in TRIF and IPS-1 adaptor proteins, which are involved in type I interferon production, to study the role of microglia during brain infection by ZIKV. Young adult mice were infected intravenously with the contemporary ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (1  10(5) PFUs/100 L). RESULTS: Infected mice did not present overt clinical signs of the disease nor body weight loss compared with noninfected animals. However, mice exhibited a viremia and a brain viral load that were maximal (1.3  10(5) genome copies/mL and 9.8  10(7) genome copies/g of brain) on days 3 and 7 post-infection (p.i.), respectively. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that ZIKV antigens were distributed in several regions of the brain, especially the dorsal hippocampus. The number of Iba1(+)/TMEM119(+) microglia remained similar in infected versus noninfected mice, but their cell body and arborization areas significantly increased in the stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare layers of the dorsal hippocampus cornu ammoni (CA)1, indicating a reactive state. Ultrastructural analyses also revealed that microglia displayed increased phagocytic activities and extracellular digestion of degraded elements during infection. Mice pharmacologically depleted in microglia with PLX5622 presented a higher brain viral load compared to untreated group (2.8  10(10) versus 8.5  10(8) genome copies/g of brain on day 10 p.i.) as well as an increased number of ZIKV antigens labeled with immunogold in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum of neurons and astrocytes indicating an enhanced viral replication. Furthermore, endosomes of astrocytes contained nanogold particles together with digested materials, suggesting a compensatory phagocytic activity upon microglial depletion. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that microglia are involved in the control of ZIKV replication and/or its elimination in the brain. After depletion of microglia, the removal of ZIKV-infected cells by phagocytosis could be partly compensated by astrocytes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate plausible effects on malaria incidence and mortality under different levels of disruption to malaria control. METHODS: Using an established set of spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical models, we generated geospatial estimates across malaria-endemic African countries of the clinical case incidence and mortality of malaria, incorporating an updated database of parasite rate surveys, insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage, and effective treatment rates. We established a baseline estimate for the anticipated malaria burden in Africa in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions, and repeated the analysis for nine hypothetical scenarios in which effective treatment with an antimalarial drug and distribution of ITNs (both through routine channels and mass campaigns) were reduced to varying extents. FINDINGS: We estimated 2152 (95% uncertainty interval 1437-3116) million cases and 3864 (3078-4978) thousand deaths across malaria-endemic African countries in 2020 in our baseline scenario of undisrupted intervention coverage. With greater reductions in access to effective antimalarial drug treatment, our model predicted increasing numbers of cases and deaths: 2241 (1487-3268) million cases and 4879 (3853-6346) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction in antimalarial drug coverage; 2331 (1537-3425) million cases and 5974 (4680-7844) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 2423 (1587-3588) million cases and 7152 (5564-9479) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. Halting planned 2020 ITN mass distribution campaigns and reducing routine ITN distributions by 25%-75% also increased malaria burden to a total of 2305 (1516-3433) million cases and 4117 (3228-5455) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 2328 (1523-3459) million cases and 4155 (3243-5494) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 2340 (1529-3484) million cases and 4176 (3255-5531) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. When ITN coverage and antimalarial drug coverage were synchronously reduced, malaria burden increased to 2405 (1565-3582) million cases and 5209 (4041-6919) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 2510 (1622-3770) million cases and 6402 (4920-8567) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 2616 (1677-3968) million cases and 7686 (5861-10387) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. INTERPRETATION: Under pessimistic scenarios, COVID-19-related disruption to malaria control in Africa could almost double malaria mortality in 2020, and potentially lead to even greater increases in subsequent years. To avoid a reversal of two decades of progress against malaria, averting this public health disaster must remain an integrated priority alongside the response to COVID-19.

METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis on linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older with confirmed COVID\\\\19 infection between 01/02/2020 and 30/06/2020 determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P\\\\values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID\\\\19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1781 people were diagnosed with COVID\\\\19, of whom 1195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50.

METHOD: Studies were identified by systematic searches in CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed and PsycINFO, complemented by searches in reference lists of eligible studies and other reviews. We included studies, when they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of an IMI to control conditions in improving psychological and disease-related outcomes in youth (mean age  18 years) with CC. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed within a random-effects model, and Hedges' g (with 95% confidence intervals) was calculated as effect size measure. Primary outcomes were comorbid mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress), as well as quality of life and self-efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 19 randomized controlled trials (2410 patients) were included in this meta-analysis.

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered.

In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay.

The participants were internists and primary care physicians of the Japanese Chapter of the American College of Physicians. The main outcome was the change in the prevalence of burnout between before and during the first wave of the pandemic. We also examined factors associated with the exacerbation of burnout during this period. RESULTS: Among the 283 respondents in the first survey and 322 in the second survey, 98 (34.6%) and 111 (34.5%) reported symptoms of burnout, respectively. In June 2020, 82 respondents (25.5%) reported that their level of burnout exacerbated compared to January 2020.

The relationship between SpO2 and SaO2 in normoxia and hypoxia in this model was quantified. Calculations were made for 5% increments of SaO2 increasing successively from 95% to 20%. RESULTS The pigs became severely hypoxic, acidotic and hypotensive. The bias in the total data was +13.7 (p < 0.001), i.e. SpO2 was on average higher than SaO2 for the entire interval of SaO2. However, bias was not significantly different from zero in most SpO2-ranges. Accuracy and precision were considerably higher than stated by the manufacturer in all SpO2-ranges, with both accuracy and precision increasing when SpO2-values down to 60% and lower were included.

To cope with these challenges and to make sound health-decisions, people need skills that enable them to access, under-stand, appraise, and use health-related information, i.e. adequate health literacy (HL). Thus, the present study investigates how people in the German-speaking part of Switzerland handle with Corona-specific information, what their difficulties are and what potential improvement measures could be. METHODS: Three representative samples of 1'000 individuals each were interviewed online in early sum-mer, autumn and winter 2020 using a modified version of the HLS-EU-Q16 questionnaire. Da-ta were analyzed using descriptive methods and an index for Corona-specific HL was built. RESULTS: In early summer, 55% of the German-speaking Swiss population reported adequate Corona-specific HL, with a tendency to increase with the duration of the pandemic (autumn: 62%; winter: 63%). Nonetheless, a great proportion reported difficulties, especially with assessing the trustworthiness of information from the media. With the progress of the pandemic, partici-pants felt less informed and the proportion of (very) poorly informed increased from 8% in early summer to 16% in winter 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Participants often found it difficult to assess the trustworthiness of information on COVID-19 and to derive consequences for their own behavior. Hence, it is important that all relevant stakeholders such as health organizations, authorities and media support the population with tools to facilitate the use of health information and to empower them to take responsibility for their own health as well as for their community.

During this period, surgical activity and admission to the Emergency Department (ED) decreased globally. The aim of this article is to understand how the admission of a patient to the ED for vascular surgery changed in our center in Portugal and if this situation prevented urgent surgical procedures. METHODS: Through a retrospective study, we compared the volume of patients admitted to the ED during the emergency state (ES) in Portugal with the same period in 2019. In addition, we analyzed the urgent surgical activity during the ES and in the correspondent period of the previous 10 years, regarding limb acute ischemia, acute aortic pathology, and vascular trauma. Two groups of patients were formed-patients operated during the ES and during the non-ES, for control. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS? Statistics, version 25. RESULTS: In the ES, 115 patients were observed at the ED and 179 in the 2019 corresponding period. During the ES, patients significantly recurred less to the ED directly from home (P < 0.001) and were less referred to the ED by primary care doctors (P < 0.001). Patients observed at the ED were significantly more urgent-required urgent surgery or were admitted to the department-than those in 2019 (40% vs. 24%). However, there were no differences when only considering urgent surgery (14% in ES vs. 10% in 2019). In the ES, 38% of patients observed at the ED were discharged with no follow-up related to vascular surgery against 60% in 2019, although this difference was not significant. Compared with the preceding 10 years, there are not significant differences in the number of patients who underwent urgent surgery in both ES and non-ES periods. In patients with acute limb ischemia, we did not find an increase in the time between onset of symptoms and ED admission, during the ES. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer patients were admitted at the ED during the ES, and those admitted were significantly more urgent. We did not find a decrease in the number of urgent surgeries when compared with the preceding 10 years. Therefore, we cannot assume that coronavirus pandemic precluded urgent surgical procedures.","output":"Is There an Impact of COVID-19 on Admission of Patients to the Emergency Department for Vascular Surgery?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the new infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first appeared in China. So far, no systematic evaluation of death certificates of COVID-19-associated deaths has been presented. METHODS: The death certificates of all deaths in Munich during the period from 1 March to 31 July 2020 were analyzed. The previously defined inclusion criteria were the indication of corona, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV?2 in the death certificates. The variables were entered anonymously according to a developed key. The collected data were evaluated descriptively. RESULTS: In the period under investigation, a total of 5840 people died in the Munich City area. Of these deaths 332 (5.7%) were COVID-19-associated. In 281 deaths (84.6%) there was a definite COVID-19 and in 51 deaths (15.4%) the suspicion of this disease. The most frequent causes of death were acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory insufficiency (59.1%), multiple organ failure (21.4%) and sepsis (10%). An average of 1.8 pre-existing illnesses were reported in the death certificates. Most frequently mentioned were diseases of the circulatory system (54.8%), the nervous system (22.8%) and metabolic diseases (18.9%). The average age at death was 79 years and the most frequent place of death was a hospital (85%). An autopsy was attempted by the doctors who issued the death certificates for 18.1% of the collective, most frequently in the case of unexplained or unnatural causes of death and young age of the deceased. Clinical pathological autopsies were performed on 11% of the collective and judicial autopsies on 1%. DISCUSSION: This study is the first evaluation of death certificates with respect to the novel infectious COVID-19. Number and essential characteristics of COVID-19-associated deaths in Munich during the so-called first wave could be mapped.

In this study, we explored the effect of Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling on the expression and activity of ADAM17 and assessed its impact on apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human alveolar epithelial cells. LPS markedly induced the shedding activity of ADAM17 in alveolar epithelial cells, which was blocked by selective c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. Ang-(1-7) concentration-dependently inhibited LPS-induced ADAM17 shedding activity, which was abolished by selective Mas blocker A779 and Mas shRNA. LPS and Ang-(1-7) showed no significant effect on the expression of ADAM17. Overexpression of ADAM17 synergized with LPS on increasing the shedding activity of ADAM17 and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells, counteracting the inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7). In addition, LPS significantly increased the JNK activity in alveolar epithelial cells; Ang-(1-7) concentration-dependently inhibited LPS-induced JNK activity, which was abolished by A779 and Mas shRNA.

In the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the bariatric surgeons' community faced many concerns and challenges, especially in light of a decree issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 22nd, to ban all elective surgery in public hospitals. The aim of this study is to portray the practices and attitudes of Israeli bariatric surgeons in the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS: Anonymous web-based questionnaire sent to all active bariatric surgeons in Israel. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software package. RESULTS: 53 out of 63 (84%) active surgeons responded to the survey. 18% practice in the public sector only, 4% in the private sector only and 78% in both sectors. 76% practice BS for more than 10 years and 68% perform more than 100 procedures a year. Almost all the surgeons (98%) experienced a tremendous decrease in operations. Nevertheless, there were substantial differences by sectors. In the public sector, 86% of the surgeons ceased to operate while 14% did not comply with the government's decree. In the public sector 69% of the surgeons were instructed by the administrators to stop operating. The majority of surgeons who continued to operate (77%) changed nothing in the indications or contra-indications for surgery. Among the surgeons who opted to refrain from operating on special sub-groups, the most frequent reasons were pulmonary disease (82%), age above 60 (64%), Ischemic heart disease (55%) and living in heavily affected communities. Roughly only half (57%) of the surgeons implemented changes in informed consent and operating room (OR) measures, contrary to guidelines and recommendations by leading professional societies. When asked about future conditions for reestablishing elective procedures, the reply frequencies were as follows: no special measures - 40%; PCR negativity - 27%; IgG positivity - 15%; waiting until the end of the pandemic- 9%. CONCLUSIONS: We showed in this nation-wide survey that the variance between surgeons, regarding present and future reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, is high. There were substantial differences between the private and the public sectors. Although the instructions given by the MOH for the public sector were quite clear, the compliance by surgeons and administrators was far from complete. The administrators in the public sector, but more so in the private sector were ambiguous in instructing staff, leading surgeons to a more \\"personal non-structured\\" practice in the first phase of the pandemic.

Insulin-supplemented frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (fsIVGTT) was performed before and after equivalent weight reduction. MINMOD analysis of insulin sensitivity (Si), acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) and C-peptide (ACPRg) response to glucose, and insulin secretion normalized to the degree of insulin resistance (disposition index (DI)) were analyzed. Weight loss was comparable in all groups (7.8  0.4%). In Study 1, significant improvement of Si, ACPRg, and DI were observed only after LAGB. In Study 2, Si, ACPRg, and plasma adiponectin increased significantly in the RYGB-DM group but not in LCD. DI improved in both T2DM groups, but the absolute increase was greater after RYGB (258.2  86.6 vs. 55.9  19.9; P < 0.05). Antidiabetic medications were discontinued after RYGB contrasting with 55% reduction in the number of medications after LCD. No intervention affected fasting glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, peptide YY (PYY) or ghrelin levels. In conclusion, RYGB produced greater improvement in Si and DI compared with diet at equivalent weight loss in T2DM subjects. Such a beneficial effect was not observed in nondiabetic subjects at this early time-point.","output":"Comparison of glucostatic parameters after hypocaloric diet or bariatric surgery and equivalent weight loss."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the emergency use authorization of the vaccine mRNA-1273 on 18th December 2020 in the US and the vaccine BNT162b2 one week earlier, two mRNA vaccines are in currently used for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

SR-B1 is subject to posttranslational regulation; however, the underlying mechanisms still remain obscure. Here, we identified a novel SR-B1-interacting protein, GIPC1 (GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus 1) that interacts with SR-B1 and stabilizes SR-B1 by negative regulation of its proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways. The physiological interaction between SR-B1 and GIPC1 was supported by co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant GIPC1 constructs in SR-B1  GIPC1 overexpressing cells, in native liver cells, and in mouse liver tissues. Overexpression of GIPC1 increased endogenous SR-B1 protein levels, subsequently increasing selective HDL-cholesterol/CE uptake and cellular triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, whereas silencing of GIPC1 in the mouse liver was associated with blunted hepatic SR-B1 levels, elevated plasma TG and TC, and attenuated hepatic TG and TC content. A positive correlation was identified between GIPC1 and SR-B1 expression, and both expressions of GIPC1 and SR-B1 from human liver samples were inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI) from human subjects. We therefore conclude that GIPC1 plays a key role in the stability and function of SR-B1 and can also effectively regulate hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism. These findings expand our knowledge of the regulatory roles of GIPC1 and suggest that GIPC1 exerts a major effect on cell surface receptors such as SR-B1 and its associated hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes.","output":"The adaptor protein GIPC1 stabilizes the scavenger receptor SR-B1 and increases its cholesterol uptake"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The occurrence of same\\\\day discharge following elective rotational atherectomy cases in England and Wales during 2007C2014 increased from approximately 7 to 36%.

There is emerging evidence that Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which inhibit JAK-dependent cytokine activity, may hold promise in sarcoidosis. In this open-label trial, 10 patients with recalcitrant sarcoidosis with cutaneous involvement were treated with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. There was no washout period and patients were permitted to continue, taper, or discontinue other treatments. The primary outcome was the change in the Cutaneous Sarcoidosis Activity and Morphology Instrument (CSAMI) activity score after 6 months. Change in internal organ disease activity was also assessed using total lesion glycolysis (TLG) determined by full-body positron emission tomography. A mean reduction in the CSAMI activity score of 82.7% was observed, with 6 patients showing a complete response. Internal organ response data was available in 8 patients; a decrease in TLG of []50% was noted in 5 patients, with complete or near complete resolution in 3 (>98% reduction in TLG). Patients were generally able to significantly taper or discontinue their baseline immunosuppressive regimen, which included prednisone in 5 patients.

Treatment protocols generally include dietary restriction of sugar, as well as drugs aiming at a reduction of blood glucose, mainly by activating the insulin system or supplementing insulin. This established approach does not take into account the outstanding physiological role of glucose as a key molecule in metabolism. Glucose is crucial to meet the high energy demand of the brain, which depends on it as an exclusive nutrient. Insulin independent glucose transporters GLUT1 import glucose into the brain. Reduction of blood glucose, as in current treatment concepts, may lead to energy deficiency in the brain and consecutively to worsening of - possibly already impaired - neurocognitive function. Reduced cell membrane fluidity of the vascular endothelium of the bloodbrain-barrier (BBB) - due to malnutrition and/or aging - is considered a major factor in pathogenesis of the cerebral metabolic syndrome, which is a key step in neurodegeneration.

Limited research has focused on home-schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic, with most research to date being descriptive in nature. The aim of the current study was to comprehensively quantify the psychosocial impacts of home-schooling on parents and other caregivers, and identify factors associated with better outcomes. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 1,296 Australian adults was recruited at the beginning of Australian COVID-19 restrictions in late-March 2020, and followed up every two weeks. Data for the current study were drawn from waves two and three. Surveys assessed psychosocial outcomes of psychological distress, work and social impairment, and wellbeing, as well as a range of home-schooling factors. RESULTS: Parents and caregivers who were home-schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced significantly higher levels of psychological distress and work/social impairment compared to those who were not home-schooling or had no school-aged children. A current mental health diagnosis or lower levels of perceived support from their childs school negatively affected levels of psychological distress, work and social impairment, and wellbeing in parents and caregivers involved in home-schooling. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health impacts of home-schooling were high and may rise as periods of home-schooling increase in frequency and duration. Recognising and acknowledging the challenges of home-schooling is important, and should be included in psychosocial assessments of wellbeing during periods of school closure. Emotional and instrumental support is needed for those involved in home-schooling, as perceived levels of support is associated with improved outcomes.

We present implementation results and lessons learned along with an intervention toolkit that others may consider using within their organization. METHODS Using iterative improvement lifecycles and systems engineering principles, we developed a risk-based workflow model for patients on chronic opioids. Two key safe opioid use process metrics-percent of patients with recent opioid treatment agreements and urine drug tests-were identified, and processes to improve these measures were designed, tested, and implemented. Focus groups were conducted after the conclusion of implementation, with barriers and lessons learned identified via thematic analysis. RESULTS Initial surveys revealed a lack of knowledge regarding resources available to patients and prescribers in the primary care clinic. In addition, 18 clinicians (69%) reported largely \\"inheriting\\" (rather than initiating) their chronic opioid therapy patients. We tracked 68 patients over a 4-year period. Although process measures improved, full adherence was not achieved for the entire population.

METHODS We conducted (a) a systematic literature review of publications in Medline, Embase and the Web of Science using a combination of at least one term related to OUD and EHR and (b) an environmental scan of publicly available data systems and dictionaries used in national informatics and quality measurement of policy initiatives. Opioid-related data elements identified within the environmental scan were compared with related data elements contained within nine common health data code systems and each element was graded for alignment with match results categorized as \\"exact\\", \\"partial\\", or \\"none.\\" RESULTS The literature review identified 5186 articles for title search, of which 75 abstracts were included for review and 38 articles were selected for full-text review. Full-text articles yielded 237 CDEs, only 12 (5.06%) of which were opioid-specific. The environmental scan identified 379 potential data elements and value sets across 9 data systems and libraries, among which only 84 (22%) were opioid-specific. We found substantial variability in the types of clinical data elements with limited overlap and no single data system included CDEs across all major data element types such as substance use disorder, OUD, medication and mental health. Relative to common health data code systems, few data elements had an exact match (< 1%), while 61% had a partial match and 38% had no matches. CONCLUSIONS Despite the increasing ubiquity of EHR data standards and national attention placed on the opioid epidemic, we found substantial fragmentation in the design and construction of OUD related CDEs and little OUD specific CDEs in existing data dictionaries, systems and literature.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between the chest CT findings and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR who had undergone more than 4 serial chest CT procedures were retrospectively enrolled. RESULTS: This study included 361 patients C 192 men and 169 women. On initial chest CT, more lesions were identified as multiple bilateral lungs lesions and localised in the peripheral lung. The predominant patterns of abnormality were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (28.5%), consolidation (13.0%), nodule (23.0%), fibrous stripes (5.3%) and mixed (30.2%). Severe cases were more common in patients with a mixed pattern (21.1%) and less common in patients with nodules (2.4%).

In this study, we applied the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology based on multilevel time series to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both developed and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, FTSE, DAX, NIKKEI, CSI 300, HSI, BSESN, and BOVESPA. In order to effectively distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash, we proposed using the LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300, BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock markets, while the well-known external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic etc. only acted as sparks during the 2020 global stock market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not been observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE, NIKKEI, and HSI, signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are exogenous, stemming from external shocks.

The KD has become more prominent as a popular health choice, not only in obese/overweight individuals, but also in healthy adults. The study aims to determine the effects of a KD, independent of weight loss, on various aspects of physiological health including: sleep, thyroid function, cognition, and cardio-metabolic health. The study will also aim to determine whether a change in basal metabolic rate may be associated with any changes observed. METHODS Twenty healthy men and women between 18 and 50 years of age will take part in this study. In a randomized controlled, cross-over design, participants will follow two isocaloric diets: a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (55% CHO, 20% fat, 25% protein) and a KD (15% CHO, 60% fat, 25% protein). Each dietary intervention will last for a minimum of 3 weeks, with a 1-week washout period in between. Before and after each diet, participants will be assessed for sleep quality, cognitive function, thyroid function, and basal metabolic rate.

The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare distributions of continuous variables and the Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. Thirty-one HNC patients were included in the study, and no case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was found. Delayed cancer care due to restriction in health services was reported in 58.1% of cases, and there was no report of telemedicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cancer-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic were described for most patients (67.7%) and included pain or discomfort, swelling, and dyspnea. Eight (25.8%) patients reported use of prescribed morphine or codeine to manage pain and six (19.4%) patients reported self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We found an association between delayed HNC care and the use of self-medication (p = 0.028). This study indicated that patients with delayed HNC care during the COVID-19 outbreak are more likely to use self-medication with NSAIDs for pain management. Better strategies to follow HNC patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities need to be discussed and implemented.","output":"Delay in head and neck cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on health outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial coinfections increase the severity of respiratory viral infections and were frequent causes of mortality in influenza pandemics but have not been well characterized in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this study, we combined the SIDARTHE model(2), which predicts the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a new data-based model that projects new cases onto casualties and healthcare system costs. Based on the Italian case study, we outline several scenarios: mass vaccination campaigns with different paces, different transmission rates due to new variants and different enforced countermeasures, including the alternation of opening and closure phases. Our results demonstrate that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have a higher effect on the epidemic evolution than vaccination alone, advocating for the need to keep NPIs in place during the first phase of the vaccination campaign. Our model predicts that, from April 2021 to January 2022, in a scenario with no vaccine rollout and weak NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 1.27), as many as 298,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 could occur. However, fast vaccination rollouts could reduce mortality to as few as 51,000 deaths. Implementation of restrictive NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 0.9) could reduce COVID-19 deaths to 30,000 without vaccinating the population and to 18,000 with a fast rollout of vaccines.

We sought to determine salivary changes, caries, and periodontal complications in NF1 patients without tumors in the oral cavity. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Eleven NF1 patients without tumors in the oral cavity and 29 matched controls without NF1 were enrolled in this caseCcontrol study. Demographic information, medical history, and data of intraoral examinations, including the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT) scores and Russels periodontal index (PI), were recorded. The functional salivary analysis was performed for sialometry, salivary pH values, and amylase activity. Ingenuity Systems Pathway Analysis (IPA) was conducted to identify mutually activated pathways for NF1-associated oral complications. RESULTS: NF1 patients were associated with periodontitis (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.06C1.73, P = 0.04), gingivitis (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.09C2.01, P = 0.0002), and decreased salivary flow rates (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.05C1.76, P = 0.005). Periodontal destruction, salivary changes, and dental caries in NF1 patients were age-dependent. Subgroup analyses based on age stratification suggested that salivary flow rates and salivary amylase activities were significantly low in NF1 patients aged over 20 years and that salivary pH values, PI and DMFT scores were significantly high among NF1- controls aged over 20. All oral complications were not significantly presented in NF1 patients aged below 20 years. IPA analyses suggested that cellular mechanisms underlying NF1-associated oral complications involved chronic inflammatory pathways and fibrosis signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: NF1 patients without tumors in the oral cavity presented a comparatively high prevalence of age-dependent oral complications, including periodontal destruction and salivary gland dysfunction, which were associated with chronic inflammatory pathogenesis.","output":"Age-dependent oral manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1: a caseCcontrol study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reducing and preventing stunting is currently a priority for health programs in Indonesia.

A prime candidate is ORF6, which encodes a 63-amino-acid membrane-associated peptide that can dramatically increase the lethality of an otherwise attenuated JHM strain of murine coronavirus (L. Pewe, H. Zhou, J. Netland, C. Tangudu, H. Olivares, L. Shi, D. Look, T. Gallagher, and S. Perlman, J. Virol. 79:11335-11342, 2005). To discern virulence mechanisms, we compared the in vitro growth properties of rJ.6, a recombinant JHM expressing the SARS peptide, with isogenic rJ.6-KO, which has an inactive ORF containing a mutated initiation codon and a termination codon at internal position 27. The rJ.6 infections proceeded rapidly, secreting progeny about 1.5 h earlier than rJ.6-KO infections did. The rJ.6 infections were also set apart by early viral protein accumulation and by robust expansion via syncytia, a characteristic feature of JHM virus dissemination. We found no evidence for protein 6 operating at the virus entry or assembly stage, as virions from either infection were indistinguishable. Rather, protein 6 appeared to operate by fostering viral RNA and protein synthesis, as RNA quantifications by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed viral RNA levels in the rJ.6 cultures that were five to eight times higher than those lacking protein 6. Furthermore, protein 6 coimmunoprecipitated with viral RNAs and colocalized on cytoplasmic vesicles with replicating viral RNAs. The SARS coronavirus encodes a novel membrane protein 6 that can accelerate replication of a related mouse virus, a property that may explain its ability to increase in vivo virus virulence.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein 6 accelerates murine coronavirus infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts play an essential role in airway remodelling, due to their protective and secretory functions.

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and clinical picture of COVID-19 in general outpatient services. Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 depends strongly on the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. However, since the sensitivity of PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 is not high enough to assure confidence. On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab) test is highly sensitive after 2 weeks of symptom onset, and might complement the PCR test. Therefore, we measured Ab in addition to PCR to obtain a more accurate clinical profile of COVID-19, which might be helpful in building future practice strategies. PATIENTS: The study patients were those who visited our department for the first time between November 2020 and March 2021 and fulfilled the enrolment criteria. METHODS: All patients underwent total SARS-CoV-2 Ab testing, and PCR tests were performed in only some of them; patients were classified according to the performance of PCR tests for comparisons. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients who underwent Ab testing during the study period were eligible for study enrolment, and the PCR test was performed in 40 of them. Only one patient was diagnosed with acute stage COVID-19 based on a positive PCR test. Antibodies were positive in six (6.4%) of the 94 patients. Five of the six Ab-positive patients were negative for PCR, and the test was not performed in the sixth patient. All the six patients had prior symptoms suggestive of infection, and respiratory symptoms were more noticeable than fever. The Ab positivity rate was significantly higher than published data.

Mechanisms of the immunosuppression induced by the cannabinoid were explored, and it was shown that O-1966 in this in vitro assay induced CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells and IL-10, as well as down-regulated mRNA for CD40 and the nuclear form of the transcription factors NF-B and NFAT in T-cells.

Full thickness flank skin patches (1-cm(2)) from C3HeB/FeJ mice were grafted by suturing onto the back of C57BL/6 mice. O-1966 or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally into treated or control groups of animals beginning 1 h pre-op, and then every other day until 14 days post-op. Graft survival was scored based on necrosis and rejection. Treatment with 5 mg/kg of O-1966 prolonged mean graft survival time from 9 to 11 days. Spleens harvested from O-1966 treated mice were significantly smaller than those of vehicle control animals based on weight. Flow cytometry analysis of CD4(+) spleen cells showed that O-1966 treated animals had almost a 3-fold increase in CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells compared to controls. When dissociated spleen cells were placed in culture ex vivo and stimulated with C3HeB/FeJ cells in an MLR, the cells from the O-1966 treated mice were significantly suppressed in their proliferative response to the allogeneic cells.

RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence to date does not suggest that people living with HIV (PLWH) have a markedly higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with disparities in the social determinants of health and comorbidities likely having a greater influence. The majority of literature has not supported a higher risk for severe disease among PLWH in Europe and the United States, although a large, population-based study in South Africa reported a higher rate of death due to COVID-19. Higher rates of comorbidities associated with COVID-19 disease severity among PLWH is an urgent concern.

In France, the University of Paris North called on its medical students, whose status makes them integral members of the healthcare staff, to volunteer in their capacity of medical students and/or as nurses/nursing aids in understaffed intensive care units and other Covid-19 services. We attempted to evaluate their commitment, whether the pandemic affected their certainty for the medical profession and career choices, and how they scored their sadness and anxiety levels. METHODS: The University of Paris North took a weekly official census of the involvement of 1205 4thC6th year medical students during the first lockdown in France. Six weeks after the lockdown began (May 4th), an e-questionnaire was sent to 2145 2nd-6th year medical students. The survey lasted 4 weeks and documented volunteering by medical students, the association between the pandemic and certainty for their profession, their choice of medical specialty and factors that influenced sadness and anxiety scores. RESULTS: 82% of 4thC6th year medical students volunteered to continue their internship or be reassigned to COVID-19 units. Of 802 2nd-6th year students who completed the e-questionnaire, 742 (93%) volunteered in Covid-19 units, of which half acted as nurses. This engagement reinforced the commitment of 92% of volunteers to become physicians. However, at the peak of the outbreak, 17% had doubts about their ability to be physicians, while 12% reconsidered their choice of future specialty. Finally, 38% of students reported a score of 7/10 or more on the sadness scale, and 43% a score of 7/10 or more for anxiety. Neither study year nor service influenced sadness or anxiety scores. However, gender influenced both, with women scoring significantly higher than men (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Medical students of the University of Paris North who made an early and unconditional commitment to help hospital staff handle the pandemic constituted a powerful healthcare reserve force during the crisis. Although the vast majority remained convinced that they want to become physicians, this experience came at a significant psychological cost, especially for women.

For VE(S) of 95% and gradual easing of restrictions, vaccination in the US reduced the peak incidence of infection, disease, and death by >55% and cumulative incidence by >32% and in China by >77% and >65%, respectively. Nearly three vaccinations were needed to avert one infection in the US, but only one was needed in China. For VE(P) of 95%, vaccination benefits were half those for VE(S) of 95%. In both countries, impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up, vaccine coverage >50%, and slower or no easing of restrictions, particularly in the US. COVID-19 vaccination can flatten, delay, and/or prevent future epidemic waves. However, vaccine impact is destined to be heterogeneous across countries because of an underlying epidemiologic inequity that reduces benefits for countries already at high incidence, such as the US.

Patients: All transports of intubated patients in the prone position with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019. Interventions: Records were reviewed for patients transported in the prone position. Major adverse events in transport, defined as severe hypoxemia (oxygen saturation < 80% or an absolute decrease in oxygen saturation > 10%), hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) not responsive to vasopressors or inotropes, endotracheal tube or vascular catheter dislodgement, and cardiac arrest, were recorded.

To disrupt the widespread of COVID-19, a mechanism for social distancing is indispensable. Also, to predict the effectiveness and quantity of social distancing for a particular social network, with a certain contagion, a generalized model is needed. In this manuscript, we propose a social distancing mediated generalized model to predict the pandemic spread of COVID-19. By considering growth rate as a temporal harmonic function damped with social distancing in generalized Richard model and by using the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, USA and India, we find that, with time, the cumulative spread grows more rapidly due to weak social distancing as compared to the stronger social distancing, where it is explicitly decreasing. Furthermore, we predict the possible outcomes with various social distancing scenarios by considering highest growth rate as an initial state, and illustrate that the increase in social distancing tremendously decreases growth rate, even it tends to reach zero in lockdown regimes. Our findings not only provide epidemic growth scenarios as a function of social distancing but also provide a modified growth model to predict controlled information flow in any network.","output":"Social distancing mediated generalized model to predict epidemic spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic stunned the health systems with severe scarcities in hospital resources. In this critical situation, decreasing COVID-19 readmissions could potentially sustain hospital capacity. This study aimed to select the most affecting features of COVID-19 readmission and compare the capability of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict COVID-19 readmission based on the selected features. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data of 5791 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively recruited from a hospital registry system. The LASSO feature selection algorithm was used to select the most important features related to COVID-19 readmission. HistGradientBoosting classifier (HGB), Bagging classifier, Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine ((SVM) kernel = linear), SVM (kernel = RBF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers were used for prediction. We evaluated the performance of ML algorithms with a 10-fold cross-validation method using six performance evaluation metrics. RESULTS: Out of the 42 features, 14 were identified as the most relevant predictors. The XGBoost classifier outperformed the other six ML models with an average accuracy of 91.7%, specificity of 91.3%, the sensitivity of 91.6%, F-measure of 91.8%, and AUC of 0.91%.

As many countries are grappling with the onset of their epidemics, pharmacotherapeutics remain lacking. The window of opportunity to mitigate downstream morbidity and mortality is narrow but remains open. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial to the homeostasis of both the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 utilises and interrupts this pathway directly, which could be described as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-SARS-CoV (RAAS-SCoV) axis. There exists significant controversy and confusion surrounding how anti-hypertensive agents might function along this pathway. This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding the RAAS-SCoV axis (informed by prior studies of SARS-CoV), how this relates to our currently evolving pandemic, and how these insights might guide our next steps in an evidence-based manner. OBSERVATIONS: This review discusses the role of the RAAS-SCoV axis in acute lung injury and the effects, risks and benefits of pharmacological modification of this axis. There may be an opportunity to leverage the different aspects of RAAS inhibitors to mitigate indirect viral-induced lung injury. Concerns have been raised that such modulation might exacerbate the disease. While relevant preclinical, experimental models to date favour a protective effect of RAAS-SCoV axis inhibition on both lung injury and survival, clinical data related to the role of RAAS modulation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remain limited. CONCLUSION: Proposed interventions for SARS-CoV-2 predominantly focus on viral microbiology and aim to inhibit viral cellular injury. While these therapies are promising, immediate use may not be feasible, and the time window of their efficacy remains a major unanswered question. An alternative approach is the modulation of the specific downstream pathophysiological effects caused by the virus that lead to morbidity and mortality. We propose a preponderance of evidence that supports clinical equipoise regarding the efficacy of RAAS-based interventions, and the imminent need for a multisite randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the inhibition of the RAAS-SCoV axis on acute lung injury in COVID-19.","output":"Understanding the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-SARS-CoV axis: a comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modeling and predicting human mobility are of great significance to various application scenarios such as intelligent transportation system, crowd management, and disaster response. In particular, in a severe pandemic situation like COVID-19, human movements among different regions are taken as the most important point for understanding and forecasting the epidemic spread in a country. Thus, in this study, we collect big human GPS trajectory data covering the total 47 prefectures of Japan and model the daily human movements between each pair of prefectures with time-series Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. Then, given the historical observations from past days, we predict the countrywide OD matrices for the future one or more weeks by proposing a novel deep learning model called Origin-Destination Convolutional Recurrent Network (ODCRN). It integrates the recurrent and 2-dimensional graph convolutional components to deal with the highly complex spatiotemporal dependencies in sequential OD matrices. Experiment results over the entire COVID-19 period demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology over existing OD prediction models. Last, we apply the predicted countrywide OD matrices to the SEIR model, one of the most classic and widely used epidemic simulation model, to forecast the COVID-19 infection numbers for the entire Japan.

METHODS We did a systemic search of PubMed and Cochrane review for all randomized controlled trials and comparative trials that compared the efficacy and safety between LESS-TEP and MP-TEP. The evaluated outcomes included perioperative parameters (operative time, conversion rate), hospital stay and complications (seroma, delayed return of bladder function, postoperative pain and recurrence). The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (RevMan, version 5.2.6) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS There were 10 trials met the inclusion criteria and included for meta-analysis. Totally, there were 595 and 514 patients underwent LESS-TEP and MP-TEP, respectively. The LESS-TEP took significantly longer-operative time than the MP-TEP in unilateral hernia repair (weighted mean difference (WMD) 4.11 min, 95% CI 0.76-7.46, p = 0.02) while not in bilateral hernia repair (WMD 3.87 min, 95% of CI -2.59-10.33, z = 1.17, p = 0.24). There were no significant differences in surgical outcomes with regard to postoperative pain scale, conversion rate, hospital stay, recurrence rate and complication rate between two groups. The length of the sub-umbilical wound was the same in both groups. The result of cosmesis was not compared because of the limited data.

Despite the global prevalence, there are currently no vaccines or drugs. Dietary plant derived exosome-like vesicles are known as edible nanoparticles (ENPs). ENPs are filled with microRNAs (miRNAs), in bioavailable form. Recently, cross-kingdom regulation of human transcripts by plant miRNAs have been demonstrated. However, ENP derived miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 has not been described. STUDY DESIGN: Mature ENP-derived miRNA sequences were retrieved from small RNA sequencing datasets available in the literature. In silico target prediction was performed to identify miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2. ENPs were isolated from ginger and grapefruit plants and the expression of SARS-CoV-2 targeting miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: From a total of 260 ENP-derived miRNAs, we identified 22 miRNAs that could potentially target SARS-CoV-2 genome. 11 miRNAs showed absolute target specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV. ENPs from soybean, ginger, hamimelon, grapefruit, tomato and pear possess multiple miRNAs targeting different regions within SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, osa/cme miR-530b-5p specifically targeted the ribosomal slippage site between ORF1a and ORF1b. We validated the relative expression of six miRNAs (miR-5077, miR-6300, miR-156a, miR-169, miR-5059 and miR-166 m) in ginger and grapefruit ENPs by RT-PCR which showed differential enrichment of specific miRNAs in ginger and grapefruit ENPs. CONCLUSION: Since administration of ENPs leads to their accumulation into lung tissues in vivo, ENP derived miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 genome has the potential to be developed as an alternative therapy.","output":"Edible plant-derived exosomal microRNAs: Exploiting a cross-kingdom regulatory mechanism for targeting SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 can affect the human brain and other neurological structures.

This study aimed to describe the features of the central and peripheral nervous system involvement by COVID-19 in terms of pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, neuropathology, neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and cerebrospinal fluid findings. Methods: : We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of all the original studies reporting patients with neurological involvement by COVID-19, from December 2019 to June 2020, without language restriction. We excluded studies with animal subjects, studies not related to the nervous system, and opinion articles. Data analysis combined descriptive measures, frequency measures, central tendency measures, and dispersion measures for all studies reporting neurological conditions and abnormal ancillary tests in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Results: : A total of 143 observational and descriptive studies reported central and peripheral nervous system involvement by COVID-19 in 10723 patients. Fifty-one studies described pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurological involvement by COVID-19, 119 focused on clinical manifestations, 4 described neuropathology findings, 62 described neuroimaging findings, 28 electrophysiology findings, and 60 studies reported cerebrospinal fluid results.

Pallotto et al., Gubitosa et al., and Touafchia et al. all reported the association of Remdesivir with increased risk of bradycardia in small samples of patients treated with RDV for COVID-19. To our knowledge, no large studies looked at this side effect of RDV therapy. We aimed to analyze the association between sinus bradycardia and Remdesivir therapy for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case-control analysis was done for 1535 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection who were admitted to four teaching hospitals in an urban area in 2020. The mean age was 66 years (SD of 16.7, range 18-99), with 774 males (50.4%). Patients were divided into cases (treated with RDV) and controls (not treated with RDV). Multivariate logistic regression methods were used to analyze the associations between independent variables and outcomes. Pulse rate variables were recorded as pulse rate at day-0, day-3, day-7, and incidence of bradycardia on three consecutive days during admission. Other variables recorded were age, gender, comorbidities, prior history of cardiac disease/arrhythmias, concomitant medications (including AV nodal blockers, dexamethasone, Albuterol, and Lasix), and ICU admission. Survival analysis was run for 7-day and 30-day mortality, as well as survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: 1415 patients were included in the final analysis, after the exclusion of 120 patients with previous heart blocks. 600 patients (39.1%) were in the Remdesivir group, and 935 patients (60.9%) were in the control group. Between both groups, a total of 454 patients (29.6%) had transient bradycardia on three consecutive days during hospitalization. A multivariate regression analysis was done after adjusting for all confounding variables (age, gender, history of cardiac diseases, AV-nodal blocking drugs, dexamethasone, furosemide, and albuterol therapy). It was seen that there was no statistically significant association between RDV therapy and persistent transient bradycardia (transient bradycardic events on three consecutive days) (Odds Ratio 0.823, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.594-1.134, p=0.236). There was no statistically significant association of RDV therapy with patients having any bradycardia event during hospitalization in a sub-analysis (Odds Ratio 0.888, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.665-1.184, p=0.419). Also, RDV failed to show any statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 1.1, CI 0.75-1.62, p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that although transient sinus bradycardia in patients with COVID-19, can be triggered by severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage to AV-nodal cells, or exaggerated response to medications, there was no statistically significant association of RDV therapy with the risk of developing bradycardia. RDV therapy should not be withheld in patients at risk of developing bradycardia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Remdesivir therapy did not increase the risk of developing bradycardia in our patient population. RDV therapy should not be withheld in patients at risk of developing bradycardia. Larger RCTs are needed to validate these findings.

ICU patients with hematological malignancies had very weak or even undetectable IgG levels. While both groups had comparable levels of specific IgM antibodies, we found much lower levels of specific IgA in ICU versus non-ICU patients. In conclusion, COVID-19 ICU patients may be at risk of reinfection as their specific IgG response is declining in a matter of weeks.

It was observed that majority of the damage was concentrated in the Bayrakl? district due to its peculiar soil properties where many 7C10 story mid-rise RC buildings suffered heavy damage and collapse. The level of amplified ground motions combined with deficiencies of apparently non-code compliant buildings exacerbated the damage. The main reasons of damage were mainly attributed to the presence of soft stories, lack of proper detailing, poor construction quality, presence of heavy overhangs, and hence significant lack of code-compliance in essence. The influence of infill walls on seismic performance of deficient and inadequate buildings was clearly seen in this earthquake. This paper also discusses seismic code requirements in effect and their influence on the observed building performance.

The objective of this study was to evaluate if a 2-week interruption in low-dose weekly methotrexate treatment after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters enhances the immune response compared with continuing treatment in adults with autoimmune inflammatory conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open-label, pragmatic, prospective, parallel group, randomised controlled superiority trial with internal feasibility assessment and nested mechanistic substudy will be conducted in rheumatology and dermatology clinics in approximately 25 UK hospitals. The sample size is 560, randomised 1:1 to intervention and usual care arms. The main outcome measure is anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody level, collected at prebooster (baseline), 4 weeks (primary outcome) and 12 weeks (secondary outcome) post booster vaccination. Other secondary outcome measures are patient global assessments of disease activity, disease flares and their treatment, EuroQol 5- dimention 5-level (EQ-5D-5L), self-reported adherence with advice to interrupt or continue methotrexate, neutralising antibody titre against SARS-CoV-2 (mechanistic substudy) and oral methotrexate biochemical adherence (mechanistic substudy). Analysis of B-cell memory and T-cell responses at baseline and weeks 4 and 12 will be investigated subject to obtaining additional funding. The principal analysis will be performed on the groups as randomised (ie, intention to treat). The difference between the study arms in anti-spike RBD antibody level will be estimated using mixed effects model, allowing for repeated measures clustered within participants.

One of those countries is Indonesia, which has many big cities with dense populations. This study was conducted in Bandung, the capital of West Java, Indonesia. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Bandung was seriously affected in various ways. One was the disruption in the distribution of the agricultural processed products supply chain, which changes producers and consumers' behaviour. Furthermore, as an effort by the government to break the spread of the virus, health protocols limit the distribution. The purpose of this study is to design an optimization model for the supply chain problem of agricultural processed products in Bandung during the Covid-19 period with the objective function is maximizing product suppliers so that all demands on consumers are fulfilled. The use of Local Food Hub (LFH) is a help in this research as a distribution centre point between the producer zone and the consumer zone. Finally, numerical experiments were carried out in two scenarios, namely Large-scale Social Distancing (LSD) and Partial Social Distancing (PSD). It was found that the optimal distribution solution was obtained if the PSD scenario was applied.

Using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoparticles expressing the spike protein of several SARS-CoV-2 variants, we evaluated the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response over time in individuals after infection and in mRNA-vaccinated individuals. We observed that boosting increases the magnitude of the antibody response to wildtype (D614), Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants; however, the Omicron variant was the most resistant to neutralization. We further observed that vaccinated healthy adults had robust and broad antibody responses whereas responses may have been reduced in vaccinated pregnant women, underscoring the importance of learning how to maximize mRNA vaccine responses in pregnant populations.

However, little is known about the impact of these measures on the population as expressed on social media from different cultural contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess and compare the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We extracted posts containing COVID-19Crelated or lockdown-related keywords in the most commonly used microblogging social media platforms (ie, Weibo in China and Twitter in France) from 1 week before lockdown to the lifting of the lockdown. A topic model was applied independently for three periods (prelockdown, early lockdown, and mid to late lockdown) to assess the evolution of the topics discussed on Chinese and French social media. RESULTS: A total of 6395; 23,422; and 141,643 Chinese Weibo messages, and 34,327; 119,919; and 282,965 French tweets were extracted in the prelockdown, early lockdown, and mid to late lockdown periods, respectively, in China and France. Four categories of topics were discussed in a continuously evolving way in all three periods: epidemic news and everyday life, scientific information, public measures, and solidarity and encouragement. The most represented category over all periods in both countries was epidemic news and everyday life. Scientific information was far more discussed on Weibo than in French tweets. Misinformation circulated through social media in both countries; however, it was more concerned with the virus and epidemic in China, whereas it was more concerned with the lockdown measures in France. Regarding public measures, more criticisms were identified in French tweets than on Weibo. Advantages and data privacy concerns regarding tracing apps were also addressed in French tweets. All these differences were explained by the different uses of social media, the different timelines of the epidemic, and the different cultural contexts in these two countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to compare the social media content in eastern and western countries during the unprecedented COVID-19 lockdown. Using general COVID-19Crelated social media data, our results describe common and different public reactions, behaviors, and concerns in China and France, even covering the topics identified in prior studies focusing on specific interests.

EF1 was compared in patients with COVID-19 and in historical controls with similar comorbidities (n=266) who had undergone echocardiography before the COVID-19 pandemic. In patients with COVID-19, EF1 was a strong predictor of survival in each patient group (Wuhan and London). In the combined group, EF1 was a stronger predictor of survival than other clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics including age, comorbidities, and biochemical markers.

It is a 45-minute reflective practice using storytelling. It provides an opportunity for people taking part to share recent experiences of their work in health and social care, focusing on participants' emotional and social response to their work. Unlike Schwartz Rounds, the audience is restricted in numbers (maximum 30), is drawn from a single department of a healthcare site rather than from across the organisation, is run and facilitated using virtual platforms, and relays stories from the recent (not distant) past. Methods/Design Two facilitators already trained in delivering Schwartz Rounds (one PEM consultant from the department plus one Trust clinical psychologist) were given additional specific training for running Team Time in March 2020. Six sessions between April and July 2020 were held. The formats of these sessions were as per guidance set by the Point of Care Foundation (UK). A theme for each session was set in advance, with two storytellers invited and prepared in advance by the two facilitators. Two storytellers related a five minute story each uninterrupted, followed by a facilitated discussion with the audience to share their own experiences and/or resonances to the stories told. Standardised web surveys designed by the Point of Care Foundation designed to collate both quantitative an qualitative feedback were distributed by E-mail to all participants the same day. Results/Conclusions Survey respondents n=40 85% strongly agreed that Team Time would help them work better with colleagues. 90% plan to attend Team Time again. 95% would recommend Team Time to colleagues. 92.5% felt that the sessions overall were either excellent or exceptional.

However, certain clinical scenarios warrant biventricular mechanical support. One strategy for some patients is the excision of both ventricles and the implantation of two VAD pumps as a total artificial heart (TAH). This has recently been made possible by the improvements in device design and the small profile of centrifugal devices. This TAH approach remains experimental with many important challenges such as the device settings to balance the right and left circulation, the orientation of the devices and the outflow graft with their influence on hemolysis and stability, and the outcome of chronic support using such an orientation.

Indeed, it does appear that no-one has yet reported phonological priming effects in such situations. The question of whether it is possible to observe phonological priming in such situations was more fully examined in the present experiments. Experiment 1 involved a masked priming SDT using Japanese Kanji script in which the primes and targets were homophonic but shared no characters. Experiment 2 was a parallel experiment using Chinese stimuli. In both experiments, phonological priming effects were observed for both one- and two-character words. These experiments indicate that, although the priming effects in masked priming SDTs undoubtedly have a strong orthographic basis, phonological codes also play a role even when the prime and (word) target are written in the same script.","output":"Phonological priming effects with same-script primes and targets in the masked priming same-different task"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, an epidemiological study was performed by focusing on all confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Xuzhou, a prefecture-level city, and a transportation hub with 10.44 million population in the east region of China.

A sufficiently high Se status is a prerequisite for adequate immune response, and preventable endemic diseases are known from areas with Se deficiency. Biomarkers of Se status decline strongly in pregnancy, severe illness, or COVID-19, reaching critically low concentrations. Notably, these conditions are associated with an increased risk for autoimmune disease (AID). Positive effects on the immune system are observed with Se supplementation in pregnancy, autoimmune thyroid disease, and recovery from severe illness. However, some studies reported null results; the database is small, and randomized trials are sparse. The current need for research on the link between AID and Se deficiency is particularly obvious for rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Despite these gaps in knowledge, it seems timely to realize that severe Se deficiency may trigger AID in susceptible subjects. Improved dietary choices or supplemental Se are efficient ways to avoid severe Se deficiency, thereby decreasing AID risk and improving disease course. A personalized approach is needed in clinics and during therapy, while population-wide measures should be considered for areas with habitual low Se intake. Finland has been adding Se to its food chain for more than 35 yearsa wise and commendable decision, according to todays knowledge. It is unfortunate that the health risks of Se deficiency are often neglected, while possible side effects of Se supplementation are exaggerated, leading to disregard for this safe and promising preventive and adjuvant treatment options.

This was an observational, retrospective study, conducted at a tertiary hospital. All subjects with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring hospital admission at our institution between the months of March and April 2020 were included in the study.

We then created a model to predict the subsequent development of a PE with the current D-dimer levels of the subject. D-dimer levels changed over time from COVID-19 diagnosis, but were always higher in subjects who went on to develop a PE. Regarding the predictive model created, the area under the curve of the ROC analyses of the cross-validation predictions was 0.72. The risk of pulmonary embolism for the same D-dimer levels varied depending on the number of days elapsed since COVID-19 diagnosis and D-dimer determination.

In 2018 an index of small-area household food insecurity risk was developed and utilised by public and third sector organisations to target interventions; this measure needed updating to better support decisions in different contexts. Methods : We held interviews with stakeholders (n=11) and completed a scoping review to identify appropriate variables to create an updated risk measure. We then sourced a range of open access secondary data to develop an indices of food insecurity risk in English neighbourhoods. Following a process of data transformation and normalisation, we tested combinations of variables and identified the most appropriate data to reflect household food insecurity risk in urban and rural areas. Results : Eight variables, reflecting both household circumstances and local service availability, were separated into two domains with equal weighting for a new index, the Complex Index, and a subset of these make up the Simple Index. Within the Complex Index the Compositional Domain includes population characteristics while the Structural Domain reflects access to resources. The Compositional Domain is correlated well with free school meal eligibility (r s =0.705) and prevalence of childhood obesity (r s =0.641). This domain was the preferred measure for use in most areas when shared with stakeholders, and when assessed alongside other configurations of the variables. Areas of highest risk were most often located in the North of England. Conclusion : We recommend the use of the Compositional Domain for all areas, with inclusion of the Structural Domain in rural areas where locational disadvantage makes it more difficult to access services.

Ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), P/F, is currently used as a marker of ARF severity in Covid-19. P/F does not reflect the respiratory efforts made by patients to maintain arterial blood oxygenation, such as tachypnea and hyperpnea, leading to hypocapnia.

Every sensor suffers from this fundamental drawback, which limits its sensitivity, specificity, and longevity. Existing efforts to improve signal-to-noise ratio involve introducing additional steps to reduce nonspecific binding, which increases the cost of the sensor. Conducting polymer-based chemiresistive biosensors can be mechanically flexible, are inexpensive, label-free, and capable of detecting specific biomolecules in complex samples without purification steps, making them very versatile. In this paper, a poly (3,4-ethylenedioxyphene) (PEDOT) and poly (3-thiopheneethanol) (3TE) interpenetrating network on polypropyleneCcellulose fabric is used as a platform for a chemiresistive biosensor, and the specific and nonspecific binding events are studied using the Biotin/Avidin and Gliadin/G12-specific complementary binding pairs. We observed that specific binding between these pairs results in a negative R with the addition of the analyte and this response increases with increasing analyte concentration. Nonspecific binding was found to have the opposite response, a positive R upon the addition of analyte was seen in nonspecific binding cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: By using administrative data from all outpatient hospital encounters in California (2005-2011) and Florida (2005-2014), all patients in the outpatient setting with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata were identified. Patients were categorized as undergoing hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization (UAE), or no intervention. Hospital stay durations and costs were recorded for each encounter. RESULTS: A total of 227,489 patients with uterine leiomyomata were included, among whom 39.9% (n = 90,800) underwent an intervention, including hysterectomy (73%), myomectomy (19%), or UAE (8%). The proportion of patients undergoing hysterectomy increased over time (2005, hysterectomy, 53.2%; myomectomy, 26.9%; UAE, 18.0%; vs 2013, hysterectomy, 80.1%; myomectomy, 14.4%; UAE, 4.0%). Hysterectomy was eventually performed in 3.5% of patients who underwent UAE and 4.1% who underwent myomectomy. Mean length of stay following hysterectomy was significantly longer (0.5 d) vs myomectomy (0.2 d) and UAE (0.3 d; P < .001 for both). The mean encounter cost for UAE ($3,772) was significantly less than those for hysterectomy ($5,409; P < .001) and myomectomy ($6,318; P < .001). Of the 7,189 patients who underwent UAE during the study period, 3.5% underwent subsequent hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of women treated with hysterectomy in the outpatient setting has increased since 2005. As a lower-cost alternative with a low rate of conversion to hysterectomy, UAE may be an underutilized treatment option for patients with uterine leiomyomata.","output":"Utilization of Endovascular and Surgical Treatments for Symptomatic Uterine Leiomyomas: A Population Health Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medication-related problems (MRPs) are an important healthcare problem. This study aimed at reviewing the published literature in Ethiopia to estimate the prevalence of MRPs and to summarize associated factors. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Google databases from inception to April 2020. Articles that addressed MRPs were eligible for inclusion. Article screening, data extraction, and study quality analysis were performed independently by two reviewers. Studies targeting specific disease condition were considered as specific, while the remaining were nonspecific. The prevalence of MRPs was then computed in medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), while associated factors were summarized in a table. Of the thirty-two studies included in this review, the majority of them (n = 24) targeted MRPs, while the remaining studies (n = 8) investigated adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Studies varied in the study design, study population, and definition of MRPs and ADRs used. The overall median prevalence was 70.8% (IQR = 61.0-80.2) with a range of 16.0% to 88.7%. The median prevalence of MRPs in specific and nonspecific patients was 71.2% (IQR = 60.7-71.2) and 69.3% (IQR = 60.7-82.0), respectively. In addition, a median of 36.6% (IQR = 10.0-85.7) of patients experienced ADRs. Indication-related and effectiveness-related MRPs were commonly reported in both specific and nonspecific patients, while noncompliance MRPs were more prevalent among specific patients than nonspecific patients. Increasing age, presence of co-morbidity, and an increasing number of drugs were the commonly identified contributing factors of MRPs. The review showed that more than two-thirds of the study participants developed MRPs. Hence, an integrated approach should be designed to improve the optimal use of pharmacotherapy to reduce the burden of MRPs. Further, future research should be undertaken to prepare cost-effective and efficient prevention mechanisms to reduce or halt the development of MRPs.","output":"Medication-related problems and adverse drug reactions in Ethiopia: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shriners Hospitals for Children \\\\ Northern California provides highly specialized pediatric surgical care.

STUDY DESIGN National cross-sectional community survey. SETTING Australian general public. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged over 18 years (N = 4362). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p < 0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59%% vs 72% p < 0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. People with inadequate health literacy were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5; p < 0.001) and reported more difficulty with remembering and accessing medicines since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7; p < 0.001). People with lower health literacy were also more likely to endorse misinformed beliefs about COVID-19 and vaccinations (in general) than those with adequate health literacy. The same pattern of results was observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home. CONCLUSION Our findings show that there are important disparities in COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours according to people's health literacy and language. These have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. People with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and are also most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19.

The European Association of Urology has committed increasing resources into the development of high quality clinical guidelines based on such SRs and MAs. OBJECTIVE In this paper, we have summarised the process of conducting SRs for underpinning clinical practice guidelines under the auspices of the European Association of Urology Guidelines Office. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The process involves explicit methods and the findings should be reproducible. When conducting a SR, the essential first step is to formulate a clear and answerable research question. An extensive literature search lays the foundation for evidence synthesis. Data are extracted independently by two reviewers and any disagreements are resolved by discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS In SRs, data for particular outcomes in individual randomised controlled trials may be combined statistically in a meta-analysis to increase power when the studies are similar enough. Biases in studies included in a SR/MA can lead to either an over estimation or an under estimation of true intervention effect size, resulting in heterogeneity in outcome between studies. A number of different tools are available such as Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool for randomised controlled trials. In circumstances where there is too much heterogeneity, or when a review has included nonrandomised comparative studies, it is more appropriate to conduct a narrative synthesis. The GRADE tool for assessing quality of evidence strives to be a structured and transparent system, which can be applied to all evidence, regardless of quality. A SR not only identifies, evaluates, and summarises the best available evidence, but also the gaps to be targeted by future studies. CONCLUSIONS SRs and MAs are integral in developing sound clinical practice guidelines and recommendations. PATIENT SUMMARY Clinical practice guidelines should be evidence based, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential in their production.

Investigation of the lockdown impact dependent on first order reaction kinetics demonstrated higher effect of lockdown 1 on controlling the COVID-19 spreading rate when contrasted with lockdown 2 and 3. Although decreasing trend was followed for the reaction rate constant of different lockdown stages, the distinction between the lockdown 2 and 3 was minimal.

In case of mathematical approach, exponential model indicated adequate performance for the prediction of the spreading rate behavior. For the FFNN based modeling, 1-5-1 was selected as the best architecture so as to predict adequate spreading rate for all the cases. The architecture also showed effective performance in order to forecast number of cases for next 14 days. The recovery percentage was modeled as a function of number of days with the assistance of polynomial fitting.

The demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and the tendency toward ON were assessed using an online questionnaire. Findings: The FCV-19S scores differed according to gender and were higher in the female students (P < 0.001). In students with a high EAT-26 score, the tendency toward ON was higher (P < 0.001). According to estimated regression models, a unit increase of the FCV-19S scores led to a decrease of 0.10 points in the Orthorexia Nervosa Evaluation Scale-11 (ORTO-11) scores. It was determined that students with high FCV-19S scores had a tendency toward ON and increased EAT-26 scores (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively).

Our main outcomes of interest were anastomotic leak, aspiration pneumonia, mortality, and length of hospital stay (LOS). Pooled mean differences (MD) and risk ratios (RR) estimates were obtained using a DerSimonian random effects model. RESULTS Two reviewers screened 613 abstracts and identified 6 RCTs eligible for inclusion; 2 regarding EOI and 4 for ENR. For EOI (2 studies, n = 389), was not associated with differences in risk of: anastomotic leak (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.407, 2.500; I2 : 0%), aspiration pneumonia (RR: 1.018; 95% CI: 0.407, 2.500), mortality (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.020, 50.0).

The aims were to reveal different strategies by which they avoid mandatory vaccination schedules and hypothetical situations in which they would reconsider vaccinating, as well as to identify features of related decision-making. We conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with vaccine hesitant parents and analyzed the data using the framework of thematic analyses. The identified themes were related to the parents decision-making process, reflection as well as justification of their decision, avoidance behavior of mandatory vaccination schedules and related consequences, dealing with outcomes of the decision and reconsidering vaccinating. The results support and extend previous findings regarding vaccine reasoning, linking hesitancy with the experientially intuitive thinking style and social intuitionist model of moral reasoning.

However, reduced specimen stability during extended transport, the absence of cold chain to centralized laboratories, and biosafety concerns surrounding specimen handling has limited this expansion. In the following study, we evaluated eNAT (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) as an alternative transport system to address the biosafety and stability challenges associated with expanding COVID-19 diagnostics to rural and remote regions. In this study, we demonstrated that high titer severe acute respiratory virus syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lysate placed into eNAT medium cannot be propagated in cell culture, supporting viral inactivation. To account for off-site testing in these settings, we assessed the stability of contrived nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens stored for up to 14 days in various transport medium (eNAT, eSwab, viral transport media [VTM], saline and phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) at 4C, 22-25C, and 35C. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was unaffected by sample storage temperature over the 2 weeks when stored in eNAT or PBS (change in cycle threshold [&#916;CT ] &#8804; 1). In contrast, variable stability was observed across test conditions for other transport media. As eNAT can inactivate SARS-CoV-2, it may support COVID-19 diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC). Evaluation of compatibility of eNAT with Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay demonstrated equivalent diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared to VTM. Taken together, these findings suggest that the implementation of eNAT as a collection device has the potential to expand COVID-19 testing to areas with limited healthcare access.","output":"Copan eNAT Transport System to Address Challenges in COVID-19 Diagnostics in Regions with Limited Testing Access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The urgency of the search and introduction into medical practice of the method for the therapy of severe forms of pneumonia COVID-19 is due to the lack of effective treatment methods that can destroy the pathogen Expectations of a good clinical effect from the application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are not groundless: there is a scientific justification in using MSCs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and of the proven mechanisms of their action Along with this, there are very little reliable data about the mechanism of MSCs' action when they are systemically administrated to a human or on the distribution of cells in the body and the long-term consequences of such administration Data from model experiments are contradictory both concerning the specific action of MSCs and their safety If clinical studies show an acceptable risk/benefit ratio for the application of MSCs, countries in which such studies have been conducted can expect their introduction into medical practice In Russia, it is necessary to initiate experimental verification of the specific action of MSCs and the risks of their use in COVID-19 conditions in a sufficient quantity, and, in parallel, to create a mechanism for accelerated but justified admission of biomedical cell products into practice","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy-Is the Vessel Half Full or Half Empty?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the two last decades, coronaviruses have affected human life in different ways, especially in terms of health and economy.

SUMMARY ANSWER Focal adenomyosis located in the outer myometrium (FAOM) was observed more frequently in women with endometriosis, and was significantly associated with the DIE phenotype. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY An association between endometriosis and adenomyosis has been reported previously, although data regarding the association between MRI appearance of adenomyosis and the endometriosis phenotype are currently still lacking. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was an observational, cross-sectional study using data prospectively collected from non-pregnant patients who were between 18 and 42 years of age, and who underwent surgery for symptomatic benign gynecological conditions between January 2011 and December 2014. For each patient, a standardized questionnaire was completed during a face-to-face interview conducted by the surgeon during the month preceding the surgery. Only women with preoperative standardized uterine MRIs were retained for this study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Surgery was performed on 292 patients with signed consent and available preoperative MRIs. After a thorough surgical examination of the abdomino-pelvic cavity, 237 women with histologically proven endometriosis were allocated to the endometriosis group and 55 symptomatic women without evidence of endometriosis to the endometriosis free group. The existence of diffuse or FAOM was studied in both groups and according to surgical endometriosis phenotypes (SUP, OMA and DIE). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Adenomyosis was observed in 59.9% (n = 175) of the total sample population (n = 292). Based on MRI, the distribution of adenomyosis was as follows: isolated diffuse adenomyosis (53 patients; 18.2%), isolated FAOM (74 patients; 25.3%), associated diffuse and FAOM (48 patients; 16.4%). Diffuse adenomyosis (isolated and associated to FAOM) was observed in one-third of the patients regardless of whether they were endometriotic patients or endometriosis free women taken as controls (34.2% (81 cases) versus 36.4% (20 cases)); P = 0.764. Among endometriotic women, diffuse adenomyosis (isolated and associated to FAOM) failed to reach significant correlation with the endometriosis phenotypes (SUP, 20.0% (8 cases); OMA, 45.2% (14 cases) and DIE, 35.5% (59 cases); P = 0.068). In striking contrast, there was a significant increase in the frequency of FAOM in endometriosis-affected women than in controls (119 cases (50.2%) versus 5.4% (3 cases); P < 0.001). FAOM correlated with the endometriosis phenotypes, significantly with DIE (SUP, 7.5% (3 cases); OMA, 19.3% (6 cases) and DIE, 66.3% (110 cases); P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION There was a possible selection bias due to the specificity of the study design, as it only included surgical patients in a referral center that specializes in endometriosis surgery. Therefore, women referred to our center may have suffered from particularly severe forms of endometriosis. This could explain the high number of women with DIE (166/237-70%) in our study group. This referral bias for women with severe lesions may have amplified the difference in association of FAOM with the endometriosis-affected patients compared to women without endometriosis. Furthermore, according to inclusion criteria, women in the endometriosis free group were symptomatic women. This may introduce some bias as symptomatic women may be more prone to have associated adenomyosis that in turn could have been overrepresented in the endometriosis free group. Whether this selection could have introduced a bias in the relationship between endometriosis and adenomyosis remains unknown. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This study opens the door to future epidemiological, clinical and mechanistic studies aimed at better characterizing diffuse and focal adenomyosis. Further studies are necessary to adequately determine if diffuse and focal adenomyosis are two separate entities that differ in terms of pathogenesis.

METHODOLOGY: Our study included age and sex-based analysis of epidemiological data of infected and deceased patients from various countries. The patient data was graphically depicted with the slope's calculation to describe a gradual or steep spread of the disease along with subsequent rise or fall in the death reports. RESULTS: Population groups of 20-49 years of age and 50 years-above were highly vulnerable to infection. Interestingly, 20-49 years of age group was most affected in India. However, higher population of the deceased were reported in the 50 years-above in all countries. India and South Korea demonstrated a gradual appearance of COVID-19 positive cases than other countries illustrated by reduced slope %. Further the highest percentage of infected people and deaths were reported from the densely populated states of India. We observed a sex independent prevalence of COVID-19. The BCG and JE vaccine are unique in the vaccination regime of India and South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ACE-2 expression in the children's nasal epithelium may be responsible for reduced SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Countries showed varying patterns in COVID-19 spread and associated mortality. It may be influenced by factors, such as screening strategy, countries demography, implementation of lockdown, etc. Due to limited evidence, it would be difficult to point to the influence of the virus on either sexes.

Hence, increased SpO(2) levels in COVID-19 patients could be crucial for their quality of life and recovery. This study aimed to demonstrate that a 30-minute single session of dorsal low-field thoracic magnetic stimulation (LF-ThMS) can be employed to increase SpO(2) levels in COVID-19 patients significantly. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variables associated with LF-ThMS, such as frequency, magnetic flux density, and temperature in the dorsal thorax, might be correlated to SpO(2) levels in these patients. Here we employed an LF-ThMS device to noninvasively deliver a pulsed magnetic field from 100 to 118 Hz and 10.5 to 13.1 milliTesla (i.e., 105 to 131 Gauss) to the dorsal thorax. These values are within the intensity range of several pulsed electromagnetic field devices employed in physical therapy worldwide. We designed a single-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on 5 COVID-19 patients who underwent 2 sessions of the study (real and sham LF-ThMS) and 12 patients who underwent only the real LF-ThMS. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between magnetic flux density, frequency, or temperature, associated with the real LF-ThMS and SpO(2) levels in all COVID-19 patients. However, the 5 patients in the sham-controlled study did not exhibit a significant change in their SpO(2) levels during sham stimulation. The employed frequencies and magnetic flux densities were safe for the patients. We did not observe adverse events after the LF-ThMS intervention.

Developing data-driven approaches to improve access to care necessitates a deeper understanding of HNHR adults attitudes toward telemedicine and technology access. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the willingness, access, and ability of HNHR veterans to use telemedicine for health care. METHODS: WWe designed a questionnaire conducted via mail or telephone or in person. Among HNHR veterans who were identified using predictive modeling with national Veterans Affairs data, we assessed willingness to use video visits for health care, access to necessary equipment, and comfort with using technology. We evaluated physical health, including frailty, physical function, performance of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL); mental health; and social needs, including Area Deprivation Index, transportation, social support, and social isolation. RESULTS: The average age of the 602 HNHR veteran respondents was 70.6 (SD 9.2; range 39-100) years; 99.7% (600/602) of the respondents were male, 61% (367/602) were White, 36% (217/602) were African American, 17.3% (104/602) were Hispanic, 31.2% (188/602) held at least an associate degree, and 48.2% (290/602) were confident filling medical forms. Of the 602 respondents, 327 (54.3%) reported willingness for video visits, whereas 275 (45.7%) were unwilling. Willing veterans were younger (P<.001) and more likely to have an associate degree (P=.002), be health literate (P<.001), live in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods (P=.048), be independent in IADLs (P=.02), and be in better physical health (P=.04). A higher number of those willing were able to use the internet and email (P<.001). Of the willing veterans, 75.8% (248/327) had a video-capable device. Those with video-capable technology were younger (P=.004), had higher health literacy (P=.01), were less likely to be African American (P=.007), were more independent in ADLs (P=.005) and IADLs (P=.04), and were more adept at using the internet and email than those without the needed technology (P<.001). Age, confidence in filling forms, general health, and internet use were significantly associated with willingness to use video visits. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the HNHR respondents were unwilling for video visits and a quarter of those willing lacked requisite technology. The gap between those willing and without requisite technology is greater among older, less health literate, African American veterans; those with worse physical health; and those living in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our study highlights that HNHR veterans have complex needs, which risk being exacerbated by the video care shift. Although technology holds vast potential to improve health care access, certain vulnerable populations are less likely to engage, or have access to, technology.

Within psychiatry, there was an expectation that junior doctors would be redeployed, with senior psychiatrists stepping down to cover physical health and on-call duties. Senior leadership in mental health trusts were also preparing for COVID-19 outbreaks on psychiatric wards and were developing strategies for managing a novel illness with a poorly understood clinical course. Many psychiatrist expressed anxieties around their competency in assessing and managing acutely physically unwell patients in a mental health setting. This project aimed to improve confidence of psychiatrists in core physical health competencies through devising and delivering an evolving SBE package. METHOD: Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust redeployed two higher trainees from their simulation faculty to work full time on developing a SBE package. This was requested by senior leadership to deliver training about assessing and managing physically unwell patients in the context of COVID-19. This training was devised as a 90 minute didactic lecture following by 90 minutes of SBE. This was delivered at 6 sites through 10 opt-in sessions available to all doctors in the trust over 4 weeks. Pre and post-course questionnaires were given to all participants to measure the effect. RESULT: 102 medical staff attended the SBE workshops. Feedback was completed by 93 (91%) doctors prior to the course and 97 (95%) post. Before the workshop, 33% did not feel they had a structured approach for assessing an acutely unwell patient, which reduced to 0% after completing the course. On a 5-point Likert scale, confidence in managing COVID-19 symptoms increased from 2.54/5 to 4.07/5 overall with 89% of doctors feeling confident or very confident. There were similar increases in confidence in managing critically unwell patients (2.7/5 pre; 3.95/5 post) and in identifying alternative causes for acutely unwell patients (2.63/5 pre; 4.02/5 post).

Due to its essential role, numerous studies have been conducted so far, which have confirmed 3CL(pro) as an attractive drug target to combat Covid-19 and have reported a vast number of inhibitors and their co-crystal structures. Despite all the ongoing efforts, D-peptides, which possess key advantages over L-peptides as therapeutic agents, have not been explored as potential drug candidates against 3CL(pro). The current work fills this gap by reporting an in silico approach for the discovery of D-peptides capable of inhibiting 3CL(pro) that involves structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) of an in-house library of D-tripeptides and D-tetrapeptides into the protease active site and subsequent rescoring steps, including Molecular Mechanics Generalized-Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) free energy calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Recent findings have unequivocally identified type 2 diabetes (T2D) as a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation and immune senescence. Immunosenescence is a hallmark of the prolonged low-grade systemic inflammation, in particular associated with metabolic syndrome and can be a cause as well as a consequence of T2D. Diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and remodelling and with particular changes to myocardial structure, function, metabolism and energetics collectively resulting in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Both cardiomyocytes and immune cells undergo metabolic remodelling in T2D and as a result become trapped in a vicious cycle of lost metabolic flexibility, thus losing their key adaptive mechanisms to dynamic changes in O(2) and nutrient availability. Immunosenescence driven by metabolic stress may be both the cause and key contributing factor to cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy by inducing metabolic perturbations that can lead to impaired energetics, a strong predictor of cardiac mortality. Here we review our current understanding of the cross-talk between inflammaging and cardiomyocytes in T2D cardiomyopathy. We discuss potential mechanisms of metabolic convergence between cell types which, we hypothesize, might tip the balance between resolution of the inflammation versus adverse cardiac metabolic remodelling in T2D cardiomyopathy.

Production of secondary metabolites from callus induction in vitro is considered more efficient and in a short time for commercial applications. The composition of hormones in callus media affects the secondary metabolites formed. The study was conducted to determine the effect of synthetic hormones auxin (BAP) and cytokinin (NAA) on callus percentage, fresh and dry callus cell weight and the average time of callus formation. The call percentage (100%) was obtained in different combinations of BAP and NAA in MS medium. The highest fresh weight of callus (165.50 gL?1) and dry cell weight (28.47 gL?1) were observed in MS medium (1.5 mgL?1 BAP and 1 mgL?1 NAA) within 7 days initial formation time of callus. The results showed that all the indices measured were positively correlated with callus induction in T. sinensis.","output":"Callus inducement of Toona sinensis: Potential agents against SARS-Corona virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Aims The present observational study aims to describe the political actions in place to fight COVID-19 in the South and Central America region (SACA) while protecting individuals with diabetes. Methods A survey with 12 questions was shared with all IDF-SACA member organizations, in 18 countries. A descriptive analysis was performed and a multivariate cluster analysis technique pam (partitioning around medoids) was applied. Results Two groups of countries were identified. The first group reported more difficulties (limitations in accessing basic or health needs) and fears (concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic), mostly countries with stricter measures to contain the spread of the virus, whereas most of the second group consisted of countries with less restrictive measures, and reported fewer difficulties. Only 37% responded that a policy was put into place to protect individuals with diabetes delivering their medicines and supplies at home (16%) or receiving at once medicine and supplies enough for 2-3 months (21%). All respondents reported as one of the main fears be infected and do not receive adequate treatment and/or getting infected if going to the hospital or medical appointments.

There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. To forecast epidemics, classical approaches usually need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here, we propose a data-driven, parameter-free, geometric approach to access the emergence of a pandemic state by studying the Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci network curvatures. Discrete Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can provide analogous results for COVID-19 epidemic time-series. We first compute both curvatures in a toy-model of epidemic time-series with delays, which allows us to create epidemic networks. We also compared our results to classical network metrics. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures can be a parameter-free estimate for identifying a pandemic state in the simulated epidemic. On this basis, we then compute both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures for real epidemic networks built from COVID-19 epidemic time-series available at the World Health Organization (WHO). This approach allows us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of our method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for the pandemic state, regardless of parameter estimation and stochastic modelling. This work opens the possibility of using discrete geometry to study epidemic networks.","output":"Using discrete Ricci curvatures to infer COVID-19 epidemic network fragility and systemic risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social distancing practices were introduced to curb infection rates in many countries. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these restrictions on behaviours and well-being and whether individual differences predict changes in well-being. METHODS: Australian adults participated in a cross-sectional, online survey during May 2020. The survey captured demographic information; health behaviours; personality traits; life satisfaction and COVID-19-related attitudes, financial concerns, perceived risks and impacts. RESULTS: In total, 3745 (86.8% of 4313) participants completed all items. Participants were mostly female (85.7%) and 56.4 years (standard deviation [SD] = 12.6) on average. Over 95.0% of the sample indicated they had been social distancing or isolating. Health behaviours and well-being had generally worsened, with social connections being the most negatively affected. Life satisfaction was significantly lower since restrictions. For changes in life satisfaction, extroversion was a risk factor and openness to experience was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, well-being was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing particularly in this sample containing mainly older women. In future, it will be crucial to understand why and who may be differentially affected, to encourage behaviours that are protective of well-being.","output":"Individual differences and changes in lifestyle behaviours predict decreased subjective well-being during COVID-19 restrictions in an Australian sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes two cases of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to incessant ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) in an infant presenting with severe left ventricular dysfunction and hemodynamic instability.

We used the hybrid intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair (IPOM) plus method, which combines open and laparoscopic surgery to treat incarcerated umbilical hernia in a severely obese patient. CASE PRESENTATION A 46-year-old man presented in our department with a chief complaint of a painful mass in the umbilical region. Incarcerated umbilical hernia was diagnosed on the basis of abdominal computed tomography, and the decision was made to perform emergency surgery. The patient was severely obese (body mass index, 53.8 kg/m2), and the incarcerated portion of the hernia was therefore first addressed by open surgery. As bowel resection was unnecessary, the risk of infection was considered low, and after direct closure of the hernia orifice, IPOM was performed laparoscopically using the hybrid IPOM plus method. CONCLUSION Among severely obese patients, first trocar insertion is difficult and the wound site tends to come under strain, meaning that simple closure of the hernia orifice results in a high recurrence rate. The hybrid IPOM plus method used in this case combines open surgery and laparoscopy and appears useful for treating uninfected incarcerated umbilical hernia in severely obese patients safely and with an anticipated low rate of postoperative recurrence.","output":"Intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair (IPOM) plus technique using a hybrid procedure of open laparotomy and laparoscopic approach (hybrid IPOM plus) for incarceration of umbilical hernia in a severely obese patient: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the end of December 2019, there was a reported of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China Later, this virus named COVID-19 became one of a major outbreak of the world Since the virus can be spread through the air, the social distancing is essential Many reports indicated that this will make the world change into a new normal Working or learning from home by using information and communication technologies will become a new standard of the future This paper proposed the ideas of the King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi to design and implement the hybrid classroom for teaching and conducting university's business after the pandemic crisis The hybrid classroom concept aims to reducing the number of involved people in each activity by offloading some group of people to online from their home The hybrid room has also been designed to allow online and physical attendees interact during operating sessions The conclusion of this paper describes the problems and obstacles that arise during the implementation of prototype rooms, as well as the solutions and future direction of this work ? 2020 ACM","output":"Hybrid Classroom: Designing for the New Normal after COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSARS Co-V-2 (COVID-19) mitigation strategies have resulted in limited clinical operations for sexual health services and adolescents and young adults (AYA) have received mixed messages about the risk for serious COVID-19 infection.

However, little is known about the impact of polypharmacy on clinical outcomes among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review summarizes the available literature on the association between polypharmacy and specific drug classes, and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted an electronic database search on Embase, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, LITCOVID, PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and China national knowledge infrastructure for studies on Polypharmacy among COVID-19 patients using relevant combinations of the keywords. Only studies published between November 2019 to September 2020 were included. Seven articles out of 1502 unique articles met the inclusion criteria and were used for the current study. We adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline in conducting and reporting this systematic review. RESULTS: The total sample size of all studies was 474,342, out of which 10,519 patients were COVID-19 positive, and 4818 COVID-19 positive patients experienced polypharmacy. Five out of the 7 included studies found associations between polypharmacy and negative clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Polypharmacy was associated with increase in the relative risk of a positive COVID-19 test result (P < 0.01), death among male COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001), increase in the rate of acute kidney injury (P = 0.003), and adverse drug reactions (P < 0.001).

METHODS We examined the affect of TyG index on incident CRC in this historical cohort study of 27,944 (16,454 men and 11,490 women) participants. TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL)  fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL)/2]. The impact of TyG index on incident CRC was investigated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise, systolic blood pressure and creatinine. The covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off value of TyG index for the incidence of CRC. RESULTS During the median 4.4-year follow-up, 116 participants were diagnosed as CRC. The cumulative incidence rate of CRC were 0.4%. In Cox proportional hazard model, the HRs of TyG index were 1.38 (95% Confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.91, p = 0.049) after adjusting for covariates.

To improve quality of care, we implemented an enhanced patient clinical streamlining (EPACS) process that establishes an early connection and coordinates care before the first surgical outpatient visit at our specialty cancer center. METHODS: During a pre-visit EPACS phone call to new patients, an advanced practice provider (APP) collected medical history and ordered work-up tests or consultations if feasible. First visit cancellation rate, number of patients who started treatment, time to start of treatment, and satisfaction by the care team and patient were compared between patients treated with versus without EPACS. RESULTS: Among 5062 consecutive new patients, 720 (14%) received an EPACS call and 4342 did not (86%); work-up was ordered pre-visit in 34% and 16%, respectively. Fewer EPACS patients cancelled the first visit (4.6% vs. 12%, p < 0.001), more started treatment (55% vs. 50%, p = 0.037), and their time to treatment was shorter, but not significantly (median 17 vs. 19 days, p = 0.086).

Although current genome assemblies from Old World camelids are very useful for investigating genome-wide diversity, demography and population structure, they have inconsistencies and gaps that limit analyses at local genomic scales. Improved and more accurate genome assemblies and annotations are needed to study complex genomic regions like adaptive and innate IR genes. RESULTS: In this work, we improved the genome assemblies of the three Old World camel species C domestic dromedary and Bactrian camel, and the two-humped wild camel C via different computational methods. The newly annotated dromedary genome assembly CamDro3 served as reference to scaffold the NCBI RefSeq genomes of domestic Bactrian and wild camels. These upgraded assemblies were then used to assess nucleotide diversity of IR genes within and between species, and to compare the diversity found in immune genes and the rest of the genes in the genome. We detected differences in the nucleotide diversity among the three Old World camelid species and between IR gene groups, i.e., innate versus adaptive. Among the three species, domestic Bactrian camels showed the highest mean nucleotide diversity. Among the functionally different IR gene groups, the highest mean nucleotide diversity was observed in the major histocompatibility complex. CONCLUSIONS: The new camel genome assemblies were greatly improved in terms of contiguity and increased size with fewer scaffolds, which is of general value for the scientific community. This allowed us to perform in-depth studies on genetic diversity in immunity-related regions of the genome. Our results suggest that differences of diversity across classes of genes appear compatible with a combined role of population history and differential exposures to pathogens, and consequent different selective pressures.","output":"Nucleotide diversity of functionally different groups of immune response genes in Old World camels based on newly annotated and reference-guided assemblies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic many researchers and health advisory institutions have focused on virus spread prediction through epidemiological models.

There are no reports of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in these patients. AIMS: To investigate prevalence of COVID-19 cases and seroprevalence among rheumatologic patients and the risk factors for infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a rheumatologic population. An online questionnaire was sent on 31 April 2020. Blood samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. RESULTS: The study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different from prevalence in Israel on 4 May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759 respectively).

Yet, there is lack of agreement about its precise role and, notably, whether loneliness should be included as a core symptom for diagnosis of grief complications. The ongoing threat of heightened social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic underlines the need to understand the impact of loneliness, and to accurately chart its prevalence, intensity, duration, and associated difficulties in the context of bereavement. Assessment issues are central to this endeavor. In this article, we review the scientific literature to examine how loneliness after bereavement has been operationalized and measured.

It follows the clear observation that, rather than two connected waves, there have been many waves of infections and fatalities in the regions of England of various magnitudes, usually overlapping. The waves are self-limiting, in that clear peaks are seen, particularly in reported positive test rates. The present model considers fatalities as the data reported are more reliable than positive test rates, particularly so during the first wave when so little testing was done. The model considers the observed waves are essentially similar in form and can be modelled using a single wave form whose final state is only dependent on its peak height and the start date of the particular wave. The basic wave form was modelled using the observed fatality rates for London, which unlike the other regions, exhibited almost completely as a single wave in the ''first wave''. Its form matches rather well with the ''Do Nothing model'' reported by Imperial College on 16th March 2020, but reduced substantially from its expected peak. There are, essentially, only two adjustable parameters used in the model, the start date of the relevant wave and its height. The modelled fatalities for each wave are summated per day and a cumulative curve is matched to that reported. The minimal number of adjustable parameters, alongside the fact that the waves invariably overlap, provides highly stringent conditions on the fitting process. Results are presented for each region for both the ''first'' and ''second'' waves. High levels of accuracy are obtained with R2 values approaching 100% against the ideal fit for both waves. It can also be seen there are fundamental differences between the underlying behaviour of the ''first'' and ''second'' waves.","output":"Modelling the COVID-19 Fatality Rate in England and its Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study is to analyze the results of managing pregnant women and newborns with COVID-19.

The department of extragenital pathology was specially equipped for patients. Based on clinical examination, epidemiological history and laboratory tests, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 179 (86.1%) pregnant women. 29 (16.2%) women were admitted to the intensive care unit and 1 (0.6%) woman required non-invasive mechanical ventilation. 74 women gave birth, of which 35 (47.3%) women - by caesarean section, the rest of the pregnant women after COVID-19 treatment were discharged under the supervision of a antenatal clinic doctor with the progression of pregnancy. The most common indication for caesarean section was fetal distress - 19 (54.2%) women. In 14 (18.9%) cases, the delivery was premature. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome) caused by SARS-CoV showed that coronaviruses can cause not only mild and moderate respiratory diseases, but also severe, and even fatal, primary viral pneumonias, mortality from which, according to the WHO, worldwide was 17.6%. The risk of severe illness in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 does not increase compared with the general population, according to our observations was 15.1%, which corresponds to the data of international experts. There is currently no evidence of miscarriage, fetal malformations, spontaneous preterm birth, and vertical transmission of the virus.

We planned this study aiming to assess the anxiety levels of PLHIV and the sources of their anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sent the web-based questionnaire to PLHIV with the help of a virtual snowball sampling method. Questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic status, information about HIV infection, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Besides, some opinions of the participants about COVID-19 were asked. RESULTS: 307 respondents with the median age of 33, from 32 different cities participated in the study. More than half of the respondents were thinking that COVID-19 is not medically known enough and nearly 45% were thinking that they would have more complication if they acquire COVID-19. One fourth of the participants were anxious. Having a pre-existing psychiatric disorder, perceiving insufficient the preventive measures they are practicing, not being sure about the presence of any patient with COVID-19 in their environment, and living with a household member with a chronic disease were found to be the risk factors of PLHIV for being anxious during this pandemic. BAI scores were correlated with the patient-reported anxiety levels about the spread of COVID-19 in Turkey, acquiring coronavirus, transmitting coronavirus to another person and transmitting HIV to another person. Among the stated conditions, the most exciting one was the spread of the virus all over the country and the least exciting condition was about transmitting HIV to someone else. CONCLUSION: Our results reveals that a significant proportion of the sample is anxious, and our findings are essential for developing evidence-based strategies for decreasing the anxiety of PLHIV especially for the ones who have risk factors and serving better health care to them during this pandemic or other pandemic-like crisis.","output":"COVID-19 related anxiety in people living with HIV: An online cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A survey to investigate the occurrence of cassava anthracnose disease (CAD) and distribution of Colletotrichum spp. in cassava plantations in different eco-zones of the Reconcavo Region in Bahia, Brazil, investigated during the rainy season of 2014.

In India, there is lack of data regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 amongst HCWs due to absence of routine screening programme within the hospital premises. We have designed this study in order to improve our understanding of the incidence of SARS-CoV2 within the health care workers working in a level 4 COVID hospital in Kolkata. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology, ID and BG Hospital, Kolkata upon health care workers who presented with symptoms suggestive of Covid 19 and their direct contacts. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the participants were subjected to Real time RT-PCR for detection of E, RDRP and ORF1B N gene for Covid 19 detection. Result: Out of the 274 HCW tested, 75 (27%) of total HCWs were found to be positive. Among them 33(44%) were frontline workers and rest of them 42 (56%) were non-frontline workers. Predominance of SARS- CoV2 infection was found in male HCWs (57%) than female HCWs (43%). HCWs younger than 45 years (68%) were more infected.52 (69%) HCWs presented with symptoms like fever, sore throat, bodyache, loss of sensation of smell, coughs etc. 23(31%) were asymptomatic with history of direct contact with Covid-19 positive cases.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort was drawn from the electronic health records of two academic medical centers and four community hospitals between February 15 and May 24, 2020. Associations between history of mood disorder and in-hospital mortality and hospital discharge home were examined using regression models among any hospitalized patients with positive tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Among 2,988 admitted individuals, 717 (24.0%) had a prior mood disorder diagnosis. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, and hospital site, presence of a mood disorder prior to admission was associated with greater in-hospital mortality risk beyond hospital day 12 (crude hazard ratio=2.156, 95% CI=1.540, 3.020; fully adjusted hazard ratio=1.540, 95% CI=1.054, 2.250).

Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a well-established model for dissecting virus-host interactions and is one of very few viruses whose RNA replication, gene expression and encapsidation have been reproduced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previously, our laboratory identified 100 non-essential host genes whose loss inhibited or enhanced BMV replication at least 3-fold. However, our isolation of additional BMV-modulating host genes by classical genetics and other results underscore that genes essential for cell growth also contribute to BMV RNA replication at a frequency that may be greater than that of non-essential genes. To systematically identify novel, essential host genes affecting BMV RNA replication, we tested a collection of 900 yeast strains, each with a single essential gene promoter replaced by a doxycycline-repressible promoter, allowing repression of gene expression by adding doxycycline to the growth medium. Using this strain array of 81% of essential yeast genes, we identified 24 essential host genes whose depleted expression reproducibly inhibited or enhanced BMV RNA replication. Relevant host genes are involved in ribosome biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and protein homeostasis, among other cellular processes. BMV 2a(Pol) levels were significantly increased in strains depleted for a heat shock protein (HSF1) or proteasome components (PRE1 and RPT6), suggesting these genes may affect BMV RNA replication by directly or indirectly modulating 2a(Pol) localization, post-translational modification or interacting partners.

Emerging evidence indicates that COVID-19 patients are at a high risk of developing coagulopathy and thrombosis, conditions that elevate levels of D-dimer. It is believed that homocysteine, an amino acid that plays a crucial role in coagulation, may also contribute to these conditions. At present, multiple genes are implicated in the development of these disorders. For example, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FGG, FGA, and F5 mediate increases in D-dimer and SNPs in ABO, CBS, CPS1 and MTHFR mediate differences in homocysteine levels, and SNPs in TDAG8 associate with Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia. In this study, we aimed to uncover the genetic basis of the above conditions by examining genome-wide associations and tissue-specific gene expression to build a molecular network. Based on gene ontology, we annotated various SNPs with five ancestral terms: pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism, vascular diseases, cerebrovascular disorders, and stroke. The gene-gene interaction network revealed three clusters that each contained hallmark genes for D-dimer/fibrinogen levels, homocysteine levels, and arterial/venous thromboembolism with F2 and F5 acting as connecting nodes.

Magnetic resonance imaging is a well-accepted and validated technique for the identification of deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesions, but has some practical and financial drawbacks. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been proposed as a suitable alternative, but validation studies are currently lacking. OBJECTIVE To assess the accuracy of CECT for the identification and characterisation of deep digital flexor tendinopathy. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study of CT, macroscopic and histological findings of the DDFT. METHODS Plain and CECT scans were acquired of 23 limbs of 16 horses with clinical lameness localised to the foot. All horses had lesions of the DDFT that were identified and characterised with CT and CECT with respect to their anatomic location and extent. All horses underwent post mortem examination and gross abnormalities were described. Samples of the DDFT were taken at specific sites (lesion and nonlesion) for histological evaluation. Macroscopic and histological outcomes were compared with CECT findings. RESULTS Of 67 sites in 23 DDFTs that were evaluated, 42 sites in 18 tendons had lesions on CECT images.

However, there are no broadly applicable tools similar to the frailty score as described in the elderly, to define functional phenotype in terms of physical capability and psychosocial wellbeing in CCD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the domains of the frailty in CCD. We prospectively recruited CCD (8C17.5 years old, 70% single ventricle, 27% heart failure, 12% pulmonary hypertension; NYHA classes I, II and III) and age and gender matched healthy controls (total n = 56; CCD n = 34, controls n = 22; age 12.6  2.6 years; 39.3% female). We measured the five domains of frailty: slowness, weakness, exhaustion, body composition and physical activity using developmentally appropriate methods. Age and gender-based population norms were used to obtain Z scores and percentiles for each measurement. Two-tailed t-tests were used to compare the two groups. The CCD group performed significantly worse in all five domains of frailty compared to healthy controls.

Here, we present a study of changes colonoscopy uptake and time to colonoscopy after a red flag diagnosis, pre and postimplementation of COVID-19 policies. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of Veterans ages 50-75 with a red flag sign or symptom for CRC (iron deficiency anemia, hematochezia or abnormal fecal immunochemical blood test [FIT/gFOBT]) receiving VHA care between April 2019 and October 2020. Veterans were grouped based on first red flag diagnosis date into pre-COVID-19 policy (April 2019-October 2019) and post-COVID-19 policy (April October 2020) exposure groups, with a 6-month washout period in between. Primary outcomes were proportion completing colonoscopy and time to colonoscopy completion in policy time window. Covariates included age, sex, race/ ethnicity, marital status, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, first red flag sign/symptom and number of red flag signs/symptoms. We examined odds of colonoscopy policy group using multivariable logistic regression, yielding odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: 33,804 Veterans with red flag signs/symptoms were included (pre-COVID: 19,472;Median age was 68 years (Quartile 1-Quartile 3 [Q1-Q3]: 61-72). Only 32% in the post-COVID group received a colonoscopy, compared with 44% pre-COVID group (p<0.01). Among colonoscopy completers, median time to colonoscopy was significantly different between pre-COVID (median: 65 days;Q1-Q3: 33-140 days) and post-COVID (median: 41 days;Q1-Q3: 20-74 days) groups (p<0.01). In adjusted models, post-COVID group Veterans had 42% lower odds of receiving a diagnostic colonoscopy, compared to those in the pre-COVID group (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.55-0.61). Findings red flag sign/symptom types (Table 2). Conclusions: Lower colonoscopy uptake was observed among individuals with red flag signs/symptoms for CRC post vs. pre-implementation of COVID-19 policies, suggesting future risk for delayed CRC diagnosis and adverse CRC outcomes. However, among completers, time to colonoscopy was shorter post-vs. pre-implementation ofCOVID-19 policies, perhaps attributable to prioritization of individuals needing diagnostic vs. less urgent procedures.

In this paper, an MPC-based control system has been realized in order to control the indoor air temperature in a high efficiency greenhouse. The main objective is to determine the optimal control signals related to the water mass flow rate supplied by a heat pump. The MPC model allows a predefined temperature profile to be tracked with an energy saving approach. The MPC has been implemented as a multiobjective optimization model that takes into account the dynamic behavior of the greenhouse in terms of energy and mass balances. The energy supply is provided by a ground coupled heat pump (GCHP) and by the solar radiation while the energy losses related to heat transfers across the glazed envelope. The proposed MPC method was applied in a smart innovative greenhouse located in Italy, and its performances were compared with a traditional reactive control method in terms of deviation of the indoor temperature in respect to the desired one and in terms of electric power consumption. The results demonstrated that, for a time horizon of 20 h, in a greenhouse with dimensions 15.3 and 9.9 m and an average height of 4.5 m, the proposed MPC approach saved about 30% in electric power compared with a relay control, guaranteeing a consistent and reliable temperature profile in respect to the predefined tracked one.","output":"Model Predictive Control versus Traditional Relay Control in a High Energy Efficiency Greenhouse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses thrive by exploiting the cells they infect, but in order to replicate and infect other cells they must produce viral proteins. As a result, viruses are also susceptible to exploitation by defective versions of themselves that do not produce such proteins. A defective viral genome with deletions in protein-coding genes could still replicate in cells coinfected with full-length viruses. Such a defective genome could even replicate faster due to its shorter size, interfering with the replication of the virus. We have created a synthetic defective interfering version of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic, assembling parts of the viral genome that do not code for any functional protein but enable the genome to be replicated and packaged. This synthetic defective genome replicates three times faster than SARS-CoV-2 in coinfected cells, and interferes with it, reducing the viral load of infected cells by half in 24 hours. The synthetic genome is transmitted as efficiently as the full-length genome, suggesting the location of the putative packaging signal of SARS-CoV-2. A version of such a synthetic construct could be used as a self-promoting antiviral therapy: by enabling replication of the synthetic genome, the virus would promote its own demise.","output":"A synthetic defective interfering SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interventions to suppress the coronavirus pandemic have led to economic recession and higher unemployment, which will increase mortality and decrease quality of life. The aim of this article is to estimate the consequences on mortality and life expectancy of increased unemployment rates due to the coronavirus pandemic in Sweden and other countries. METHODS: Based on recent increases and expected future unemployment rates due to the coronavirus pandemic, results from a systematic review and data from vital statistics in Sweden, the number of premature deaths due to unemployment in Sweden have been estimated. RESULTS: Based on our assumptions, the calculations show that if the number of unemployed persons in Sweden increases by 100,000, one may expect some 1800 more premature deaths during the following 9 years. If the duration of the recession is limited to 4 years, excess deaths due to unemployment may be around 800. On average, the unemployed will lose 2 years of their remaining life expectancy. In many other countries unemployment rates have or are estimated to rise more than in Sweden, sometimes two- or threefold, suggesting hundreds of thousands of excess deaths due to unemployment.

SWeeP vectors represented the Brazilian and worldwide genomic/proteomic data from GISAID between 02/2020-08/2021. Clusters were analyzed and compared with PANGO lineages. Hierarchical clustering provided phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of the lineages, and we tracked the P.1 (Gamma) variant origin. The genomic diversity based on Chao's estimation allowed us to compare richness and coverage among Brazilian states and other representative countries. We found that epidemics in Brazil occurred in two distinct moments, with different genetic profiles. The P.1 lineages emerged in the second wave, which was more aggressive. We could not trace the origin of P.1 from the variants present in Brazil in 2020. Instead, we found evidence pointing to its external source and a possible recombinant event that may relate P.1 to the B.1.1.28 variant subset. We discussed the potential application of the pipeline for emerging variants detection and the stability of the PANGO terminology over time. The diversity analysis showed that the low coverage and unbalanced sequencing among states in Brazil could have allowed the silenty entry and dissemination of P.1 and other dangerous variants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 65 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) who sought medical aid at the Ophthalmological Center of FMBA during the COVID-19 pandemic; they were examined using three tonometry methods: RBT, TPT and CDT. All patients underwent central corneal thickness measurement, perimetry, OCT and OCTA with assessment of vessel density (VD) of the superficial plexus in the macula (whole image macula) and peripapillary retina (PPR). RESULTS: High correlation was found between the results obtained with RBT, TPT and CDT. None of the methods showed a correlation between IOP and corneal thickness. The correlations between IOP and OCTA parameters were obtained: IOPTPT and VDPPR in the inferior temporal sector (r= -0.386, p=0.027), IOPRBT and VD whole image macula (r= -0.69, p=0.019), and in the macula inferior hemisphere (r= -0.75, p=0.008), as well as between the ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) and VD in the macular inferior hemisphere (r=0.380, p=0.039).

In this study, we have deciphered the role of this interaction in HCV replication in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell culture system. We incorporated mutation of the GCAC motif in an HCV monocistronic subgenomic replicon and a pJFH1 construct which altered the binding of La and checked HCV RNA replication by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The mutation drastically affected HCV replication. Furthermore, to address whether the decrease in replication is a consequence of translation inhibition or not, we incorporated the same mutation into a bicistronic replicon and observed a substantial decrease in HCV RNA levels. Interestingly, La overexpression rescued this inhibition of replication. More importantly, we observed that the mutation reduced the association between La and NS5B. The effect of the GCAC mutation on the translation-to-replication switch, which is regulated by the interplay between NS3 and La, was further investigated. Additionally, our analyses of point mutations in the GCAC motif revealed distinct roles of each nucleotide in HCV replication and translation.

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nonanesthesiologist-administered propofol (NAAP) sedation with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system in elderly patients during ERCP. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed 482 patients who underwent ERCP under propofol sedation with a TCI system at Iwakuni Medical Center between January 2014 and October 2016. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to their age: Group A, <70 years (n=130); Group B, 70 and <85 years (n=224); and Group C, 85 years (n=125). We compared the propofol dose and AEs during ERCP. RESULTS The median total infusion dose and minimum and maximum target blood concentrations of propofol were 336 mg, 2.2 g/mL, and 2.2 g/mL in Group A, 184 mg, 1.0 g/mL, and 1.4 g/mL in Group B, and 99 mg, 0.6 g/mL, and 1.0 g/mL in Group C, respectively, with older groups requiring a lower dose (p<0.0001). Hypotension was observed in 23 patients (4.8%), with no significant difference between the groups (Group A: 2.3%; Group B: 6.3%; Group C: 4.8%; p=0.24). Hypoxemia was observed in 16 patients (3.3%), with no significant difference between the groups (Group A: 3.1%; Group B: 4.9%; Group C: 0.8%; p=0.17). All AEs were immediately resolved, and no procedures were aborted. CONCLUSION NAAP sedation with a TCI system during ERCP may be acceptable in elderly patients with a lower dose of propofol than that used in younger patients.","output":"Propofol sedation with a target-controlled infusion pump in elderly patients undergoing ERCP."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To design a low cost ($40), realistic and fluoroscopy-free percutaneous Kirschner wire hand fracture fixation training instrument kit for home-based skill acquisition during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patient and professional feedback on an acute male inpatient ward in South London highlighted a demand for more medication information outside the formal ward round setting. We aimed to have 100% of patients meet our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing on the ward by March 2021. To fulfil criteria, all patients are offered: (1) ward round discussion, (2) written patient information leaflets (PILs), (3) informal discussion groups, all regarding medication.The principles of this quality improvement project (QIP) were drawn from definitions of patient-centred care and standards of good practice;patients should have access to a variety of information formats, relevant to the individual, and the knowledge gained empowers patients.Patient experience data revealed that 30% of clients answered passively to the question, Do you feel involved in your care? We hypothesized that medication discussion groups positively impact patients wellbeing, by providing a safe space that facilitates conversation surrounding medication issues.MethodWe conducted weekly audits on patients whose admission duration was &gt;7 days, and recorded fulfilment of the above criteria. At week 1, we introduced a program of weekly medication discussion groups led by members of the wider multi-disciplinary team covering a broad topic range. At week 6, we developed a rolling rota of the discussion groups and posters were displayed in advance. At week 14, all patients were offered PILs through a 1:1 interaction and this continued as routine practice. Medication discussion group feedback was obtained via questionnaires and The Blob Tree, a psycho-emotional assessment tool commonly used in healthcare settings.ResultIn 19 weeks, the median percentage of patients who fulfilled our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing was 92.86%. After 11 medication discussion groups, 79.3% of questionnaire responders wanted further sessions. 88% of The Blob Tree responses collected inferred a positive emotional response after the group discussions and half of those noticed an improvement in their emotional state.ConclusionThis QIP was overall a success;it fulfilled a requirement to meet good standards in information sharing and became embedded in the fabric of the ward, continuing to run as part of the activities program. It demonstrated the impact of education on patients mental wellbeing through empowerment and peer support. As a by-product it established multidisciplinary connections and improved therapeutic relationships.

Methods The phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late phase studies in younger (18-59 years) and older (60-84 years) participants and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through day 35 (14 days after the second dose). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one or two intramuscular doses of 5-microgram or 25-microgram NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7 day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild type virus neutralizing antibody response. Results After randomization, approximately 250 participants each were assigned to one of four vaccine groups or placebo. Of these, approximately 45% were older participants. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose, and occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. The two-dose regimen of 5-microgram NVX-CoV2373 induced robust geometric mean titer (GMT) IgG anti-spike protein (65,019 and 28,137 EU/mL) and wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (2201 and 981 titers) responses in younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups.

It is influenced by multiple factors such as surgical, patient-related, and orthodontic aspects. While recent reviews mainly focus on short-term dental changes (0.5-2 years), longer follow-up dental stability remains hardly reviewed. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term stability of dental and dentolabial changes following combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. SEARCH METHODS A systematic search was conducted up to December 2019 using Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series with a minimum of 10 patients, which reported long-term dental stability following combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment, were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Long-term changes were assessed for overjet, overbite, maxillary, and mandibular incisors' position and relationship of lip position to maxillary and mandibular incisors. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. RESULTS Following the screening of 3178 articles, 11 studies were included (2 RCT, 9 retrospective) with a postoperative follow-up period ranging from 5 to 15 years. A decrease in overjet was observed for patients with skeletal class III malocclusion, whereas overjet increased in class II patients at long-term follow-up. Overbite increased in class II patients, whereas class III showed variable results. The lower incisor position was more stable vertically than horizontally; the latter showing more outcome variability. Dentolabial changes corresponded to the normal ageing process and results were not clinically significant after long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION Current evidence suggests variability of dental and dentolabial stability in both skeletal class II and III patients. Further prospective studies are required to develop guidelines for long-term follow-up assessment using computer tomography or cone-beam computed tomography imaging, before final conclusions can be drawn.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?: There is widespread interest in whether drug interventions can be used for the prevention of covid-19, but there is uncertainty about which drugs, if any, are effective. The first version of this living guideline focuses on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Subsequent updates will cover other drugs being investigated for their role in the prevention of covid-19. RECOMMENDATION: The guideline development panel made a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine for individuals who do not have covid-19 (high certainty). HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: This living guideline is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and provides up to date covid-19 guidance to inform policy and practice worldwide. Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. A living systematic review with network analysis informed the recommendations. An international guideline development panel of content experts, clinicians, patients, an ethicist and methodologists produced recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. UNDERSTANDING THE NEW RECOMMENDATION: The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (6 trials and 6059 participants) found that hydroxychloroquine had a small or no effect on mortality and admission to hospital (high certainty evidence). There was a small or no effect on laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (moderate certainty evidence) but probably increased adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). The panel judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile. In addition, the panel decided that contextual factors such as resources, feasibility, acceptability, and equity for countries and healthcare systems were unlikely to alter the recommendation. The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent covid-19. UPDATES: This is a living guideline. New recommendations will be published in this article and signposted by update notices to this guideline. READERS NOTE: This is the first version of the living guideline for drugs to prevent covid-19. It complements the WHO living guideline on drugs to treat covid-19.

DESIGN: In a qualitative approach, we utilised data collected between 2013 and 2020 during the planning and implementation of two RCTs. The data comprised agreed records of research meetings, and semistructured interviews with clinical trial stakeholders. The stakeholders were parents/carers of child participants, and site-based research officers, healthcare providers and community advisory groups. Our thematic analysis was informed by constructivist grounded theory. SETTING: The RCTs investigated the management of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, with the first RCT commencing recruitment in 2014 and the second in 2017. They took place in Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs), large primary health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, based in urban and regional communities across two Australian states and one territory. RESULTS: We analysed data from 56 meetings and 67 interviews, generating themes on making research valuable and undertaking ethical and sustainable RCTs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership, and support of AMSs in their service delivery function were critical. The broad benefits of the trials were considered important to sustainability, including workforce development, enhanced ear healthcare and multidirectional research capacity building. Participants emphasised the long-term responsibility of research teams to deliver benefits to AMSs and communities regardless of RCT outcomes, and to focus on relationships, reciprocity and creating positive experiences of research. CONCLUSION: We identify principles and strategies to assist in undertaking ethical and sustainable RCTs within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health services. Maintaining relationships with AMSs and focusing on mutual workforce development and capacity building creates opportunities for long-term benefits so that health research and RCTs work for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, services, communities and researchers.

In Brazil, one of the countries most severely impacted throughout the pandemic, a complex dynamics involving variants co-circulation and turnover events has been recorded with the emergence and spread of VOC Gamma in Manaus in late 2020. In this context, we present a genomic epidemiology investigation based on samples collected between December 2020 and May 2021 in the second major Brazilian metropolis, Rio de Janeiro. By sequencing 244 novel genomes through all epidemiological weeks in this period, we were able to document the introduction and rapid dissemination of VOC Gamma in the city, driving the rise of the third local epidemic wave. Molecular clock analysis indicates this variant has circulated locally since the first weeks of 2021 and only seven weeks were necessary for it to achieve a frequency above 70%, consistent with rates of growth observed in Manaus and other states. Moreover, a Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction indicates VOC Gamma spread throughout Brazil between December 2020 and January 2021, and that it was introduced in Rio de Janeiro through at least 13 events coming from nearly all regions of the country. Comparative analysis of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values provide further evidence that VOC Gamma induces higher viral loads (N1 target; mean reduction of Ct: 2.7, 95% CI = 2.0 - 3.4).

We used baseline data from Engage, a cohort of GBM recruited by respondent-driven sampling, to examine patterns of combination HIV prevention use among Montreal GBM since PrEP became available. Latent class analysis, stratified by HIV status, was used to categorize GBM by self-reported use of biomedical and behavioural prevention strategies. Correlates of resulting classes were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Among HIV-negative/unknown GBM (n = 968), we identified four classes: low use of prevention (32%), condoms (40%), seroadaptive behaviour (21%), and biomedical (including PrEP; 7%). Those using prevention (condoms, seroadaptive behaviour, and biomedical) had a higher number of anal sex partners and were more likely to report a recent sexually transmitted infection diagnosis. GBM using biomedical prevention also had a higher level of formal education. Among GBM living with HIV (n = 200), we identified three classes: mainly antiretroviral treatment (ART) with viral suppression (53%), ART with viral suppression and condoms (19%), and ART with viral suppression and seroadaptive behaviour (18%). Again, the number of anal sex partners was higher among those using condoms and seroadaptive behaviours. Our findings show antiretroviral-based prevention, either alone or in combination with other strategies, is clearly a component of the HIV prevention landscape for GBM in Montreal.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data on hospital admission of all patients with severe COVID\\\\19 and a control cohort (1:1) of gender\\\\ and hospital\\\\matched patients with mild disease from 13 designated hospitals in the Hebei Province between 22 January and 15 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (52 with severe COVID\\\\19 and 52 with mild disease) were included. Only age, fever, duration from symptom onset to confirmation, respiratory rate, percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and neutrophilic percentage were independent predictors of severe COVID\\\\19. Age and neutrophilic percentage performed best in predicting severe COVID\\\\19, followed by SpO(2). Age + neutrophilic percentage (the sum of age and neutrophilic percentage) (area under the curve [AUC] 0.900, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.825\\\\0.950, P < .001) and age and neutrophilic percentage (the prediction probability of age and neutrophilic percentage for severe type obtained by logistic regression analysis) (AUC 0.899, 95% CI 0.824\\\\0.949, P < .001) had excellent predictive performance for severe type.

METHODS: Specificity was evaluated using a cross-reactivity panel of 85 pre-pandemic serum samples. Sensitivity was determined at both the manufacturer's and a 95% specificity cut-off level, using 81 serum samples of patients with a positive rRT-PCR. Sensitivity was determined in function of time post symptoms onset. RESULTS: Specificity for all assays ranged from 92.9% to 100% (Roche and Thermo Fisher) with the exception of the Theradiag IgM LFA (82.4%). Sensitivity in asymptomatic patients ranged between 41.7% and 58.3%. Sensitivity on samples taken <10 days since symptom onset was low (23.3%C66.7%) and increased on samples taken between 10 and 20 days and > 20 days since symptom onset (80%C96% and 92.9%C100%, respectively). From 20 days after symptom onset, the Roche, Id-vet and Thermo Fisher assays all met the sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>97%) targets determined by the WHO.

DIR to HA is reported to occur in the different scenarios including: secondary to poor injection technique, following dental cleaning procedures, following bacterial/viral illness, and after vaccination. In this report of 4 cases with distinct clinical histories and presentations: one case occured following a community acquired COVID-19 infection, one case occured in a study subject in the mRNA-1273 clinical phase III trial, one case occurred following the first dose of publically available mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna, Cambridge MA), and the last case occurred after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer, New York, NY). Injectable HA dermal fillers are prevalent in aesthetic medicine for facial rejuvenation. Structural modifications in the crosslinking of HA fillers have enhanced the products resistance to enzymatic breakdown and thus increased injected product longevity, however, have also led to a rise in DIR. Previous, DIR to HA dermal fillers can present clinically as edema with symptomatic and inflammatory erythematous papules and nodules. The mechanism of action for the delayed reaction to HA fillers is unknown and is likely to be multifactorial in nature. A potential mechanism of DIR to HA fillers in COVID-19 related cases is binding and blockade of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptors (ACE2), which are targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein to gain entry into the cell. Spike protein interaction with dermal ACE2 receptors favors a pro-inflammatory, loco-regional TH1 cascade, promoting a CD8+T cell mediated reaction to incipient granulomas, which previously formed around residual HA particles. Management to suppress the inflammatory response in the native COVID-19 case required high-dose corticosteroids (CS) to suppress inflammatory pathways, with concurrent ACE2 upregulation, along with high-dose intralesional hyaluronidase to dissolve the inciting HA filler. With regards to the two vaccine related cases; in the mRNA-1273 case, a low dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) was utilized for treatment, to reduce pro-inflammatory Angiotensin II. Whereas, in the BNT162b2 case the filler reaction was suppressed with oral corticosteroids.

Exposures ACEI/ARB use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date. Main Outcomes and Measures In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe COVID-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis. Results In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years [interquartile range, 40.9-72.0]; 47.9% men). There were 895 users (20.0%) of ACEI/ARBs and 3585 nonusers (80.0%). In the ACEI/ARB group, 18.1% died within 30 days vs 7.3% in the nonuser group, but this association was not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and medical history (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-1.03]). Death or severe COVID-19 occurred in 31.9% of ACEI/ARB users vs 14.2% of nonusers by 30 days (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]). In the nested case-control analysis of COVID-19 susceptibility, 571 patients with COVID-19 and prior hypertension (median age, 73.9 years; 54.3% men) were compared with 5710 age- and sex-matched controls with prior hypertension but not COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 86.5% used ACEI/ARBs vs 85.4% of controls; ACEI/ARB use compared with other antihypertensive drugs was not significantly associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.80-1.36]). Conclusions and Relevance Prior use of ACEI/ARBs was not significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with hypertension or with mortality or severe disease among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19. These findings do not support discontinuation of ACEI/ARB medications that are clinically indicated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Association of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Use With COVID-19 Diagnosis and Mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rise of COVID-19 has precipitated an increased importance of cleaning and sanitation, ideally without human intervention.

More needs to be understood about developmental changes in healthy and unhealthy food perceptions and preference. We investigated how food perceptions and preference vary as a function of age and how food attributes (taste and health) impact age-related changes. One hundred thirty-nine participants (8C23 years, 60 females) completed computerized tasks to rate high-calorie and low-calorie food cues for taste, health, and liking (preference), followed by 100 binary food choices based on each participants ratings. Dietary self-control was considered successful when the healthier (vs. tastier) food was chosen. Self-control success ratio was the proportion of success trials over total number of choices. Beta-weights for health (-health) and taste (-taste) were calculated as each attributes influence on food preference. Adiposity measurements included BMI z-score and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). High-calorie foods were rated more tasty and less healthy with increasing age. Older participants liked high-calorie foods more (vs. younger participants), and -taste was associated with age. Significant age-by-WHtR interactions were observed for health and taste ratings of high-calorie foods, -taste, and marginally for preference of high-calorie foods. Stratifying by WHtR (high, low), we found age-related increases in taste and preference ratings of high-calorie foods in the high WHtR group alone. In contrast, age-related decreases in health ratings of high-calorie foods were significant in the low WHtR group alone. Age and -taste were significantly associated in the high WHtR group and only marginally significant with low WHtR. Although participants rated low-calorie foods as less tasty and less healthy with increasing age, there was no association between age and preference for low-calorie foods. Participants made faster food choices with increasing age regardless of WHtR, with a significant age-by-WHtR interaction on reaction time (RT). There were no age-related effects in self-control success ratio and -health. These results suggest that individual differences in age and central adiposity play an important role in preference for high-calorie foods, and a higher importance of food tastiness in food choice may contribute to greater preference for high-calorie foods with increasing age.","output":"Developmental Changes in Food Perception and Preference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurologic diseases with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (false discovery rate corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive and 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 67.0-83.8 years vs 70.1 years, IQR 52.9-78.6 years, p = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1 vs 0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6, p = 0.006).

Methods: A cross sectional study was performed during the third week of June among first to final year medical and dental students. As the country was in lockdown, a structured online questionnaire was used to obtain data. The responses obtained were cleaned, coded, entered in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows and the normality of the data checked using one-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov test (p<0.05). The demographic parameters were tabulated and total score compared among different subgroups of participants. The frequency of different measures mentioned by respondents to control the pandemic were also noted. Results: Out of the 565 participants, 336 (59.6%) were females followed by 229 (40.4%) males.

The fear of viral transmission along with the short period of study made patients delay their hospital visits and doctors reassess the approach of certain acute situations. This study aimed to assess the changes in the management of patients with acute cholecystitis before and during COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases was performed until 01 September 2021. Totally, two kinds of studies were included, those assessing the management of acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 and those comparing the periods before and during the pandemic. The outcomes recorded include management approaches, complications, and mean length of stay. RESULTS: A number of 15 eligible articles were included in the study. During the pandemic, six studies revealed a shift toward conservative management of acute cholecystitis and five of them reported that conservative management was opted in 73% of the patients. On the contrary, data from all studies revealed that the surgical approach was preferred in only 29.2% of patients. Furthermore, when comparing the periods before vs. during COVID-19, the conservative approach was reported in 36.3 and 43.2% before vs. during COVID-19, respectively, whereas surgical intervention was performed in 62.5% of patients before COVID-19 and 55.3% during the pandemic. The length of stay was delayed when a non-surgical approach was selected in most studies. Complications, mainly classified by the Clavien-Dindo scale, were higher in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: A tendency toward more conservative approaches was observed in most studies, reversing the previously used surgical approach in most cases of acute cholecystitis. In most of the examined cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, antibiotic treatment and percutaneous cholecystostomy were much more considered and even preferred.","output":"COVID-19 and Acute Cholecystitis Management: A Systematic Review of Current Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleosome positioning is involved in many gene regulatory processes happening in the cell and it may change as cells differentiate or respond to the changing microenvironment in a healthy or diseased organism. One important implication of nucleosome positioning in clinical epigenetics is its use in the nucleosomics analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for the purpose of patient diagnostics in liquid biopsies. The rationale for this is that the apoptotic nucleases that digest chromatin of the dying cells mostly cut DNA between nucleosomes. Thus, the short pieces of DNA in body fluids reflect the positions of nucleosomes in the cells of origin. Here we report a systematic nucleosomics database C NucPosDB, curating published nucleosome positioning datasets in vivo as well as datasets of sequenced cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that reflect nucleosome positioning in situ in the cells of origin. Users can select subsets of the database by a number of criteria and then obtain raw or processed data. NucPosDB also reports the originally determined regions with stable nucleosome occupancy across several individuals with a given condition. An additional section provides a catalogue of computational tools for the analysis of nucleosome positioning or cfDNA experiments and theoretical algorithms for the prediction of nucleosome positioning from DNA sequence. We provide an overview of the field, describe the structure of the database in this context and demonstrate data variability using examples of different medical conditions. NucPosDB is useful both for analysis of fundamental gene regulation processes and training computational models for patient diagnostics based on cfDNA. The database currently curates 400 publications on nucleosome positioning in cell lines and in situ as well as cfDNA from >10,000 patients and healthy volunteers. For open-access cfDNA datasets as well as key MNase-seq datasets in human cells, NucPosDB allows downloading processed mapped data in addition to the stable-nucleosome regions.

As of April 28, 2020, South Africa reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Sub-Sahara Africa. The country took aggressive steps to control the spread of the virus including setting a national command team for COVID-19 and putting the country on a complete lockdown for more than 100 days. Evidence across most countries has shown that, it is vital to monitor the progression of pandemics and assess the effects of various public health measures, such as lockdowns. Countries need to have scientific tools to assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The objective of this study was thus to assess the extent to which a systems dynamics model can forecast COVID-19 infections in South Africa and be a useful tool in evaluating government interventions to manage the epidemic through 'what if' simulations. DESIGN AND METHODS This study presents a systems dynamics model (SD) of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa, as one of such tools. The development of the SD model in this study is grounded in design science research which fundamentally builds on prior research of modelling complex systems. RESULTS The SD model satisfactorily replicates the general trend of COVID-19 infections and recovery for South Africa within the first 100 days of the pandemic. The model further confirms that the decision to lockdown the country was a right one, otherwise the country's health capacity would have been overwhelmed. Going forward, the model predicts that the level of infection in the country will peak towards the last quarter of 2020, and thereafter start to decline. Conclusions: Ultimately, the model structure and simulations suggest that a systems dynamics model can be a useful tool in monitoring, predicting and testing interventions to manage COVID-19 with an acceptable margin of error.

Outcome measures were administered at patients initial and final appointment. Information was merged into a single database and imported into IBM SPSS for retrospective analysis. The following measures were administered at the beginning and end of treatment and were used to evaluate patient progress;Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS), Life Skills Profile (LSP), Session Rating Scale (SRS), Outcome Rating Scale (ORS).ResultTwo cohorts were derived from the clinic;the first cohort (n = 90;53 females;37 males;M = 35.72 years;SD = 12.12 years) comprised of those patients whose care occurred between 23/09/2019 and 22/03/2020 and did not receive telehealth appointments. The second cohort (n = 122;68 females;54 males;M = 36.2 years;SD = 12.78 years) were those patients who presented to the clinic and were discharged between 23/03/2020 and 21/09/2020 and received at least one telehealth appointment. In the pre-telehealth cohort, mean HoNOS scores at baseline were 17.87 compared to 13.53 at discharge, mean LSP scores at baseline were 10.76 compared to 9.01 at discharge, mean SRS scores at baseline were 34.17 compared to 36.04 at discharge, and mean ORS scores at baseline were 12.97 compared to 21.28 at discharge. In the post-telehealth cohort, mean HoNOS scores at baseline were 14.45 compared to 10.50 at discharge, mean LSP scores at baseline were 7.85 compared to 7.19 at discharge, mean SRS scores at baseline were 36.04 compared to 35.36 at discharge, and mean ORS scores at baseline were 18.83 compared to 15.85 at discharge.ConclusionResults show that telehealth did not impact negatively on the therapeutic effect of clinical sessions, highlighted by similar reductions in HoNOS and LSP scores. It was seen in the post-telehealth cohort that there was worsening in the subject-rated scales (SRS and ORS) which was not seen in the pre-telehealth face-to-face cohort. Thus, there seems to be a discernible negative difference from the patient's perspective in the clinical sessions. This may be due to the difficulties in therapeutic alliance using the telehealth platform. We appreciate that there are a number of confounding factors, especially the effect of COVID-19 isolation.

Herein, we describe a novel approach to abdominal pain and hyperbilirubinemia due to SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19) which led to additional imaging and an incidental malignancy diagnosis. Case Description/Methods: A 52-year old man with a history of chronic hepatitis B virus presented with one week of abdominal pain and jaundice. Admission labs were significant for a total bilirubin of 4.1mg/dL, and positive screening for Covid 19. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated a dilated CBD to 1.7cm. His presentation was highly suggestive of choledocolithiasis by ASGE criteria, but ERCP was deferred to abide by hospital-wide precautions at the time. As a result, the patient underwent confirmatory testing with MRCP, which showed no choledocholithiasis but demonstrated a 4.1cm enhancing lesion abutting the pancreatic body. Subsequent abdominal computed tomography found a 3.3cm soft tissue density encasing the celiac axis, suggesting lymphoma. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biopsy of the pancreatic lesion demonstrated an unreported 3.1cm liver mass, which was biopsied. On further review of imaging, the liver mass was not appreciated on ultrasound, CT or MRCP. It was suspected that the hyperbilirubinemia was likely due to this intrahepatic mass, described as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Due to the early diagnosis he was able to be discharged and follow up with oncology to better guide his future directed therapy. Discussion: The Covid 19 pandemic forced all aspects of healthcare to adapt. Given gastroenterology's invasive nature this also encouraged gastroenterologists to consider alternative pathways of treatment aside from the published algorithms in place. This case demonstrates how deviating from the ASGE guidelines resulted in a cascade of diagnostics which led to an eventual malignancy diagnosis which may have been otherwise missed or delayed. Guidelines are established on large sets of data and patient prognostic indicators which to our knowledge have not considered infection status or isolation needs. Further research in this area may result in amending guidelines to address isolation status and reminds practitioners to consider the patient before them and their unique patient needs.

To evaluate the effect of parasite stimulus on the structure of the leukocyte nucleolus, we exposed rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the crude extract of the nematode A. pegreffii (Anisakidae), and compared the observed changes to the effect of control (RPMI-1640 media), immunosuppressive (MPA) and immunostimulant treatment (bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and viral analogue polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)) by confocal microscopy.

In this study we aimed to construct machine-learning (ML) models to predict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection based on the clinical features of patients visiting an ED during the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of all patients who received reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the ED of Baylor Scott & White All Saints Medical Center, Fort Worth, from February 23CMay 12, 2020. The variables collected included patient demographics, ED triage data, clinical symptoms, and past medical history. The primary outcome was the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 infection) by a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, and was used as the label for ML tasks. We used univariate analyses for feature selection, and variables with P<0.1 were selected for model construction. Samples were split into training and testing cohorts on a 60:40 ratio chronologically. We tried various ML algorithms to construct the best predictive model, and we evaluated performances with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the testing cohort. RESULTS: A total of 580 ED patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study periods, and 98 (16.9%) were identified as having the SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the RT-PCR results. Univariate analyses selected 21 features for model construction. We assessed three ML methods for performance: of the three methods, random forest outperformed the others with the best AUC result (0.86), followed by gradient boosting (0.83) and extra trees classifier (0.82). CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is feasible to use ML models as an initial screening tool for identifying patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Classical diagnostic measures like Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are not applicable for mutations in the DNAH11 gene since ultrastructural defects of the ciliary apparatus are absent. Novel mutations encoding for PCD appear all the time with considerable variation in the clinical picture, making it necessary to update data bases and guidelines for PCD diagnostics. METHODS In this study we examined two unrelated, Finnish families with symptoms of PCD applying the clinical scoring system: Primary ciliary dyskinesia Rule (PICADAR), high speed video microscopy analysis (HSVMA) for ciliary movement, a commercially available gene panel analysis and nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO) measurements if applicable. RESULTS Two, likely pathogenic variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.2341G > A, p. (Glu781Lys) ja c.7645 + 5G > A) were detected. In the first family, compound heterozygous mutations led to disease manifestation in two of 4 children, which showed a similar phenotype of cilia beating pattern but marked differences in disease severity. In the second family, all three children were homozygotes for the c.2341G > A p.(Glu781Lys) mutation and showed a similar degree of disease severity. However, the phenotype of cilia beating pattern was different ranging from stiff, static cilia to a hyperkinetic movement in one of these children. CONCLUSIONS In this study we describe two Finnish families with PCD, revealing two novel mutations in the DNAH11 gene which show considerable variety in the clinical and beating cilia phenotype. The results of this study show the clinician that PCD can be much milder than generally expected and diagnosis demands a combination of measures which are only successful in experienced hands.

Clinical trial registries were also searched. Results Findings from randomized clinical trials demonstrate that compared to placebo, ipragliflozin significantly reduces glucose as measured via Hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose levels. Ipragliflozin is also associated with weight reduction and an improvement in some, but not all, cardiovascular risk markers. Ipragliflozin has a favourable safety profile with a low risk of hypoglycemia and the rates of common adverse events are not significantly different than placebo. Limited data are available to assess rare and long-term adverse effects. Conclusion Current evidence shows that ipragliflozin is an effective therapeutic option for the management of glucose control in type 2 diabetes. However, no cardiovascular outcome trials have been conducted to date. Real-world observational studies are still needed to accurately capture any possible rare or long-term adverse events.","output":"Profile of Ipragliflozin, an Oral SGLT-2 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: The Evidence to Date."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"European SARS-CoV-2 pandemic epicenter was detected in Northern Italy, in a little Italian town of Lodi province, the Lodi Hospital was therefore rapidly saturated, and in particularly the departments of respiratory diseases and Intensive Care Unit had been largely involved In this paper, we describe how the first Sub-intensive Respiratory Unit in Europe completely dedicated to COVID-19 patients was organized and managed in our hospital From February 25(th) to April 30(th) 2020, 156 patients were admitted to our Respiratory Sub-intensive Unit Among them, 100 were discharged, 28 dead and 28 transferred to ICU for intubation","output":"First COVID-19 sub-intensive respiratory unit in Europe: the Italian experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious global epidemic in the past few months and caused huge loss to human society worldwide. For such a large-scale epidemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent studies have shown that one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable non-contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those potential patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory data capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\\\\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our researchers. This work demonstrates that the proposed portable and intelligent health screening device can be used as a pre-scan method for respiratory infections, which may help fight the current COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Combining Visible Light and Infrared Imaging for Efficient Detection of Respiratory Infections such as COVID-19 on Portable Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The delivery of high-quality academic programmes is central to the mission of any university.

Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of IgM and IgG testing for the diagnosis of highly suspected COVID-19. Methods: A total of 63 patients with suspected COVID-19 were observed, 57 of whom were enrolled (24 males and 33 females). The selection was based on the diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 (trial Sixth Edition) released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Patients were divided into positive and negative groups according to the first nucleic acid results from pharyngeal swab tests. Routine blood tests were detected on the second day after each patient was hospitalized. The remaining serum samples were used for detection of novel coronavirus-specific IgM/IgG antibodies. Results: The rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid positivity was 42.10%. The positive detection rates with a combination of IgM and IgG testing for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test results were 72.73 and 87.50%, respectively. Conclusions: We report a rapid, simple, and accurate detection method for patients with suspected COVID-19 and for on-site screening for close contacts within the population. IgM and IgG antibody detection can identify COVID-19 after a negative nucleic acid test.

New studies have described the production and dissemination of sprays during simulated dental procedures, but findings lack generalizability beyond their measurements setting. This study aims to describe the fundamental mechanisms associated with spray production from rotary dental instrumentation with particular focus on what are currently considered high-risk componentsnamely, the production of small droplets that may remain suspended in the room environment for extended periods and the dispersal of high-velocity droplets resulting in formites at distant surfaces. Procedural sprays were parametrically studied with variables including rotation speed, burr-to-tooth contact, and coolant premisting modified and visualized using high-speed imaging and broadband or monochromatic laser lightCsheet illumination. Droplet velocities were estimated and probability density maps for all laser illuminated sprays generated. The impact of varying the coolant parameters on heating during instrumentation was considered. Complex structured sprays were produced by water-cooled rotary instruments, which, in the worst case of an air turbine, included droplet projection speeds in excess of 12 m/s and the formation of millions of small droplets that may remain suspended. Elimination of premisting (mixing of coolant water and air prior to burr contact) resulted in a significant reduction in small droplets, but radial atomization may still occur and is modified by burr-to-tooth contact. Spatial probability distribution mapping identified a threshold for rotation speeds for radial atomization between 80,000 and 100,000 rpm. In this operatory mode, cutting efficiency is reduced but sufficient coolant effectiveness appears to be maintained. Multiple mechanisms for atomization of fluids from rotatory instrumentation exist, but parameters can be controlled to modify key spray characteristics during the current crisis.","output":"Mechanisms of Atomization from Rotary Dental Instruments and Its Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rampant integration of social media in our every day lives and culture has given rise to fast and easier access to the flow of information than ever in human history.

Additionally, relationships between exercise-induced increases in systemic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and response to PAS and motor learning were evaluated. Sixteen young healthy participants completed six experimental sessions, including the following: 1) rest followed by PAS; 2) aerobic exercise followed by PAS; 3) rest followed by practice of a continuous tracking (CT) task and 4) a no-exercise 24-h retention test; and 5) aerobic exercise followed by CT task practice and 6) a no-exercise 24-h retention test. The CT task included an embedded repeated sequence allowing for evaluation of sequence-specific implicit learning. Slope of motor-evoked potential recruitment curves generated with transcranial magnetic stimulation showed larger increases when PAS was preceded by aerobic exercise (59.8% increase) compared with rest (14.2% increase, P = 0.02). Time lag of CT task performance on the repeated sequence improved under the aerobic exercise condition from early (-100.8 ms) to late practice (-75.2 ms, P < 0.001) and was maintained at retention (-79.2 ms, P = 0.004) but did not change under the rest condition (P > 0.16). Systemic BDNF increased on average by 3.4-fold following aerobic exercise (P = 0.003), but the changes did not relate to neurophysiological or behavioral measures (P > 0.42).

To investigate these, we pooled data from two cluster\\\\randomized trials investigating community\\\\based DSD in Zimbabwe and Lesotho. METHODS: Individual\\\\level participant data of newly stable adults enrolled between 6 and 12 months after ART initiation were pooled. Both trials (conducted between August 2017 and July 2019) had three arms: Standard\\\\of\\\\care three\\\\monthly ART provision at healthcare facilities (SoC, control); ART provided three\\\\monthly in community ART groups (CAGs) (3MC) and ART provided six\\\\monthly in either CAGs or at community\\\\distribution points (6MC). Clinical visits were three\\\\monthly in SoC and annually in intervention arms. The primary outcome was retention in care and secondary outcomes were viral suppression (VS) and number of unscheduled facility visits 12 months after enrolment. Individual\\\\level regression analyses were conducted by intention\\\\to\\\\treat specifying for clustering and adjusted for country. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 599 participants were included; 212 (35.4%), 128 (21.4%) and 259 (43.2%) in SoC, 3MC and 6MC, respectively. Few participants aged <25 years were included (n = 32). After 12 months, 198 (93.4%), 123 (96.1%) and 248 (95.8%) were retained in SoC, 3MC and 6MC, respectively. Retention in 3MC was superior versus SoC, adjusted risk difference (aRD) = 4.6% (95% CI: 0.7%?8.5%). Retention in 6MC was non\\\\inferior versus SoC, aRD = 1.7% (95% CI: ?2.5%?5.9%) (prespecified non\\\\inferiority aRD margin ?3.25%). VS was similar between arms, 99.3, 98.6 and 98.1% in SoC, 3MC and 6MC, respectively. Adjusted risk ratio's for VS were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92?1.03) for 3MC versus SoC, and 0.98 (CI: 0.95?1.00) for 6MC versus SoC.

There was a lower threshold to manage fractures conservatively, in an attempt to curtail COVID-19 transmission rates amongst inpatients. This retrospective study evaluated our Orthopaedic departments adherence to BOAST guidelines on ankle fractures, during COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19. METHOD: Data on patients who presented with ankle fractures during the initial national lockdown in 2020 were compared against similar ankle fracture patterns one-year prior (pre-COVID) over a similar time frame. Patient clerking notes, operative notes, radiographical images and clinic letters were retrieved and compared against BOAST guidelines on ankle fractures. Management plans and time to surgery was extrapolated from these resources. RESULT: Ankle fracture incidence rates increased by 79.8% during the COVID pandemic when compared with data from 2019. 28% of ankle fractures in 2020 were managed operatively when compared with 80% in 2019. Average time to surgery during the pandemic improved by 1.64. Adequate documentation for neurovascular status, as per BOAST guidelines, was 30.5% in 2019 and 27% in 2020. Pre- and post-reduction views were available in 87% of cases in 2019 and 83% in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: As a third national lockdown is upon us, evaluation of BOAST guidelines on ankle fractures would be worth revising.

The use of PPE among critical care clinicians has not been extensively evaluated, especially during the pandemic influenza. This study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors, and barriers to compliance with the use of PPE among ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) during the pandemic influenza. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A survey instrument consisting of 36 questions was developed and mailed to all HCWs in 21 ICUs in 17 provinces in China. A total of 733 physicians, nurses, and other professionals were surveyed, and 650 (88.7%) were included in the analysis. Fifty-six percent of respondents reported having received training program of pandemic influenza before they cared for H1N1 patients, while 77% reported to have adequate knowledge of self and patient protection. Only 18% of respondents were able to correctly identify all components of PPE, and 55% reported high compliance (>80%) with PPE use during patient care. In multivariate analysis, vaccination for 2009 H1N1 influenza, positive attitudes towards PPE use, organizational factors such as availability of PPE in ICU, and patient information of influenza precautions, as well as reprimand for noncompliance by the supervisors were associated with high compliance, whereas negative attitudes towards PPE use and violation of PPE use were independent predictors of low compliance.

Dee Finks curricular design principles of Significant Learning, Jonsen et. als Four-Box Method of ethical analysis, and ABP bioethics content specifications to create 10 TBL bioethics sessions. Paediatric residents at a major academic centre then completed a 3-year longitudinal, integrated TBL-based bioethics curriculum. Primary outcomes included individual and group readiness assessment tests (iRAT/gRAT), pre-work completion, and satisfaction with sessions. RESULTS: The TBL-based bioethics curriculum contains 10 adaptable modules. Paediatric residents (n = 348 total resident encounters) were highly engaged and satisfied with the curriculum. gRAT scores (mean 89%) demonstrated significant improvement compared to iRAT scores (72%) across all TBLs and all post-graduate years (p < .001). Higher gRAT scores correlated with higher level of training. Although pre-work completion was low (28%), satisfaction was high (4.42/5 on Likert scale). CONCLUSIONS: Our TBL-based bioethics curriculum was effective in improving knowledge, practical and flexible in its implementation, and well-received. We attribute its success to its grounding in ethical theory, relevance to ABP specifications, and a multi-modal, engaging format. This curriculum is easily modified to different specialties, virtual formats, or other specific institutional needs. KEY MESSAGES: Despite formidable challenges to teaching bioethics in residency education, evidence-based methods such as Team-Based Learning (TBL) can be employed to increase knowledge and satisfaction. This study reports the first successful TBL bioethics curriculum, planned and executed longitudinally over 3 years, with paediatric residents at a large academic childrens hospital in the US. TBL can be utilised to teach bioethics at the graduate medical education level and is adaptable to different situational factors, disciplines, and levels of clinical experience.","output":"Meeting the challenge of teaching bioethics: a successful residency curricula utilizing Team-Based Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extremely premature infants have demonstrated increased survival due to advancements in care This population is at risk for decreased lung function that persists into adolescence It is important for clinicians to consider this history when treating and assessing such patients who contract SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection A 17-year-old, former premature infant of 23 weeks gestation with BPD presented to the pediatric emergency department for evaluation of hypoxia and increased work of breathing in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection He was managed aggressively with early noninvasive respiratory support, Remdesevir, systemic steroids, and convalescent plasma Utilization of aggressive medical therapies early in the hospital course assisted in preventing intubation and mechanical ventilation for this patient While there are studies examining the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in premature infants, there is a paucity of data on this vulnerable group as they age into adolescence More studies are needed to assess the severity of illness and optimal management of this population","output":"Management of COVID-19 in an adolescent demonstrates lasting effects of extreme prematurity on pulmonary function: COVID-19 in an Adolescent Former Premature Infant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Infections following arthroplasty are one of the major risks during this type of surgery. Case presentation: Four and half years after right hip arthroplasty surgery, the patient came back to our attention with pain at the same hip. The instrumental examinations showed signs of cup detachment and therefore, after carefully analyzing the case, we decided to perform a sterile aspiration of the hip in the operating room under C-arm fluoroscopy. Microbiological examinations showed positivity for E.Coli. The patient underwent to surgery to remove the prosthesis and implant a spacer. A therapy with Cefotaxim 2g 1-1-1 for 6 weeks was then set, after which a total arthroplasty was implanted. During this period, the Covid-19 pandemic occurred and therefore the patient performed two nasal-throat swabs, both negative. However, one week after the final surgery, respiratory conditions worsened and we performed a chest X-ray and CT scan, with suggestive images of ground-glass opacification patterns (GGO). Due to the clinic and the characteristic images of the instrumental examinations, the patient was transferred to the observation ward, waiting for the response of two additional swabs, also negative. The patient was then transferred to the ward for patients with typical symptoms of Covid-19 but with negative swabs for two weeks and subsequently discharged at home.

Based on formative research, we developed an approach that integrates patient-centred counselling and engagement of an adherence supporter for pregnant and breastfeeding women initiating HIV treatment (ie, antiretroviral therapy (ART)) or biomedical HIV prevention (ie, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)). METHODS: Tonse Pamodzi 2 is a pilot study designed to provide acceptability, fidelity and clinical outcomes data on a set of behavioural interventions for adherence support. The study comprises two parallel randomised trials, enrolling HIV-positive pregnant women initiating ART (Trial 1, n=100) and HIV-negative pregnant women with risk of HIV acquisition and willing to initiate PrEP (Trial 2, n=200). Within each trial, participants are randomised 1:1 to either the intervention or control group. The Tonse Pamodzi adherence intervention comprises patient-centred counselling (adapted Integrated Next Step Counseling(iNSC)) and external adherence support tailored to the clinical context (ie, for ART or PrEP). Participants randomly assigned to the control group receive standard counselling based on local HIV guidelines. Participants are followed for 6 months. To assess intervention acceptability, we will employ a mixed method approach to describe participant engagement, satisfaction, and discussion content. We will audit and score recorded counselling sessions to evaluate the implementation fidelity of iNSC sessions. We will also assess clinical outcomes at 3 and 6 months for both Trial 1 (retention in care and viral suppression of HIV) and Trial 2 (retention in care, and plasma and intracellular tenofovir drug concentrations). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Malawi National Health Science Research Committee (19/05/2334) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board (19-1060).

Previous research suggested 4-32% of nurses did not adhere to laundry policies, which could be an infection control risk. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of UK healthcare workers towards domestic laundering of uniforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Online and paper questionnaires were distributed to HCWs and nursing students who regularly wear uniforms. Differences in knowledge between HCWs were analysed by Chi-squared tests and attitudes were examined using exploratory factor analysis. RESULTS: 86% of participants (n=1099 of 1277) laundered their uniforms domestically. Respondents were confident in laundering their uniforms appropriately (71%), however 17% failed to launder at the recommended temperature (60C). Most participants (68%) would prefer their employer launder their uniforms, with mixed negative emotions towards domestic laundering. Limited provision of uniforms and changing/storage facilities were a barrier to following guidelines. CONCLUSION: Most HCWs domestically launder their uniforms, despite a preference for professional laundering. One-fifth of HCWs deviated from the UK National Health Service uniform guidelines; onsite changing facilities were the most significant barrier towards adherence.","output":"Healthcare worker knowledge and attitudes towards uniform laundering during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The publisher regrets the absence of the Declaration of Competing Interest section in the paper.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced to contain it, searches for socially distanced activities have trended. We hypothesize that trends in the volume of search queries related to activities associated with COVID-19 transmission correlate with subsequent COVID-19 caseloads. We present a preliminary analytics framework that examines the relationship between Google search queries and the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States. We designed an experimental tool with search volume indices to track interest in queries related to two themes: isolation and mobility. Our goal was to capture the underlying social dynamics of an unprecedented pandemic using alternative data sources that are new to epidemiology. Our results indicate that the net movement index we defined correlates with COVID-19 weekly new case growth rate with a lag of between 10 and 14 days for the United States at-large, as well as at the state level for 42 out of 50 states with the exception of 8 states (DE, IA, KS, NE, ND, SD, WV, WY) from March to June 2020. In addition, an increasing caseload was seen over the summer in some southern US states. A sharp rise in mobility indices was followed by a sharp increase, respectively, in the case growth data, as seen in our case study of Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas.

We performed a systematic review to investigate changes in food intake, eating behaviors, and diet quality during lockdown as compared with before the lockdown. A literature search was performed using 3 electronic databases from inception until 13 June 2021. Observational studies evaluating changes in general populations during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were eligible. Of 1963 studies retrieved from the search strategy, 95 met inclusion criteria (85 in adults, 10 in children/adolescents), and the majority were of high quality (72.6%). Most of the studies were web-based surveys using convenience sampling, mainly focused on variations in the consumption of foods and eating behaviors during lockdown, whereas only 15 studies analyzed diet quality through dietary indices. On the basis of the definition of a healthful diet as reflected by a traditional Mediterranean diet, an increase in recommended foods such as fruit and vegetables, legumes, cereals, and olive oil was observed, although a sharp decrease in fish intake and an increase in dairy products were documented. Accordingly, a reduction in foods that should be eaten less frequently was reportednamely, red and processed meat. However, a higher consumption of unhealthy foods (e.g., snacks and sweets) was also observed. Results indicated improved diet quality in Europe, especially among Mediterranean countries, with the exception of France, while a switch to poor nutrient patterns was observed in Colombia and Saudi Arabia. Analyses of eating behaviors suggest an increase in food intake, number of daily meals, and snacking. In conclusion, changes in intake of major food groups, apart from fish intake, were in line with the definition of a traditional Mediterranean diet, indicating a consistent moderate improvement in dietary habits worldwide.

March 20 to May 30, 2003, was defined as the peak period of incidence and was compared with the same period in 2002. During the SARS epidemic, there was a 21% decrease in the number of patient consultations and a 15% reduction in the number of patients treated with RT. There was no significant change in the tumor type or reason for referral. Short fractionation schedules were employed for 35% of treated patients compared with 34% in 2002. Patient waiting times between referral and treatment decreased during the period of interest, from 16 days to 8 days (P = 0.021).

Here we show that neutrophils are the main myeloid cells that produce IL-10 in the lungs during the first 48 h of infection. Importantly, in vitro assays with bone-marrow derived neutrophils confirmed that IL-10 can be induced by these cells by the direct recognition of pneumococcal antigens. In vivo, we identified the recruitment of two neutrophil subpopulations in the lungs following infection, which exhibited clear morphological differences and a distinctive profile of IL-10 production at 48 h post-infection. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of neutrophils from WT mice into IL-10 knockout mice (Il10(-/-)) fully restored IL-10 production in the lungs and reduced lung histopathology. These results suggest that IL-10 production by neutrophils induced by S. pneumoniae limits lung injury and is important to mediate an effective immune response required for host survival.","output":"Characterization of the Anti-Inflammatory Capacity of IL-10-Producing Neutrophils in Response to Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are terrifically precise and adapted towards specialized respiratory epithelial cells, observed in organ culture and human volunteers both.

The problem arises to aggregate multiple appraised imperfections and perform inference with RWE. In this article, we thus develop an evidence appraisal aggregation algorithm called EA(3). Our algorithm employs the softmax functiona generalisation of the logistic function to multiple dimensionswhich is popular in several fields: statistics, mathematical physics and artificial intelligence. We prove that EA(3) has a number of desirable properties for appraising RWE and we show how the aggregated evidence appraisals computed by EA(3) can support causal inferences based on RWE within a Bayesian decision making framework. We also discuss features and limitations of our approach and how to overcome some shortcomings. We conclude with a look ahead at the use of RWE.","output":"EA(3): A softmax algorithm for evidence appraisal aggregation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presented paper proposes a hybrid neural architecture that enables intelligent data analysis efficacy to be boosted in smart sensor devices, which are typically resource-constrained and application-specific. The postulated concept integrates prior knowledge with learning from examples, thus allowing sensor devices to be used for the successful execution of machine learning even when the volume of training data is highly limited, using compact underlying hardware. The proposed architecture comprises two interacting functional modules arranged in a homogeneous, multiple-layer architecture. The first module, referred to as the knowledge sub-network, implements knowledge in the Conjunctive Normal Form through a three-layer structure composed of novel types of learnable units, called L-neurons. In contrast, the second module is a fully-connected conventional three-layer, feed-forward neural network, and it is referred to as a conventional neural sub-network. We show that the proposed hybrid structure successfully combines knowledge and learning, providing high recognition performance even for very limited training datasets, while also benefiting from an abundance of data, as it occurs for purely neural structures. In addition, since the proposed L-neurons can learn (through classical backpropagation), we show that the architecture is also capable of repairing its knowledge.","output":"Boosting Intelligent Data Analysis in Smart Sensors by Integrating Knowledge and Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of a diagnostic algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19 in patients who are referred to an emergency department for being suspected of having the disease DESIGN: Retrospective study METHOD: Patients with fever with no apparent cause and patients with recently developed respiratory symptoms, whether or not in combination with fever, were routinely given a PCR test, blood tests (lymphocyte count and LDH levels) and a chest CT scan The CT scan was assessed according to the CO-RADS classification Based on the findings, the patients were divided into 3 cohorts (proven COVID-19, strong suspicion of COVID-19, and low suspicion of COVID-19) and the appropriate isolation measures were taken RESULTS: In the period from 8 to 31 March 2020, the algorithm was applied to 312 patients COVID-19 was proven for 69 (22%) patients COVID-19 was strongly suspected for 151 (48%) patients and suspicion was low for the remaining 92 (29%) patients The percentage of patients with positive PCR results and the percentage of patients with abnormal laboratory test results increased as the CO-RADS score increased Among patients with a CO-RADS score of 4 or 5, this percentage increased further when they also had lymphopenia or elevated LDH levels We have adjusted the flowchart based on our findings CONCLUSION: In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans Even before the results of the PCR test are known and even if the results are negative, patients can be classified as 'proven COVID-19 patients' using the algorithm","output":"Diagnostic algorithm for COVID-19 at the ER/ Diagnostisch algoritme voor COVID-19 op de SEH"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 ?in 'den Dnya geneline h?zla yay?lan ?lmcl bir virstr.

The COVID-19 outbreak has deeply affected individuals physically, socially and psychologically. In this study, it was aimed to examine the effect of individuals' ability to organize personal presentation on perceived stress, insufficient self-efficacy and perception of stress / discomfort during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were obtained from 443 volunteers between the ages of 18-65 living in Konya, accessible through an online questionnaire and agreeing to participate in the study. As a result of the analyzes, it was determined that the high ability to organize personal presentation has an effect that reduces perceived general stress, insufficient self-efficacy and stress / discomfort perception. As a result, it has been found that those who adapt to the changes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic period are less stressed. It is important to increase individual efforts to adapt to the conditions required by the pandemic period in order to control the pandemic and to minimize individual stress.","output":"COVID-19 Salg?n?

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Internet-based survey covered 353 individuals who had participated in a psychological support project operated by one of the non-governmental organizations in Lublin, Poland, in the 12 months prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study contained questions to collect sociodemographic data and psychometric scales to measure resource gains and losses (the Conservation of Resources - Evaluation questionnaire), the quality of life (the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF), and strategies of coping with the pandemic situation (a modified Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire). RESULTS: A higher global quality of life occurred with higher gains and minor losses, as well as with coping through planning, positive reframing, emotional support seeking, a reduced substance use tendency, low self-blame, avoidance, and disengagement. Moreover, helplessness-based coping strategies were found to mediate both the relationships between resource gains and the quality of life, and between resource losses and the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may reduce people's quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic are an increase in losses and limited gains, experienced over the 6 months preceding the pandemic, as well as not using active, meaning-oriented, and support-seeking coping strategies, but using avoidance behaviors instead. Coping strategies specific to people experiencing helplessness are a mediating mechanism between losses and limited gains of resources, and the quality of life.

RESULTS: A total of 230 women with COVID-19 (154 deliveries, 66 ongoing pregnancies, and 10 abortions) and 156 newborns from 20 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. A total of 34.62% of the pregnant patients had obstetric complications, and 59.05% of patients displayed fever. Lymphopenia was observed in 40.71% of patients. A total of 5.19% of women received mechanical ventilation. Seven women were critically ill. One mother and two newborns died. A total of 24.74% of newborns were premature. Five newborns' throat swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 were positive, all of which were delivered by cesarean section. For eight newborns with negative throat swab tests, three had both elevated IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid tests of vaginal secretions, breast milk, amniotic fluid, placental blood, and placental tissues were negative. CONCLUSION: Most pregnant patients were mildly ill. The mortality of pregnant women with COVID-19 was lower than that of overall COVID-19 patients. Cesarean section was more common than vaginal delivery for pregnant women with COVID-19.

This protective function is especially important at the time of weaning, when animals are exposed to infectious agents and to numerous stresses such as the change of environment and diet. Diets supplemented with spray-dried plasma or plasma protein fractions have been shown to improve growth performance of farm animals and have been proposed as an alternative to antibiotics. In this review, we summarize our findings on the mechanism of action of dietary plasma proteins using a rat model of intestinal inflammation, based on the administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B activates the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), increasing T-lymphocytes in Peyer's patches and the number of activated T lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes (organized GALT). In the lamina propria SEB increased cytotoxic T Ħ and natural killer cell populations of the diffuse GALT. Staphyloccocal enterotoxin B significantly increased proinflammatory cytokines in Peyer's patches and mucosa. Plasma protein supplements modulated the mucosal immune response in organized and diffuse GALT, protecting GALT from possible excessive activation by the SEB challenge. These effects are accompanied by a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production, supporting the view that changes in cytokine production mediate the effects of dietary plasma proteins during intestinal inflammation. The increase in mucosal permeability and intestinal secretion induced by SEB was associated with decreased expression of mucosal tight-junction and adherent-junction proteins. Both plasma and plasma protein fractions prevented the effects of SEB on intestinal permeability, thus reducing the exposure of the host to microbial and food antigens across the interstitial space.

The pathogens of HFMD are mainly human enteroviruses (HEVs). Among them, human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are the most common pathogens of HFMD. However, other HEVs could also cause HFMD. To rapidly detect HEV71 and CVA16, and ensure detection of all HEVs causing HFMD, two real-time hybridization probe-based RT-PCR assays were developed in this study. One is a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, which was developed to detect and differentiate HEV71 specifically from CVA16 directly from clinical specimens within 1C2 h, and the other is a broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay, which targeted almost all HEVs. The experiments confirmed that the two assays have high sensitivity and specificity, and the sensitivity was up to 0.1 TCID(50)/ml for detection of HEVs, HEV71, and CVA16, respectively. A total of 213 clinical specimens were simultaneously detected by three kinds of assays, including the two real-time RT-PCR assays, direct conventional RT-PCR assay, and virus isolation assay on human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells). The total positive rate of both HEV71 and CVA16 was 69.48% with real-time RT-PCR assay, 47.42% with RT-PCR assay, and 34.58% with virus isolation assay. One HFMD clinical specimen was positive for HEV, but negative for HEV71 or CVA16, which was identified as Echovirus 11 (Echo11) by virus isolation, RT-PCR, and sequencing for the VP1 gene. The two real-time RT-PCR assays had been applied in 31 provincial HFMD labs to detect the pathogens of HFMD, which has contributed to the rapid identification of the pathogens in the early stages of HFMD outbreaks, and helped to clarify the etiologic agents of HFMD in China.","output":"The Development and Application of the Two Real-Time RT-PCR Assays to Detect the Pathogen of HFMD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 evolution depends on immunological capacity.

Minimizing reliance on an in-clinic patient performance status test to determine a patients prognosis and course of treatment can improve resource utilization. Further, current performance status measurements cannot capture patients' constant changes. These measurements also rely on self-reports, which are subjective and subject to bias. Real-time monitoring of patients' activities may allow for a more accurate assessment of patients performance status while minimizing resource utilization. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the validity of consumer-based activity trackers for monitoring the performance status of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. METHODS: A total of 27 consenting patients (63% male, median age 58 years) wore a consumer-based activity tracker 7 days before chemotherapy and 14 days after receiving their first treatment. The provider assessed patients using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) scale and Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF) before and after chemotherapy visits. The statistical correlations between ECOG-PS and MSAS-SF scores and patients daily step counts were assessed. RESULTS: The daily step counts yielded the highest correlation with the patients' ECOG-PS scores after chemotherapy (P<.001). The patients with higher ECOG-PS scores experienced a higher fluctuation in their step counts. The patients who walked more prechemotherapy (mean 6071 steps per day) and postchemotherapy (mean 5930 steps per day) had a lower MSAS-SF score (lower burden of symptoms) compared to patients who walked less prechemotherapy (mean 5205 steps per day) and postchemotherapy (mean 4437 steps per day). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using inexpensive, consumer-based activity trackers for the remote monitoring of performance status in the gastrointestinal cancer population.

Numerous observational studies have reported an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their associations with the ABO blood group served as the main outcome measures. Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before 1 January 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Of them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariable analysis identified the A blood group (vs. others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio (OR) = 6.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.11?18.92; p = 0.001).

The aim of this retrospective observational study was to determine whether COVID+ patients already on SSRIs upon hospital admission had reduced mortality compared to COVID+ patients not on chronic SSRI treatment. Electronic medical records of 9044 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from six hospitals were queried for demographic and clinical information. Using R, a logistic regression model was run with mortality as the outcome and SSRI status as the exposure. In this sample, no patients admitted on SSRIs had them discontinued. There was no significant difference in the odds of dying between COVID+ patients on chronic SSRIs vs. those not taking SSRIs, after controlling for age category, gender, and race.

More microbes can be found on a mobile phone than on a man's lavatory seat, the sole of a shoe, or a door handle. When examining patients, frequent handling of mobile phones can spread bacteria and provide a suitable breeding environment for numerous microorganisms. Nevertheless, evidence of bacterial contamination of mobile phones among healthcare workers in Africa was not conclusive. Thus, this meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of bacterial contamination of mobile phones used by healthcare workers and the most frequent bacterial isolates in Africa. Methods: We systematically retrieved relevant studies using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, POPLINE, HINARI, Science Direct, Cochrane Library databases, and Google Scholar from 2009 to 2021 publication year. We included observational studies that reported the prevalence of bacterial contamination of mobile phones among healthcare workers. Two independent authors assessed the quality of the studies. The DerSimonian-random Laird's effect model was used to calculate effect estimates for the pooled prevalence of bacterial contamination in mobile phones, as well as a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among 3882 retrieved studies, 23 eligible articles with a total sample size of 2,623 study participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of mobile phones bacterial contamination among healthcare workers was 83.9% (95% CI: 80.6, 87.2%; I 2 = 98%, p-value < 0.001).

Conclusion: The review indicated that the contamination with a different bacterial isolate of mobile phones used by health care workers was high. The most dominant bacterial isolates were Coagulase-negative staphylococci , Staphylococcus aureus , and Escherichia coli .

This study represents a secondary analysis of a prospectively conducted immunophenotyping study of pediatric severe sepsis to test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone will be differentially associated with clinical outcomes in children with or without immunoparalysis. METHODS: Children with severe sepsis/septic shock underwent blood sampling within 48 h of sepsis onset. Immune function was measured by quantifying whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced TNF&#945; production capacity, with a TNF&#945; response < 200 pg/ml being diagnostic of immunoparalysis. The primary outcome measure was number of days in 14 with MODS. Univariate and multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to examine associations between hydrocortisone use, immune function, and duration of MODS. RESULTS: One hundred two children were enrolled (age 75 [6-160] months, 60% male). Thirty-one subjects received hydrocortisone and were more likely to be older (106 [52-184] vs 38 [3-153] months, p = 0.04), to have baseline immunocompromise (32 vs 8%, p = 0.006), to have higher PRISM III (13 [8-18] vs 7 [5-13], p = 0.0003) and vasoactive inotrope scores (20 [10-35] vs 10 [3-15], p = 0.0002) scores, and to have more MODS days (3 [1-9] vs 1 [0-3], p = 0.002).

LRTI also occurs during mechanical ventilation, increasing the morbidity and mortality of intubated patients.

RESULTS: We enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal (OP) and deep endotracheal (ET) secretions were sampled within 24 h of intubation and every 48C72 h thereafter. Bacterial community profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon. Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma parvum and Enterococcus faecalis.

METHODS: In this study, the studies focusing on anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar from the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic to February 2021. RESULTS: 103 studies constituting 140732 people included in the review. The findings showed that anxiety prevalence was 27.3% (95% CI, 23.7%; 31.2%) among general population while the prevalence in COVID-19 patients was 39.6% (95% CI, 30.1%; 50.1%). Anxiety was significantly higher among females and older adults (p0.05). In addition Europe revealed the highest prevalence of anxiety 54.6% (95% CI, 42.5%; 66.2%) followed by America 31.5% (95% CI, 19%; 47.5%) and Asia 28.3% (95% CI, 20.3%; 38%). In the general population the highest prevalence of anxiety was in Africa 61.8% (95% CI, 57%-66.4%) followed by America 34.9% (95% CI, 27.7%-42.9%), Europe 30.7% (95% CI, 22.8%-40%) and Asia 24.5% (95% CI, 20.7%-28.9%). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 crisis, through identifying those who are more likely to be suffered from mental disorders at different layers of populations, it would be possible to apply appropriate supportive interventions with a view to provide targeted mental health services during the outbreak.","output":"A systematic review of the prevalence of anxiety among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-Na4 VMn(PO4 )3 (NVMP) cathode is attractive for sodium-ion battery application due to its reduced cost and toxicity, and high energy density (425 Wh kg-1 ).

That is, amino acid substitutions at this position (S267X) lead to a wide range of functional outcomes. This result was particularly striking because molecular models predicted the S267X side chains are buried, and thus, usually expected to be less tolerant of substitutions. To assess whether structural tolerance to buried substitutions is widespread in NTCP, here we used Rosetta to model all 19 potential substitutions at another 13 buried positions. Again, only subtle changes in the calculated stabilities and structures were predicted. Calculations were experimentally validated for 19 variants at codon 271 (N271X). Results showed near wildtype expression and rheostatic modulation of substrate transport, implicating N271 as a rheostat position. Notably, each N271X substitution showed a similar effect on the transport of three different substrates and thus did not alter substrate specificity. This differs from S267X, which altered both transport kinetics and specificity. As both transport and specificity may change during protein evolution, the recognition of such rheostat positions may be important for evolutionary studies. We further propose that the presence of rheostat positions is facilitated by local plasticity within the protein structure. Finally, we note that identifying rheostat positions may advance efforts to predict new biomedically relevant missense variants in NTCP and other membrane transport proteins.","output":"Structural Plasticity Is a Feature of Rheostat Positions in the Human Na(+)/Taurocholate Cotransporting Polypeptide (NTCP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Researchers have already reported a high level of interleukin (IL)-6 in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) In this study, we","output":"Iran COVID-19 Immunological Study: Remarkable Level of Interleukin-6 in Iranian COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely reported to cause symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue and shortness of breath.

Therefore, understanding how SARS-Cov-2 causes such wide-spread tissue damage and developing targeted pharmacological treatments will be critical in fighting this virus and preparing for future outbreaks. Herein, we summarize the progress made thus far by using in vitro or in vivo models to investigate individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their pathogenic mechanisms. We grouped the SARS-CoV-2 proteins into three categories: host-entry, self-acting and host-interacting. This review focuses on the self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins and summarizes current knowledge on how these proteins promote virus replication and disrupt host systems, as well as drugs that target these virus- and interacting host proteins. Many of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Future coronavirus outbreaks will mostly likely be caused by new virus strains that evade the vaccines through mutations in host-entry proteins. Therefore, study of individual self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins for targeted therapeutic interventions is not only essential for fighting COVID-19, but also valuable against future coronavirus outbreaks.","output":"Understanding individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins for targeted drug development against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of older adults living with cancer is increasing.

This study defines, applies and demonstrates the capability of system dynamics modelling to recognise and visualise the ripple effect subject to supply, demand, and logistics disruptions as well as a combined, simultaneous disruption of supply, demand and logistics. Simulation results for these four risk scenarios indicate that disruption propagation and its impacts vary based on risk type, combination of risks and the impacting node. The bi-directional, increasing effect is significant for disruptions of longer duration. Retailers and manufacturers are most fragile to multiple disruptions due to broader risk exposure points. In generalised terms, systems theory-based study provides insights into the complex behaviour of simultaneous risks and associated disruptions occurring at a node and across the SC. The outcomes derived can help practitioners visualise and recognise the dynamic nature of the ripple effect cascading across the SC network.

This appears to be a function of multiple herpesvirus proteins, but only a minority of herpesvirus proteins have been examined for cell cycle effects. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the viral proteins that contribute to G1/S arrest, we screened a library of over 200 proteins from herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for effects on the G1/S interface, using HeLa fluorescent, ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) cells in which G1/S can be detected colorimetrically. Proteins from each virus were identified that induce accumulation of G1/S cells, predominantly tegument, early, and capsid proteins. The identification of several capsid proteins in this screen suggests that incoming viral capsids may function to modulate cellular processes. The cell cycle effects of selected EBV proteins were further verified and examined for effects on p53 and p21 as regulators of the G1/S transition. Two EBV replication proteins (BORF2 and BMRF1) were found to induce p53 but not p21, while a previously uncharacterized tegument protein (BGLF2) was found to induce p21 protein levels in a p53-independent manner. Proteomic analyses of BGLF2-interacting proteins identified interactions with the NIMA-related protein kinase (NEK9) and GEM-interacting protein (GMIP). Silencing of either NEK9 or GMIP induced p21 without affecting p53 and abrogated the ability of BGLF2 to further induce p21. Collectively, these results suggest multiple viral proteins contribute to G1/S arrest, including BGLF2, which induces p21 levels likely by interfering with the functions of NEK9 and GMIP. IMPORTANCE Most people are infected with multiple herpesviruses, whose proteins alter the infected cells in several ways. During lytic infection, the viral proteins block cell proliferation just before the cellular DNA replicates. We used a novel screening method to identify proteins from three different herpesviruses that contribute to this block. Several of the proteins we identified had previously unknown functions or were structural components of the virion. Subsets of these proteins from Epstein-Barr virus were studied for their effects on the cell cycle regulatory proteins p53 and p21, thereby identifying two proteins that induce p53 and one that induces p21 (BGLF2). We identified interactions of BGLF2 with two human proteins, both of which regulate p21, suggesting that BGLF2 induces p21 by interfering with the functions of these two host proteins.

METHODS Deterministic susceptible-infected and susceptible-infected-removed models were used for both epidemic waves, using official published information. NLREG 6.2 was used for estimating deterministic parameters and analytical solutions were obtained with Maple 9 software. Dynamical indicators were obtained for the epidemic. RESULTS Suitable adjustment of the data was observed with both models, but smaller adjustment was observed during the second wave with the non- removed model. The highest rate of infectiousness was shown (35 new cases per 10 000 susceptible people) during the second wave (with R0 near to one), in spite of presenting greater incidence (8.8 cases per day), compensated for by a high rate of removal (11,5 cases per day) which lasted less than the epidemic (11,1 days), and a lower rate of attack (1 case per each 100 susceptible people).

METHOD: Self-reported lonely individuals with AARP Medicare Supplement plans insured by UnitedHealthcare who participated in a program with a robotic pet (n = 20) were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked to provide feedback about their experiences interacting with a robotic pet, their perceptions about the potential impact on loneliness, and recommendations for improving the program. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Constant comparison and consensus-gaining processes were used to develop categories that later formed representative themes. RESULTS: Seven themes emerged from analysis: Openness to Adoption of Robotic Pet, Reactions to Pet and its Attributes, Integration of Pet in Daily Life, Strategic Utilization and Forging New Connections, Deriving Comfort and Camaraderie, Advice for Future Users, and Recommendations for Enhancing Ownership Experience. Participants living alone, with fewer social connections and less active lifestyles, derived the most benefit from interacting with their pets. Common responses to pets included cuddling, petting, grooming, and sleeping with them. Some shared or loaned their pets, while others refused to loan their pets to interested peers. Most reported showing their pets to others, which helped some facilitate communication and social connections.

Secondary aims were to assess perceived restrictions, influence on mental health, and functional outcome compared to patients undergoing surgery without restriction. METHODS: During February and March 2020, 105 patients underwent THA (n = 48) or TKA (n = 57) and completed preoperative and six-month postoperative assessments. A cohort of 415 patients undergoing surgery in 2019 were used as the control. Patient demographic data, BMI, comorbidities, Oxford Hip Score (OHS) or Knee Score (OKS), and EuroQoL five-domain (EQ-5D) score were collected preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. At six months postoperatively, the 2020 patients were also asked to complete a questionnaire relating to the effect of the social restrictions on their outcome and their mental health. RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients (47.6%, n = 50/105) felt that the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 had limited their rehabilitation and were associated with a significantly worse postoperative OKS (p &lt; 0.001), EQ-5D score (p &lt; 0.001), and lower satisfaction rate (p = 0.019). The reasons for the perceived limited rehabilitation were: being unable to exercise (n = 32, 64%), limited access to physiotherapy (n = 30, 60%), and no face-to-face follow-up (n = 30, 60%). A quarter (n = 26) felt that their mental health had deteriorated postoperatively;17.1% (n = 18) felt depressed and 26.7% (n = 28) felt anxious. Joint-specific scores and satisfaction for the 2020 group were no different to the 2019 group, however patients undergoing THA in 2020 had a significantly worse postoperative EQ-5D compared to the 2019 cohort (difference 0.106;p = 0.001) which was not observed in patients undergoing TKA. CONCLUSION: Half of the 2020 cohort felt that their rehabilitation had been limited and was associated with worse postoperative Oxford and EQ-5D scores, and lower rates of patient satisfaction, but relative to the 2019 cohort their overall outcomes were no different, with the exception of THA patients who had a worse general health score.

Drawing on affective events theory (AET), the present study proposed a theoretical model for the relationships among peer abusive supervision, negative affectivity, cyberloafing, and hostile attribute bias, which aims to bridge the above research gap. METHODOLOGY: Multiwave data of 355 employes from 8 service-oriented companies in Southwest China supported our model. Time-lag method and critical incident techniques were introduced during the data collection stage. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and bootstrapping method were employed for hypothesis test. FINDINGS: The empirical results indicated that peer abusive supervision was positively related to third partys cyberloafing, and the third partys negative affectivity plays a mediating role among the above relationships. In addition, the third partys hostile attribution bias moderated the mediating role of third partys negative affectivity. Specifically, the effect of peer abusive supervision on third partys negative affectivity and the mediating effect of this negative affectivity were stronger when the third partys hostile attribution bias was higher. ORIGINALITY: Drawing on AET, the current study constructed a process model of third partys cyberloafing reactions to peer abusive supervision, which helps explain the affective mechanism and the boundary conditions of the above events-affectivity-behavior path. Our model is a positive response to previous scholars calls for research of abusive supervision from multiple perspectives.

Here, we confirm that m6A addition indeed regulates HIV-1 RNA expression and demonstrate that this effect is largely mediated by the nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1 and the cytoplasmic m6A reader YTHDF2. Both YTHDC1 and YTHDF2 bind to multiple distinct and overlapping sites on the HIV-1 RNA genome, with YTHDC1 recruitment serving to regulate the alternative splicing of HIV-1 RNAs. Unexpectedly, while YTHDF2 binding to m6A residues present on cellular mRNAs resulted in their destabilization as previously reported, YTHDF2 binding to m6A sites on HIV-1 transcripts resulted in a marked increase in the stability of these viral RNAs.

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. SETTING: Abortion service in one National Health Service health board in Scotland. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Twenty women who accessed telemedicine abortion services and self-administered mifepristone and misoprostol at home up to 12 weeks' gestation. METHODS: Thematic analysis of semi-structured qualitative interviews, informed by the Framework analytic approach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's experiences of accessing telemedicine for medical abortion at home, specifically: acceptability of the telephone consultation and remote support; views on no pre-abortion ultrasound scan; and self-administration of abortion medications at home. RESULTS: Novel study findings were three-fold: (1) participants valued the option of accessing abortion care via telemedicine and emphasised the benefits of providing a choice of telephone and in-person consultation to suit those with different life circumstances; (2) the quality of abortion care was enhanced by the telemedicine service in relation to access, comfort and flexibility, and ongoing telephone support; (3) participants described being comfortable with, and in some cases a preference for, not having an ultrasound scan. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates support for the continuation of telemedicine abortion services beyond the temporary arrangements in place during COVID-19, and lends weight to the argument that offering the option of telemedicine abortion care can enable women to access this essential health service.

Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the wave 1 group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised wave 2. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7C13 February), post-peak (14C27 February), remission plateau (28 February?present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04C1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16C1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07C1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19C0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14C0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11C0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79C0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms: a longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the preparations of flexible electronic devices have attracted great attention. Here, a simple one-pot method of thermal polymerization is introduced to fabricate silk fibroin-dopted hydrogels (SFHs), which are both chemically and physically cross-linked by acrylamide (AM), acrylic acid (AA), and silk fibroin (SF). The addition of SF can effectively enhance the mechanical property of the SFH12% by 59% compared with SFH0% . Taking the advantage of its wide working range of stress (about 0.455-568.9 kPa), the SFH can work as a resistance-type pressure sensor to monitor different human motions. What is more, the excellent adhesion, about 75.17 N m-1 of SFH46% enables it to fit tightly to other objects during the testing, which significantly reduces the loss of small signals due to poor fit. In addition, the SFH demonstrates excellent self-healing property without requiring external excitation and a sensitive temperature response in the range of -10 to 60 C. The SFH is expected to be applied in the field of electronic skin, soft robots, and other flexible electronic products as well as speech recognition.","output":"Highly Stretchable, Adhesive, and Self-Healing Silk Fibroin-Dopted Hydrogels for Wearable Sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The natural history of recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unknown.

Our objective was to survey rhinologists and understand the extent to which telemedicine serves as a rejoinder to in-person consultation: appreciation of relevant factors may be important in planning for present and future considerations. METHODS: A 14-question anonymous survey sent out to the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) membership in April 2020. It included demographic factors and detailed questions examining the extent of telemedicine use. Numerous topics including the degree of use, satisfaction with services, and utility of services were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 134 respondents. Most reported seeing 30% of typical in-person volume, with 14.8% not seeing any patients at all. 88.1% used telemedicine; 82.0% reported some level of satisfaction with telemedicine. The vast majority utilized platforms employing audio and video (83.3%), and a plurality reported spending 5C15 min on calls. Numerous reasons were cited for the use of telemedicine, including significant public health benefits amid the crisis (89.7%). Only 12.0% of respondents reported using telemedicine for hospital consultation. CONCLUSION: Rhinologists have embraced telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to improve accessibility, patient satisfaction, and revenue stream. When utilized appropriately, this technology obviates the need for seeing at-risk patients and performing procedures such as nasal endoscopy. Only a minority of rhinologists was dissatisfied, viewing this as a temporary fix during the pandemic.","output":"Incorporation of telemedicine by rhinologists: The COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in April 2020, social distancing measures were implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory. METHODS: Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied. RESULTS: A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period. DISCUSSION: A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.","output":"Blood supply management in times of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - challenges, strategies adopted, and the lessons learned from the experience of a hospital-based blood centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID-19 outbreak imposing stay at home and social distancing policies, warnings about the impact of lockdown and its economic consequences on domestic violence have surged This paper disentangles the effect of forced cohabitation and economic stress on intimate partner violence Using an online survey data set, we find a 23% increase of intimate partner violence during the lockdown Our results indicate that the impact of economic consequences is twice as large as the impact of lockdown We also find large but statistically imprecise estimates of a large increase of domestic violence when the relative position of the man worsens, especially in contexts where that position was already being threatened We view our results as consistent with the male backlash and emotional cue effects","output":"Intimate Partner Violence under Forced Cohabitation and Economic Stress: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UK National Diabetes Inpatient COVID Response Group was formed at the end of March 2020 to support the provision of diabetes inpatient care during the COVID pandemic.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Community based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked with hospital admission data. PARTICIPANTS: 839 278 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19, of whom 36 233 had been admitted to hospital within 14 days, tested between 23 November 2020 and 31 January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay that enables assessment of S-gene target failure (SGTF), a proxy test for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, region of residence, and date of positive test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admission between one and 14 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: 27 710 (4.7%) of 592 409 patients with SGTF variants and 8523 (3.5%) of 246 869 patients without SGTF variants had been admitted to hospital within one to 14 days. The stratum adjusted hazard ratio of hospital admission was 1.52 (95% confidence interval 1.47 to 1.57) for patients with covid-19 infected with SGTF variants, compared with those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age (P<0.001), with hazard ratios of 0.93-1.21 in patients younger than 20 years with versus without SGTF variants, 1.29 in those aged 20-29, and 1.45-1.65 in those aged 30 years. The adjusted absolute risk of hospital admission within 14 days was 4.7% (95% confidence interval 4.6% to 4.7%) for patients with SGTF variants and 3.5% (3.4% to 3.5%) for those with non-SGTF variants. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the risk of hospital admission is higher for people infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting a more severe disease.

METHOD In May 2020, 11,596 15- to 20-year-olds from two subpopulations answered a survey regarding their alcohol use and social life, as well as changes to these, during the Danish lockdown. Using survey data from all participants, we performed a multinomial logistic regression to assess the association between determinants of alcohol use and perceived change in alcohol use during the Danish lockdown. We used longitudinal data from one subpopulation (n=1869) to perform negative binomial regressions exploring changes in frequency of alcohol use from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS Of all participants, 59% drank less, 75% had fewer in-person social interactions and 56% met more frequently online during lockdown. Girls were more likely than boys to have a perceived decrease in alcohol use during lockdown (odds ratio (OR)=1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-1.56). A perceived decrease in in-person social interaction during lockdown was associated with less drinking (OR=2.27; 95% CI 1.98-2.61), while a perceived increase in in-person social interaction during lockdown was associated with more drinking (OR=1.42; 95% CI 1.11-1.82) compared to unchanged drinking behaviour and social interaction.

To overcome the intensity shift, our method first transforms annotated lung cancer data into the style of unlabeled COVID-19 data using an effective augmentation approach via a Fourier transform. Furthermore, to reduce the distribution shift, we design a teacher-student network to learn rotation-invariant features for segmentation.

Across all studies, the overall sample size of COVID positive children was 1,247 and the median age of this population was 9 1 years old Among COVID positive pediatric patients, there was an AKI incidence of 30 51%, with only 0 56% of these patients receiving KRT The mortality was 2 55% among all COVID positive pediatric patients The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among COVID positive patients was 74 29% CONCLUSION: AKI has shown to be a negative prognostic factor in adult patients with COVID-19 and now also in the pediatric cohort with high incidence and mortality rates Additionally, our findings show a strong comparison in epidemiology between adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients;however, they need to be confirmed with additional data and

However, the exact molecular pathways underlying these effects remain poorly clarified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of emodin on HepaRG cells and to define the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that emodin evidently inhibited HepaRG cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner by blocking cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phase and by inducing apoptosis. Emodin treatment also resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which abrogated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The above effects were all suppressed by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further studies by western blot analysis howed that emodin upregulated p53, p21, Bax, cyclin E, cleaved caspase-3, 8 and 9, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). However, the protein expression of Bcl-2, cyclin A and CDK2 was downregulated.

We investigated if an interaction existed between vitamin D levels and social deprivation in those with and without COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Upper or lower respiratory tract samples from 104 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in accordance with Public Health England criteria (January-May 2020) using RT-PCR. The latest serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D(25-OHD) levels, quantified by LC-MS/MS, was obtained for each patient (September 2019-April 2020). Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was generated for each patient. Univariate and logistic regression analyses examined associations between age, gender, 25-OHD, IMD score and SARS-CoV-2 result in the total cohort and subgroups. RESULTS: In the total cohort, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was significantly associated with lower 25-OHD levels and higher IMD. A positive test was associated with higher IMD in the male subgroup and with lower 25-OHD levels in those aged >72 years. Low 25-OHD and IMD quintile 5 were separately associated with positive COVID-19 outcome in the cohort. Patients in IMD quintile 5 with vitamin D levels &#8804; 34.4 nmol/L were most likely to have a positive COVID-19 outcome, even more so if aged >72 years (OR: 19.07, 95%CI: 1.71-212.25; P = .016).

However, its usefulness in predicting the clinical outcome of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in patients with NSCLC has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the CONUT score in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced NSCLC who received pembrolizumab monotherapy. A cut-off CONUT score of 2 was used to categorize patients into low and high CONUT groups. We evaluated the relation between the clinicopathological factors including CONUT score and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the prognosis. Results Twenty-two patients were classified into the low CONUT score group, while 10 were classified into the high CONUT score group. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, the number of prior treatments and the CONUT score were found to independently predict progression-free survival (PFS) (P<0.05), while the CONUT score as well as NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P<0.05). In addition, in patients who received pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment, a high CONUT score was associated with a significantly worse PFS and overall survival in comparison to a low CONUT score. Conclusions The CONUT score has potential application as a predictor of the therapeutic effect and the prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Our findings suggest that in addition to the programmed cell death ligand 1 expression level, the CONUT may also be a useful indicator for selecting NSCLC patients who may benefit from ICI treatment.","output":"Prognostic impact of the Controlling Nutritional Status score in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with pembrolizumab."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Through a multisectoral approach, the DREAMS Partnership aimed to reduce HIV incidence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) by 40% over 2 years in high-burden districts across sub-Saharan Africa. DREAMS promotes a combination package of evidence-based interventions to reduce individual, family, partner, and community-based drivers of young womens heightened HIV risk. We evaluated the impact of DREAMS on HIV incidence among AGYW and young men in 2 settings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We directly estimated HIV incidence rates among open population-based cohorts participating in demographic and HIV serological surveys from 2006 to 2018 annually in uMkhanyakude (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) and over 6 rounds from 2010 to 2019 in Gem (Siaya, Kenya). We compared HIV incidence among AGYW aged 15 to 24 years before DREAMS and up to 3 years after DREAMS implementation began in 2016. We investigated the timing of any change in HIV incidence and whether the rate of any change accelerated during DREAMS implementation. Comparable analyses were also conducted for young men (20 to 29/34 years). In uMkhanyakude, between 5,000 and 6,000 AGYW were eligible for the serological survey each year, an average of 85% were contacted, and consent rates varied from 37% to 67%. During 26,395 person-years (py), HIV incidence was lower during DREAMS implementation (2016 to 2018) than in the previous 5-year period among 15- to 19-year-old females (4.5 new infections per 100 py as compared with 2.8; age-adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.82), and lower among 20- to 24-year-olds (7.1/100 py as compared with 5.8; aRR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04). Declines preceded DREAMS introduction, beginning from 2012 to 2013 among the younger and 2014 for the older women, with no evidence of more rapid decline during DREAMS implementation. In Gem, between 8,515 and 11,428 AGYW were eligible each survey round, an average of 34% were contacted and offered an HIV test, and consent rates ranged from 84% to 99%. During 10,382 py, declines in HIV incidence among 15- to 19-year-olds began before DREAMS and did not change after DREAMS introduction. Among 20- to 24-year-olds in Gem, HIV incidence estimates were lower during DREAMS implementation (0.64/100 py) compared with the pre-DREAMS period (0.94/100 py), with no statistical evidence of a decline (aRR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.18). Among young men, declines in HIV incidence were greater than those observed among AGYW and also began prior to DREAMS investments. Study limitations include low study power in Kenya and the introduction of other interventions such as universal treatment for HIV during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial declines in HIV incidence among AGYW were observed, but most began before DREAMS introduction and did not accelerate in the first 3 years of DREAMS implementation. Like the declines observed among young men, they are likely driven by earlier and ongoing investments in HIV testing and treatment. Longer-term implementation and evaluation are needed to assess the impact of such a complex HIV prevention intervention and to help accelerate reductions in HIV incidence among young women.","output":"Evaluating the impact of DREAMS on HIV incidence among adolescent girls and young women: A population-based cohort study in Kenya and South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 was classified as a pandemic, the stream of important information from multiple sources is constant and always changing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, guidelines implemented to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection made collection of venous blood logistically difficult at a time when SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance was urgently needed. Dried blood spots (DBS) have generated interest as an alternative to venous blood for SARS-CoV-2 serological applications due to their stability, low cost, and ease of collection; DBS samples can be self-generated via fingerprick by community members and mailed at ambient temperatures. Here, we detail the development of four DBS-based SARS-CoV-2 serological methods and demonstrate their implementation in a large serological survey of community members from 12 cities in the East Bay region of the San Francisco metropolitan area using at- home DBS collection. We find that DBS perform similarly to plasma/serum in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and commercial SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. In addition, we show that DBS samples can reliably detect antibody responses months post-infection and track antibody kinetics after vaccination. Implementation of DBS enabled collection of valuable serological data from our study population to investigate changes in seroprevalence over an eight-month period.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been observed to have a greater mortality impact on subgroups of people in the population who are deemed to be at higher medical disease risk. Individuals with cardiovascular disorders are one such COVID-19-associated high-mortality risk group. RECENT FINDINGS Evidence is accumulating that COVID-19 infection may worsen an individual's future cardiovascular health, and, preinfection/postinfection cardiovascular evaluation may be warranted to determine if progressive cardiovascular damage has occurred because of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, focusing on the association between COVID-19 severity and cardiac-specific biomarkers, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin T (TnT)/troponin I (TnI), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB). TnT had the highest odds ratio or OR (11.83) indicating the greatest association with COVID-19 severity, followed by NT-proBNP (7.57), TnI (6.32), LDH (4.79), D-dimer (4.10), creatine kinase (3.43), and CK-MB (3.35). All of the biomarkers studied were significantly correlated with COVID-19 severity including severe symptoms, ICU care, and mortality (P < 0.0001, except P < 0.01 for CK-MB). SUMMARY COVID-19 infection results in short-term and long-term disease risk that may involve adverse cardiovascular health issues including heart failure.

This chapter describes the nature and modern treatment of waste water, land applications of waste water, and methods of land applications of biosolids and animal wastes. The amount of organic matter in domestic wastes determines the degree of required biological treatment. Various tests are used to assess the amount of organic matter: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). The complete sewage treatment comprises three major steps: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. Tertiary treatment processes involving physicochemical processes can be effective in reducing the concentration of pathogens. The treated domestic wastewater may be disposed of via land application for crop irrigation or as a means of additional treatment and disposal through the three basic methods that include low-rate irrigation, overland flow, and high-rate infiltration.","output":"Chapter 24 Wastewater Treatment and Biosolids Reuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines changes in people's mobility over a 7-month period (from March 1st to September 30th, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U S using longitudinal models and county-level mobility data obtained from people's anonymized mobile phone signals It differentiates two distinct waves of the study period: Wave 1 (MarchCJune) and Wave 2 (JuneCSeptember) It also analyzes the relationships of these mobility changes with various social, spatial, policy, and political factors The results indicate that mobility changes in Wave 1 have a V-shaped trend: people's mobility first declined at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (MarchCApril) but quickly recovered to the pre-pandemic mobility levels from April to June The rates of mobility changes during this period are significantly associated with most of our key variables, including political partisanship, poverty level, and the strictness of mobility restriction policies For Wave 2, there was very little mobility decline despite the existence of mobility restriction policies and the COVID-19 pandemic becoming more severe Our findings suggest that restricting people's mobility to control the pandemic may be effective only for a short period, especially in liberal democratic societies Further, since poor people kept traveling during the pandemic because they are mostly essential workers who are required to be physically present at their workplaces, health authorities should pay special attention to these people by implementing policies to mitigate their high COVID-19 exposure risk","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's mobility: A longitudinal study of the U.S. from march to september of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As the world experiences successive waves of corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, global efforts to develop and distribute an effective vaccine produced several promising options. The aim of our study was to assess the difference in pulmonary involvement between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients among Egyptians. Patients and methods: Our study involved 234 patients who were tested positive for COVID-19 and had classic symptoms. They were split into 2 groups: group 1 (131 unvaccinated patients), and group 2 (103 fully vaccinated patients). Patients underwent high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. All scans were evaluated, and CT severity score (CT-SS) was calculated. Results: For group 1 the patients ages ranged from 19 to 84, mean = 44.5 years (+ 16.2 SD), 76 (58%) males and 55 (42%) females, while group 2 age ranged from 18 to 85, mean (+SD)= 42.2 years (+ 16.6), 59 (57.3%) males and 44 (42.7%) females. The presence of ground glass opacities and white lung sign varied significantly between both groups (P=0.001 and 0.002 respectively). For other recorded signs no significant difference was detected. The mean computed tomography severity score (CT-SS) for group 1 was 11.25 ( 6.6 SD). While for group 2 it was 6.32 ( 4.33 SD). The difference between studied groups was highly significant (P<0.001).

Liposomal bupivacaine is liposome-encapsulated bupivacaine which has been reported to be effective for up to 72 h. The study of Peri-Articular Anaesthetic for Replacement of the Knee (SPAARK) trial has been designed to assess the effectiveness of peri-articular liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine hydrochloride compared with peri-articular bupivacaine hydrochloride alone in the management of post-operative pain following knee replacement. METHODS/DESIGN: The SPAARK trial is a multi-centre, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial. The co-primary outcomes are post-operative recovery assessed by global QoR-40 scores at 72 h and cumulative pain VAS score from 6 to 72 h following surgery. Longer-term measures of the co-primary outcomes are collected at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months post randomisation, together with secondary outcomes, i.e. the Oxford Knee Score, and the American Knee Society Score. Cumulative opiate use and fitness for discharge are measured up to 72 h post-surgery. The analysis approaches for the primary and secondary outcomes are described here, as are the descriptive statistics which will be reported. The full SPAARK protocol has already been published. RESULTS: The co-primary outcomes will be analysed using multivariate linear regression adjusting for stratification factors and other important prognostic variables, including baseline scores in the case of the QoR-40. The adjusted mean difference between the two groups together with 97.5% confidence intervals will be reported for each of the primary outcomes. Other continuous variables will be assessed using the same method. Binary outcomes will be assessed using chi-squared tests. DISCUSSION: The paper provides details of the planned statistical analyses for the SPAARK trial and aims to reduce the risk of outcome reporting bias from prior data knowledge. Any changes or deviations from this statistical analysis plan will be described and justified in the final study report. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN54191675.

Although these effects can play out on a grand scale, to understand them we need to zoom in to virus life cycle traits. The values of these traits determine a virus effect on the host population, the trait diversity provides the material for natural selection, and trade-offs between the traits are expected to constrain virus evolutionary potential. However, due to the difficulty involved in measuring viral life history phenotypes, there are not many studies that characterize their diversity within clades of viruses. In this study, we quantified the life history of 35 chloroviruses from three host range groups (NC64A, Osy, and SAG viruses). We developed methods to efficiently measure adsorption rate, depolarization probability, lysis probability, lysis time, burst size, specific infectivity, and decay. The trait estimates varied between 5 and 75-fold across all the virus strains, with most traits varying substantially both within and across groups. We then used our largest virus group, the NC64A viruses (n = 20), to look for correlations that could signal trade-offs between traits. We found that viruses with high depolarization probabilities also had higher burst sizes, but lower lysis probabilities once depolarized. These correlations were strong, but their mechanistic underpinnings are unclear. We also found a strong correlation between growth rate and survival in the NC64A viruses. Finally, we discovered biphasic or tailing decay in all the chlorovirus groups. The nature and diversity of these traits has large implications for the ecology and evolutionary potential of the chloroviruses, and confirm the importance of studying viral life cycle traits.","output":"Life history diversity and signals of trade-offs in a large group of chloroviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ricardo Garza, MD, was still walking the tightrope: standing, but unable to withstand another gust of wind COVID-19 swept away about 35% of the San Antonio solo cardiologist's practice revenue, and that was just what he could calculate as he waited for insurers to process straggling claims But he had returned to in-office operations without any layoffs While some practices are surviving - and trying their best to prepare for future threats - others weren't so lucky On-the-ground experiences align with the Texas Medical Association's Practice Viability Survey in showing COVID-19 was, and still is, a disruptor unlike any other - challenging or torpedoing the viability of various practice types","output":"Road to Recovery: COVID-19 Tests, Bends, and Breaks Texas Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Examination of serum specimens from a patient with chronic active hepatitis proved negative to the Australia-SH antigen by immunodiffusion and by complement fixation.

COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaikes information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female.

To gain SMR control, stroke survivors are usually instructed to engage in motor imagery (MI) or to attempt moving the paralyzed fingers resulting in task- or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of SMR (SMR-ERD). However, as these tasks are cognitively demanding, especially for stroke survivors suffering from cognitive impairments, BCI control performance can deteriorate considerably over time. It would thus be important to identify biomarkers that predict decline in BCI control performance within an ongoing session in order to optimize the man-machine interaction scheme. Here we determine the link between BCI control performance over time and heart rate variability (HRV). Specifically, we investigated whether HRV can be used as a biomarker to predict decline during voluntary control of SMR-ERD across 17 healthy participants using Granger causality. SMR-ERD was visually displayed on a screen. Participants were instructed to engage in MI-based SMR-ERD control over two consecutive runs of 8.5 minutes each. During the second run, task difficulty was gradually increased. While control performance (p = .18) and HRV (p = .16) remained unchanged across participants during the first run, during the second run, both measures declined over time at high correlation (performance: -0.61%/10s, p = 0; HRV: -0.007ms/10s, p < .001). We found that HRV Granger-caused BCI control performance (p < .001) exhibited predictive characteristics of HRV on an individual participant level.

Tonic pain was induced on day 1, 4 and 14 by immersing the hand in 2 C water for 120 s. Electroencephalography was recorded during test pain at baseline and after 14 days. Spectral analysis and source localization were investigated in predefined frequency bands. RESULTS A decreased perception of pain on day 4 persisted throughout the 14 days compared to baseline (p < 0.006). Oxycodone decreased the electroencephalography spectral power in the delta and theta bands and increased power in the alpha1, alpha2 and beta1 bands (p < 0.03). Tapentadol increased spectral power in the alpha1 band (p < 0.001).

In this study, antibacterial activity was evaluated for six dihydrochalcone compounds from Malus. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited antibacterial effects on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the antibacterial capacity of these compounds was greater than that of their glycosylated derivatives. Within a certain range, dihydrochalcone hydrophobicity was positively correlated with antibacterial activity. Additionally, glycosylation at the 2'-position of the A-ring and hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the B-ring played a key role in the antibacterial activity of dihydrochalcones. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin caused damage to bacterial cells by significantly increasing protein and inorganic phosphate leakage. Compared to phloretin, 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited a smaller effect on Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and a greater effect on Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggesting different antibacterial mechanisms. At a low dihydrochalcone concentration, the respiration of M. luteus did not change, while membrane permeability increased significantly. These results indicate that the antibacterial mechanism of M. luteus was primarily damage to the cell membrane. However, damage to respiration and the cell membrane might occur simultaneously in K. pneumoniae, suggesting that the antibacterial mechanism of dihydrochalcones also depends on strain type.

Individual demographics and institution-specific variables were included in the survey along with questions assessing both attitudes toward COVID-19 illness in pregnancy as well as confidence in counseling regarding the use of the vaccine for pregnant patients. Results: Almost all providers (151, 98.1%) reported already receiving or being scheduled to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and a majority of providers (111, 72.1%) reported that they believe the benefits of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy outweigh the risks. Forty-one (26.6%) reported feeling very confident in counseling patients who primarily speak English about the evidence for mRNA vaccination in pregnancy, and 36 (23%) reported feeling very confident in counseling patients who are not primarily English-speaking. Forty-three providers (28.1%) expressed strong confidence in their comfort talking to individuals with vaccine hesitancy based on historic and continued racism and systemic injustices. The sources that survey respondents most commonly used to find information regarding COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy were the CDC (112, 74.2%), hospital-specific resources (94, 62.3%) and ACOG (82, 54.3%).

In recent months, the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCbased antibody tests has gained a lot of attention. These tests can potentially be used to assess SARS-COV-2 immunity status in individuals (e.g., essential health care personnel). They can also be used as a screening tool to identify people that had COVID-19 asymptomatically, thus getting a better estimate of the true spread of the disease, gain important insights on disease severity, and to better evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures implemented to combat the pandemic. But the usefulness of these tests depends not only on the quality of the test but also, critically, on how far disease has already spread in the population. For example, when only very few people in a population are infected, a positive test result has a high chance of being a false positive. As a consequence, the spread of the disease in a population as well as individuals immunity status may be systematically misinterpreted. SARS-COV-2 infection rates vary greatly across both time and space. In many places, the infection rates are very low but can quickly skyrocket when the virus spreads unchecked. Here, we present two tools, natural frequency trees and positive and negative predictive value graphs, that allow one to assess the usefulness of antibody testing for a specific context at a glance.

The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it naturally turns the K-means local search into global one through the process of decomposition of the minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC) problem. On one hand, decomposition of the MSSC problem into smaller subproblems reduces the computational complexity and allows for their parallel processing. On the other hand, the MSSC decomposition provides a new method for the natural data-driven shaking of the incumbent solution while introducing a new neighborhood structure for the solution of the MSSC problem. The proposed algorithm is scalable, fast, and accurate. The scalability of the algorithm can be easily adjusted by choosing the appropriate number of subproblems and their size.

Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas? e601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: In total, 3,156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts.

Limited data exist on otolaryngology manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatrics. This study aims to discuss the clinical features of COVID-19 in pediatrics, with an emphasis on otolaryngology manifestations. METHODS: The study included 660 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed positive pediatric patients (aged 3-15 years) diagnosed at King Abdullah Specialist Children Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data were retrospectively retrieved from January to July 2020 from electronic medical records and included patients' epidemiological and clinical features. Patients were then followed-up via phone calls to document any symptoms encountered after the first visit. Patients were categorized into three main groups according to age (3-6 years, 7-10 years, 11-15 years). RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients (43.6%) had asymptomatic infections. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported manifestations accounting for 39.2% and 19.8%, respectively. The most frequently reported otolaryngology symptoms were sore throat (17.3%) and rhinorrhea (14.4%). Moreover, 10.4% and 13.1% of children aged 7-15 years old experienced smell and taste disturbances, respectively. Older children (11-15 years) were more likely to report taste disturbances when compared to the younger children (17.2% vs 9.8%, p-value 0.02). Children aged between 3 and 6 years had significantly higher rates of admission (13.7%) and mortality (0.9%) when compared to the older groups (p-value 0.00).

Designing these tests for broad, long-term detection was complicated by limited information about the novel virus' genome sequence and how it might mutate during global spread and adaptation to humans. METHODS: We assessed eight widely adopted lab developed PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 against 15,001 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Using a custom bioinformatic pipeline called PCR_strainer, we identified all mismatches and sequence variants in genome locations targeted by 15 sets of primer/probe oligonucleotides from these assays. RESULTS: For 12 out of 15 primer/probe sets, over 98 % of SARS-CoV-2 genomes had no mismatches. Two primer/probe sets contained a single mismatch in the reverse primer that was present in over 99 % of genomes. One primer/probe set targeted a location with extensive polymorphisms with 23 sequence observed variants at the forward primer location. One of these variants, which contains three nucleotide mismatches, arose in February as part of the emergence of a viral clade and was present in 18.8 % of the genomes we analyzed. DISCUSSION: Most early PCR diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 remain inclusive of circulating viral diversity, but three assays with extensive mismatches highlight assay design challenges for novel pathogens and provide valuable lessons for PCR assay design during future outbreaks.

In addition, advances in digital technologies provide new opportunities to address limitations of drug-based treatments, such as medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, drug resistance, drug shortages, affordability, and accessibility. Pharmaceutical drugs and biologics can be combined with digital health technologies, including mobile medical apps (digital therapeutics), which offer additional clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness. Promises of drug+digital combination therapies are recognized by pharmaceutical and digital health companies, opening opportunities for integrating pharmacotherapies with non-pharmacological interventions (metapharmacology). Herein we present unique features of digital health technologies which can deliver personalized self-care modalities such as breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga, physical activity, adequate sleep, listening to preferred music, forgiveness and gratitude. Clinical studies reveal how aforementioned complimentary practices may support treatments of epilepsy, chronic pain, depression, cancer, and other chronic diseases. This article also describes how digital therapies delivering \\"medicinal\\" self-care and other non-pharmacological interventions can also be personalized by accounting for: 1) genetic risks for comorbidities, 2) adverse childhood experiences, 3) increased risks for viral infections such as seasonal influenza, or COVID-19, and 4) just-in-time stressful and traumatic circumstances. Development and implementation of personalized pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies (precision metapharmacology) require aligning priorities of key stakeholders including patients, research communities, healthcare industry, regulatory and funding agencies. In conclusion, digital technologies enable integration of pharmacotherapies with self-care, lifestyle interventions and patient empowerment, while concurrently advancing patient-centered care, integrative medicine and digital health ecosystems.","output":"From Precision Metapharmacology to Patient Empowerment: Delivery of Self-Care Practices for Epilepsy, Pain, Depression and Cancer Using Digital Health Technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite growing evidence that COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting communities of color, state-reported racial/ethnic data are insufficient to measure the true impact.We found that between April 12, 2020, and November 9, 2020, the number of US states reporting COVID-19 confirmed cases by race and ethnicity increased from 25 to 50 and 15 to 46, respectively.

COVID\\\\19 detection is a difficult task that necessitates the use of intelligent diagnosis algorithms. Numerous studies have suggested the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to detect COVID\\\\19 infection in patients through chest X\\\\ray image analysis. The use of medical imaging with different modalities for COVID\\\\19 detection has become an important means of containing the spread of this disease. However, medical images are not sufficiently adequate for routine clinical use; there is, therefore, an increasing need for AI to be applied to improve the diagnostic performance of medical image analysis. Regrettably, due to the evolving nature of the COVID\\\\19 global epidemic, the systematic collection of a large data set for deep neural network (DNN)/ML training is problematic. Inspired by these studies, and to aid in the medical diagnosis and control of this contagious disease, we suggest a novel approach that ensembles the feature selection capability of the optimized artificial immune networks (opt\\\\aiNet) algorithm with deep learning (DL) and ML techniques for better prediction of the disease. In this article, we experimented with a DNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long\\\\short\\\\term memory, a support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression for the effective detection of COVID\\\\19 in patients. We illustrate the effectiveness of this proposed technique by using COVID\\\\19 image datasets with a variety of modalities. An empirical study using the COVID\\\\19 image dataset demonstrates that the proposed hybrid approaches, named COVID\\\\opt\\\\aiNet, improve classification accuracy by up to 98%C99% for SVM, 96%C97% for DNN, and 70.85%C71% for CNN, to name a few examples.

Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP. Patients and Methods: Patients &#8805;18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed. Results: CCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex.

The main causes of sHLH are infections and hematological malignancies, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite new insights into the pathogenesis of HLH, the diagnosis and treatment of this immune disorder remain a great challenge. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a young adult without comorbidities whose clinical course was nonspecific for several months and resulted in late diagnosis of HLH secondary to peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). The etiological factor of recurring fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and deteriorating condition was unidentified for a long time before fatal sHLH was finally diagnosed. The patient was treated according to the HLH-2004 protocol; however, he did not achieve any response. Unfortunately, due to nonspecific symptoms, lack of lymphadenopathy for a long time, and negative positron emission tomography results, the diagnosis of PTCL was established only after the patients death. CONCLUSIONS: It should be emphasized that early diagnosis is crucial for better prognosis of patients with sHLH. Bone marrow biopsy is worth considering in patients with prolonged fever of unknown origin, hyperferritinemia, splenomegaly, and unexplained cytopenia of 2 or more lineages. Despite the existence of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols available in the literature, the prompt diagnosis and treatment of HLH remains a great challenge.

Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) served as a model for inflammatory pain. The CFA injection decreased the thermal thresholds in both sexes but only the male mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior and diminished cognition, while the females were not affected. Increased calcium fluorescence, a marker for neuronal activity, was detected by photometry in the mPFC of males but not in females with CFA. Next, while chemogenetic inhibition of the projections from the mPFC to the LC improved the object recognition memory of males with pain, the inhibition of the mPFC to LC pathway in female mice produced anxiolysis and spatial memory deficits. The behavior results prompted us to compare the reciprocal innervation of mPFC and LC between the sexes. We used an anterograde transsynaptic tagging technique, which relies on postsynaptic cre transfer, to assess the innervation of LC by mPFC efferents. The males showed a higher rate of postsynaptic cre transfer into LC neurons from mPFC efferents than the females. And vice versa, a retrograde tracing experiment demonstrated that LC to mPFC projection neurons were more numerous in females when compared to males. In conclusion, we provide evidence that subtle differences in the reciprocal neuronal circuit between the LC and mPFC may contribute to sex differences associated with the adverse cognitive effects of inflammatory pain.","output":"The role of medial prefrontal cortex projections to locus ceruleus in mediating the sex differences in behavior in mice with inflammatory pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the progress of population aging in China, the proportion of elderly population is increasing.

Cholesterol in the host cell plasma membrane plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into cells. Serum lipids, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), are in constant interaction with the lipid rafts in the host cell membranes and can modify the interaction of virus with host cells and the resultant disease severity. Recent studies on serum lipid levels and COVID-19 disease severity lack consistency. OBJECTIVES: Our systematic review and meta-analysis compared the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides (TG) between (1) COVID-19 patients vs. healthy controls; (2) severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 disease; (3) deceased vs. surviving COVID-19 patients. METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We included peer-reviewed articles on observational (case-control and cohort) studies from PubMed and Embase published from the database inception until September 1, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for pooled mean-differences (pMD) in lipid levels (mg/dL) for the above groups. RESULTS: Among 441 articles identified, 29 articles (26 retrospective and 3 prospective cohorts), with an aggregate of 256,721 participants, were included.

Based on the results of a survey administered to a sample of 700 Italian tourists, this paper aims to acquire an empirical understanding of key challenges for the travel and tourismsector in the coming months and the possible responses of tourist cities. Design/methodology/approach - To study tourism after the pandemic, OUT (University of Naples Tourism Research Center) has created an online survey to answer the following questions: What will tourism be like after the pandemic?What will the main changes in travel behaviors be?What role will new information technologies play in future tourism? Are there territorial differences based on the spread of the virus? Findings - The pandemic has inevitably affected everyone's tourist choices, regardless of how much their specific area of residence has been impacted by the virus. Consequently, it will significantly influence travelers' experiences. The Italian tourists who were survey respondents are aware that physical distancing rules will probably remain in effect for an extended time and, therefore, they cannot imagine future tourism not conditioned by these measures. This does not mean that Italians will give up tourism in the short-medium term, however. Indeed, the research data highlight the resilient character of tourism in that it is transformed but does not cease to exist. Originality/value - By studying the future through a sociological approach, it is possible to identify how the COVID-19 emergency will impact tourism and how both the form and social meaning of mobility will be conditioned. On the basis of the data, the analysis will be directed from the present to the post-pandemic horizon, hypothesizing possible scenarios for the future of tourism and providing some possible policy indications.","output":"Post-pandemic tourism resilience: changes in Italians' travel behavior and the possible responses of tourist cities.

Based on such signal-off trend, the proposed genosensor exhibited a good linear response to SARS-CoV-2 RdRP in the concentration range 1.0 pM-8.0 nM with a regression equation I (A) = - 6.555 log [RdRP sequence] (pM) + 32.676 (R2 = 0.995) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 pM. The standard addition method with different spike concentrations of RdRP sequence in human sputum samples showed a good recovery for real sample analysis (> 95%). Therefore, the developed voltammetric genosensor can be used to determine SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequence in sputum samples. PAMAM-functionalized SiQDs were used as a versatile electrochemical platform for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP detection based on a signal off sensing strategy. In this study, for the first time, the silver ions (Ag+) in the hexathia-18-crown-6 carrier were applied as an electrochemical probe.","output":"A nanoscale genosensor for early detection of COVID-19 by voltammetric determination of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on upper respiratory tract (URT) samples is the primary method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections and guide public health measures, with a supportive role for serology.

In the present study, Bayesian statistical modeling was used to retrospectively determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2 serology in 644 COVID-19-suspected patients with varying degrees of disease severity and duration. The sensitivity of RT-PCR ranged between 79-95%; while increasing with disease severity, it decreased rapidly over time in mild COVID-19 cases.

There is a need for customizable rehabilitation approaches that can flexibly target different aspects of gait asymmetry with minimal need for specialized equipment. Here, we studied how simple within-stride changes in treadmill speed could drive selective, predictable changes in human gait symmetry. Methods In Experiment 1, ten healthy young adults walked on an instrumented treadmill with and without a closed-loop controller engaged. The controller changed the treadmill speed to 1.50 m/s or 0.75 m/s depending on whether the right or left leg generated propulsive (i.e., forward-directed) ground reaction forces, respectively. In Experiment 2, a separate group of ten healthy young adults walked on the treadmill with and without an open-loop controller engaged. This controller changed the treadmill speed to 1.50 m/s or 0.75 at a prescribed time interval. We used a metronome to guide the participants to step at a series of different time points relative to the controller-driven speed change. We collected kinematic and kinetic data in Experiments 1 and 2. Results In Experiment 1, participants walked with asymmetric kinematics and ground reaction forces when the closed-loop controller was engaged. The leg that accelerated during propulsion (right leg) showed a smaller leading limb angle and a larger trailing limb angle than the leg that decelerated during propulsion (left leg). The right leg also generated smaller propulsive forces than the left leg. In Experiment 2, the patterns of asymmetry in spatiotemporal gait parameters, kinematics, and ground reaction forces depended on the timing of the speed change within the gait cycle. Step times, leading limb angles, and peak propulsion became asymmetric when the treadmill speed changed early in stance. When the treadmill speed changed later in stance, step lengths, step times, and propulsion impulses became asymmetric. Conclusions Simple manipulations of treadmill speed can drive predictable, selective changes in human gait symmetry. Future work will explore this customizable technique as a potential approach for restoring gait symmetry in clinical populations.","output":"Simple within-stride changes in treadmill speed can drive selective changes in human gait symmetry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a significant threat to global health. While respiratory aerosols or droplets are considered as the main route of human-to-human transmission, secretions expelled by infected individuals can also contaminate surfaces and objects, potentially creating the risk of fomite-based transmission. Consequently, frequently touched objects such as paper currency and coins have been suspected as a potential transmission vehicle. To assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by banknotes and coins, we examined the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), as surrogate with lower biosafety restrictions, on these different means of payment and developed a touch transfer method to examine transfer efficiency from contaminated surfaces to skin. Although we observed prolonged virus stability, our results, including a novel touch transfer method, indicate that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via contaminated coins and banknotes is unlikely and requires high viral loads and a timely order of specific events.","output":"A realistic touch-transfer method reveals low risk of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 by contaminated coins and bank notes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The optimal head position for GlideScope facilitated nasotracheal intubation has not yet been determined.

Despite the numerous studies of PGRs' post-arrival experiences, there is a major dearth of research into their pre-arrival, application experiences. Given the worldwide competition for high calibre PGRs, along with impact posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and by Brexit for the UK, it is vital for universities to ensure that factors clearly under their control, such as the information on their websites and the way they communicate, are as informative and helpful as possible. In this article, we draw on social media data to examine the challenges and uncertainties that Korean PGR applicants experienced in navigating the process of applying to UK universities. The paper compares their confusions with information available on university websites and recommends a series of points that higher education institutions should check for. It also reveals and discusses issues associated with communication. While the data has been collected from Korean social media websites, we argue that our paper has broader relevance for the following reasons. First, the same fundamental intercultural issues-different educational systems and different background knowledge-apply to PGR applicants from other countries and so their queries are likely to be similar or comparable. Second, the insights gained from social media websites to facilitate the application process and thereby enhance recruitment can usefully be applied to other countries and levels of study, in a way that has rarely been done to date.","output":"Enhancing the recruitment of postgraduate researchers from diverse countries: managing the application process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has represented a major impact to health systems and societies worldwide.

As the core of tissue repair, seed cells are widely used in various fields of regenerative medicine. However, their use is still associated with problems such as decreased cell survival and regeneration capacity after transplantation, immune rejection, and ethical concerns. Therefore, it is difficult to universally and safely apply stem cell banks for regenerative medicine. The paracrine effects of cells, especially secretion of exosomes, play vital roles in cell communication, immune response, angiogenesis, scar formation, tissue repair, and other biological functions. Exosomes are a type of nanoscale extracellular vesicle that contain biologically active molecules such as RNA and proteins; therefore, exosomes can replicate the functions of their parental cells. Meanwhile, exosomes can be used as nanocarriers to deliver active factors or small molecules to promote tissue repair. Preclinical studies of exosomes in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have been carried in the fields of bone/cartilage repair, nerve regeneration, liver and kidney regeneration, skin repair, vascular tissue regeneration, etc. This review introduces exosomes from the aspects of biogenesis, composition, identification, and isolation, and focuses on the development status of scaffold materials for exosome delivery.

Measures to limit the spread of the virus were implemented, including complete lockdown (26 March). Nonetheless, the virus spread throughout the country, with a first peak of almost a million cases in October. On 30 November, the governments recommendation switched from social, preventive and compulsory isolation, to social, preventive and compulsory distancing. OBJECTIVES: To describe a tailored public health strategy to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and determine its behaviour in San Antonio de Areco district from Buenos Aires province (Argentina) through a privateCpublic association. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Surveillance of the virus was performed with the local healthcare system, through early identification of cases and the systematic study of each infected individual and contact, regardless of symptomatology, using telemedicine and a COVID-19-specific outpatient clinic. Real-time PCR was used for detection using both individual and pooled samples, with a 12-hour turnaround time. RESULTS: Up to 30 November, a total of 2426 suspected cases were analysed and 578 were confirmed. Surveillance of health personnel and at-risk populations proved effective, mitigating viral spread. Pooling samples allowed reduction of operator time, helped reduce costs, and allowed detection of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: After 8 months of protocol implementation, the strategy to intensively survey groups at higher epidemiological risk and the systematic search for asymptomatic cases with the incorporation of pooled PCR for diagnosis, in combination with individual testing, is an efficient and viable option in populations with similar characteristics, in the frame of social isolation.","output":"Impact of a public health intervention for active surveillance and mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 in a district from Buenos Aires province, Argentina: a descriptive epidemiological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic ongoing since January 2020 , caused so far 95 million cases and 2 million deaths worldwide [1].

We analysed complications of Tenckhoff insertion, specifically infection and the formation of hernias requiring operative management. RESULTS Infections noted in our patients included peritonitis (10%) and exit-site infection (5%). Of the five patients who required re-insertion of Tenckhoff catheter, four were for infective complications. A total of seven hernias developed in five (8%) of patients, mostly inguinal or umbilical near the Hassan port entry site. DISCUSSION With infection and hernia formation being the main contributors to failure of the procedure, actively addressing the entry site and areas predisposed to hernia formation, observing aseptic technique and meticulous attention to early signs of complications during follow-up are vital to improve success rates.

Originally this forum had 1 major role-education. The MMC evolved and a second key role was added: quality improvement. In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, a second evolution-one that will humanize the MMC-is required. The pandemic emphasizes the need to use MMCs not only as a place to discuss errors but also as a place for medical providers to reflect on lives lost. The authors' review of the literature regarding MMCs indicates that most studies focus on enabling MMCs to become a forum for quality improvement, while none have emphasized the need to humanize MMCs to decrease medical provider burnout and improve patient satisfaction. Permitting clinicians to be human on the job requires restructuring the MMC to provide a space for reflection and, ultimately, defining a new purpose and charge for the MMC. The authors have 3 main recommendations. First, principles of humanism such as compassion, empathy, and respect, in particular, should be incorporated into traditional MMCs. Second, shorter gatherings devoted to giving clinicians the opportunity to focus on their humanity could be arranged. Third, an MMC focused entirely on the human aspects of medical care could be periodically arranged to provide an outlet for storytelling, artistic expression, and reflection. Humanizing the MMC-a core symposium in clinical medicine worldwide-could be the first step in revitalizing the spirit at the heart of medicine, one dedicated to health and healing.

METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter, descriptive study included 83 patients with CRS from three hospitals in Wuhan. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients with CRS, the fatality rate was even higher in CRRT group (P=0.005). However, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, neutrophil counts, and D-dimer decreased after CRRT (P<0.05). Results of Lasso model showed that tracheotomy (? -1.31) and convalescent plasma (? -1.41) were the protective factors.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 actively replicates in the throat, unlike SARS-CoV, and shows high pharyngeal viral shedding even in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. HCoV-229E is one of four coronaviruses causing the common cold. In this study, the efficacy of ColdZyme? (CZ-MD), a medical device mouth spray, was tested against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. The CZ-MD provides a protective glycerol barrier containing cod trypsin as an ancillary component. Combined, these ingredients can inactivate common cold viruses in the throat and mouth. The CZ-MD is believed to act on the viral surface proteins that would perturb their entry pathway into cells. The efficacy and safety of the CZ-MD have been demonstrated in clinical trials on the common cold.

In the 21st century, the necessary technologies for this exist. The gap in technological capacity reflects the existence of a technological gradient between large- and small-scale production, due to an absence of incentives for innovation and a lack of technological dissemination in small businesses and communities. Technological change is central to development, but it is a public good that the market economy does not provide efficiently. Providing it requires the implementation of public policies aimed at technological innovation and dissemination. Reducing the technological gradient is therefore a major part of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Pan American Health Organizations 2018-2030 Sustainable Health Agenda for the Americas. This also applies to the development of health systems, which function as a redistribution mechanism to break poverty traps.

METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of ESCC patients who were judged to be ycN-RLN(-) following nCRT. Patients were divided into two groups according to the extent of LND [standard two-field LND (STL group) versus total two-field LND (TTL group)]. Only lower mediastinal and upper abdominal lymph nodes were removed in the STL group. In addition to the standard procedure, patients in the TTL group underwent resection of upper mediastinal lymph nodes located along the bilateral RLN. Using propensity score matching, 29 pairs were identified and compared with regard to perioperative complications, lymph-node metastases rates, overall survival (OS), and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS: No significant intergroup differences were identified in terms of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Metastases to the RLN lymph nodes were identified in 20.7% (6/29) of TTL patients, being the only site of lymph-node metastases in three of them. TTL was associated with lower upper mediastinal lymph-node recurrence rate (6.5%) compared with STL (21.5%, p = 0.134), although the overall recurrence rate was similar (STL, 44.8% versus TTL, 46.4%). No significant intergroup differences were also evident with regard to 3-year DSS and OS rates. CONCLUSIONS: RLN LND can be safely performed in ESCC patients who had undergone nCRT, ultimately resulting in an improved local control, and should be practiced as part of the surgical routine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19 at our center were evaluated for clinical presentation and outcome; duration of viral shedding and viral burden by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay cycle threshold; and magnitude of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Six KTRs identified with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms were similar to those in the general population. Four patients had severe disease and, of these, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 4 had acute kidney injury, and 3 had secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. Five patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. No patient required dialysis or died. Patients with severe disease had a longer duration of viral shedding, which lasted more than 40 days, and had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which were detected from 3 weeks to as long as 10 weeks after symptom onset. In patients with less severe disease no IgG antibodies where detected between 9 and 14 weeks after symptom onset.

The factors associated with the outcome of COVID-19 have not been completely characterized to date.

It is possible to develop such an alternative vaccine by using nano- or microparticle platforms. These platforms address most of the existing vaccine limitations as they are stable at room temperature, are inexpensive to produce and distribute, can be administered orally, and do not require cold chain storage for transportation or preservation. Particulate vaccines can be administered as either oral solutions or in sublingual or buccal film dosage forms. Besides improved patient compliance, the major advantage of oral, sublingual, and buccal routes of administration is that they can elicit mucosal immunity.

In particular, if has also affected the training of dental residents, who are specialists in training. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, perception and attitude of dental residents in Nigeria to the pandemic and its perceived impact on the dental residency training programme across the country. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of dental residents in teaching hospitals across Nigeria. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to consenting participants through an online data collection platform (Google forms), between April and June 2020. Data were collected on sociodemographics, knowledge and awareness of coronavirus as well as impact of the pandemic. Data analysis was carried out with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Level of significance was set at p-value < .05. RESULTS: A total of 104 dental residents participated in the study from ten residency training institutions in the country with a mean age of 35.65  4.8 years. Almost all 98 (94.2%) of the residents showed a good knowledge of COVID 19. About two-thirds, 72 (69.2%) of the participants were mostly worried about COVID-19 affecting their residency training program 72 (69.2%), with their greatest source of worry being the risk of contracting the virus in the dental clinic. CONCLUSION: The dental residents had a very good knowledge of the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and majority of them felt that it would affect their training residency programme.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and dental residency training in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of war, the right to speak freely is often the first casualty. As global leaders have come to use the language of war to describe their efforts to stop COVID-19, it leads to natural questions on the extent to which freedom of expression might be compromised in order to protect public health. In particular, governments around the world have enacted new policies targeting misinformation as the pandemic has spread, or increased enforcement of existing rules. While the World Health Organization has warned of an infodemic of fake news which spreads faster and more easily than this virus, human rights mechanisms have expressed alarm at the impacts of the accompanying crackdown on freedom of expression. This paper discusses the global human rights implications of aggressive measures targeting the spread of COVID-19-related misinformation. Part I discusses the international human rights standards with regard to misinformation. Part II explores various regulatory responses to misinformation amongst COVID-19 thus showing the impact on international human rights. Part III explores the applicability of international human rights law, specifically the standards for derogation in key human rights documents, to the current exceptional circumstances of COVID-19. Part VI asses the measures against international human rights standards, finding significant cause for concern, particularly if these enforcement postures become normalized. Part V offers alternative solutions to the human rights challenges posed by health misinformation, particularly restrictions which are more carefully targeted and less open to abuse as well as transparency measures to promote trust and accountability in public institutions. Part VI concludes.","output":"Even in a Pandemic, Sunlight is the Best Disinfectant: COVID-19 and Global Freedom of Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salah satu faktor yang diperlukan untuk menekan angka kasus COVID-19 adalah tingginya perhatian atau atensi masyarakat.

We validated the proposed method in 12 human disease datasets and performed an in-depth study of patients with mild and severe symptomatology of the coronavirus disease 2019 for predicting novel therapeutic targets. As a result, we identified the extracellular matrix protein versican and Toll-like receptor 2 as potential targets for modulating the inflammatory response.

Participants received two intramuscular (IM) injections of LNP-nCoVsaRNA at six different dose levels, 01-100mg, given four weeks apart. An open-label dose escalation was followed by a dose evaluation. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for one week from enrolment, with follow-up at regular intervals (1-8 weeks). The binding and neutralisation capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody raised in participant sera was measured by means of an anti-Spike (S) IgG ELISA, immunoblot, SARS-CoV-2 pseudoneutralisation and wild type neutralisation assays.Findings: 192 healthy individuals with no history or serological evidence of COVID-19, aged 18-45 years were enrolled. The vaccine was well tolerated with no serious adverse events related to vaccination. Seroconversion at week six whether measured by ELISA or immunoblot was related to dose (both p<0001), ranging from 8% to 61% in ELISA and 46% to 87% in the immunoblot assay.Concurrent anti-S IgG ranged from GM concentration (95% CI) 74 (45-119) at 01mg to 1023 (468-2236) ng/ml at 50mg (p<0001) and was not higher at 100mg.

Data on which vaccines offer the most robust protection over time, and which patients are most vulnerable to attenuating protection, could help inform potential booster programmes. In this study, we used comprehensive hospitalisation data to estimate vaccine effectiveness over time. METHODS: In this case-control study, we used data from a large US health-care system to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and examined variation based on time since vaccination, vaccine type, and patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared trends in attenuation of protection across vaccines and used a multivariable model to identify key factors associated with risk for severe breakthrough infection. Patients were considered to have severe COVID-19 if they were admitted to the hospital, had a final coded diagnosis of COVID-19 (according to International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision code U07.1) or a positive nucleic acid amplification test for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 during their hospitalisation, and were treated with remdesivir or dexamethasone during hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2021, and Oct 26, 2021, we observed 9667 admissions for severe COVID-19 (ie, cases). Overall, 1293 (134%) of 9667 cases were fully vaccinated at the time of admission, compared with 22 308 (577%) of 38 668 controls, who were admitted to hospital for other reasons. The median time between vaccination and hospital admission among cases was 162 days (IQR 118C198). Overall vaccine effectiveness declined mostly over the course of the summer, from 945% (95% CI 914C965) in April, 2021 (pre-delta), to 840% (816C861) by October, 2021. Notably, vaccine effectiveness declined over time, from 940% (95% CI 928C950) at days 50C100 after vaccination to 804% (778C827) by days 200C250 after vaccination. After 250 days, vaccine effectiveness declines were even more notable. Among those who received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, vaccine effectiveness fell from an initial peak of 949% (932C962) to 741% (696C779) by days 200C250 after vaccination. Protection from the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and Ad26.COV2 (Janssen) vaccines declined less over time, although the latter offered lower overall protection. Holding other factors constant, the risk of severe breakthrough infection was most strongly associated with age older than 80 years (adjusted odds ratio 176, 95% CI 143C215), vaccine type (Pfizer 139, 098C197; Janssen 1453, 843C2503; both relative to Moderna), time since vaccination (105, 103C107; per week after week 8 when protection peaks, technically), and comorbidities including organ transplantation (344, 95% CI 212C557), cancer (193, 160C233), and immunodeficiency (149, 113C196). INTERPRETATION: Vaccination remains highly effective against hospitalisation, but vaccine effectiveness declined after 200 days, particularly for older patients or those with specific comorbidities. Additional protection (eg, a booster vaccination) might be warranted for everyone, but especially for these populations. In addition to promoting general vaccine uptake, clinicians and policy makers should consider prioritising booster vaccinations in those most at risk of severe COVID-19.

Seven of the isolates belonged to the A2a clade, while one belonged to the B4 clade. Specific mutations, characteristic of the A2a clade, were also detected, which included the P323L in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and D614G in the Spike glycoprotein. Further, our data revealed emergence of novel subclones harbouring nonsynonymous mutations, viz. G1124V in Spike (S) protein, R203K, and G204R in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region involved in viral capsid formation and the S protein mutation is in the S2 domain, which is involved in triggering viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Interesting correlation was observed between these mutations and travel or contact history of COVID-19 positive cases. Consequent alterations of miRNA binding and structure were also predicted for these mutations. More importantly, the possible implications of mutation D614G (in SD domain) and G1124V (in S2 subunit) on the structural stability of S protein have also been discussed.

Due to the limited medical resources in these areas an alternative accessible technology is needed. The iBreast Exam (iBE) is a point-of-care electronic palpitation device that has a reported sensitivity of 86%. However, little is known about the performance and acceptability of this device for women in the Pacific. METHODS A total of 39 women (ages 42-73 years) were recruited in Guam with 19 women having a mammogram requiring biopsy (BI-RADS category 4 or above) and 20 women with a negative screening mammogram before study visit. Participants received an iBE exam and completed a 26-item breast health questionnaire to evaluate the iBE. Furthermore, the performance characteristics of the iBE were tested using gelatin breast phantoms in terms of tumor size, tumor depth, and overall breast stiffness. RESULTS The iBE had a sensitivity of 20% (2 true positives to 8 false negatives) and specificity of 92% (24 false positives to 278 true negatives) when analyzed based on location of tumor by quadrant. The iBE also had generally poor agreement according to a Cohen's kappa value of 0.068. The phantom experiments showed that the iBE can detect tumors as deep as 2.5cm, but only if the lesion is greater than 8mm in diameter. However, the iBE did demonstrate acceptability; 67% of the women reported that they had high trust in iBE as an early detection device. CONCLUSIONS The iBE had generally poor sensitivity and specificity when tested in a clinical setting which does not allow its use as a screening tool.

Many people have migrated to the state from different countries as well as other states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to analyse the receptor-binding domain (RBD) sequence of the spike protein from isolates collected from throat swab samples of COVID-19-positive patients and further to assess the RBD affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of different species, including humans. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19-positive patients was performed by ARTIC amplicon-based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis were performed for the spike region and the RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 of five different species was also analysed. RESULTS: The spike region of 32 isolates showed one or multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison with the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutations, at position 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C), in the RBD coding region of the spike protein showed stronger binding affinity for human ACE2. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates showed binding affinity for ACE2 of different species. CONCLUSION: As mutant RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The binding affinity of the RBDs for ACE2 of all five species studied suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals, which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Sequence analysis of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates shows a stronger interaction of mutant receptor-binding domain with ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients at high-risk of poor prognosis is crucial.

Despite the potential mental health related impact of this psychological phenomenon, there are currently no measures available that are designed to evaluate the extent to which individuals become fearful of these everyday situations during a respiratory viral pandemic. Here, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS) questionnaire across two samples recruited online (ns = 243, 341) recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the ARVIS is best described by a single factor and shows a high reliability (Chronbachs alpha >.88). It showed convergent associations with state anxiety and low discriminant associations with general trait anxiety and depression. Moreover, the ARVIS was highly associated with the extent to which subjects reported engaging in handwashing and social distancing, demonstrating criterion validity.

The present study aimed to explore the effect of miR-223-3p on inflammation and autophagy in fungal keratitis (FK). METHODS: An FK mouse model was established, and primary corneal stromal cells were isolated by inoculation with Fusarium solani. The expression of miR-223-3p was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Subsequently, the target gene of miR-223-3p was identified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The levels of miR-223-3p were altered by transfecting miR agomir/antagomir to evaluate its effects. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and hematoxylin and eosin staining were employed to detect corneal damage. The levels of autophagy were assessed by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy. In addition, inflammation was demonstrated by determining the proinflammatory mediators IL-1 and TNF-. RESULTS: Our data suggested that miR-223-3p was increased and that autophagic flux was impaired in mouse FK. Then, we confirmed that autophagy-related gene 16L1 (ATG16L1) was a potential target of miR-223-3p and that this miR negatively regulated the expression of ATG16L1. The inhibition of miR-223-3p attenuated inflammation in FK, reduced P62 expression, and increased the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, whereas the overexpression of miR-223-3p displayed the opposite results. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, miR-223-3p might regulate autophagy via targeting ATG16L1 in experimental F. solani keratitis and is associated with the inflammatory response.

Asthma is one such condition, which may be exacerbated by both prolonged adverse in-home exposures if quarantining in unhealthy homes and prolonged outdoor exposures if the ambient air quality is unhealthy or hazardous. As both are often the case in Environmental Justice (EJ) communities, here we have analyzed data at the census tract (CT) level for Louisiana to assess any correlation between social and environmental vulnerability, and health issues like COVID-19 and asthma. Higher Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Particulate Matter less than 2.5 m in diameter (PM(2.5)) and Ozone levels were associated with higher rates of cumulative COVID-19 incidence at various time points during the pandemic, as well as higher average annual asthma hospitalization rates and estimated asthma prevalence. Further, cumulative COVID-19 incidence during the first three months of the pandemic was moderately correlated with both asthma hospitalizations and estimated prevalence, suggesting similar underlying factors may be affecting both conditions. Additionally, 137 CTs were identified where social and environmental vulnerabilities co-existed, of which 75 (55%) had high estimated prevalence of asthma. These areas are likely to benefit from asthma outreach that considers both social and environmental risk factors. Fifteen out of the 137 CTs (11%) not only had higher estimated prevalence of asthma but also a high burden of COVID-19. Further research in these areas may help to elucidate any common social determinants of health that underlie both asthma and COVID-19 burdens, as well as better clarify the possible role of the environment as related to the COVID-19 burden in Louisiana.","output":"Identifying Louisiana communities at the crossroads of environmental and social vulnerability, COVID-19, and asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to its borderless nature, COVID-19 is a matter of common European interest since its very first detection on the continent Yet this pandemic outbreak has largely been handled as an essentially national matter This article makes a first attempt at unpacking how such a fragmented, uncoordinated but ultimately converging national responses to COVID19 came into being under the EU legal order","output":"The European response to COVID19.

The many risks to the wellbeing of HCWs are not well understood. Of the literature, there is a paucity of information around how to best prevent psychological distress, and what steps are needed to mitigate harm to HCWs' wellbeing. Methods: A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was used to investigate the psychological impact on HCWs facing epidemics or pandemics, using three electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL), dating back to 2002 until the 21st of August 2020. The search strategy included terms for HCWs (e.g., nurse and doctor), mental health (e.g., wellbeing and psychological), and viral outbreaks (e.g., epidemic and pandemic). Only studies with greater than 100 frontline HCWs (i.e. doctors or nurses in close proximity to infected patients) were included. Results: A total of 55 studies were included, with 53 using quantitative methodology and 2 were qualitative. 50 of the quantitative studies used validated measurement tools while 5 used novel questionnaires. The studies were conducted across various countries and included people with SARS (13 studies), Ebola (1), MERS (3) and COVID-19 (38). Findings suggest that the psychological implications to HCWs are variable with several studies demonstrating an increased risk of acquiring a trauma or stress-related disorders, depression and anxiety. Fear of the unknown or becoming infected were at the forefront of the mental challenges faced. Being a nurse and being female appeared to confer greater risk. In past epidemics, the perceived stigma from family members and society heightened negative implications; predominantly stress and isolation. Coping strategies varied amongst the contrasting sociocultural settings and appeared to differ amongst doctors, nurses and other HCWs. Implemented changes, and suggestions for prevention in the future consistently highlighted the need for greater psychosocial support and clearer dissemination of disease-related information. Conclusion: This review can inform current and future research priorities in the maintenance of wellbeing amongst frontline HCWs. Change needs to start at the level of policy-makers to offer an enhanced variety of supports to HCWs who play a critical role during largescale disease outbreaks. Psychological implications are largely negative and require greater attention to be mitigated, potentially through the involvement of psychologists, raised awareness and better education. The current knowledge of therapeutic interventions suggests they could be beneficial but more long-term follow-up is needed.","output":"The psychological impact of COVID-19 and other viral epidemics on frontline healthcare workers and ways to address it: A rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Samsung Electronics and Microsoft Corporation have been developing open source implementation of NET platform called NET Core since 2016 This platform is usually used for implementation of server-side and desktop applications, and Samsung has also adopted NET Core virtual machine and libraries for Tizen OS This solution was integrated into various ARM CPU based devices e g smart watches, TVs and other electronic devices Tizen has always supported variety of languages and SDKs for developers NET has greatly expanded this variety by supporting new tools and new languages This paper describes major challenges that we have encountered during integration of NET to Tizen OS as well as optimizations, which were applied to NET Core to make applications startup and memory consumption better on variety of devices","output":".NET Runtime and Tools for Tizen Operating System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) comprises a single layer of endothelial cells and maintains a safe and homeostatic environment for proper neuronal function and synaptic transmission. BBB is not a discrete physical barrier, but a complex, dynamic, and adaptable interface. BBB continues to mature under the influence of the neural environment within a short period of time after birth. However, the basic mechanism of BBB formation and maintenance remains a mystery. Early studies have identified two structural characteristics of microvascular endothelium: special tight junctions (TJs) and a very low transcellular vesicle transport rate. Previous studies believed that BBB damage was mainly due to the destruction of tight junctions, and the role of vesicle transcytosis was neglected, so there was a lack of research on its impact on blood-brain barrier. It is urgent to get a better clarification of the unique structural and functional characteristics of the BBB endothelium to explain the role of BBB injury in neurological diseases. RNA sequencing was used to study the molecular characterization of cerebral cortex vascular endothelium by isolating them from neonatal, adolescent and adult rats. For investigation the maintenance mechanism of the BBB, we focused on the cellular and molecular regulation of barrier formation and the two characteristics of microvascular endothelial cells. Interestingly, we found that during the development of the blood-brain barrier, although the tight junctions gradually mature, endothelial cell transcytosis is gradually enhanced, resulting in an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. This study suggested that under physiological conditions, low vesicle transport is playing an important role in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. This study not only summarized the unique characteristics of microvascular endothelial cells, but also illustrated a clarified mechanism of the development and maintenance of BBB which can provide new therapeutic opportunities for central nervous system drug delivery.

The NHS in England stopped most non-urgent work by March 2020, but later recommended that services should be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. The authors are developing the OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory, using data to describe changes in service activity during COVID-19, and reviewing signals for action with commissioners, researchers and clinicians. Here we report phase one: generating, managing, and describing the data. Objective To describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in English primary care across 23.8 million patients records, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedures as key examples. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we developed an open source software framework for data management and analysis to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across primary care EHR data on 23.8 million patients; and conducted a population cohort-based study to describe activity using CTV3 coding hierarchy and keyword searches from January 2019-September 2020. Results Much activity recorded in general practice declined to some extent during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September 2020, with some exceptions. There was a large drop in coded activity for commonly used laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was blood coagulation tests such as International Normalised Ratio (INR), with a smaller reduction (median tests per 1000 patients in 2020: February 8.0; April 6.2; September 7.0). The overall pattern of recording for respiratory symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified as no change from the previous year. Respiratory tract infections exhibited a sustained drop compared with pre-pandemic levels, not returning to pre-pandemic levels by September 2020. Various COVID-19 codes increased through the period. We observed a small decline associated with high level codes for long-term respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Asthma annual reviews experienced a small drop but since recovered, while COPD annual reviews remain below baseline. Conclusions We successfully delivered an open source software framework to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering to near-normal levels by September 2020, with some important tests less affected. Records of respiratory infections decreased with the exception of codes related to COVID-19, whilst activity of other respiratory disease codes was mixed.

Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection.

We derive analytical expressions for the probability of containment of the outbreak, which is complementary to the probability of seeding a deterministically growing epidemic. This probability depends on the statistics of the intra-community contact network and the initial conditions, in particular, on the contact degree of patient zero. Based on this model, we suggest surveillance protocols by which individuals are tested proportionally to their degree in the contact network.

CASE REPORT A 47-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging 6.9-cm thoracic aneurysm that was a complication of a chronic type B aortic dissection. A 2-piece, custom-made, tapered, fenestrated thoracic endoprosthesis (innominate scallop plus single carotid) was planned to seal from the innominate origin to immediately above the celiac axis after staged left carotid to subclavian bypass. Blood pressure control with rapid ventricular pacing aided deployment of the proximal, fenestrated stent-graft component with both openings accurately positioned over their respective branch vessel ostia. Attempted retrieval of the nosecone was hampered by a release failure of the single conformance tie that connects the stent-graft to its central cannula. This left the stent-graft fully deployed with the nosecone irretrievable beyond a point immediately distal to the small fenestration. A series of endovascular salvage maneuvers ensued, ranging from simple actions to manipulate and balloon dilate the graft through to more complex attempts to break the tie and lasso the nosecone using snares. Finally, attempts at antegrade retrieval of the nosecone straightened the device and released the offending tie, allowing case completion. CONCLUSION This is a rare but cautionary example of the potential pitfalls of translating endograft technology from the abdominal aorta to the hostile environment of the aortic arch. It is likely that a combination of the arch curvature and hemodynamic forces, combined with the narrowed true lumen, contributed to failure of the trigger-wire tie release mechanism. Consideration of these endovascular salvage maneuvers may benefit interventional specialists who treat such diseases of the aortic arch.","output":"Fenestrated aortic arch stent-graft malfunction with endovascular salvage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The clinical response of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin was examined after establishing the in vitro antiviral susceptibility of the SARS associated coronavirus to a panel of antiviral agents. METHODS The in vitro susceptibility of the prototype of SARS associated coronavirus to a panel of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors currently licensed for clinical use was studied. Forty one patients with SARS followed for 3 weeks were treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. The clinical progress and virological outcomes were monitored and compared with 111 patients treated with ribavirin only who served as historical controls. RESULTS In vitro antiviral activity against SARS associated coronavirus was demonstrated for lopinavir and ribavirin at concentrations of 4 micro g/ml and 50 micro g/ml, respectively, only at 48 hours. The adverse clinical outcome (ARDS or death) was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the historical controls (2.4% v 28.8%, p<0.001) at day 21 after the onset of symptoms. The adverse outcome remained significantly lower in the treatment group than in the controls-both those diagnosed early (p<0.001) and those diagnosed later in the course of the epidemic (p = 0.002)-but there was no significant difference in adverse outcome rates between the two time periods (p = 0.548). No time related difference in outcome was observed in the control groups. A reduction in steroid usage and nosocomial infections was seen in patients initially treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, and these patients had a decreasing viral load and rising peripheral lymphocyte count. Multivariate analysis showed that age, hepatitis B carrier status, and lack of treatment with this antiviral combination were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. Lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was associated with a better outcome even when adjusted for baseline lactate dehydrogenase level.

Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish neighbourhoods in England experienced high incidences of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020-21 and measles outbreaks (2018-19) due to suboptimal childhood vaccination coverage. The objective of our study was to explore how the coronavirus vaccination programme (CVP) was co-delivered between public health services and an Orthodox Jewish health organisation. Methods included 28 semi-structured interviews conducted virtually with public health professionals, community welfare and religious representatives, and household members. We examined CVP delivery from the perspectives of those involved in organising services and vaccine beneficiaries. Interview data was contextualised within debates of the CVP in Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish print and social media. Thematic analysis generated five considerations: i) Prior immunisation-related collaboration with public health services carved a role for Jewish health organisations to host and promote coronavirus vaccination sessions, distribute appointments, and administer vaccines ii) Public health services maintained responsibility for training, logistics, and maintaining vaccination records; iii) The localised approach to service delivery promoted vaccination in a minority with historically suboptimal levels of coverage; iv) Co-delivery promoted trust in the CVP, though a minority of participants maintained concerns around safety; v) Provision of CVP information and stakeholders response to situated (context-specific) challenges and concerns. Drawing on this example of CVP co-delivery, we propose that a localised approach to delivering immunisation programmes could address service provision gaps in ways that involve trusted community organisations. Localisation of vaccination services can include communication or implementation strategies, but both approaches involve consideration of investment, engagement and coordination, which are not cost-neutral. Localising vaccination services in collaboration with welfare groups raises opportunities for the on-going CVP and other immunisation programmes, and constitutes an opportunity for ethnic and religious minorities to collaborate in safeguarding community health.","output":"Localising Vaccination Services: Qualitative Insights on an Orthodox Jewish Collaboration with Public health during the UK coronavirus Vaccine Programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer patients suffer changes in energy balance (EB), the combination of energy intake (nutrition) and energy expenditure (physical activity (PA)), which may influence cancer-related morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.

CASE REPORT: . A healthy 73-years old woman admitted to the ED for dyspnea, fever and thoracic pain. Cardiac ultrasound, electrocardiogram and clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of cardiogenic obstructive shock due to acute pulmonary embolism, successfully treated with thrombolysis. A CT angiography confirmed the pulmonary embolism (EP) diagnosis and showed bilateral pneumonia, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: .

Human colonic adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) showed less sensitivity than hepatocyte-derived cellular carcinoma cells (HuH-7), and in turn, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was variable. Also, the apoptotic potential of Aspergillus species-derived fungal secondary metabolites was proven via detection of up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. The expression level was cell type dependent. Concurrently, apoptotic profile was accompanied with cellular DNA accumulation at the G2/M phase, as well as an elevation in Pre-G1 phase but not during G0/G1 and S phases. Also, there were characteristic apoptotic features of treated cells presented as abnormal intra-nuclear eosinophilic structures, dead cells with mixed euchromatin and heterochromatin, ruptured cell membranes, apoptotic cells with irregular cellular and nuclear membranes, as well as peripheral chromatin condensation.

Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patient tests and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently.

Racial and ethnic disparities in health care have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19 . MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis and COVID test results. RESULTS: Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95%CI:0.58-0.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients. DISCUSSION: There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of Zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection; many of which are due to systemic racism. Evidence regarding disparities that manifest through telemedicine can be used to inform tool design and systemic efforts to promote digital health equity.","output":"Telemedicine and Healthcare Disparities: A cohort study in a large healthcare system in New York City during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To perform a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 publications published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology (IJO) during the two years of the pandemic and to study their impact on ophthalmic literature.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of tentatively diagnosed IIVDE in dogs to assess the prognostic utility of neurological grade and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. METHODS Twenty dogs were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS Nonchondrodystrophic breeds (n = 16) were more predisposed than chondrodystrophic breeds. Most dogs showed acute onset of clinical signs. Neurological examination at admission showed predominant non-ambulatory paraparesis (n = 9); paresis (n = 16) was confirmed more frequently than paralysis (n = 4). Follow-up neurological examination results were only available for 11 dogs, ten of whom showed neurological improvement and 8 showed successful outcomes at 1 month. The characteristic MRI findings include thoracic vertebra (T)2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, intramedullary linear tracts with reduced disc volume, and cleft of the annulus fibrosus. None of the MRI measurements were significantly correlated with neurological grade at admission. Neurological grade did not differ according to the presence of parenchymal hemorrhage, parenchymal contrast enhancement, and meningeal contrast enhancement. Neurological grades at admission showed a statistical correlation with those observed at the 1-month follow-up (r = 0.814, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS IIVDE is a rare form of disc extrusion commonly experienced after physical activity or trauma and most frequently affects the cranial-cervical and thoracolumbar regions of nonchondrodystrophic dog breeds.

Diets were evaluated using the Nutrient Rich Diet score (NRD15.3), diet-related greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and a diet similarity index that quantified the proportion of food intake that remained similar as compared with the observed diet. SETTING: National dietary surveys of four European countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, Italy and France). SUBJECTS: Approximately 6500 adults, aged 18-64 years. RESULTS: When dietary preferences were prioritised, NRD153 was ~6 % higher, GHGE was ~4 % lower and ~85 % of food intake remained similar. This diet had higher amounts of fruit, vegetables and whole grains than the observed diet. When nutrient quality was prioritised, NRD153 was ~16 % higher, GHGE was ~3 % lower and ~72 % of food intake remained similar.

However, Merremia boisiana, a vigorous invasive twining liana, never strangles the host tree. Here, we investigated how M. boisiana stems adjust their twining growth to avoid intense competition with host trees, and how hydraulic conductivity is maintained for rapid asexual reproduction. We evaluated the effects of competition on twining M. boisiana stems (Em) and host tree trunks (Eh), compared differences in secondary growth between twining and creeping M. boisiana stems, calculated the total number of vessels (Nt), vessel density (Vmm-2), average vessel diameter (VDave), and percentage of vessels wider than 300 m in diameter (P300) in the secondary xylem, and traced how these parameters change with increasing cross-sectional area of stem (SA). The results showed that twining M. boisiana stems were competitively weaker, and mean Em (14.3%) was 21 times greater than that of Eh (0.7%). Secondary growth along the normal direction of the contact surface was significantly inhibited in stems twining on host trees. The lateral secondary growth of these stems was active, forming secondary vascular rings and/or arcs with abundant large vessels. Secondary growth in the central vascular cylinder was also significantly limited in extremely flat twining stems. Nt was positively and linearly correlated with SA. Vmm-2 and VDave fluctuated greatly in younger stems and tended to be stable in older stems. Nt and Vmm-2 did not significantly differ between twining and creeping stems, while VDave and P300 were both higher in twining stems compared to creeping stems of the same size. In conclusion, well-developed lateral anomalous secondary growth prevents twining M. boisiana stems from fiercely competing with their host trees, while stable vessel density and wider, newly formed, vessels ensured sufficient hydraulic conductivity for the rapid asexual reproduction of twining M. boisiana stems.","output":"How weak twining lianas adapt to competition with host tree trunks: Case of Merremia boisiana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic AA-amyloidosis is a protein-misfolding disease that is characterized by fibril deposition of serum amyloid-A protein (SAA) in several organs in humans and many animal species.

The emergence of Delta in the UK occurred on the background of a heterogeneous landscape of immunity and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions(4,5). Here we analyse 52,992 Delta genomes from England in combination with 93,649 global genomes to reconstruct the emergence of Delta, and quantify its introduction to and regional dissemination across England, in the context of changing travel and social restrictions. Through analysis of human movement, contact tracing, and virus genomic data, we find that the focus of geographic expansion of Delta shifted from India to a more global pattern in early May 2021. In England, Delta lineages were introduced >1,000 times and spread nationally as non-pharmaceutical interventions were relaxed. We find that hotel quarantine for travellers from India reduced onward transmission from importations; however the transmission chains that later dominated the Delta wave in England had been already seeded before restrictions were introduced. In England, increasing inter-regional travel drove Delta's nationwide dissemination, with some cities receiving >2,000 observable lineage introductions from other regions. Subsequently, increased levels of local population mixing, not the number of importations, was associated with faster relative growth of Delta. Among US states, we find that regions that previously experienced large waves also had faster Delta growth rates, and a model including interactions between immunity and human behaviour could accurately predict the rise of Delta there.

REPORT OF THE CASE: 50-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented with one day of petechial rash on her arms, chest and legs. Patient reports that she had just completed a 7- day course of TMP/SMX (1-double strength tablet twice a day) for uncomplicated UTI by her PMD. On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and complete blood cell count revealed a platelet count of 2000/uL. TMP/SMX was believed to be the most likely cause of thrombocytopenia. After discontinuation of TMP/SMX and treatment with 2 units of platelets, 1gm intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral dexamethasone, repeat CBC showed a stable platelet count of 90,000/uL. Patient was successfully discharged on hospital day 3 with outpatient follow up with the hematology clinic for further monitoring. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Differential diagnosis of severe thrombocytopenia include drug induced thrombocytopenia (DITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), post transfusion purpura (PTP), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Drug-dependent antibodies are an unusual class of antibodies that bind firmly to specific epitopes on platelet surface glycoproteins only in the presence of the sensitizing drugs. DITP typically has an abrupt onset of severe thrombocytopenia, usually less than 20,000/uL.

Despite its prevalence, little is known about outcomes in children following minor injury at home. Understanding the impact of these injuries on children and their families is important for treatment, prevention, and policy. The objectives of our study were (1) To describe the distribution of short-term outcomes following pediatric minor injuries sustained at home and (2) To explore the relationship of injury type and patient and household demographics with these outcomes. METHODS: Children (n = 102) aged 0C7 years with a minor injury sustained at home were recruited in an urban pediatric emergency department as part of the Child Housing Assessment for a Safer Environment (CHASE) observational study. Each patient had a home visit following the emergency department visit, where five parent-reported outcomes were assessed. Relationships were explored with logistic regression. RESULTS: The most common type of injury was soft tissue (57.8 %). 13.2 % of children experienced  7 days of pain, 21.6 % experienced  7 days of abnormal activity, 8.9 % missed  5 days of school, 17.8 % of families experienced  7 days of disruption, and 9.1 % of parents missed  5 days of work. Families reported a total of 120 missed school days and 120 missed work days. Children who sustained a burn had higher odds of experiencing pain (OR 6.97), abnormal activity (OR 8.01), and missing school (OR 8.71). The parents of children who sustained a burn had higher odds of missing work (OR 14.97). CONCLUSIONS: Families of children suffering a minor injury at home reported prolonged pain and changes in activity as well as significant school and work loss.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis of a historical cohort of 7,816 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020, and August 1, 2020. Main outcomes were progression to ARDS and 30-day mortality from ARDS, respectively. RESULTS: The cohort was comprised predominantly of men (94.5%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-74 years). 2,184 (28%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 643 (29.4%) were diagnosed with ARDS.

Independent predictors of progression to ARDS were body mass index (BMI) &#8805;40 kg/m2, diabetes, lymphocyte counts <700  109/L, LDH >450 U/L, ferritin >862 ng/ml, C-reactive protein >11 mg/dL, and D-dimer >1.5 ug/ml. In contrast, the use of an anticoagulant lowered the risk of developing ARDS (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.49-0.89]. Crude 30-day mortality rate from ARDS was 41% (95% CI 38%-45%).

Survival benefit was observed in patients who received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir but there was no advantage of combination therapy over either agent alone. CONCLUSIONS: Among those hospitalized for COVID-19, nearly 1 in 10 progressed to ARDS. Septic shock, and acute renal failure are the leading causes of death in these patients.

While physiological role protects the host, pathophysiological role can substantially harm the host, by triggering several hyper-inflammatory pathways, referred as \\"hypercytokinaemia\\". Emerging clinical evidence suggests that exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), tricks the complement to aberrantly activate the \\"hypercytokinaemia\\" loop, which significantly contributes to the severity of the COVID19. The pathophysiological response of the complement is usually amplified by the over production of potent chemoattractants and inflammatory modulators, like C3a and C5a. Therefore, it is logical that neutralizing the harmful effects of the inflammatory modulators of the complement system can be beneficial for the management of COVID19.

This comprehensive review of recent studies examining overall trauma volumes, mechanisms of injury, and outcomes after trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed to better understand the impact of the pandemic on trauma patients. RECENT FINDINGS In the early stages of the pandemic, the overall volumes of patients seen in many major trauma centers had decreased; however, these rates largely returned to historical baselines after the cessation of stay-at-home orders. An increasing proportion of trauma patients were injured by penetrating mechanisms during the pandemic. Being a victim of interpersonal violence was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection. In two studies utilizing propensity score-matched analysis among trauma patients, COVID-19 infection was associated with a five- to sixfold increase in mortality risk as compared to uninfected patients.

DESIGN: It was carried out a descriptive transversal study in the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco state, Brazil, within the period of 20/02/2020 to 05/05/2020. Data included all official reports for influenza-like illness notified by the municipality health department and the self-reports collected through the participatory surveillance platform Brasil Sem Corona. METHODS: We used linear regression and loess regression to verify a correlation between Participatory Surveillance (PS) and Traditional Surveillance (TS). Also a spatial scanning approach was deployed in order to identify risk clusters for COVID-19. RESULTS: In Caruaru, the PS had 861 active users, presenting an average of 1.2 reports per user per week. The platform Brasil Sem Corona started on March 20(th) and since then, has been officially used by the Caruaru health authority to improve the quality of information from the traditional surveillance system. Regarding the respiratory syndrome cases from TS, 1,588 individuals were positive for this clinical outcome. The spatial scanning analysis detected 18 clusters and 6 of them presented statistical significance (p-value < 0.1). Clusters 3 and 4 presented an overlapping area that was chosen by the local authority to deploy the COVID-19 serology, where 50 individuals were tested. From there, 32% (n = 16) presented reagent results for antibodies related to COVID-19.

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with increased COVID-19 severity and evaluate the current antiviral drugs, especially in severe patients. Methods: : This was a retrospective observational study performed at the No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan (Wuhan, China) with hospitalized patients confirmed with COVID-19 from January 11 to March 13, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associated factors of severe COVID. Treatments of antivirus drugs were collected and evaluated. Results: : Of the 550 patients, 292 (53.1%) were female and 277 (50.4%) were > 60 years old. The most common symptom was fever (n=372, 67.7%), followed by dry cough (n=257, 46.7%), and dyspnea (n=237, 43.1%), and fatigue (n=224, 40.7%). Among the severe patients, 20.2% required invasive ventilator support and 18.0% required non-invasive ventilator. The identified risk factors for severe cases were: age 60 years (odds ratio (OR) =3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-8.08, P=0.028), D-dimer >0.243 g/ml (OR=2.734, 95%CI: 1.012-7.387, P=0.047), and low oxygenation index (OR=0.984, 95%CI: 0.980-0.989, P<0.001). In severe cases, the benefits (relief of clinical symptoms, clinical outcome, and discharge rate) of arbidol alone was 73.3%, which was better than ribavirin (7/17, 41.2%, P=0.029). Conclusions: : Age > 60 years, D-dimer >0.243 g/ml, and lower oxygenation index were associated with severe COVID-19.

The low infectious dose and the lack of long-term immunity in infected persons means that norovirus often causes outbreaks in institutions and closed and semiclosed centers. Norovirus gastroenteritis are usually mild, with no complications, but occasionally can result in hospital admission. Understanding the risk factors involved in a norovirus outbreak can reduce the spread, severity, and duration of the outbreak and, when a vaccine becomes available, this understanding would help us identify the population groups need to get vaccinated.

It comes at a historic inflection point, following the chaotic departure of one of the most nativist administrations in US history and in the early months of a new administration whose executive orders, administrative actions, and legislative proposals augur a different view of immigrants and immigration.The paper examines two main ways that the BidenCHarris administration can realize its immigration, naturalization and integration goals: i.e., by expanding access to permanent residence and by increasing naturalization numbers and rates. First, it proposes administrative and, to a lesser degree, legislative measures that would expand the pool of eligible-to-naturalize immigrants. Second, it identifies three underlying factorsfinancial resources, English language proficiency, and educationthat strongly influence naturalization rates. These factors must be addressed, in large part, outside of and prior to the naturalization process. In addition, it provides detailed estimates of populations with large eligible-to-naturalize numbers, populations that naturalize at low rates, and populations with increasing naturalization rates. It argues that the administration's immigration strategy should prioritize all three groups for naturalization.The paper endorses the provisions of the US Citizenship Act that would place undocumented and temporary residents on a path to permanent residence and citizenship, would reduce family- and employment-based visa backlogs, and would eliminate disincentives and barriers to permanent residence. It supports the Biden-Harris administration's early executive actions and proposes additional measures to increase access to permanent residence and naturalization. It also endorses and seeks to inform the administration's plan to improve and expedite the naturalization process and to promote naturalization.The paper's major findings regarding the eligible-to-naturalize population include the following: In 2019, about 74 percent, or 23.1 million, of the 31.2 million immigrants (that were eligible for naturalization) had naturalized. Three statesIndiana, Arizona, and Texashad naturalization rates of 67 percent, well below the national average of 74 percent. Fresno, California had the lowest naturalization rate (58 percent) of the 25 metropolitan (metro) areas with the largest eligible-to-naturalize populations, followed by Phoenix at 66 percent and San Antonio and Austin at 67 percent. Four cities in California had rates of 52C58 percentSalinas, Bakersfield, Fresno, and Santa Maria-Santa Barbara. McAllen, Laredo, and Brownsville had the lowest naturalization rates in Texas. Immigrants from Japan had the lowest naturalization rate (47 percent) by country of origin, followed by four countries in the 60C63 percent rangeMexico, Canada, Honduras, and the United Kingdom. Guatemala and El Salvador each had rates of 67 percent. Median household income was $25,800, or 27 percent, higher for the naturalized population, compared to the population that had not naturalized (after an average of 23 years in the United States for both groups). In the past 10 years, naturalization rates for China and India have fallen, and rates for Mexico and Central America have increased (keeping duration of residence constant). In short, the paper provides a roadmap of policy measures to expand the eligible-to-naturalize population, and the factors and populations that the BidenCHarris administration should prioritize to increase naturalization rates, as a prerequisite to the full integration and participation of immigrants, their families, and their descendants in the nation's life.","output":"Making Citizenship an Organizing Principle of the US Immigration System: An Analysis of How and Why to Broaden Access to Permanent Residence and Naturalization for New Americans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health care systems around the world.

However, their synthesis, performed in solution, involves multiple synthetic and purification steps, thereby generating a major limitation for rapid preparation of such probes with diverse substrate scope. To overcome this limitation, we developed a general solid-phase-synthetic approach to prepare chemiluminescent protease probes, by peptide elongation, performed on an immobilized chemiluminescent enol-ether precursor. The enol-ether precursor is immobilized on a 2-chlorotrityl-chloride resin through an acrylic acid substituent by an acid-labile ester linkage. Next, a stepwise elongation of the peptide is performed using standard Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. After cleavage of the peptide-enol-ether precursor from the resin, by hexafluoro-iso-propanol, a simple oxidation of the enol-ether yields the final chemiluminescent dioxetane protease probe. To validate the applicability of the methodology, two chemiluminescent probes were efficiently prepared by solid-phase synthesis with dipeptidyl substrates designed for activation by aminopeptidase and cathepsin-B proteases. A more complex example was demonstrated by the synthesis of a chemiluminescent probe for detection of PSA, which includes a peptidyl substrate of six amino acids. We anticipate that the described methodology would be useful for rapid preparation of chemiluminescent protease probes with vast and diverse peptidyl substrates.","output":"Universal Access to Protease Chemiluminescent Probes through Solid-Phase Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a range of emergency measures worldwide. Early in the pandemic, children were suspected to act as drivers of the COVID-19 spread in the population, which was based on experiences with influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens. Consequently, closures of schools and kindergartens were implemented in many countries around the world, alongside with other non-pharmaceutical interventions for transmission control. Given the grave and multifaceted consequences of contact restriction measures for children, it is crucial to better understand the effect size of these incisive actions for the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we systematically review the current evidence on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to and by children. Data Sources: PubMed and preprints uploaded on medRxiv. Study Selection: Original research articles, case reports, brief communications, and commentaries were included into the analysis. Each title or abstract was independently reviewed to identify relevant articles. Studies in other languages than English were not included. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently reviewed the selected studies. Extracted data included citation of each study, type of healthcare setting, location of the study, characteristics of patient population, and reported outcomes. Results: Data on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on or by children is scarce. Several studies show a lower seropositivity of children compared to adults, suggesting a lower susceptibility of especially younger children. Most insight currently comes from household studies suggesting, that children are predominantly infected by their household contacts. The contagiousness however, seems to be comparable between children and adults, based on our meta-analysis of included studies.

It becomes more and more clear that the respiratory mucosa which forms a physiological as well as chemical barrier for inhaled particles, plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis and driving disease. In a healthy state, the mucosal immune system provides protection against pathogens as well as maintains a tolerance toward non-harmful commensal microbes and benign environmental substances such as allergens. One of the most important players of the mucosal immune system is immunoglobulin (Ig) A, which is well-studied in gut research where it has emerged as a key factor in creating tolerance to potential food allergens and maintaining a healthy microbiome.

Current tools for taxonomic assignment from sequencing reads based on alignment or alignment-free k-mer approaches may not perform optimally in cases where the sequences diverge significantly from the reference sequences. Furthermore, many tools may not incorporate the genomic coverage of assigned reads as part of overall likelihood of a correct taxonomic assignment for a sample. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe the development of a pipeline that incorporates a multi-task learning model based on convolutional neural network (MT-CNN) and a Bayesian ranking approach to identify and rank the most likely human virus from sequence reads. For taxonomic assignment of reads, the MT-CNN model outperformed Kraken 2, Centrifuge, and Bowtie 2 on reads generated from simulated divergent HIV-1 genomes and was more sensitive in identifying SARS as the closest relation in four RNA sequencing datasets for SARS-CoV-2 virus. For genomic region assignment of assigned reads, the MT-CNN model performed competitively compared with Bowtie 2 and the region assignments were used for estimation of genomic coverage that was incorporated into a na?ve Bayesian network together with the proportion of taxonomic assignments to rank the likelihood of candidate human viruses from sequence data. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a pipeline that combines a novel MT-CNN model that is able to identify viruses with divergent sequences together with assignment of the genomic region, with a Bayesian approach to ranking of taxonomic assignments by taking into account both the number of assigned reads and genomic coverage.

The interactions between different sectors in a territory are still not easily observable. We test the complexity of the economic structure at a local level, given the availability of data at a very granular scale.

Thus, in order to interpret the economic structure of a territory, we used cluster-based analysis. The analysis helps in evaluating the interconnections among sectors that constitute a cluster. A novel method of describing the territorial economic structure is presented by applying Social Network Analysis (SNA) within cluster-based analysis to characterize the importance of both location and economic interconnections. In this study, we focus on the industrial agglomerations in Calabria, Italy, to underpin the potential of the regions industries by using social networking analysis metrics. This research put forward new interpretations of SNA metrics that describe regional economic compositions. Our findings reveal that territorial social networks are a potential instrument for understanding interactions in regional systems and economic clusters and might help in highlighting local industrial potentials.

Older adults are considered more vulnerable during public health emergency crises. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological response of older adults during the acute phase of the pandemic in Greece. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was part of a larger three-day online survey. A total of 103 participants over the age of 60 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The survey included sociodemographic questions and six psychometric scales: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (JGLS). RESULTS: A significant proportion of the participants reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms (81.6%), moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (84.5%), as well as disrupted sleep (37.9%). Women reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19Crelated fear, more severe depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty. Participants living alone showed higher levels of loneliness. Intolerance of uncertainty was shown to modulate levels of loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: During the quarantine, attention was promptly drawn upon the risks related with older peoples loneliness. Studies identifying factors that may contribute to loneliness during a public health emergency facilitate the implementation of supportive interventions.

Strained healthcare providers make difficult decisions on patient triage, treatment and care management on a daily basis. Policy makers have imposed social distancing measures to slow the disease, at a steep economic price. We design analytical tools to support these decisions and combat the pandemic. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, predict its mortality, forecast its evolution, and ultimately alleviate its impact. By leveraging cohort-level clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to re-allocate ventilators and alleviate shortages. Our results have been used at the clinical level by several hospitals to triage patients, guide care management, plan ICU capacity, and re-distribute ventilators.

Responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: The participants reported markedly decreasing their PA following the enactment of physical distancing measures. The inability to subsequently engage in regular PA was a source of frustration for participants. Interview analysis revealed two themes that contributed to the understanding of why these individuals felt they needed PA coaching to increase PA; namely, a desire for both listening support and PA self-regulation support. CONCLUSION: The individuals who decreased PA due to COVID-19 desired an autonomy-supportive counselling style, centred on listening support and self-regulatory support.

This study addresses the clinical and immunopathological characteristics of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe and nonsevere groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics. A panel of blood cytokines was quantified over time. Biopsy specimens from 2 deceased cases were obtained for immunopathological, ultrastructural, and in situ hybridization examinations. RESULTS: Circulating cytokines, including IL-8, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IP10, MCP1, and RANTES, were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. Dynamic IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated to infect type II and type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis. In severe cases, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were observed in both blood and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions. Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both cytopathy caused by SARS-CoV-2 and immunopathologic damage.

Each transition resembles a phase transition of the second-order (Ginzburg-Landau instability) and, therefore, potentially a general phenomenon. The first wave of COVID-19 led to social distancing around the globe: severe lockdowns to stop the pandemic were followed by a series of lockdown lifts.

Further progression requires efforts to reduce viral circulation that may ultimately result in being awarded official disease-free status by the World Organisation for Animal Health [Office International des Epizooties (OIE)]. Typically, FMD control is reliant on the extensive use of vaccines, requiring careful consideration of the costs and benefits to ensure investment is likely to provide a positive return. This study conducted a costCbenefit analysis (CBA) for a proposed zone within Punjab Province, Pakistan. Benefits were assumed to come from averted production losses and treatment costs and the costs based on typical measures required for establishing a disease-free zone. To estimate the impact of FMD at the farm level, models were created to estimate effects on milk production, offtakes, and changes in herd value over a 5-year period with different parameters used to represent the production systems present. Control strategy costs incorporated aspects of vaccination, surveillance, sanitary measures, program management, stakeholder engagement, preparatory studies, training, and capacity building. The results indicated a median benefitCcost ratio of 1.03 (90% central range 0.37, 1.63) with a median net present value of 1.99 billion Pakistan Rupees (90% central range ?37.7, 37.0). The greatest cost was due to vaccination at 56%, followed by sanitary measures (including implementing and maintaining an animal ID system and quarantine stations around the zone) at 41%. Although the median benefitCcost ratio and net present value indicated that investment is likely to generate a positive return, the large variation indicates caution in interpreting the results and it is possible that an increase in animal value through new export markets will be required. Further refinement in our knowledge of disease impact and the details of the control strategy are needed. Moreover, there are implications regarding vaccine security, since the strategy is reliant on the steady provision of quality vaccines in order to achieve the anticipated benefits, raising important issues on vaccine availability for countries to maintain lucrative export markets for FMD.","output":"Economic Considerations for Advancement Through the Progressive Control Pathway: CostCBenefit Analysis of an FMD Disease-Free Zone in Punjab Province, Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the COVID-19 manifestations and evolution has improved over the past 10 months, but the reasons why evolution is more severe in obese and diabetic patients are not yet completely understood MAIN TEXT: In the present review we discuss the different mechanisms that may contribute to explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 including viral entrance, direct viral toxicity, endothelial dysfunction, thromboinflammation, dysregulation of the immune response, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system CONCLUSIONS: We show that the viral infection activates an integrated stress response, including activations of serine kinases such as PKR and PERK, which induce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and insulin resistance In parallel, we correlate and show the synergy of the insulin resistance of COVID-19 with this hormonal resistance of obesity and diabetes, which increase the severity of the disease Finally, we discuss the potential beneficial effects of drugs used to treat insulin resistance and diabetes in patients with COVID-19","output":"Diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance in COVID-19: molecular interrelationship and therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the prominence of East and Southeast Asia as a focus of communications and game studies.

Here, we review important evolutionary aspects of HIV infection, highlighting the concept of selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the smallest scale, a single cell may be infected by multiple virions competing for intracellular resources. Recombination and phenotypic mixing introduce novel evolutionary dynamics. As the virus spreads between cells in an infected individual, it continually evolves to circumvent the immune system. We discuss evolutionary mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Viral spread throughout the human population can lead to changes in virulence and the transmission of immune-evading variation. HIV emerged as a human pathogen due to selection occurring between different species, adapting from related viruses of primates. HIV also evolves resistance to antiretroviral drugs within a single infected host, and we explore the possibility for the spread of these strains between hosts, leading to a drug-resistant epidemic. We investigate the role of latency, drug-protected compartments, and direct cell-to-cell transmission on viral evolution. The introduction of an HIV vaccine may select for viral variants that escape vaccine control, both within an individual and throughout the population. Due to the strong selective pressure exerted by HIV-induced morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world, the human population itself may be co-evolving in response to the HIV pandemic. Throughout the paper, we focus on trade-offs between costs and benefits that constrain viral evolution and accentuate how selection pressures differ at different levels of selection.

However, diagnostic criteria for AB are heterogeneous and not very well known. OBJECTIVE: To identify the diagnostic criteria for AB used by experts and clinical paediatricians in Spain. METHODS: Delphi study with Spanish AB experts, looking for the points of agreement about AB diagnosis. A subsequent cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an on-line questionnaire addressed to all Spanish paediatricians, reached through electronic mail messages sent by nine paediatric scientific societies. Descriptive and factorial analyses were carried out, looking for any association of diagnostic criteria with demographic or geographic variables, or with paediatric subspecialty. RESULTS: Agreement was reached by 40 experts in many issues (first episode of respiratory distress and high respiratory frequency, diagnosis in any season of the year, and usefulness of virus identification in making diagnosis), but opposite views were maintained on key characteristics such as the maximum age for diagnosis. The on-line questionnaire was completed by 1297 paediatricians. Their diagnostic criteria were heterogeneous and strongly associated with their paediatric sub-specialty. Their agreement with the Spanish expert consensus and with international standards was very poor. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic criteria for AB in Spain are heterogeneous. These differences could cause variability in clinical practice with AB patients.","output":"Heterogeneidad de criterios en el diagnstico de bronquiolitis aguda en Espa?a()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus is highly transmissible among individuals through both droplets and aerosol leading to determine severe pneumonia. Among the various factors that can influence both the onset of disease and the severity of its complications, the microbiome composition has also been investigated. Recent evidence showed the possible relationship between gut, lung, nasopharyngeal, or oral microbiome and COVID-19, but very little is known about it. Therefore, we aimed to verify the relationships between nasopharyngeal microbiome and the development of either COVID-19 or the severity of symptoms. To this purpose, we analyzed, by next generation sequencing, the hypervariable V1-V2-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=18) and control (CO) individuals (n=12) using Microbiota solution A (Arrow Diagnostics). We found a significant lower abundance of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria in COVID-19 patients in respect to CO (p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively) from the phylum up to the genus (p<0.001). The Fusobacterium periodonticum (FP) resulted as the most significantly reduced species in COVID-19 patients respect to CO. FP is reported as being able to perform the surface sialylation. Noteworthy, some sialic acids residues on the cell surface could work as additional S protein of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 could use sialic acids as receptors to bind to the epithelium of the respiratory tract, promoting its clustering and the disease development. We can therefore speculate that the significant reduction of FP in COVID-19 patients could be directly or indirectly linked to the modulation of sialic acid metabolism. Finally, viral or environmental factors capable of interfering with sialic metabolism could determine a fall in the individual protection from SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are necessary to clarify the precise role of FP in COVID-19.","output":"Nasopharyngeal Microbiome Signature in COVID-19 Positive Patients: Can We Definitively Get a Role to Fusobacterium periodonticum?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Internet and social media became important and fast sources of health information, leading to overabundance of both valid and invalid information. Digital health literacy (DHL) is a core competency for navigating web- and social media based COVID-19 information. This study is part of the global COVID-HL survey assessing DHL among university students. METHODS: Six universities from Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Finland participated in an online survey in May 2020. Five subscales from the DHL Instrument (DHLI), adapted to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, were used. The data were analyzed using univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Mean age of the students (N = 3771) was 28 y. (females n = 2720). Students had searched information from the Internet for themselves and others (85,2%). Females had searched more than male, and the probability of searches increased with age. Majority of students (90,4%) considered information easy to find and 83,2% of students found it easy to use the information in decisions related to their health, males easier than female or diverse gender. The greatest difficulty was in assessing the reliability of information (24,0%). The sources for information seeking often were news sites, search engines, and websites of public bodies (64,8%, 50,5% and 44,1%, respectively). The topics that were most searched were spread of the coronavirus (90,1%), its symptoms (88,0%) and restrictions (87,7%). 86,3% of students considered the verified information very important. CONCLUSIONS: Finnish students were rather confident in their DHL skills. However, almost every fourth had difficulties in assessing the reliability of the information, a key competence of DHL in the context of overabundance of information. This suggests that DHL, especially the competence of critically evaluate health related information, need to be strengthen among university students in Finland across different study subjects.","output":"Digital health literacy and information behaviour in university students in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 43-yr-old man with left lumbar pain was diagnosed as having a growing renal angiomyolipoma at imaging.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Only patients with unruptured interstitial pregnancy evaluated by MRI and observed for at least a year after surgery were included. Initial evaluation was performed by measurement of serum -human chorionic gonadotrophin level and ultrasonography. In suspicious cases, emergency MRI was performed to diagnose interstitial pregnancies with the exclusion of rudimentary horn pregnancy and angular pregnancy. Three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) angiography was additionally performed if the uteroplacental neovascularization needed to be evaluated. Then, management procedures were individually determined along with the need for preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for immediate devascularization, and for the local or systemic administration of methotrexate. Either laparoscopic cornuostomy or cornual resection was chosen to excise the gestational mass. RESULTS Five consecutive women with unruptured interstitial pregnancy were enrolled. One case each of rudimentary horn pregnancy and angular pregnancy was excluded. Three-dimensional CT angiography was performed in three cases due to increased vascular flow on color Doppler ultrasonography. Preoperative devascularization by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was performed in two cases, in which a prominent neovascularized gestational mass was identified. Uterine preservation was achieved by cornuostomy or cornual resection in all cases. Two patients with a desire to become pregnant conceived spontaneously thereafter, followed by successful cesarean birth.

EXPERT OPINION Extensive research efforts have been made to optimize mRNA constructs and preparation procedures to unleash the full potential of mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines. Sequence optimization (untranslated region and codon usage), chemical engineering of nucleotides and modified 5'cap, and optimization of in vitro transcription and mRNA purification protocols have overcome the major obstacles (instability, delivery, immunogenicity and safety) hindering the clinical applications of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. The optimized design parameters should not be applied as default to different biological systems, but rather individually optimized for each mRNA sequence and intended application. Further advancement in the mRNA design and delivery technologies for achieving cell type- and organ site-specificity will broaden the scope and usefulness of this new class of drugs.","output":"An overview of rational design of mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 has modified how we relate with other people and our built environment, changing from in-person to primarily virtual activities. However, some activities are impossible to be virtually performed, such as construction activities. Consequently, the construction industry has been highly impacted by the pandemic due to COVID-19. In response to the impacts of the pandemic, the construction sector must identify alternatives that can minimize the spread of COVID-19 among workers in construction projects. Given this context, this study explores the alternative of managing the workforce of construction projects using multiple working shifts as multiple shifts may reduce construction workers density in the field, and with that, reducing the probabilities to spread COVID-19 among workers. This study presents an agent-based modeling approach to assess the impact of using two shifts to reduce the spread of COVID19 among construction workers. The model is supported by data found in the literature to simulate workers behavior regarding multiple shifts and by international institutions to simulate the pandemic context through multiple scenarios. This study found that the more workers are assigned to a night shift during a project, the higher the average number of workers classified as healthy (i.e., without COVID-19) is going to be. Namely, by assigning approximately half of the workers involved in a project to a night shift, the average number of healthy workers can be increased by 20% on a project. Quantifying the impact of alternatives that may reduce the spread of COVID-19 among construction workers can incentivize the implementation of such alternatives by construction managers. This study contributes to quantifying the benefits of using multiple working shifts to minimize the spread of COVID-19 among construction workers.","output":"Modeling working shifts in construction projects using an agent-based approach to minimize the spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration of Competing Interest statements were not included in published version of the following articles that appeared in previous issues of World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion Hence, the authors of the below articles were contacted after publication to request a Declaration of Interest statement: 1 Acupuncture for insomnia attention deficit and the influence of nerve electrophysiology [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2018;28 (3): 161-166] https://10 1016/j wjam 2018 09 0092 Effects of pricking blood therapy at meridian sinews on upper limb spasm of post-stroke patients [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2020;30: 39-44] https://10 1016/j wjam 2020 03 0013 Twenty cases of temporomandibular disorders with warming-needle moxibustion on ginger at Xigun (¹ST 7) [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2018;28(4): 291-293] https://10 1016/j wjam 2018 12 0034 Acupuncture and moxibustion combined with western medication for ninety cases of Bell's palsy at different stages: A randomized controlled trial [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2019;29 (4): 249-253] https://10 1016/j wjam 2019 11 0025 China Association of AcupunctureaMoxibustion Evidence-based clinical practice guideline of acupuncture and moxibustion: Primary dysmenorrhea [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2019;29 (4): 294-300] https://10 1016/j wjam 2019 12 0076 Efficacy observation on long snake moxibustion for lumbar disc herniation with cold-dampness syndrome [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2019;29 (2): 97-102] https://10 1016/j wjam 2019 06 0047 Preliminary optimization of acupuncture regimen at Nigun(PC 6) for gastroesophageal reflux disease [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2019;29 (2): 123-126] https://10 1016/j wjam 2019 04 0028 Nocturnal polyuria after lumbar disc herniation surgery [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2019;28 (4): 300-302] https://10 1016/j wjam 2018 11 0019 Exploration on the feasibility of moxibustion in prevention and treatment of COVID-19 from the perspective of modern medical mechanism [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2020;30 (2): 81-84] https://10 1016/j wjam 2020 06 00110 Clinical observation on the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion combined with rehabilitation training on post-stroke shoulder hand syndrome [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2020;30 (2): 107-112] https://10 1016/j wjam 2020 05 01511 Clinical Study on Bladder function recovery of 360 cases after radical hysterectomy treated by acupuncture [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2020;30 (3): 188-192] https://10 1016/j wjam 2020 07 00312 The treatment of urinary retention of neurogenic bladder of one patient with diabetes from the perspective of governor vessel: a case report [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2018;28: 63-65] https://10 1016/j wjam 2018 03 00513 Effect comparison of thermosensitive moxibustion and estazolam on anxiety and depression in the patients of insomnia differentiated as liver qi stagnation [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2018;28: 15-18] https://10 1016/j wjam 2018 03 01214 Pestle needling at Yoynggun-Bzhn points for intractable lumbodynia after lumbar disc herniation surgery: A randomized controlled trial [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2019;29 (3): 194-199] https://10 1016/j wjam 2019 08 00615 Analysis on the key factors of allergic rhinitis treated with acupuncture and moxibustion [World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion, 2019;29 (2): 133-139] https://10 1016/j wjam 2019 05 007","output":"Erratum regarding missing Declaration of Competing Interest statements in previously published articles (World Journal of Acupuncture C Moxibustion (2020) 30(3) (188C192), (S1003525720300787), (10.1016/j.wjam.2020.07.003))"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics are by nature \\"out of the blue.\\" Their unpredictable nature and impact can leave nurses and support systems reeling.

Observations shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 suggested that ibuprofen was associated with an increased risk of adverse events in COVID-19 patients, but subsequent observational studies failed to demonstrate increased risk and in one case showed reduced risk associated with NSAID use. METHODS: A 38-center retrospective cohort study was performed that leveraged the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. A propensity-matched cohort of 19,746 COVID-19 inpatients was constructed by matching cases (treated with NSAIDs at the time of admission) and 19,746 controls (not treated) from 857,061 patients with COVID-19 available for analysis. The primary outcome of interest was COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients, which was classified as: moderate, severe, or mortality/hospice. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), invasive ventilation, and all-cause mortality at any time following COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that NSAID use was not associated with increased COVID-19 severity (OR: 0.57 95% CI: 0.53C0.61). Analysis of secondary outcomes using logistic regression showed that NSAID use was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.51 95% CI: 0.47C0.56), invasive ventilation (OR: 0.59 95% CI: 0.55C0.64), AKI (OR: 0.67 95% CI: 0.63C0.72), or ECMO (OR: 0.51 95% CI: 0.36C0.7). In contrast, the odds ratios indicate reduced risk of these outcomes, but our quantitative bias analysis showed E-values of between 1.9 and 3.3 for these associations, indicating that comparatively weak or moderate confounder associations could explain away the observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Study interpretation is limited by the observational design. Recording of NSAID use may have been incomplete. Our study demonstrates that NSAID use is not associated with increased COVID-19 severity, all-cause mortality, invasive ventilation, AKI, or ECMO in COVID-19 inpatients. A conservative interpretation in light of the quantitative bias analysis is that there is no evidence that NSAID use is associated with risk of increased severity or the other measured outcomes.

Complementary analyses of the nucleic-acid-induced VP40 ring by native mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and X-ray crystal structures at 1.8 and 1.4 ? resolution reveal the stoichiometry of RNA binding, as well as an interface involving a key guanine nucleotide. The host factor-induced structural transformation of protein structure in response to specific RNA triggers in the Ebola virus life cycle presents unique opportunities for therapeutic inhibition.","output":"Cellular mRNA triggers structural transformation of Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 to its essential regulatory form"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, initially originated from China.

These perturbations can alter the ecological and evolutionary relationships among humans, wildlife, and the pathogens that move between them, resulting in disease emergence. In recent years, the rise in zoonotic EIDs has not only increased our awareness of the need for cross-sectoral collaborations, but has also highlighted the disconnect between current ecological theory and biological reality.

Methodology: Records of patients presenting at the emergency department(ED during the lockdown period(23rd March 2020 to 7th May) was assessed. Similarly records of patients presenting to the emergency department during the same period last year was assessed. The two were than compared. Parameters compared included the gender difference, the underlying disease, the number of ST elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) patients, patients undergoing lysis and primary percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) and the mortality. Data analysis was done in terms of numbers and percentage change in each parameter. Results: There was considerable decrease in the number of patients visiting the emergency department(32.48%)i.e from 13326 to 8997. In addition, the ST elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) number declined considerably(37.84%) as did the primary percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) number(66.43%) and the number of patients coming with non ST elevation acute coronary syndromes(NSTEACS)(72.32%) and decompensated heart failure(86.86%). The overall emergency department mortality also reduced by 42.1%. There was however an increase in the percentage of ST elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) patients lysed.

Assessment the state of the lungs using CT in the dynamic follow-up of pa-tients who have suffered from viral COVID-19 pneumonia in the delayed period af-ter 6-10 months, and to identify the relationship of residual lung changes with the clinical condition and results of external respiratory function (ERF). Materials and methods. We examined 78 patients who had suffered from bilateral polysegmental viral COVID-19 pneumonia in April-May 2020, using multi-spiral computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. All patients had a medical history, performed CT scans of the lungs in the acute and delayed (6-10 months after hospitalization) phases, and a study of FVD in the delayed phase. The analysis of a series of tomograms of the lungs in dynamics was carried out. We developed an severity score of the lung condition (LungSS), expressed in the total score, which was calculated based on the score of typical patterns characteristic of viral Covid19-pneumonia, as well as residual changes and areas of fibrosis. LungSS was calculated for each patient in the acute and delayed follow-up periods. Results. The present study shows the dynamics of lung changes in the delayed peri-od 6-10 months after the viral Covid19-pneumonia. Residual lung changes were detected in 66 people (84,6%). Of these, 35,9% of patients have areas of fibrosis, but most of the residu-al changes are linear and small-nodular seals (76,9%). The frequency of detection of residual reticular changes and consolidation was low (15,3%, 1,3%, respectively). Attention is drawn to the relatively frequent detection of areas of \\"Ground-glass opacity \\"(10,8%). In patients with severe and critical course of viral Covid19-pneumonia (CT3 and CT4), LungSS in the delayed follow-up period did not significantly differ from that in patients with mild and mod-erate course (CT1 and CT2) of the disease (4,5 [0,22], 2,5 [0,16], accordingly, p=0,61). There was no significant correlation between the detected residual lung changes in the delayed period and ERF. Conclusion. In a significant part of patients (84,6%) who have suffered from COVID-19 viral pneumonia, residual changes in the lung parenchyma persist, mainly in the form of linear seals and to a lesser extent fibrosis. These changes did not have a reliable relation-ship with the results of the FVD.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20C91 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4C7 days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. RESULTS: In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening. The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019. CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease. If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered. KEY POINTS: ? Multiple GGOs with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of COVID-19. ? The halo sign may be a special CT feature in the early-stage COVID-19 patients. ?

While the first constraint is relieved, and there is adequate progress on the others, fiscal space is still constrained. Even so, the Covid-19 crisis necessitates a large macroeconomic stimulus. In order not to overstrain government finances it should be targeted, temporary and self-limiting. Financing features can aid this as well as improve financial stability.

By capturing exogenous antigens and presenting antigen-derived peptides via major histocompatibility complex molecules to na?ve T cells, DCs induce antigen-specific immune responses in vivo. In order to induce effective host immune responses, active delivery of exogenous antigens to DCs is considered important for future vaccine development. We recently generated bionanocapsules (BNCs) consisting of hepatitis B virus surface antigens that mediate stringent in vivo cell targeting and efficient endosomal escape, and after the fusion with liposomes (LP) containing therapeutic materials, the BNC-LP complexes deliver them to human liver-derived tissues in vivo. BNCs were further modified to present the immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc-interacting domain (Z domain) derived from Staphylococcus aureus protein A in tandem. When mixed with IgGs, modified BNCs (ZZ-BNCs) displayed the IgG Fv regions outwardly for efficient binding to antigens in an oriented-immobilization manner. Due to the affinity of the displayed IgGs, the IgG-ZZ-BNC complexes accumulated in specific cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo. After mixing ZZ-BNCs with antibodies against DCs, we used immunocytochemistry to examine which antibodies delivered ZZ-BNCs to mouse splenic DCs following intravenous injection of the ZZ-BNCs. ZZ-BNCs displaying anti-CD11c monoclonal antibodies (-CD11c-ZZ-BNCs) were found to accumulate with approximately 62% of splenic DCs, and reside within some of them.

Healthcare workers, especially those immersed in palliative care, are prone to burnout due to the intense emotions associated with end-of-life caregiving. This study examines the efficacy of a novel, multimodal, and group-based Mindful-Compassion Art-based Therapy (MCAT) that integrates reflective self-awareness with creative emotional expression for protecting healthcare workers mental health. A dual-arm open-label waitlist randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 56 healthcare workers were recruited from the largest homecare hospice in Singapore and randomized to the immediate-treatment condition of a standardized 6-week, 18-hours MCAT intervention (n=29), or the waitlist-control condition (n=27). Self-administered outcome measures on burnout, resilience, emotional regulation, self-compassion, death attitudes, and quality of life were collected at baseline, post-intervention/second-baseline at 6weeks, and follow-up/post-intervention at 12weeks. Results from mixed model ANOVAs reveal that treatment group participants experienced significant reduction in mental exhaustion, as well as significant improvements in overall emotional regulation, nonreactivity to intrusive thoughts, approach acceptance of death, and afterlife belief as compared to waitlist-control immediately after MCAT completion. Effect sizes of these impacts ranged from medium to large ((2)=0.65 to 0.170). Results from one-way ANOVAs further reveal that the treatment gains of reduced mental exhaustion and increased emotional regulation were maintained among treatment group participants at 12-weeks follow-up compared to baseline, with new benefits identified. These include increased ability to observe and describe ones experiences, elevated overall self-compassion, greater mindful awareness, enhanced common humanity, and better quality of life. Effect sizes of these impacts were large ((2)=0.128 to 0.298). These findings reflect the robust effectiveness and positive residual effects of MCAT for reducing burnout, building resilience, nurturing compassion, fostering collegial support, and promoting mental wellness among healthcare workers.

This mass migration and other factors have put Nigeria in an emergency food and nutrition insecure situation. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was already an existing gap in the Nigerian food system, which led to the importation of food items to augment local production in order to meet local demand. However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic undermined efforts to achieve SDG 2 as the country witnessed not only a major disruption to food supply chains in the wake of lockdowns and movement restrictions triggered by the global health crisis, but also a major economic slowdown. The commerce, service, and agricultural sectors were the hardest hit by the spread of the virus and the effects are different along the rural-urban continuum. The vacuum created by the migration of people from the rural to urban areas led to reduction of farm yields, while the urban areas were particularly affected in terms of food supply from rural areas as a result of movement restrictions made during the height of the pandemic. More urbanised areas may be harder hit than remote rural areas if connectivity remains broken down, as most food crops are produced in the rural and semi-rural areas. This paper recommends strategies and policies aimed at reducing poverty, food insecurity and inequality across the urban-rural continuum through agricultural development.

A brief analysis of the importance of the arts and their education is necessary, as well as the new social framework in which they are inserted: postdigitality. The presence of digital technologies and devices -even more so during the pandemic period- has shown a hybridisation between physical and digital boundaries, two closely interrelated contexts. Education, like the arts and its educational practice, is nourished by these spaces and ways of doing things, and a (critical) look at the possibilities and challenges they present is necessary. Thus, one of the pedagogical strategies that emerges in this analysis is the concept of intercreativity. A discourse that approaches collective creative processes from a critical educational conception recognises the artistic conception as a powerful pedagogical resource in the classroom.

This index ranked 195 countries according to their expected preparedness in the case of a pandemic or other biological threat. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic provides the background to compare each country's predicted performance from the GHSI with the actual performance. In general, there is an inverted relation between predicted versus actual performance, i.e. the predicted top performers are among those that are the worst hit. Obviously, this reflects poorly on the potential policy uses of this index in imminent crisis management. METHODS: The paper analyses the GHSI and identifies why it may have struggled to predict actual pandemic preparedness as evidenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper also uses two different data sets, one from the Worldmeter on the spread of the Covid-19 pandemics, and the other from the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA) Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, to draw comparisons between the actual introduction of pandemic response policies and the corresponding death rate in 29 selected countries. RESULTS: This paper analyses the reasons for the poor match between prediction and reality in the index, and mentions six general observations applying to global indices in this respect. These observations are based on methodological and conceptual analyses. The level of abstraction in these global indices builds uncertainties upon uncertainties and hides implicit value assumptions, which potentially removes them from the policy needs on the ground. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, the question is raised if the policy community might have better tools for decision-making in a pandemic. On the basis of data from the INGSA Evidence-to-Policy Tracker, and with backing in studies from social psychology and philosophy of science, some simple heuristics are suggested, which may be more useful than a global index.","output":"Should policy makers trust composite indices?

Lymphopenia was prominent amongst the laboratory abnormalities reported in acute SARS. METHODS: The effect of SARS on peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subsets was examined in 271 SARS coronavirus-infected individuals. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD16+/56+ cell counts over the five weeks of the SARS illness although CD4+/CD8+ ratios did not change significantly. The lymphopenia was prolonged, reaching a nadir during days 7C9 in the second week of illness before returning towards normal after five weeks, with the lowest mean CD4+ cell count of 317 cells  10(6)/L at day 7, and CD8+ cell count of 239 cells  10(6)/L at day 8. Patients with more severe clinical illness, or patients who died, had significantly more profound CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia. DISCUSSION: Lymphopenia is a prominent part of SARS-CoV infection and lymphocyte counts may be useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes. Possible reasons for the SARS-associated lymphopenia may be direct infection of lymphocytes by SARS-CoV, lymphocyte sequestration in the lung or cytokine-mediated lymphocyte trafficking.

To this end, a database was created and subsequently analysed. RESULTS: The Chinese population includes a higher proportion of younger patients and no differences were identified regarding sex. Most of the variables studied behaved in the same way in both patient populations. Spanish patients presented a lesser impact (30.7%) on their socio-economic situation than Chinese patients (44%) (P < .05). There were no significant differences between populations in the remaining variables. Social networks were widely used in the majority of patients from both populations. CONCLUSIONS: The social and professional consequences of the pandemic were very similar in both groups; the use of social networks and family support was also similar.

The manifestation of COVID-19 may lead to a cytokine storm, i.e., it facilitates viral replication that triggers a strong release of cytokines, which then modulates the immune system and results in hyperinflammation. Todays diet is high in omega-6 fatty acids and deficient in omega-3 fatty acids;this, along with a high fructose intake, leads to obesity, which is a chronic state of low-grade inflammation. Omega-6 fatty acids are proinflammatory and prothrombotic whereas omega-3 fatty acids are less proinflammatory and thrombotic. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids make specialized lipid mediators, namely resolvins, protectins, and maresins, that are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Throughout evolution there was a balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids with a ratio of 1C2/1 omega-6/omega-3, but today this ratio is 16C20/1 omega-6/omega-3, leading to a proinflammatory state. In addition, genetic variants in FADS1, FADS2, ELOV-2, and ELOV-5 lead to a more efficient biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), e.g., of linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (ARA), and (alpha-linolenic acid) (ALA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), leading to higher ARA levels. Because the US diet is already high in omega-6 fatty acids, the increased biosynthesis of ARA in people with the derived FADS haplotype (haplotype D) leads to an increased production of leukotrienes, thromboxanes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and eventually elevated levels of cytokines, like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19. About 80% of African Americans, 50% of Hispanics, and 45% of European Americans have the FADS haplotype D and are thus efficient metabolizers, which could account for the higher vulnerability of these populations to COVID-19. Therefore, another reason that African Americans and Hispanics are more susceptible to COVID-19 is that they have a higher frequency of haplotype D, which is no longer beneficial in todays environment and diet. Genetic variation must be considered in all studies of disease development and therapy because it is important to the practice of precision nutrition by physicians and other health professionals. The objective of this commentary is to emphasize the importance of genetic variation within populations and its interaction with diet in the development of disease. Differences in the frequency of genes and their interactions with nutrients in various population groups must be considered among the factors contributing to health disparities in the development of COVID-19. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is essential to health. Physicians should measure their patients fatty acids and recommend decreasing the intake of foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids and increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids along with fruits and vegetables.","output":"Genetic Variation, Diet, Inflammation, and the Risk for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with COVID-19 disease are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. Current data regarding disease characteristics and outcomes in this population is limited. AIM: To delineate the adverse factors associated with outcomes of COVID- 19 patients &#8805;75 years of age. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients were classified into mild/moderate, severe/very severe, and critical disease (intubated) based on oxygen requirements. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 355 patients aged &#8805;75 years hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 19th and April 25th, 2020 were included. Mean age was 84.3 years. One-third of the patients developed critical disease. Mean length of stay was 7.10 days. Vasopressors were required in 27%, with the highest frequency in the critical disease group (74.1%). Overall mortality was 57.2%, with a significant difference between severity groups (mild/moderate disease : 17.4%, severe/very severe disease : 71.3%, critical disease: 94.9%, p < 0.001). Increased age, dementia, and severe/very severe and critical disease groups were each significantly associated with increased odds for mortality while diarrhea was associated with decreased odds for mortality (OR : 0.12, 95% CI : 0.02-0.60, p < 0.05)]. None of the cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Age and dementia are associated with increased odds for mortality in patients &#8805;75 years of age hospitalized with COVID-19.

NK cells respond to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro and are activated in patients with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, by which mechanisms NK cells detect SARS-CoV-2-infected cells remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Non-structural protein 13 of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for a peptide that is presented by human leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E). In contrast to self-peptides, the viral peptide prevents binding of HLA-E to the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, thereby rendering target cells susceptible to NK cell attack. In line with these observations, NKG2A-expressing NK cells are particularly activated in patients with COVID-19 and proficiently limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected lung epithelial cells in vitro. Thus, these data suggest that a viral peptide presented by HLA-E abrogates inhibition of NKG2A+ NK cells, resulting in missing self recognition.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 encodes for an HLA-E-stabilizing peptide that abrogates inhibition of NKG2A-expressing NK cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a year now, the world has been facing the pandemic of COVID-19, which has affected many sectors of society in an unprecedented proportion. The main objective of this paper was to investigate whether there are relationships between empathy, prosocial behavior, and adherence to measures to fight COVID-19 in a sample of Brazilian participants. Results point to the influence of education, living conditions, political orientation, and empathy on the adoption of measures to contain the virus, and on personal impressions regarding the disease. Specifically, participants with more years of education, with better conditions of practice social distancing, and those who identified themselves as leftist or center-leftist were more favourable to adopting virus containment measures and to practicing physical distancing. Higher levels of empathy were also associated to more positive attitudes concerning those measures. It is argued that political polarization and divergences between discourses by scientists, health authorities, politicians, and the Brazilian rulers may be reinforcing the perception of division in society.

Findings: Enforcement is less effective when: it is applied inconsistently;rules are ambiguous;behaviours are unobservable. Providing food and financial support, creating social norms and increasing trust are more effective in addressing specific barriers and fostering voluntary adherence. Where enforcement forms part of the strategy for policing COVID-19 regulations, rules must be clear and local responders must be given time and opportunity to plan their response as new rules are implemented. Research limitations/implications: This narrative review was limited to papers published in English and available either via the databases searched, or via reference searching;some relevant studies may therefore not have been identified. Practical implications: Findings inform an understanding of the impact of enforcement on adherence and facilitate the development of recommendations for increasing adherence to protective behaviours during COVID-19.

These isolates were identified by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies produced against reference serotypes: Mass, Conn, and Ark. RT-PCRs were performed on viral RNAs to amplify S1 gene using a specific set of primers S1OLIGO3 and S1OLIGO5. Restriction polymorphism (RFLP) of PCR products was determined by the use of HaeIII restriction enzyme. As expected, patterns of PCR products were different from common pattern of strains assigned to Mass serotype M41, Beaudette, H120, and Florida. Molecular analysis showed a nucleotide insertion in hypervariable region one (HVR-1) of S1 gene of only Quebec isolates (Qu16, Qu_mv and Q_37zm). However, New Brunswick IBV isolate (NB_cp) did not display these insertions. Major amino acid changes involved insertion of two stretches (aa(118C119): ArgCSer and aa(141C145): SysCSerCAsnCAlaCSerCCys) located at N-terminal and C-terminal regions of HVR-2. It is speculated that cysteine residue located upstream and downstream of CysCSerCAsnCAlaCSerCCys segment might be involved in the formation of loop structure and disulfide bond that could trigger important epitope changes. Insertion of new NXT and NXS (XP) glycosylation motifs scattered along S1 region and insertion of cysteine residues in HVR are contributing to the antigenic shifting of Quebec isolates.

Heterogeneity, Egger's test, evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias, and subgroup analyses were rigorously evaluated. Results: Intended outcomes of 12 eligible studies were mortality, clinical improvement, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation (MV), adverse events (AEs), intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, virus clearance time (VCT), and negative conversion. Corticosteroid administration was associated with a 27% risk reduction in MV [hazard ratio (HR): 0.73 (0.64-0.83)] and a 20% reduction in mortality of critically ill/severe COVID-19 patients [HR: 0.80 (0.65-0.98)]. Interestingly, shorter ICU stays and, conversely, potentially longer hospital stays, a longer VCT, and a longer time to negative conversion were associated with corticosteroid use. There was no significant impact of different corticosteroid doses on mortality. Only one study showed slightly excess significant bias. Caution should be applied given the weak nature of the evidence, and it has been confirmed by sensitivity analyses too.

Whether all populations, including pregnant and lactating individuals, will mount a comparable response to a booster dose is not known. OBJECTIVE: We sought to profile the humoral immune response to a COVID-19 mRNA booster dose in a cohort of pregnant, lactating, and age-matched nonpregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: We characterized the antibody response against ancestral Spike and Omicron in a cohort of 31 pregnant, 12 lactating and 20 nonpregnant age-matched controls who received a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster dose after primary COVID-19 vaccination. We also examined the vaccine-induced antibody profiles of 15 maternal:cord dyads at delivery. RESULTS: Receipt of a booster dose during pregnancy resulted in increased IgG1 against Omicron Spike (post-primary vaccination vs post-booster, p = 0.03). Pregnant and lactating individuals exhibited equivalent Spike-specific total IgG1, IgM and IgA levels and neutralizing titers against Omicron compared to nonpregnant women. Subtle differences in Fc-receptor binding and antibody subclass profiles were observed in the immune response to a booster dose in pregnant compared to nonpregnant individuals. Analysis of maternal and cord antibody profiles at delivery demonstrated equivalent total Spike-specific IgG1 in maternal and cord blood, yet higher Spike-specific Fc-gamma-R3a-binding antibodies in the cord relative to maternal blood (p = 0.002), consistent with preferential transfer of highly functional IgG. Spike-specific IgG1 levels in the cord were positively correlated with time elapsed since receipt of the booster dose (Spearman R 0.574, p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that receipt of a booster dose during pregnancy induces a robust Spike-specific humoral immune response, including against Omicron. If boosting occurs in the third trimester, higher Spike-specific cord IgG1 levels are achieved with greater time elapsed between receipt of the booster and delivery. Receipt of a booster dose has the potential to augment maternal and neonatal immunity.","output":"COVID-19 booster dose antibody response in pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This project presents a prototype of lux meter integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) and data saving.

Persons at risk of severe disease, for example, those receiving immunosuppressive therapies for chronic inflammatory cdiseases (CIDs), are prioritised for vaccination. However, data concerning generation of protective antibody titres in immunosuppressed patients are scarce. Additionally, mRNA vaccines represent a new vaccine technology leading to increased insecurity especially in patients with CID. OBJECTIVE: Here we present for the first time, data on the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in a cohort of immunosuppressed patients as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: 42 healthy controls and 26 patients with CID were included in this study (mean age 37.5 vs 50.5 years). Immunisations were performed according to national guidelines with mRNA vaccines. Antibody titres were assessed by ELISA before initial vaccination and 7 days after secondary vaccination. Disease activity and side effects were assessed prior to and 7 days after both vaccinations. RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as neutralising activity could be detected in all study participants. IgG titres were significantly lower in patients as compared with controls (2053 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL 1218 vs 26851102). Side effects were comparable in both groups. No severe adverse effects were observed, and no patients experienced a disease flare. CONCLUSION: We show that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines lead to development of antibodies in immunosuppressed patients without considerable side effects or induction of disease flares.

Vaccines offer the best hope for controlling its deleterious effects, but not everybody is willing to be vaccinated, so it is important to explore variables that might predict vaccination willingness. The present study addressed this by drawing upon the Social Identity Approach, which posits that people's membership of social groups is consequential for their thoughts and behaviour. Specifically, it was predicted that people's strength of identification with their local community (a social group that came to particular prominence during the pandemic) would positively predict their willingness to engage in community-related prosocial normative behaviour (i.e., their perceived sense of duty, as a community member, to get vaccinated) and that this, in turn, would predict higher levels of vaccination willingness. Participants (N = 130) completed an online survey, which supported the hypothesized mediation model, even after controlling for subjective neighbourhood socio-economic status and age (two variables that are particularly likely to impact upon vaccination willingness). To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply Social Identity Approach principles to the study of COVID-19 vaccination willingness.

To find effective drugs, the parameters of binding sites were calculated by SeeSAR. In addition, potential miRNAs were predicted according to RNA base-pairing. After prediction by using NCBI, WebMGA and GeneMark and comparison, a total of 8 credible ORFs were detected. Even the whole genome have great difference with other CoVs, each ORF has high homology with SARS-CoVs (>90%). Furthermore, domain composition in each ORFs was also similar to SARS. In the DrugBank database, only 7 potential drugs were screened based on the sequence search module.

METHODS A 17-item online mixed methods survey was distributed to academic staff across 31 Irish and UK medical schools. Participants were asked about (a) the effect of the pandemic on undergraduate research teaching and project opportunities, (b) measures taken to mitigate pandemic effects on these curricular elements. Descriptive analysis was used to summarise quantitative data, and free-text responses were thematically grouped. FINDINGS We received a 66.74% (n = 21) response rate to our survey. Over 75% of respondents stated that the availability of clinical research, lab-based research, summer research programmes and QI/clinical audit projects was negatively impacted by Covid-19. Mitigation strategies included adaptation and adjustment in design of research projects; migration to online content delivery and collaborative platforms; virtualisation of research dissemination opportunities; increased workload for staff involved in delivery of research programmes; flexibility around assessment of research-based assignments; and importance of open communication. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Covid-19 has affected traditional clinical research opportunities for medical students, particularly patient-facing projects, as well as laboratory-based research options.

Key questions are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. We assessed these questions using virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as a proxy for infectious virus shedding. Methods Clinical and virological data were obtained from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (89 intensive care, 40 medium care). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify if viral RNA load, detection of viral subgenomic RNA, serum neutralizing antibody response, duration of symptoms, or immunocompromised status were predictive for a positive virus culture. Findings Infectious virus shedding was detected in 23 of the 129 patients (17,8%). The median duration of shedding was 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and the probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13,4-17,2). Multivariate analyses identified viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p<0,001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p<0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Infectious virus shedding drops to undetectable levels below a viral RNA load threshold and once serum neutralizing antibodies are present, which warrants the use of quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.","output":"Shedding of infectious virus in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): duration and key determinants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To better understand SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration and infectivity, we estimated SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration, described characteristics associated with viral RNA shedding resolution(1), and determined if replication-competent viruses could be recovered 10 days after symptom onset among individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We collected serial nasopharyngeal specimens at various time points from 109 individuals with rRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in Utah and Wisconsin. We calculated probability of viral RNA shedding resolution using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and evaluated characteristics associated with shedding resolution using Cox proportional hazards regression. We attempted viral culture for 35 rRT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal specimens collected 10 days after symptom onset. RESULTS: The likelihood of viral RNA shedding resolution at 10 days after symptom onset was approximately 3%.

A potential near real-time predictor of future case numbers is human mobility; however, research on the predictive power of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for epidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes model. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process captures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates the rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R varies across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson regression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure incorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model was evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used mobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5 billion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication data, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest telecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared error. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The improvement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons between 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is superior.

Longevity also brings challenges in the form of a polymorbid geriatric population that places financial pressure on healthcare systems. Regardless, one disease dominates the debate about financial sustainability due to the increasing numbers of people diagnosed, and that is Alzheimers disease (AD). The presented paper aims to demonstrate the economic burden of social and healthcare services. Data from two regions in the Czech Republic were selected to demonstrate the potential scope of the problem. The future costs connected with AD are calculated by a prediction model, which is based on a population model for predicting the number of people with AD between 2020 and 2070. Based on the presented data from the two regions in the Czech Republic and the prediction model, several trends emerged. There appears to be a significant difference in the annual direct costs per person diagnosed with AD depending on the region in which they reside. This may lead to a significant inequality of the services a person can acquire followed by subsequent social issues that can manifest as a lower quality of life. Furthermore, given the prediction of the growing AD population, the costs expressed in constant prices based on the year 2020 will increase almost threefold during the period 2020C2070.

We define exposure density ([Formula: see text]) as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring in distinct land-use types. Using detailed neighborhood data for New York City, we quantify neighborhood exposure density using anonymized smartphone geolocation data over a 3-mo period covering more than 12 million unique devices and rasterize granular land-use information to contextualize observed activity. Next, we analyze disparities in community social distancing by estimating variations in neighborhood activity by land-use type before and after a mandated stay-at-home order.

Our findings demonstrate distinct behavioral patterns across neighborhoods after the stay-at-home order and that these variations in exposure density had a direct and measurable impact on the risk of infection. Notably, we find that an additional 10% reduction in exposure density city-wide could have saved between 1,849 and 4,068 lives during the study period, predominantly in lower-income and minority communities.","output":"Exposure density and neighborhood disparities in COVID-19 infection risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the high pressure structural aspects of thorium dialuminide, ThAl2, by performing evolutionary crystal structure searches and first principles calculations.

Comparison of crystal parameters and ELFs for ambient and high pressure phases indicates that a change of Al-Al bonding under pressure is responsible for the structural phase transition. Furthermore, we computed the high P-T phase diagram by including the temperature effects via free energies for the most relevant structures, namely, AlB2-type, MgCu2-type and new hexagonal. We found that a MgCu2-type structure becomes stable only under high P-T conditions.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the effects of the app in patients with severe OSAHS. METHODS: Forty patients with severe OSAHS (apneaChypoxia index [AHI]>30) were enrolled prospectively and randomized into an intervention group that used the app for 90 sessions or a control group. Anthropometric measures, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (0-24), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (0-21), Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) scores, and oxygen desaturation index were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, 28 patients remained. No significant changes were observed in the control group; however, the intervention group showed significant improvements in most metrics. AHI decreased by 53.4% from 44.7 (range 33.8-55.6) to 20.88 (14.02-27.7) events/hour (P<.001). The oxygen desaturation index decreased by 46.5% from 36.31 (27.19-43.43) to 19.4 (12.9-25.98) events/hour (P=.003). The IOPI maximum tongue score increased from 39.83 (35.32-45.2) to 59.06 (54.74-64.00) kPa (P<.001), and the IOPI maximum lip score increased from 27.89 (24.16-32.47) to 44.11 (39.5-48.8) kPa (P<.001). The AHI correlated significantly with IOPI tongue and lip improvements (Pearson correlation coefficient ?0.56 and ?0.46, respectively; both P<.001).

In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, with their potential to escape neutralization by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. GS-621763 was also potently antiviral against a genetically unrelated emerging coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 administration reduced viral load and lung pathology; treatment also improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral which has recently received EUA approval, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious in mice.

Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are a biomarker of inflammatory disease activity in MS, but little is known about the relation of age and gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans in people with MS. In this study, we investigated the association of age and other risk factors with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI in a retrospective cross-sectional clinical MS cohort. METHODS: In a cohort including 1543 people with CIS and MS, we investigated the association of the risk factors age, sex, disease course, immunomodulatory drug (IMD) treatment, and disability with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: Age was the most important factor associated with gadolinium enhancement, with the odds of gadolinium enhancement decreasing with advancing age. Participants with CIS had lower odds of gadolinium enhancement (odds ratio of 0.42, 95% confidence interval of 0.24-0.72 compared to RRMS). Sex, disease course and IMD treatment were not significantly associated with gadolinium enhancement in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation shows that gadolinium enhancement is strongly associated with age.

Here, we report on the bio-guided fractionation of H. noldeae and assessment of the inhibitory properties of some fractions and purified compounds on NLRP3 inflammasome and Interleukin 6 (IL-6). The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was determined by detecting the activity of caspase-1 and the production of Interleukin 1? (IL-1?) in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP-stimulated Tamm-Horsfall Protein 1 (THP-1) macrophages, while the production of IL-6 was studied in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. It was observed that hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the crude extract of the aerial parts of H. noldeae, as well as caffeic acid, isoquercetin, and ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions revealed significant inhibitory effects on Caspase-1 activities, and on IL-1? and IL-6 production. The ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions downregulated the production of IL-1? and IL-6, in a similar range as the caspase-1 inhibitor AC-YVAD-CHO and the drug Dexamethasone, both used as controls, respectively.

METHODS: A Bayesian synthesis design was applied to integrating the empirical evidence on the one-arm compassion study and the two-arm ACTT-1 trial for COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir. A multistate model was developed to model the dynamics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from three transient states of low, medium-, and high-risk until the two outcomes of recovery and death. The outcome measures for clinical efficacy comprised high-risk state, death, and discharge. RESULTS: The efficacy of remdesivir in reducing the risk of death and enhancing the odds of recovery were estimated as 31% (95% CI, 18-44%) and 10% (95% CI, 1-18%), respectively. Remdesivir therapy for patients with low-risk state showed the efficacy in reducing subsequent progression to high-risk state and death by 26% (relative rate (RR), 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93) and 62% (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.48), respectively.

However, it is important to emphasize that not all commercial video games are equal, and their effects strongly depend on specific characteristics of the games. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to describe the literature on the use of commercial off-the-shelf video games for diminishing stress and anxiety, examining the research outcomes along with critical variables related to computer game characteristics (ie, genre, platform, time of play). METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. The search databases were PsycINFO, Web of Science, Medline, IEEExplore, and the Cochrane Library. The search string was: [(video game*) OR (computer game*)] AND [(stress) OR (anxiety) OR (relaxation)] AND [(study) OR (trial) OR (training)]. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria for the publication period 2006-2021. The findings demonstrate the benefit of commercial off-the-shelf video games for reducing stress in children, adults, and older adults. The majority of the retrieved studies recruited young adults, and fewer studies have involved children, middle-aged adults, and older adults. In addition to exergames and casual video games, other genres of commercial off-the-shelf games helped to reduce stress and anxiety.

While there is an abundance of genetic association studies in controlled medical settings, there is a paucity of studies with a naturalistic design in real-life clinical practice in patients with comorbidities and under multiple drug treatment regimens. African patients are often burdened with communicable and noncommunicable comorbidities, yet the application of pharmacogenomics in African clinical settings remains limited. Using warfarin as a model, this study aims at minimizing gaps in precision/personalized medicine research in African clinical practice. We present, therefore, pharmacogenomic profiles of a cohort of 503 black Africans (n = 252) and Mixed Ancestry (n = 251) patients from Southern Africa, on warfarin and co-prescribed drugs in a naturalized noncontrolled environment. Seventy-three (n = 73) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 29 pharmacogenes were characterized using a combination of allelic discrimination, Sanger sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and Sequenom Mass Array. The common comorbidities were hypertension (43C46%), heart failure (39C45%), diabetes mellitus (18%), arrhythmia (25%), and HIV infection (15%). Accordingly, the most common co-prescribed drugs were antihypertensives, antiarrhythmic drugs, antidiabetics, and antiretroviral therapy. We observed marked variation in major pharmacogenes both at interethnic levels and within African subpopulations. The Mixed Ancestry group presented a profile of genetic variants reflecting their European, Asian, and African admixture. Precision medicine requires that African populations begin to capture their own pharmacogenetic SNPs as they cannot always infer with absolute certainty from Asian and European populations. In the current historical moment of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also underscore that the spectrum of drugs interacting with warfarin will likely increase, given the systemic and cardiovascular effects of COVID-19, and the anticipated influx of COVID-19 medicines in the near future. This observational clinical pharmacogenomics study of warfarin, together with past precision medicine research, collectively, lends strong support for incorporation of pharmacogenetic profiling in clinical settings in African patients for effective and safe administration of therapeutics.","output":"Warfarin Pharmacogenomics for Precision Medicine in Real-Life Clinical Practice in Southern Africa: Harnessing 73 Variants in 29 Pharmacogenes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to identify the urgency and the form of law enforcement reform in the COVID-19 pandemic era.

Anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin) are a class of cytotoxic agents used in treatment of breast cancer, sarcomas, or hematological malignancies that are associated with high risk of cardiotoxicity that is observed in even up to 30% of patients and can be diagnosed years after the therapy. The mechanism, in which anthracyclines cause cardiotoxicity are not well known, but it is proposed that dysregulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), one of main humoral regulators of cardiovascular system, may play a significant role. There is increasing evidence that drugs targeting this system can be effective in the prevention and treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity what has recently found reflection in the recommendation of some scientific societies. In this review, we comprehensively describe possible mechanisms how anthracyclines affect RAAS and lead to cardiotoxicity. Moreover, we critically review available preclinical and clinical data on use of RAAS inhibitors in the primary and secondary prevention and treatment of cardiac adverse events associated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","output":"Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systemfrom molecular mechanisms to therapeutic applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The safety and efficacy of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in the context of cirrhosis have not been established. We hypothesized that LAGB in cirrhotic patients is a safe procedure that may offer positive long-term benefits, both in terms of obesity and avoiding progression of liver disease. METHODS Data were gathered from a prospectively maintained database of 8402 patients who had undergone LAGB from November 1993 and April 2014. RESULTS Fourteen patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis were identified in the database. In all cases, cirrhosis was an unexpected macroscopic finding at the time of surgery, confirmed with intraoperative biopsy. All patients were either Child-Pugh A or B. No patients had preoperative clinical evidence of decompensated liver disease. The mean initial weight was 116.6 kg and BMI 38.9. There was no operative mortality. Two patients experienced a surgical complication (Clavien-Dindo grade II and grade IIIa). At 12 months, the mean excess weight loss was 61.3% giving a mean BMI 31.7. Repeat biopsies were available in three patients. All demonstrated improvement in inflammation and two had fibrosis regression. Baseline liver biochemistry was compared in nine patients who had repeat biochemistry studies after 12 months. There was a significant improvement in alanine transaminase (ALT) (p = 0.04) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (p = 0.02). Two patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One has died as a result of this disease 11 years after LAGB surgery. CONCLUSION LAGB may be a safe and effective bariatric intervention in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Our findings support the need for a prospective study with paired liver biopsies.","output":"Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding In Patients with Unexpected Cirrhosis: Safety and Outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nisin, a food-grade antimicrobial peptide produced by lactic acid bacteria has been examined for its probable interaction with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor, the site where spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds.

The mortality rate across countries had ranged from 1% up to more than 10% and it is underestimated in some countries. Advanced age is the most frequently reported factor associated to mortality. Other factors were the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. Several models for mortality prediction had been developed to assist in improving the prognosis. The aim of our study was to assess the factors related to mortality among COVID-19 patients and develop a prediction model based on these factors. Methods: A retrospective cohort study assessed the factors related to the mortality among COVID-19 patients who attended Imperial Hospital isolation centre on November- December, 2020, Khartoum, Sudan. Statistical tests performed were chi-square test, odds ratio and regression to develop the prediction model. Tests were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results: 105 patients were studied. 29% of the patients were deceased, while, 71% were discharged alive. A statistically significant association was found between the age and severity with regards to mortality rate (p=0.034, 0.018 respectively).

Objectives To explore the experiences of community pharmacists in relation to provision of community pharmacy services during COVID-19 pandemic. Setting Community pharmacists in Kosovo. Methods This was a cross-sectional study where data was collected via a self-administered online questionnaire, from 264 pharmacists actively practicing in Kosovo during the pandemic. The questionnaire consisted of a combination of closed and open-ended questions, optional statements and statements on a five-point Likert scale, derived at least in part from the Transtheoretical Model. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in responses to Likert-type items whereas categorical variables were analyzed using Chi square testing. Main outcome measures Community pharmacists' perceptions on COVID-19 related preventative measures. Results A response rate of 40.6% was achieved. Sufficient and adequate COVID-19-related preventative measures were being implemented by a majority of pharmacies (n = 232; 87.9%), and over two-thirds of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that their pharmacies were sufficiently prepared with protective equipment for their personnel. Implementation of preventative measures was associated with respondents' perception that pharmacists and the pharmacy profession were valued more by patients during the pandemic and to a lesser degree, by other health professionals. Most commonly stated pros dealt with employee and patient safety, while key cons dealt with increased costs and running out of the necessary protective equipment. Key barriers to pharmacy activities were price increases by wholesalers, and patients' panic and excessive buying, whereas drivers dealt with professional obligation to assist and opportunity to prove inseparable to other health professionals. The most popular means of accessing COVID-19 related information by pharmacists was via mobile devices and information from professional organizations was considered most useful by pharmacists. Conclusions Community pharmacies actively implemented various measures as precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our findings highlight the value of continuous provision of information by professional organizations and use of mobile devices as key means to access information by pharmacists.","output":"Provision of community pharmacy services during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross sectional study of community pharmacists' experiences with preventative measures and sources of information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the use of social media platforms by medical students, surgical trainees, and practicing surgeons for surgical education during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Using an original survey of 350 mobility platform drivers conducted in May 2020 and a pre-pandemic set of semi-structured interviews with driver communities, I find that mutual aid dispersed through associative, informal labor networks became an essential infrastructure of support for drivers during the pandemic. Most drivers in Jakarta were able to mobilize pre-existing labor networks for extensive material and emotional support. However, results indicate this support was not universally accessible: the pre-pandemic structures of a driver's community and the driver's own participation within the community correlated with the magnitude of community support a driver reported receiving. By putting CSCW literature in conversation with broader literature on informal urbanism, this paper shows how informal labor networks and mutual aid can be a transformative, even outside of formal union structures. By analyzing the forms and limits of these networks this paper also carries lessons in how to build solidarity amongst distributed workforces. At the same time, this study highlights the role of local socio-economic context in shaping gig worker experiences of the pandemic. Thus, it points to the need for more contextually driven analysis of both gig worker precarity and what are deemed effective forms of labor solidarity ? 2021 Owner/Author.","output":"What's in a Network?

METHODS: We used nationwide register data on all hospitalized COVID-19 cases between February and June 2020 (n = 2232) and random controls from the general population (n = 498117). We performed logistic regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and socioeconomic and demographic factors. Main outcome measure was Hospitalization with COVID-19. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are estimated by using logistic regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and socioeconomic and demographic factors. RESULTS: Among 2232 COVID-19 cases, the OR of hospitalization with COVID-19 among immigrants and descendants of Non-Western origin was 2.5 times higher (95% CI: 2.23 to 2.89) than that of the majority population, with most pronounced results among individuals from Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, and Somalia. The OR was largely attributed to comorbidity and socioeconomic factors, especially household size, occupation, and population density.

The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3). RESULTS: Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60C100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were  4.79  0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30  0.26 in whole blood units. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30  0.26 on average in whole blood.

Methods: Data were collected in June 2020 from 933 community-based adults in Alberta without a previous diagnosis of PTSD. The Primary Care PTSD Screen was adapted to assess pandemic-related PTSD symptoms. Participants were asked if alcohol or cannabis use had increased in the past month. Adjusted logistic regression models examined associations between probable PTSD and substance use. Results: Significantly more women (19%) than men (13%) met criteria for probable pandemicCrelated PTSD, while a similar percentage (13.5% of women, 13.0% of men) reported increased substance use during the pandemic. Adults with lower income, education, or pandemic-related job loss were more vulnerable to PTSD and substance use increases. Probable pandemic-related PTSD was associated with increased substance use for both women (OR = 2.2) and men (OR = 2.3) in adjusted models.

Objective was to describe the morphology, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of SPNs in patients under 20 years of age and present a detailed review of literature. METHODS: A total of 29 cases in patients under 20 years of age reported as SPN during the period January 2014 to December 2019, were included in the study. These included 19 resection specimens, 4 incision biopsies and 6 cases received as blocks for second opinion. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides as well as immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides of all cases were retrieved and reviewed by the authors. TFE3 and Progesterone Receptor were performed retrospectively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of the 29 patients were females. Ages of patients ranged from 12 to 19 years. Nineteen cases were resections. Tail was the commonest location. Mean tumor size was 9.5 cm. In 89.5% cases, tumor was confined to the pancreas. In 2 cases, distant metastasis was present. In 2 cases, extension beyond pancreas was seen. Solid and pseudopapillary areas were seen in all cases while other features were variable. Beta catenin and Cyclin D1 were positive in most cases while TFE3 was positive in 57% cases. Progesterone Receptor (PR) was positive in all 13 cases in which it was performed. Follow up was available in 14 patients. Follow up period ranged from 3 to 70 months. Twelve were alive and well without recurrence or metastasis while 2 were alive with recurrence and metastasis to liver and omentum respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although many studies on SPNs have been published, surgeons, oncologists and even pathologists in this part of the world are often not aware of these rare tumors leading to inaccuracies and delays in diagnosis. In addition, this paper focusses on the interesting observation that the majority of SPNs diagnosed in our department during study period occurred in patients under 20 years of age (29 versus 21 in patients over 20). However, clinico-epidemiological, morphologic and prognostic features were similar in both age groups. Possibility of SPNs should always be considered in case of pancreatic neoplasms occurring in patients under 20 years of age as well.

The patient-physician agreement for the symptom review was assessed via Cohen kappa (), through which the interrater reliability was calculated. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether the patient-reported outcome was different among symptoms, types of cancer, demographics, and physicians experience. RESULTS: Among the 181 patients (158 women and 23 men; median age 54.4 years), there was a fair scoring agreement (=0.24; 95% CI 0.16-0.33) for symptoms that were entered 2 to 4 weeks before the intended review (first rating) and a moderate agreement (=0.41; 95% CI 0.34-0.48) for symptoms that were entered within 1 week of the intended review (second rating). However, the level of agreement increased from moderate (first rating, =0.43) to substantial (second rating, =0.68) for common symptoms of pain, fever, diarrhea, obstipation, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis. Similar congruency levels of ratings were found for the most frequently entered symptoms (first rating: =0.42; second rating: =0.65). The symptom with the lowest agreement was hair loss (=C0.05). With regard to the latency of symptom entry into the review, hardly any difference was demonstrated between symptoms that were entered from days 1 to 3 and from days 4 to 7 before the intended review (=0.40 vs =0.39, respectively). In contrast, for symptoms that were entered 15 to 21 days before the intended review, no congruency was demonstrated (=C0.15). Congruency levels seemed to be unrelated to the type of cancer, demographics, and physicians review experience. CONCLUSIONS: The shared monitoring and review of symptoms between patients and clinicians has the potential to improve the understanding of patient self-reporting. Our data indicate that the integration of ePRO into oncological clinical research and continuous clinical practice provides reliable information for self-empowerment and the timely intervention of symptoms.

The CAP represents the main cause for sepsis and septic shock in ED, and the most frequent cause of death and admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to infectious disease. Overall mortality is 10-14% according to age and associated risk factors. Forty to 60% of CAP will require hospital admission, including observation units (with very variable ranges from 22-65% according to centers, seasonal of the year and patients characteristics).

The nucleolus, a highly dynamic and structured membrane-less sub-nuclear compartment, is the site of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis and is involved in numerous cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control and viral infection. Importantly, transient nucleolar trafficking of both Tat and HIV-1 viral transcripts are critical in HIV-1 replication, however, the role(s) of the nucleolus in HIV-1 replication remains unclear. To better understand how the interaction of Tat with the nucleolar machinery contributes to HIV-1 pathogenesis, we investigated the quantitative changes in the composition of the nucleolar proteome of Jurkat T-cells stably expressing HIV-1 Tat fused to a TAP tag. Using an organellar proteomic approach based on mass spectrometry, coupled with Stable Isotope Labelling in Cell culture (SILAC), we quantified 520 proteins, including 49 proteins showing significant changes in abundance in Jurkat T-cell nucleolus upon Tat expression. Numerous proteins exhibiting a fold change were well characterised Tat interactors and/or known to be critical for HIV-1 replication. This suggests that the spatial control and subcellular compartimentaliation of these cellular cofactors by Tat provide an additional layer of control for regulating cellular machinery involved in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Pathway analysis and network reconstruction revealed that Tat expression specifically resulted in the nucleolar enrichment of proteins collectively participating in ribosomal biogenesis, protein homeostasis, metabolic pathways including glycolytic, pentose phosphate, nucleotides and amino acids biosynthetic pathways, stress response, T-cell signaling pathways and genome integrity. We present here the first differential profiling of the nucleolar proteome of T-cells expressing HIV-1 Tat.

Recent social movements have called for substantial police reforms, including defunding the police, a phrase originating from a larger, historical abolition movement advocating that public investments be redirected away from the criminal justice system and into social services and health care. Although research has demonstrated the expansive role of police to respond a broad range of social problems and health emergencies, existing research has yet to fully explore the capacity for health insurance policy to influence rates of arrest in the population. To fill this gap, we examine the potential effect of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on arrests in 3,035 U.S. counties. We compare county-level arrests using FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data before and after Medicaid expansion in 2014C2016, relative to counties in non-expansion states. We use difference-in-differences (DID) models to estimate the change in arrests following Medicaid expansion for overall arrests, and violent, drug, and low-level arrests. RESULTS: Police arrests significantly declined following the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. Medicaid expansion produced a 20C32% negative difference in overall arrests rates in the first three years. We observe the largest negative differences for drug arrests: we find a 25C41% negative difference in drug arrests in the three years following Medicaid expansion, compared to non-expansion counties. We observe a 19C29% negative difference in arrests for violence in the three years after Medicaid expansion, and a decrease in low-level arrests between 24C28% in expansion counties compared to non-expansion counties. Our main results for drug arrests are robust to multiple sensitivity analyses, including a state-level model. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence in this paper suggests that expanded Medicaid insurance reduced police arrests, particularly drug-related arrests. Combined with research showing the harmful health consequences of chronic policing in disadvantaged communities, greater insurance coverage creates new avenues for individuals to seek care, receive treatment, and avoid criminalization. As police reform is high on the agenda at the local, state, and federal level, our paper supports the perspective that broad health policy reforms can meaningfully reduce contact with the criminal justice system under historic conditions of mass criminalization.","output":"The consequences of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act for police arrests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

Some epitopes were detected in either early or chronic HIV-1 infection whereas others were detected in both stages. Different distribution patterns of minority variant epitopes were observed in sample pairs; with some increasing or decreasing over time, while others remained constant. Some of the identified epitopes have not been previously reported for HIV-1 subtype C. There were also variants that could not be mapped to reported CTL epitopes in the Los Alamos HIV database. CONCLUSION: Deep sequencing revealed many Pol CTL epitopes, including some not previously reported for HIV-1 subtype C. The findings of this study support the inclusion of RT and IN epitopes in HIV-1 vaccine candidates as these proteins harbour many CTL epitopes.

The current study examined the interactive effects of ACES, the ability to recognize emotional intensity and depressive symptoms in 249 preschoolers enriched for depression. Findings demonstrated that when experiencing ACES, sad (not happy) emotion recognition was associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Specifically, when facing multiple ACEs, preschoolers with poor and moderate ability to recognize sad emotional intensity exhibited elevated depressive symptoms.

Innovative solutions to facilitate remote therapeutic drug monitoring are therefore required. Low-volume intracapillary blood sampling can be undertaken by patients at home and samples returned by post to central laboratories. We sought to report the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on requests for therapeutic drug monitoring and the equivalence, acceptability and effectiveness of low volume Patient-led Remote IntraCapillary pharmacoKinetic Sampling (fingerPRICKS) compared to conventional venepuncture. METHODS We undertook a cross-sectional blood sampling methods comparison study and compared sample types using linear regression models. Drug and antidrug antibody levels were measured using standard ELISAs. Acceptability was assessed using a purpose-designed questionnaire. RESULTS Therapeutic drug monitoring requests for adalimumab (96.5 [70.5 - 106] per week to 52 [33.5 - 57.0], p < 0.001) but not infliximab (184.5 [161.2 - 214.2] to 161 [135 - 197.5], p = 0.34) reduced during the first UK stay-at-home lockdown compared with the preceding six months.Fingerprick sampling was equivalent to conventional venepuncture for adalimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab drug, and anti-adalimumab and -infliximab antibody levels. The median (IQR) volume of serum obtained using intracapillary sampling was 195L (130-210). More than 87% (90/103) patients agreed that intracapillary testing was easy and 69% (71/103) preferred it to conventional venepuncture.In routine care, 75.3% (58/77) patients returned two blood samples within 14 days to permit remote assessment of biologic therapeutic drug monitoring.

The aim of the review was to identify procedure-specific indications and outcomes for reoperative procedures. METHODS Literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting indications for and outcomes after reoperative bariatric surgery. Specifically, operations to treat complications, failed weight loss, and weight regain were evaluated. Abstract and manuscript reviews were completed by the task force members to identify, grade, and categorize relevant studies. RESULTS A total of 819 articles were identified in the initial search. After review for inclusion criteria and data quality, 175 articles were included in the systematic review and analysis. The majority of published studies are single center retrospective reviews. The evidence supporting reoperative surgery for acute and chronic complications is described. The evidence regarding reoperative surgery for failed weight loss and weight regain generally demonstrates improved weight loss and co-morbidity reduction after reintervention. Procedure-specific outcomes are described. Complication rates are generally reported to be higher after reoperative surgery compared to primary surgery.

We then statistically analyzed the incidence of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. We included 3044 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 12 studies. The most common cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were myocardial injury (21.2%, 95% CI 12.3-30.0%) and arrhythmia (15.3%, 95% CI 8.4-22.3%), followed by heart failure (14.4%, 95% CI 5.7-23.1%) and acute coronary syndrome (1.0%, 95% CI 0.5-1.5%). The pooled incidence of heart failure, arrhythmia and myocardial injury in non-survivors were 47.8% (95% CI 41.4-54.2%), 40.3% (95% CI 1.6-78.9%) and 61.7% (95% CI 46.8-76.6%), respectively.

Few studies have investigated the psychological stress of students in Health University during the COVID-19 outbreak, and almost no work has attended to the influencing factors that may cause their psychological stress risk. This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental measurement from 2,498 medical students and 1,177 non-medical students in 31 provinces from March 5, 2020, to March 10, 2020, in China. The psychological stress was measured using the Chinese Perceived Stress Scales (CPSS) under a self-design questionnaire. Sociodemographic, major characteristics, and knowledge of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were also identified as potential influencing factors of stress. The study revealed that medical students are suffering from more stress than non-medical students almost in all provinces of China. Four influencing factors including level of familiarity with the novel coronavirus, family income, major of students, and status of the intern student can be significantly related to students stress in the medical group by using the univariate and multivariate analysis. Further analysis showed that students with low stress had a greater number of positive psychological emotions and a lower number of negative psychological emotions than with medical students with high stress. In addition, high stress caused low enthusiasm for learning in these medical students and lead to little/no willingness to do professional medical work in the future.

This study aimed to explore COVID-19-related fear, depressive and anxiety symptoms, social responsibility, and behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 10 to April 13, 2020. Members of the Greek general population completed anonymously an online survey, distributed through the social media. Among the 3,700 adult respondents, 3,029 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The survey included sociodemographic questions, questions exploring potential risk factors for increased fear of COVID-19, questions about the employment of safety and checking behaviors, and questions about compliance with public health guidelines. In addition, four psychometric scales were used, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and Steeles Social Responsibility Motivation scale. Multivariate General Linear Models (GLM) were used to depict significant differences among dependent variables (FCV-19S, PHQ-9, GAD-7) and independent variables (potential risk factors, safety and checking behaviors, compliance with guidelines). The relationship between the FCV-19S total score and influencing factors was quantified by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Several participants reported high levels of COVID-19-related fear (35.7%) and moderate to severe depressive symptoms (22.8%), while a significant proportion reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (77.4%). Women scored altogether significantly higher than men. Respondents under the age of 30 reported less fear and depressive symptoms and showed the least social responsibility. Based on GLM, a significant others COVID-19 illness, being on psychiatric medication, employment of safety and checking behaviors, and compliance with guidelines were associated with higher COVID-19-related fear. Linear regression analysis revealed that gender, age, depressive, and anxiety symptoms modified levels of COVID-19-related fear. CONCLUSIONS: Greater behavioral responses to the pandemic, that is, excessive employment of safety/checking behaviors and greater compliance with guidelines, were shown to amplify fear, potentially due to increased contamination awareness.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated its limitations. Mobile health clinic programs in the US already play important, albeit under-appreciated roles in the healthcare system. They provide access to healthcare especially for displaced or isolated individuals; they offer versatility in the setting of a damaged or inadequate healthcare infrastructure; and, as a longstanding community-based service delivery model, they fill gaps in the healthcare safety-net, reaching social-economically underserved populations in both urban and rural areas. Despite an increasing body of evidence of the unique value of this highly adaptable model of care, mobile clinics are not widely supported. This has resulted in a missed opportunity to deploy mobile clinics during national emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as using these already existing, and trusted programs to overcome barriers to access that are experienced by under-resourced communities. MAIN TEXT: In March, the Mobile Healthcare Association and Mobile Health Map, a program of Harvard Medical School's Family Van, hosted a webinar of over 300 mobile health providers, sharing their experiences, challenges and best practices of responding to COVID 19. They demonstrated the untapped potential of this sector of the healthcare system in responding to healthcare crises. A Call to Action: The flexibility and adaptability of mobile clinics make them ideal partners in responding to pandemics, such as COVID-19. In this commentary we propose three approaches to support further expansion and integration of mobile health clinics into the healthcare system: First, demonstrate the economic contribution of mobile clinics to the healthcare system. Second, expand the number of mobile clinic programs and integrate them into the healthcare infrastructure and emergency preparedness. Third, expand their use of technology to facilitate this integration. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the economic and social impact that mobile clinics are having in our communities should provide the evidence to justify policies that will enable expansion and optimal integration of mobile clinics into our healthcare delivery system, and help us address current and future health crises.","output":"Mobile health clinic model in the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons learned and opportunities for policy changes and innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A global pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing spread.

Given that personality attributes might affect the manifestation of psychological disorders, it was hypothesized that depression, anxiety and stress mediate the relationship between impulsivity-related traits and orthorexic eating, noting that previous research had evaluated the role of depression as a mediator between impulsivity and other pathological eating behaviors. The study objectives were to explore the mediating effect of depression, anxiety, and stress, on impulsivity and orthorexia nervosa, and healthy orthorexia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted between July and December 2019 recruited 519 Lebanese adults from seven community pharmacies randomly selected from a list provided by the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists. RESULTS: Our results showed that depression and anxiety were positively correlated with ON. We also found a notable gender difference in findings: higher anxiety and female gender were significantly associated with higher TOS healthy orthorexia, while higher stress was associated with lower TOS healthy orthorexia. Finally, higher urgency was associated with lower TOS healthy orthorexia, while higher perseverance was significantly associated with higher TOS healthy orthorexia. Depression and anxiety partially mediated the association between perseverance and ON while anxiety and stress partially mediated the association between urgency and healthy orthorexia. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that depression, anxiety and stress play a mediating role between impulsivity and orthorexia nervosa/healthy orthorexia. Our findings provide a ground for future investigations of impulsive behaviors, psychopathology, and orthorexia in different populations.

Inadequate antibiotic prescriptions have been frequently reported, especially for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI); many patients receive antibiotics for viral pneumonia or bronchiolitis or broad-spectrum antibiotics for not complicated community-acquired pneumonia. For this reason, healthcare organizations need to implement strategies to raise physicians awareness about this kind of drug and their overall effect on the population. The implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs and the use of Clinical Pathways (CPs) are excellent solutions because they have proven to be effective tools at diagnostic and therapeutic levels. AIMS: This study evaluates the impact of CPs implementation in a Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), analyzing antibiotic prescriptions before and after the publication in 2015 and 2019. The CP developed in 2019 represents an update of the previous one with the introduction of serum procalcitonin. The study aims to evaluate the antibiotic prescriptions in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) before and after both CPs (2015 and 2019). METHODS: The periods analyzed are seven semesters (one before CP-2015 called PRE period, five post CP-2015 called POST 1C5 and 1 post CP-2019 called POST6). The patients have been split into two groups: (i) children admitted to the Pediatric Acute Care Unit (INPATIENTS), and (ii) patients evaluated in the PED and sent back home (OUTPATIENTS). We have analyzed all descriptive diagnosis of CAP (the assessment of episodes with a descriptive diagnosis were conducted independently by two pediatricians) and CAP with ICD9 classification. All antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric patients with CAP were analyzed. RESULTS: A drastic reduction of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescription for inpatients has been noticed; from 100.0% in the PRE-period to 66.7% in POST1, and up to 38.5% in POST6. Simultaneously, an increase in amoxicillin use from 33.3% in the PRE-period to 76.1% in POST1 (p-value 0.078 and 0.018) has been seen. The outpatients groups broad-spectrum antibiotics prescriptions decreased from 54.6% PRE to 17.4% in POST6. Both for outpatients and inpatients, there was a decrease of macrolides. The inpatient groups antibiotic therapy duration decreased from 13.5 days (PRE-period) to 7.0 days in the POST6. Antibiotic therapy duration in the outpatient group decreased from 9.0 days (PRE) to 7.0 days (POST1), maintaining the same value in subsequent periods. Overlapping results were seen in the ICD9 group for both inpatients and outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that CPs are effective tools for an antibiotic stewardship program. Indeed, broad-spectrum antibiotics usage has dropped and amoxicillin prescriptions have increased after implementing the CAP CP-2015 and the 2019 update.","output":"Multistep antimicrobial stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescriptions and treatment duration in children with pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In order to be eligible for consultant appointments within the NHS, orthodontists can undertake higher specialty training after their Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST). These training posts are known as Post-CCST positions and orthodontists must be eligible for inclusion on the General Dental Council's (GDC) specialist list for orthodontics before applying. There has been a decline in the number of applicants and the number of filled Post-CCST positions in recent years, leading to concerns over a potential shortage of appropriately trained consultant orthodontists to provide a secondary care service in the near future. This survey was undertaken to identify barriers to applying for Post-CCST training and assess potential options for increasing trainee numbers. METHODS An online survey was distributed, by email, to current orthodontic trainees and those that had recently completed training in the last six months via the British Orthodontic Society Training Grades Group. Reminder emails were sent at two and four weeks. A total of 201 trainees were invited to complete the survey. RESULTS Eighty-nine trainees completed the survey (response rate of 44.3%). Regarding applying to Post-CCST training, 32.6% and 47.7% of respondents, respectively, either wanted to or were considering applying for Post-CCST training. The South East was the most preferred region for Post-CCST training (38.0%). Reasons for not wishing to complete Post-CCST training included salary (71.9%), lack of consultant posts in desired regions (64.1%) and inability/unwillingness to relocate (63.5%). Part-time training (91.0%) and a higher salary during training (86.0%) were most likely to incentivise application for Post-CCST training. CONCLUSION Financial, family and geographical concerns appear to be the main reasons why trainees might not consider Post-CCST training. Part-time and run-through training options may encourage trainees to apply for Post-CCST training.","output":"Barriers to Post-CCST training in orthodontics: A survey of trainee perceptions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona (COVID-19) epidemic has triggered interest in many fields of technology, medicine, science, and politics. Most of the mathematical research in this area focused on analyzing the dynamics of the spread of the virus. In this article, after a review of some current methodologies, a non-linear system of differential equations is developed to model the spread of COVID-19. In order to consider a wide spectrum of scenarios, we propose a susceptible-exposedinfected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQRS)-model which was analyzed to determine threshold conditions for its stability, and the number of infected cases that is an infected person will transmit on a virus to, reproduction number R0 is calculated. It is established that the disease-free state is globally asymptotically stable when the reproduction number is less than unity and unstable if its value is more than one. The model is tested against real data taken from the Ministry of Health in Jordan covering three time periods between March and September 2020 wherein two infection peaks occurred in the country. Simulations show consistency and accurate spread predictions within the optimistic range and the proposed model is distinguished by its applicability to aspects including recurrent infections, asymptomatic carriers over several timespans as well as the aforementioned waves of infection. ? 2022, Tech Science Press.

Recent studies have unveiled protein interactions of SARS-COV-2 in different cell lines and through a number of high-throughput approaches. Here, we carried out a comparative analysis of four experimental and one computational studies to characterize the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. Although hundreds of interactors have been identified, only twenty-one appear in all the experiments and show a strong propensity to bind. This set of interactors includes stress granule forming proteins, pre-mRNA regulators and elements involved in the replication process. Our calculations indicate that DDX3X and several editases bind the 5 end of SARS-CoV-2, a regulatory region previously reported to attract a large number of proteins. The small overlap among experimental datasets suggests that SARS-CoV-2 genome establishes stable interactions only with few interactors, while many proteins bind less tightly. In analogy to what has been previously reported for Xist non-coding RNA, we propose a mechanism of phase separation through which SARS-CoV-2 progressively sequesters human proteins hijacking the host immune response.","output":"Phase Separation Drives SARS-CoV-2 Replication: A Hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sexual assault advocates provide support to survivors as they navigate medical, legal, housing, and other complex systems.

While the evidence suggests the potential of well-designed curriculum-based interventions that target known risk factors of violence at the community level, this has certain limitations for working in partnership with communities in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries, particularly when it comes to addressing the power dynamics embedded within north-south research relationships. METHODS: As an alternative approach, we outline the study design for the EVE Project: a formative research project implemented in partnership with community-based researchers in Samoa and Amantan (Peru) using a participatory co-design approach to VAWG prevention research. We detail the methods we will use to overcome the power dynamics that have been historically embedded in Western research practices, including: collaboratively defining and agreeing research guidelines before the start of the project, co-creating theories of change with community stakeholders, identifying local understandings of violence to inform the selection and measurement of potential outcomes, and co-designing VAWG prevention interventions with communities. DISCUSSION: Indigenous knowledge and ways of thinking have often been undermined historically by Western research practices, contributing to repeated calls for better recognition of Southern epistemologies. The EVE Project design outlines our collective thinking on how to address this gap and to further VAWG prevention through the meaningful participation of communities affected by violence in the research and design of their own interventions. We also discuss the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the project in ways that have both disrupted and expanded the potential for a better transfer of power to the communities involved. This article offers specific strategies for integrating Southern epistemologies into VAWG research practices in four domains: ethics, theories of change, measurement, and intervention design. Our aim is to create new spaces for engagement between indigenous ways of thinking and the evidence that has been established from the past two decades of VAWG prevention research and practice.","output":"Decolonising violence against women research: a study design for co-developing violence prevention interventions with communities in low and middle income countries (LMICs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). Information on their molecular epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics in the tropical region of southeast Asia however is limited. Here, we analyzed the phylogenetic, temporal distribution, population history, and clinical manifestations among patients infected with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 2,060 consenting adults presented with acute URTI symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2013. The presence of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. A total of 68/2,060 (3.3%) subjects were positive for human alphacoronavirus; HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected in 45 (2.2%) and 23 (1.1%) patients, respectively. A peak in the number of HCoV-NL63 infections was recorded between June and October 2012. Phylogenetic inference revealed that 62.8% of HCoV-NL63 infections belonged to genotype B, 37.2% was genotype C, while all HCoV-229E sequences were clustered within group 4. Molecular dating analysis indicated that the origin of HCoV-NL63 was dated to 1921, before it diverged into genotype A (1975), genotype B (1996), and genotype C (2003). The root of the HCoV-229E tree was dated to 1955, before it diverged into groups 1-4 between the 1970s and 1990s.

Moreover, age-associated kidney failure has been widely accepted. However, efforts to demonstrate aging-dependent renal metabolic rewiring have been limited. In the present study, we investigated aging-related renal metabolic determinants by integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic data sets from kidneys of young (3 months, n = 7 and 3 for respectively) and old (24 months, n = 8 and 3 for respectively) naive C57BL/6 male mice. Metabolite profiling analysis was conducted, followed by data processing via network and pathway analyses, to identify differential metabolites. In the aged group, the levels of glutathione and oxidized glutathione were significantly increased, but the levels of gamma-glutamyl amino acids, amino acids combined with the gamma-glutamyl moiety from glutathione by membrane transpeptidases, and circulating glutathione levels were decreased. In transcriptomic analysis, differential expression of metabolic enzymes is consistent with the hypothesis of aging-dependent rewiring in renal glutathione metabolism; pathway and network analyses further revealed the increased expression of immune-related genes in the aged group. Collectively, our integrative analysis results revealed that defective renal glutathione metabolism is a signature of renal aging.

Evidence-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies for patients on B-cell-depleting therapies are scarce. We aimed to investigate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines in patients receiving CD20-targeted B-cell-depleting agents for autoimmune disease, malignancy, or transplantation. METHODS: The RituxiVac study was an investigator-initiated, single-centre, open-label study done at the Bern University Hospital (Bern, Switzerland). Patients with a treatment history of anti-CD20-depleting agents (rituximab or ocrelizumab) and with no previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between April 26 and June 30, 2021, for analysis of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (by interferon- [IFN] release assay) at least 4 weeks after completing vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Healthy controls without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were also enrolled at least 4 weeks after completing vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. All study participants received two doses of either the PfizerCBioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a history of anti-CD20 treatment who showed a humoral immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in comparison with immunocompetent controls. Prespecified secondary endpoints were the effect of anti-CD20 therapy (including time since last treatment and cumulative dose) on humoral or cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and biomarkers of immunocompetence. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04877496. FINDINGS: The final study population comprised 96 patients and 29 immunocompetent controls. The median age of patients was 67 years (IQR 57C72) and of controls was 54 years (45C62), and 51 (53%) of 96 patients and 19 (66%) of 29 controls were female. The median time since last anti-CD20 treatment was 107 years (IQR 048C255) and the median cumulative dose of an anti-CD20 depleting agent was 280 g (150C500). Anti-spike IgG antibodies were detected in 47 (49%) of 96 patients 179 months (IQR 116C248) after the second vaccine dose compared to 29 (100%) of 29 controls 181 months (117C248) after the second vaccine dose (p<0001). SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN release was detected in 13 (20%) of 66 patients and 21 (75%) of 28 of healthy controls (p<0001). Only nine (14%) of 66 patients were double positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG and cell-mediated responses, compared with 21 (75%) of 28 healthy controls (p<0001). Time since last anti-CD20 therapy (>76 months; positive predictive value 078), peripheral CD19(+) cell count (>27 cells per L; positive predictive value 070), and CD4(+) lymphocyte count (>653 cells per L; positive predictive value 071) were predictive of humoral vaccine response (area under the curve [AUC] 67% [95% CI 56C78] for time since last anti-CD20 therapy, 67% [55C80] for peripheral CD19(+) count, and 66% [54C79] for CD4(+) count).

Like Spiroplasma mirum, S. eriocheiris infects the newborn mouse (adult mice are not infected) and can cause cataract. Adhesion-related protein is an important protein involved in the interaction between pathogen and host. In this study, the Adhesin-like Protein (ALP) of S. eriocheiris was detected on its outer membrane by using immune electron microscopy, and was found to be involved in the bacterium's infection of mouse embryo fibroblasts (3T6-Swiss albino). Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that ALP interacts with a diverse group of mouse proteins. The interactions between recombinant partial fibulin7 (FBLN7; including two epidermal growth factor [EGF] domains) and ALP were confirmed by Far-western blotting and colocalization. We synthetized the domains of FBLN7 [EGF domain: amino acids 136C172 and complement control protein (CCP) domain: 81C134 amino acids], and demonstrated that only EGF domain of FBLN7 can interact with ALP. Because the EGF domain has high degree of similarity to EGF, it can activate the downstream EGFR signaling pathway, in key site amino acids.

This unexpected and abrupt change of curriculum delivery from previously well-established educational programs has not been without challenges, and subsequently identified a need for improvements in online teaching and learning practices. In September of 2020, a group of dental students and motivated faculty at Western University Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry came together in response to the pandemic and established an online feedback model (V1). This feedback model created the foundation for a Students as Partners program (SaP). SaP programs provide students and faculty the opportunity to foster academic partnerships and together be part of the teaching and learning process. This program allowed dentistry students to provide real-time feedback on curricular content and delivery as teaching and learning shifted online. In order to evaluate the impact a real-time feedback model has in enhancing teaching and learning, it is crucial to determine whether the feedback model closes the feedback loop. Closing the feedback loop is a systematic process where student feedback is shared with students and faculty, timely actions are taken to implement changes from the student voice, and the effectiveness of actioned improvements is monitored. MATERIALS AND METHODS To assess if the V1 feedback system closes the feedback loop to enhance teaching and learning, we distributed Qualtrics surveys with 7-point Likert scale statements and free-text response questions to obtain student and faculty perspectives on their awareness, use, and perceived effectiveness of the V1 feedback system. RESULTS After collecting pilot data from students and faculty on their perspectives of the V1feedback system, changes were made to the model of SaP and essential elements were re-established. The student perspective reported that 73% (n=11) of students disagreed that they were well aware of the V1 feedback system and its intended use, 78% (n=10) disagreed that the V1 feedback system provided a solution for real-time improvements, and 80% (n=5) disagreed that they were notified of changes being made to the feedback they provided. These results identified closing the feedback loop was not taking place in this V1 model. CONCLUSION Since increasing the awareness of the SaP program, an updated feedback system (V2) that closes the feedback loop to enhance teaching and learning in dental and undergraduate medical science education was developed and is being evaluated. Further analysis will determine if the V2 feedback system closes the feedback loop in a real-time feedback model. SIGNIFICANCE This research is intended to assist researchers in dental and undergraduate medical science education with a feedback model that elicits student voices while enhancing the teaching and learning experience.","output":"An Interactive Feedback Model for Enhancing Teaching and Learning in Dental and Undergraduate Medical Science Education."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infant mortality from viral infection remains a major global health concern: viruses causing acute infections in immunologically mature hosts often follow a more severe course in early life, with prolonged or persistent viral replication. Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN- supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-B, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN- responses.","output":"Functional Limitations of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Limit Type I Interferon, T Cell Responses and Virus Control in Early Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lyssaviruses are an important genus of zoonotic viruses which cause the disease rabies.

CT was entrapped in PLGA NPs by nanoprecipitation, and the resulting NPs were characterized using dynamic light scattering and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the particle size and CT loading efficiency, respectively. In vitro biocompatibility of the NPs was examined in human dermal fibroblasts. Permeation, washability, and staining experiments were carried out using skin-mimetic Strat-M membranes in Franz diffusion cells. The optimal CT-loaded PLGA NPs achieved 92% loading efficiency and were 133 nm in size with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.10 and a zeta potential of ?40 mV, promoting colloidal stability during storage. CT NPs significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of crude CT in human dermal fibroblasts, maintaining more than 75% cell viability at the highest concentration tested, whereas an equivalent concentration of CT was associated with 28% viability. Permeation studies showed that only a negligible amount of CT NPs could cross the Strat-M membrane after 24 h, with 97% of the applied dose found accumulated within the membrane. The superiority of CT NPs was further demonstrated by the notably diminished staining ability and enhanced washability compared to those of crude CT.

Better understanding of the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis should contribute significantly towards the development of improved prophylactic, therapeutic and diagnostic reagents to control infections. In the present investigation, transcriptional profiles were analyzed by using RNA recovered from the lung tissue of IBV infected 18-day-old chicken embryos at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h post IBV infection. This microarray analysis was completed using avian cDNA arrays comprised of fragments of 1191 unique chicken and turkey gene transcripts. These arrays were generated from normalized cDNA subtraction libraries that were derived from avian pneumovirus (APV) infected chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures and tissues obtained from APV infected turkeys subtracted with their respective uninfected cultures and tissues. Of the 1191 unique genes represented on the array, the expression of a total of 327 genes (27% of total) were altered by two-fold or more from 6 through 72 h post-infection. A comparative analysis of IBV regulated genes with genes previously reported to change in expression following infection with other avian respiratory viruses revealed both conserved and unique changes. Real-time qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulated expression of genes related to several functional classes including kinases, interferon induced genes, chemokines and adhesion molecules, vesicular trafficking and fusion protein genes, extracellular matrix protein genes, cell cycle, metabolism, cell physiology and development, translation, RNA binding, lysosomal, protein degradation and ubiquitination related genes.

We built a mutation-annotated reference SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny with two main macro-haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and more than 160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing a rather uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could have implications for diagnostics and the design of future vaccines. Identification of the root of SARS-CoV-2 genomes is not without problems, owing to conflicting interpretations derived from either using the bat coronavirus genomes as an outgroup or relying on the sampling chronology of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and TMRCA estimates; however, the overall scenario favors haplogroup A as the ancestral node. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a TMRCA for SARS-CoV-2 genomes dating to November 12, 2019, thus matching epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2 most likely originated in Europe from an Asian ancestor and gave rise to subclade A2a, which represents the major non-Asian outbreak, especially in Africa and Europe.

The ratio between Ti and Cu was approximately kept one, with the variation of the Ag content between 10 and 35 at.%, while the power on the targets is changed during each deposition to get the desired Ag content. Thin film characterization is performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanoindentation (modulus and hardness), to quantitatively evaluate the scratch adhesion, and atomic force microscopy to determine the surface topography. The residual stresses are measured by focused ion beam and digital image correlation method (FIB-DIC). The produced Ti-Cu-Ag thin films appear to be smooth, uniformly thick, and exhibit amorphous structure for the Ag contents lower than 25 at.%, with a transition to partially crystalline structure for higher Ag concentrations. The Ti-Cu control film shows higher values of 124.5 GPa and 7.85 GPa for modulus and hardness, respectively. There is a clear trend of continuous decrease in the modulus and hardness with the increase of Ag content, as lowest value of 105.5 GPa and 6 GPa for 35 at.% Ag containing thin films. In particular, a transition from the compressive (?36.5 MPa) to tensile residual stresses between 229 MPa and 288 MPa are observed with an increasing Ag content.

While infectious bronchitis (IB) is considered primarily a disease of the respiratory system, different IBV strains may show variable tissue tropisms and also affect the oviduct and the kidneys, with serious consequences. Some strains replicate in the intestine but apparently without pathological changes. Pectoral myopathy has been associated with an important recent variant. Several factors can influence the course of infection with IBV, including the age, breed and nutrition of the chicken, the environment and intercurrent infection with other infectious agents. Immunogenic components of the virus include the S (spike) proteins and the N nucleoprotein. The humoral, local and cellular responses of the chicken to IBV are reviewed, together with genetic resistance of the chicken. In long-term persistence of IBV, the caecal tonsil or kidney have been proposed as the sites of persistence. Antigenic variation among IBV strains is related to relatively small differences in amino acid sequences in the S1 spike protein. However, antigenic studies alone do not adequately define immunological relationships between strains and cross-immunisation studies have been used to classify IBV isolates into protectotypes. It has been speculated that changes in the S1 protein may be related to differences in tissue tropisms shown by different strains. Perhaps in the future, new strains of IBV may arise which affect organs or systems not normally associated with IB.","output":"Infectious bronchitis virus: immunopathogenesis of infection in the chicken"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent approvals for novel agents such as the small molecule Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), combined with the advent of biosimilars has widened the gamut of available therapeutic options in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This combined with the introduction of mandatory non- medical switches to biosimilars in some jurisdictions by both public and private payors has led to a significant increase in the volume of therapeutic changes for patients. Pharmacists are well positioned to ensure effective and safe transitions, however there is a significant unmet need for objective and subjective clinical guidance around therapy as well disease state monitoring in RA that facilitates best practices throughout the patient journey. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we aim to create a consensus derived monitoring algorithm for pharmacists to facilitate best practices throughout therapeutic transitions from originator biologic to other originator biologics, biosimilars, and Janus kinase inhibitors in RA. METHODS: The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used to understand if consensus could be found among the participants. Clinically relevant questions were developed to capture solutions to the identified unmet need. The faculty considered the questions as individuals, and privately generated answers/ideas. After discussion and consideration, the participants ranked the ideas and established a consensus. RESULTS: Based on the outcome of the consensus discussions, an algorithm was created to help guide pharmacists through therapeutic transitions in RA. The tool covers important topics such as pre-transition considerations, avoiding the nocebo effect for biosimilars, specific considerations for each drug or class, monitoring efficacy, and when to refer. CONCLUSIONS: New classes of anti-rheumatic drugs including JAKi, along with the introduction of biosimilars are presenting more opportunity for therapeutic changes and monitoring in patients with RA. We hope our evidence-based consensus derived guidance tool will assist frontline pharmacists in supporting their patients to a successful therapeutic transition in RA.","output":"Monitoring the transition of patients on biologics in rheumatoid arthritis: Consensus guidance for pharmacists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential pharmacological value of extracts from honeysuckle on patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: The active components and targets of honeysuckle were screened by Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). SwissADME and pkCSM databases predict pharmacokinetics of ingredients. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database collected transcriptome data for mild COVID-19. Data quality control, differentially expressed gene (DEG) identification, enrichment analysis, and correlation analysis were implemented by R toolkit. CIBERSORT evaluated the infiltration of 22 immune cells. RESULTS: The seven active ingredients of honeysuckle had good oral absorption and medicinal properties. Both the active ingredient targets of honeysuckle and differentially expressed genes of mild COVID-19 were significantly enriched in immune signaling pathways. There were five overlapping immunosignature genes, among which RELA and MAP3K7 expressions were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Finally, immune cell infiltration and correlation analysis showed that RELA, MAP3K7, and natural killer (NK) cell are with highly positive correlation and highly negatively correlated with hematopoietic stem cells. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggested that honeysuckle extract had a safe and effective protective effect against mild COVID-19 by regulating a complex molecular network. The main mechanism was related to the proportion of infiltration between NK cells and hematopoietic stem cells.","output":"New Approach for Targeted Treatment of Mild COVID-19 by Honeysuckle through Network Pharmacology Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unintentional and violence-related injuries, including suicide, homicide, overdoses, motor vehicle crashes, and falls, were among the top 10 causes of death for all age groups in the United States and caused nearly 27 million nonfatal emergency department (ED) visits in 2019.*,?

Despite extensive research over the last several decades, neuropathic pain remains difficult to manage. METHODS The authors conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and crossover clinical trial to examine the effect of 1.5% topical diclofenac (TD) on neuropathic pain. The authors hypothesized that 1.5% TD would reduce the visual pain score and improve both quantitative sensory testing and functional status in subjects with neuropathic pain. The authors recruited subjects with postherpetic neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome. The primary outcome was subject's visual pain score. RESULTS Twenty-eight subjects completed the study (12 male and 16 female) with the mean age of 48.8 yr. After 2 weeks of topical application, subjects in 1.5% TD group showed lower overall visual pain score compared with placebo group (4.9 [1.9] vs. 5.6 [2.1], difference: 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.3; P = 0.04) as well as decreased burning pain (2.9 [2.6] vs. 4.3 [2.8], difference, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.6; P = 0.01). There were no statistical differences in constant pain, shooting pain, or hypersensitivity over the painful area between the groups. This self-reported improvement of pain was corroborated by the decreased pain summation detected by quantitative sensory testing. There were no statistically significant changes in functional status in these subjects. There were no complications in both groups.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly associated with cardiovascular complications requiring hospitalizations; however, the mechanisms underlying these complications remain unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are gasotransmitters that regulate key cardiovascular functions. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients and 33 controls and NO and H2S metabolites were assessed. H2S and NO levels were compared between cases and controls in the entire study population and subgroups based on race. The availability of gasotransmitters was examined based on severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. The performance of H2S and NO levels in predicting COVID-19 infection was also analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the effects of traditional determinants of gasotransmitters on NO and H2S levels in the patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Significantly reduced NO and H2S levels were observed in both Caucasian and African American COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher NO and H2S levels compared to COVID-19 patients who survived. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis of NO and H2S metabolites in the study population showed free sulfide levels to be highly predictive of COVID-19 infection based on reduced availability. Traditional determinants of gasotransmitters, namely age, race, sex, diabetes, and hypertension had no effect on NO and H2S levels in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: These observations provide the first insight into the role of NO and H2S in COVID-19 infection, where their low availability may be a result of reduced synthesis secondary to endotheliitis, or increased consumption from scavenging of reactive oxygen species.","output":"Decreased availability of nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide is a hallmark of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A dysregulated immune response characterized by the hyperproduction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (a.k.a.

Particularities of SARS-CoV-2, such as its persistence in surfaces and the lack of a curative treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, have pushed authorities to apply restrictive policies to control its spreading. As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their quality is a critical variable for decision-making actors, and therefore should be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of error in typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for diagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in the report of new cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time gaps, and other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a statistically-based algorithm, we perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors, building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion effectively occurred. We also statistically enhance the robustness behind the discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct test, which is typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing capabilities are fully dedicated to the evaluation of new cases.

OBJECTIVES To assess whole-body patterns of photodamage in an Australian population. METHODS A random sample of adult residents of Queensland underwent imaging across 10 body sites. Photodamage was graded from images using an ordinal photo-numeric scale. We used cluster analysis to identify whole-body photodamage patterns and prevalence proportion ratios (PPRs) to assess associated factors. RESULTS Of 190 adults (median age 52; 58% males), 58% showed severe or moderate-to-severe photodamage on most body sites. A higher proportion of woman had severe photodamage on the arms (upper: p=0.002, lower: p=0.034). A higher proportion of men had moderate or severe photodamage on the lower back (p=0.004). We identified four photodamage patterns: 'severe general' (n=24, 13%), 'moderate-severe general' (n=86, 45%), 'moderate-severe head, neck, dcolletage' (n=40, 21%), and 'mild-moderate upper body' (n=12, 6%). All participants with 'severe-general' photodamage were > 50 years, and more likely to have past skin cancer (PPR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.44-4.49) than those with moderate-severe head, neck, dcolletage photodamage. Those with 'moderate-severe general' photodamage showed similar associations, and were more likely female (PPR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.69). Past or current smoking was associated with having higher levels of photodamage, with no smokers in those with 'mild-moderate upper body' photodamage. CONCLUSIONS Moderate to severe photodamage across much of the body is common in Queensland adults and associated with age, sex, past skin cancer and smoking. Assuming a universal pattern of site-specific sun-exposure could lead to spurious correlations, while accurate and objective assessment of site-specific photodamage can add to understanding of the development of sun-associated skin cancers, in particular site-specific skin carcinogenesis. Additionally, degree of site-specific photodamage has the potential to assist skin cancer screening.","output":"High variability in anatomic patterns of cutaneous photodamage: a population-based study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Despite the wide variety of Covid-19 symptoms, pain and the related mechanisms underlying unsettled nociceptive status is still under-prioritized. Understanding the complex network of Covid-19-related pain may result in new lines of study. It is unknown whether patient's immunological background influence pain in the acute phase of Covid-19, including musculoskeletal pain. Thus, we evaluated the blood levels of selected molecules that are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyzed a possible correlation with pain during Covid-19. Methods A cohort of 20 hospitalized patients with confirmed diagnoses for Covid-19 were evaluated in the context of pain. Visual analogic scale (VAS) was applied to quantitate pain level. Blood tests were used to determine the systemic levels of cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1?), substance P, and leptin. The data was correlated when appropriate to determine the association between pain-related markers and assessed pain intensity. Results Our findings show that systemic levels of IL-10 have strong negative correlation with pain intensity on Covid-19 patients. Additionally, we also show that leptin systemic levels were increased in Covid-19 patients with pain, however, with moderate positive correlation between these events. IL-1? and SP levels did not differ between Covid-19 patients with or without pain. Men reported less pain compared to women. No differences were found between gender in the levels of the molecules evaluated in patients with pain.

In the new era that we are living in, where we live a life that coexists with the virus, we are participating in video conferences held online rather than on-site in order to slow the spread of the virus. Video conferencing has become our necessity since March 2020, and is becoming a new standard, especially in the MICE industry. Recently, however, people who have excessively used video conference platforms are complaining of video conference fatigue, which is a new negative emotion such as stress, anxiety, and worry as well as general work fatigue. Therefore, this study focused on the mechanism of video conferencing in MICE, which is rapidly digitally converted by the virus, and the digital psychological factors of the participants. This study derived the quality attributes of video conferencing in MICE and empirically analyzed the relationship with digital psychological factors of the video conference participants, such as video conference fatigue, social presence, and flow. One hundred and thirty-eight valid questionnaires collected from participants of several international academic conferences held in EXCO, Daegu, Korea, from 23 to 28 May 2021, were analyzed. The main results are as follows. First, unlike general video conference fatigue, MICE video conference fatigue was not found to be related to the preceding and following variables. This is due to the characteristics of the MICE video conference and the expertise of the participants. Second, social presence was identified as an important variable in MICE video conferencing.

It was initially thought that quality and productivity are opposite to each other and need to be compromised. Once an economic crisis occurred in the 1970s, a novel perspective on the quality-productivity relationship was proposed and played a prominent role in the recovery from that crisis. Researchers such as Deming proposed that productivity can in fact increase as quality increases. This perspective helped people in that crisis and has so far been continually explored in industry and academia. Now, herein, we propose a new perspective that is the reverse of the aforementioned perspective and has its own benefits. We examine it in machining that is a process used in almost all industrial activities. We consider the cutting speed as a productivity (and throughput) measure and the workpiece temperature as a quality metric. We show that why the workpiece temperature may decrease at higher cutting speeds. From various experimental data in the literature, we also realize that the behavior of the workpiece temperature versus the cutting speed is steeper before the peak than that after the peak. We analytically try to explain this observation as well. Then, we analyze our general perspective from three aspects. First, we propose and implement a volume partition analysis. Second, we introduce a new dimension in Taguchi's view of quality. Third, we introduce the circuit model in the realm of quality and productivity, based on which we develop the mutual interactions between quality and productivity. The proposed perspective in this study is expected to be a helpful mindset change in manufacturing both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. ? 2021 The Authors.

Older adults are the most sedentary age group, and decreasing sitting time represents an intervention target for improving health. Determinants of sedentary behavior have been examined in older adults living in their own homes, yet less is known about sedentary behavior of older adults in residential care facilities. The purpose of this study was to explore factors contributing to sedentary behavior among residents of independent and assisted living facilities. We conducted eight focus groups with residents (n = 44) and semi-structured interviews with staff (n = 6) across four living facilities. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative, inductive approach. Three salient themes were identified. Residents and staff both viewed sedentary behavior negatively unless it was in the context of social engagement. Additionally, fear of falling was discussed as a significant contributor to sedentary behavior. Finally, residents felt the community living environment contributed to their sedentary behavior while staff did not. Our findings provide valuable insight for designing targeted interventions for older adults in residential facilities and suggest thinking beyond the individual and considering environmental influences on sedentary behavior in the residential care setting.","output":"Personal and Environmental Contributors to Sedentary Behavior of Older Adults in Independent and Assisted Living Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is an abnormal vascular connection between arterial and venous channels within dura mater. Although DAVFs have been linked to other types of intracranial tumors, this is the first case reporting the association between DAVF and an epidermoid tumor. CASE DESCRIPTION A middle-aged patient with chronic headache presented with Borden type II DAVF draining into the right transverse sigmoid junction and was also found to have an epidermoid tumor over the right mastoid. The patient underwent staged embolization of the fistula through both transvenous and transarterial routes. Continuous intraoperative venous pressure monitoring confirmed marked reduction in intracranial venous pressure, and the patient's symptoms completely resolved. However, the fistula still remained. The residual DAVF was then surgically disconnected, and the epidermoid tumor was resected in the same procedure. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates a DAVF can be associated with an epidermoid tumor. Tumor can compromise the venous outflow, which can then lead to intracranial venous hypertension and development of the DAVF. Venous pressure monitoring offers an objective method to verify resolution of venous hypertension, which might correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms.","output":"Mastoid Epidermoid Tumor and Associated Dural Arteriovenous Fistula with Venous Sinus Occlusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Although it is well accepted that itch might be one of the symptoms related to diabetes mellitus, very little is known about this topic from previous studies. In the current study, we aimed to investigate itch sensation in type 2 diabetes mellitus with special emphasis on the potential underlying causes. According to our study, itch was a relatively frequent symptom, present in about 36% of subjects, causing significant impairment to quality of life. Based on our findings and previous literature data, it seems that the primary cause of itch in this group of subjects is poor diabetes control with subsequent skin dryness and diabetic polyneuropathy. ABSTRACT: Background: Despite growing interest in itch, data regarding itch in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) are still limited, and mostly based on outdated studies. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of itch in the adult population with DM2 and explore potential underlying causes. Methods: The study group consisted of 109 adult patients with DM2. Standardized questionnaires were completed in order to assess the itch intensity [Numerical Rating Scale (three days, 24hours) (NRS)] and the Four-item Itch Questionnaire (4IIQ) and to assess the psychological impact of itch [ItchyQoL, Six-Item Stigmatization Scale (6-ISS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)]. Skin dryness was evaluated clinically and by non-invasive assessment of epidermis moisturizing. Neuropathy was assessed using the clinical Katzenwadel neuropathy scale. Results: Itch occurred in 35.8% of adult patients with DM2, with NRS(max) three days 6.31  2.16 and 8.1  3.5 points in 4IIQ. Itchy patients have had significantly higher FPG levels compared with the non-itchy population (p = 0.01). Patients with itch had a significantly higher possibility of neuropathy compared with non-itchy subjects (p < 0.01). Skin xerosis was significantly more advanced in patients with itch compared to those without (p < 0.01). The mean ItchyQol score was assessed as 41.2  13.4 points, indicating mild life quality impairment and correlated positively with itch intensity. Itchy subjects had significantly higher scores in both anxiety and depression dimensions of HADS (in each p < 0.01). Conclusions: We suggest that the primary cause of itch is prolonged poor diabetes control with altered glucose and insulin levels, subsequently causing skin dryness and neuropathy in long-lasting DM2.","output":"Itch in Adult Population with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Clinical Profile, Pathogenesis and Disease-Related Burden in a Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Norwegian children have a lower intake of fruit, vegetables, and a higher intake of unhealthy snacks compared to dietary guidelines. Such dietary inadequacies may be detrimental for their current and future health. Schools are favorable settings to establish healthy eating practices. Still, no school meal arrangement is provided in Norway, and most children typically bring packed lunches from home. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serving a free healthy school meal for one year resulted in a higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of unhealthy snacks in total among 10-12-year-olds in Norway. METHODS: The School Meal Project in Southern Norway was a non-randomized trial in two elementary schools in rural areas in the school year 2014/2015. The study sample consisted of 10- to 12-year-old children; an intervention group (N = 55) and a control group (N = 109) resulting in a total of 164 school children at baseline. A food frequency questionnaire was completed by the children at baseline, at five months follow-up and after one year to assess fruit, vegetable, and snacks intake. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess intervention effects on overall intake of fruit and vegetables and unhealthy snacks. RESULTS: Serving of a free healthy school meal for one year was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches in the intervention group compared to the control group, adjusted for baseline intake (B: 1.11 (95% CI: .38, 1.85)) at the end of the intervention. No other significant intervention effects were found for the remaining fruit and vegetables measures. Serving of a free healthy school meal was not associated with a lower weekly intake of unhealthy snacks (i.e. potato chips, candy, sugar sweetened beverages) in the intervention group compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A free healthy school meal was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches but did not significantly change any other investigated dietary behaviors. However, given the inadequate intake of vegetables among children and that even moderate improvements have public health relevance, a free healthy school meal for all school children could be beneficial.

We explored the efficacy of KSK in reducing viral load and preventing the disease progression in asymptomatic, COVID-19 cases. METHODS: A prospective, single-center, open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a COVID Care Centre in Chennai, India. We recruited reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 of 18 to 55 years of age, without clinical symptoms and co-morbidities. They were randomized (1:1 ratio) to KSK (60 mL twice daily for 7 days) or standard of care (7 days supplementation of vitamin C 60,000 IU morning daily and zinc 100 mg evening daily) groups. The primary outcomes were reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 load [as measured by cyclic threshold (CT) value of RT-PCR], prevention of progression of asymptomatic to symptomatic state, and changes in the immunity markers including interleukins (IL-6, IL-10, IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF ). Siddha clinical assessment and the occurrence of adverse effects were documented as secondary outcomes. Paired t-test was used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: Viral load in terms of the CT value (RdRp: 95% CI = 1.89 to 5.74) declined significantly on the seventh day in the KSK group and that of the control group, more pronounced in the study group. None progressed to the symptomatic state. There was no significant difference in the biochemical parameters. We did not observe any changes in the Siddha-based clinical examination and adverse events in both groups. CONCLUSION: KSK significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load among asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and did not record any adverse effect, indicating the use of KSK in the strategy against COVID-19.

Interdisciplinary rehabilitation programs that include Acceptance and Commitment-based (ACT) components could be important to tackle the vicious circle linking progression of the disease, inactivity, and psychopathological symptoms. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of routinely collected data of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation program was performed. The program included group sessions including patient education, breathing exercise, occupational therapy and an ACT-based psychological treatment, and individual sessions of physical therapy. Demographic data, clinical characteristics of the patients and the values of outcome variables (health status, quality of life, anxiety, and depression) before treatment, at discharge, at 3 months, and at 6 months were extracted from medical records. Multiple imputation was employed to address missing data. Linear mixed models were employed to assess changes over time. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of a minimum clinically important change of health status from baseline to the 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: Data from 31 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 12 patients with bronchiectasis were extracted. Health status improved from baseline to discharge to the 3 months follow-up, but not to the 6 months follow-up. Anxiety and depression improved across all the time points. Quality of life did not improve over time. Having a worse health status at baseline and fewer depressive symptoms were significantly associated with achieving a minimum clinically important change of health status at 6 months. The effects of the interdisciplinary program were not different for patients with COPD or with bronchiectasis.

Nowadays, overweight/obesity among childrearing-age women has become rapidly increasing in both urban and rural areas. AIM: This study aimed to assess the variation of overweight/obesity among urban and rural reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. METHODS: For this study, the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data were used. The survey was a community-based cross-sectional study, which used a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique to select the participants. A total of 13,451 reproductive-age women were included in the analysis. Both descriptive and analytical analysis was performed. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used as the measure of statistical significance. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight/obesity among urban reproductive-age women was statistically higher (p = 21.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 18.2-25.1) than the rural women (p = 3.5%; 95% CI: 2.9%-4.2%). Women who attend secondary or above education, women in the age groups 25-34 and &#8805; 35 years, and high wealth index (rich) had higher odds of overweight/obesity in both urban and rural women. Moreover, women who were married, who had a large family size, and who have a history of alcohol intake had higher odds of overweight/obesity among urban women. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight/obesity among reproductive-age women is a public health problem in Ethiopia, especially for women who are living in urban settings. Therefore, it is important to establish targeted overweight reduction programs with particular emphasis on urban, older aged, educated, and married women. Additionally, encouraging the limitation of the number of family size and alcohol intake can reduce women's overweight/obesity.","output":"Comparative assessment of overweight/obesity among rural and urban reproductive-age women in Ethiopia: Evidence from a cross-sectional 2016 national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To identify Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases efficiently, affordably, and at scale, recent work has shown how audio (including cough, breathing and voice) based approaches can be used for testing. However, there is a lack of exploration of how biases and methodological decisions impact these tools performance in practice. In this paper, we explore the realistic performance of audio-based digital testing of COVID-19. To investigate this, we collected a large crowdsourced respiratory audio dataset through a mobile app, alongside symptoms and COVID-19 test results. Within the collected dataset, we selected 5240 samples from 2478 English-speaking participants and split them into participant-independent sets for model development and validation. In addition to controlling the language, we also balanced demographics for model training to avoid potential acoustic bias. We used these audio samples to construct an audio-based COVID-19 prediction model. The unbiased model took features extracted from breathing, coughs and voice signals as predictors and yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65C0.77). We further explored several scenarios with different types of unbalanced data distributions to demonstrate how biases and participant splits affect the performance. With these different, but less appropriate, evaluation strategies, the performance could be overestimated, reaching an AUC up to 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85C0.95) in some circumstances.

Both methods revealed limited amounts of polymorphism. Since the SSCP analysis concerned an expressed DRB gene it can be concluded that the level of functional MHC class II polymorphism, at least at the DRB locus, is low in Swedish moose. DNA fingerprinting was used to determine if the unusual pattern of low MHC variability could be explained by a low degree of genome\\\\wide genetic diversity. Hybridizations with two minisatellite probes gave similarity indices somewhat higher than the average for other natural population, but the data suggest that the low MHC variability cannot be explained by a recent population bottleneck. However, since minisatellite sequences evolve more rapidly than MHC sequences, the low levels of MHC diversity may be attributed to a bottleneck of more ancient origin. The selection pressure for MHC variability in moose may also be reduced and we discuss the possibility that its solitary life style may reduce lateral transmission of pathogens in the population.","output":"Limited polymorphism at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci in the Swedish moose A. alces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic deeply affected how schools and families functioned through most of 2020.

This study analyzed social class variations in the quantity and quality of homeschooling during the lockdown. Through an online questionnaire, 360 parents reported (1) their digital equipment and use, (2) the perceptions of their ability to homeschool their children, (3) how they handled homeschooling and (4) the extent to which they supported other activities considered more or less profitable from an educational point of view (e.g., reading, watching television). A social position index was used as a proxy of social class. The results indicated that all parents were highly involved in setting up homeschooling and that the lower the parents social position, the more they spent time homeschooling their children. However, in line with the digital divide literature, the lower the parents social position, the lower the digital equipment and the less the parents felt capable of homeschooling. Finally, the higher the social position of the families, the more children spent time doing activities considered to be educationally profitable, and the less they spent time doing unprofitable activities. Thus, even if all parents were highly involved in homeschooling, higher social position parents were better equipped both materially and psychologically to face the challenge of homeschooling.

Methods: Ranging in age 23-100 years, 77 persons living or working in an assisted living facility were tested for IgG and IgM just prior to receiving their 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine on 01/17/2021. Re-retesting occurred on Day 14, Day 21 (before dose 2), Day 28 and Day 42 (7 days and 21 days after dose 2). Medical histories, including underlying conditions and medications, were collected confidentially. Testing involved point-of-care lateral flow chromatography devices (under emergency use authorization as reported in our previous research on PCR+, humoral Ab- persons) using fingerstick samples. The lateral flow assay antigens included a recombinant nucleocapsid protein and a spike protein (S1) conjugated with colloid gold. Readings were recorded 15 min. after obtaining blood samples. Results: On the day of dose 1, one person had a faint IgM reading (and a known past history of COVID-19) and 3 others demonstrating detectable Ab were asymptomatic and had no known prior illness. None of these four persons were PCR + at the time of assay and their Ab profiles all further evolved following vaccination. Consistent with the original Pfizer clinical trial, on Day 14, 27 (69%) of the 39 persons <70 years old (yo) already were demonstrating a degree of new Ab production while 84% of the 38 persons >70 had no detectable Ab. However, by Day 21, just prior to receiving the second dose of vaccine, 100% of persons <60 yo had detectable Ab except for two persons taking immunosuppressants. In each successive decade of age, a progressively smaller % of persons showed Ab production (eg, among those >90 yo, 80% tested Ab negative). Seven days after the second dose, however, 100% of persons <80 yo had become Ab positive (except 2 taking immunosuppressants). Whereas only 89% of those in their 80s (n=18) and 78% of those in their 90s had IgG detected seven days after their second dose, by day 42, only two persons remained Ab negative (one taking immunosuppressants and the other was a 93 yo). Semi-quantitative results indicated strong Ab responses for 100% of those <80 yo on Day 42. Also, as previously demonstrated, the point of care chromatography device used for the assays had reproducible results and there was persistent Ab detection in all persons once they had turned positive. Conclusions: Age and immunosuppressant conditions impact the timing and degree of Ab production following mRNA vaccination. Contrasted with our prior Ab study findings regarding native COVID-19 disease in which some persons < 50 yo manifesting milder disease do not generate IgG/IgM, the current study did demonstrate that younger persons uniformly have a rapid onset of strong IgG development after mRNA vaccination, even before their second dose. While very elderly persons and those taking immunosuppressants generally had undetectable IgG production after the first dose of vaccine, almost everyone developed strong responses, regardless of age, within a week following dose two. Antibody development became even more evident and robust 21 days after the second dose of the vaccine.","output":"23 Degree, Timing and Factors Observed in COVID-19 Post-Vaccination Humoral Antibody Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies are a principal determinant of immunity for most RNA viruses and have promise to reduce infection or disease during major epidemics.

Methods: SEIR dynamics model was used to fit daily onset infections to search the start date of this resurgent COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing. The number of cumulative infections from June 12 to July 1 in Beijing were fitted considering different levels of control strength. Results: The current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing probably started between May 22 and May 28 (cumulative probability: 95%), with the highest probability on May 25 (23%). The R(0) of the current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic was 4.22 (95%CI: 2.88-7.02). Dynamic model fitting suggested that by June 11, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reached 99 (95%CI: 77-121), which was in line with the actual situation, and without control, by July 1, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reach 65 090 (95%CI: 39 068-105 037). Since June 12,comprehensive prevention and control measures have been implemented in Beijing, as of July 1,compared with uncontrolled situation, the number of infections had been reduced by 99%, similar to the fitting result of a 95% reduction of the transmission rate. The sensitivity analysis showed consistent results. Conclusions: For the emergent outbreak of COVID-19, the dynamics model can be used to infer the start time of the transmission and help tracing the source of epidemic. The comprehensive prevention and control measures taken in Beijing have quickly blocked over 95% of the transmission routes and reduced 99% of the infections, containing the sudden epidemic timely and effectively,which have value in guiding the prevention and control of the epidemic in the future.","output":"[Inference of start time of resurgent COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing with SEIR dynamics model and evaluation of control measure effect]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The [Formula: see text] -nearest neighbor ([Formula: see text] -NN) query is an important query in location-based service (LBS), which can query the nearest k points to a given point, and provide some convenient services such as interest recommendations.

The four-day course aims to provide a formative learning experience for final year medical, pharmacy, nursing, and paramedicine students. It focuses on building skills in professionalism, communication, leadership and interprofessional safe teamwork through structured learning activities and clinical simulation scenarios. METHODS: In 2018, we commenced focused ethnographic research involving participant observation, field notes, interviews, photography and ethnographic film. RESULTS: A total of 112 students participated in this research from the disciplines of medicine (n = 53), nursing (n = 27), pharmacy (n = 17), and paramedicine (n = 15). In a revisit to Van Genneps (1972) seminal work on liminality, we suggest that the course represents a liminal space where students ideas about what it means to be a healthcare professional are challenged, disrupted and reconstructed. We observed students emerging from the course with transformed professional and interprofessional identities. CONCLUSIONS: We posit that the ritualised and liminal nature of the course plays a role in the development of interprofessional identities by interrupting the reproduction of siloed biomedical culture.

Some patients who recovered from the infection developed long-term effects which have become of interest to the scientific and medical communities, as it relates to pathogenesis and the multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Long COVID (long-term or long-haul) is the collective term used to define recovered individuals of SARS-CoV-2 infection who have presented with persistent COVID symptoms, as well as the emergence of disorders and complications. Following the review of literature from major scientific databases, this paper investigated long COVID and the resulting post-sequela effects on survivors, regardless of initial disease severity. The clinical manifestations and multisystem complications of the disease specifically, cardiovascular, neurologic and psychologic, hematologic, pulmonary, dermatologic, and other ailments were discussed. Patients with chronic COVID-19 were found to experience heart thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction, inflammation, lung fibrosis, stroke, venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, brain fog, general mood dysfunctions, dermatological issues, and fatigue. As the disease continues to progress and spread, and with the emergence of new variants the management of these persisting symptoms will pose a challenge for healthcare providers and medical systems in the next period of the pandemic. However, more information is needed about long COVID, particularly concerning certain patient populations, variability in follow-up times, the prevalence of comorbidities, and the evolution of the spread of infection. Thus, continued research needs to be conducted concerning the disease pathology to develop preventative measures and management strategies to treat long COVID.","output":"Post-acute Sequelae in COVID-19 Survivors: an Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Queensland, Australia has been successful in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Underpinning that response has been a highly effective virus containment strategy which relies on identification, isolation, and contact tracing of cases. The dramatic emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered traditional paper-based systems for managing contact tracing no longer fit for purpose. A rapid digital transformation of the public health contact tracing system occurred to support this effort. Objectives The objectives of the digital transformation were to shift legacy systems (paper or standalone electronic systems) to a digitally enabled public health system, where data are centered around the consumer rather than isolated databases. The objective of this paper is to outline this case study and detail the lessons learnt to inform and give confidence to others contemplating digitization of public health systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This case study is set in Queensland, Australia. Universal health care is available. A multidisciplinary team was established consisting of clinical informaticians, developers, data strategists, and health information managers. An agile pair-programming approach was undertaken to application development and extensive change efforts were made to maximize adoption of the new digital workflows. Data governance and flows were changed to support rapid management of the pandemic. Results The digital coronavirus application (DCOVA) is a web-based application that securely captures information about people required to quarantine and creates a multiagency secure database to support a successful containment strategy. Conclusion Most of the literature surrounding digital transformation allows time for significant consultation, which was simply not possible under crisis conditions. Our observation is that staff was willing to adopt new digital systems because the reason for change (the COVID-19 pandemic) was clearly pressing.

Every player in Education sector had to adjust their performance. Teachers and students were unexpectedly thrown to online communication platforms, namely Teams, Zooms, and asked to continue classes on a new framework, without a priori preparation. This teaching style is defined as emergency remote teaching (ERT), contrasting to the planned and designed online learning.

In retinal degeneration-resistant CD-1 mice, only the acute infection is seen. In the present study, interferon (IFN)-gamma production during ECOR was studied and its role evaluated in the clearance of infectious virus from the retina. METHODS BALB/c, CD-1, and IFN-gamma-deficient (IFN-gamma gko) mice were inoculated with the JHM strain of murine coronavirus by the intravitreal route. Mouse eyes were evaluated for infiltrating cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression by immunocytochemical staining. Isolated retinas were analyzed for IFN-gamma mRNA by RT-PCR, and sera were evaluated for IFN-gamma protein by ELISA assays. RESULTS Virus infection in BALB/c mice was associated with an increase in the incidence and levels of systemic IFN-gamma. Moreover, IFN-gamma mRNA was detected within the retinas of infected animals during the acute phase of the disease but was not detected in normal or mock-injected animals. IFN-gamma mRNA was detected at the time of T-cell infiltration, and earlier studies have shown that this is temporally related to granzyme B gene expression and the clearance of infectious virus from the retina. Retinal IFN-gamma mRNA was also associated with the upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules within the retina. When this infection occurred in IFN-gamma gko mice, the virus was unchecked, and the infection led to death. CONCLUSIONS These studies indicate that generation of IFN-gamma by cells infiltrating the retina is an essential part of an immune mechanism responsible for noncytolytic clearance of infectious virus from the retina.","output":"The critical role of IFN-gamma in experimental coronavirus retinopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spondyloarthritis (Spa), Beh?ets disease (BD) and sarcoidosis are major systemic inflammatory diseases worldwide.

REVIEW FINDINGS: Child and adolescent mental health conditions are a common yet underrecognized risk factor for premature CVD. The American Heart Association has recently included psychiatric conditions as a CVD risk factor (CVDRF) and the evidence linking childhood adversity to cardiometabolic disease. There are bidirectional and additive effects from the intrinsic emotional dysregulation and inflammatory changes from the mental health condition, the associations with risky health behaviors, and in some cases, metabolic side effects from pharmacotherapy. These pathways can be potentiated by toxic stress, a physiologic response to stressors from childhood adversity. Toxic stress is also associated with development of mental health conditions with epigenetic effects that can result in transgenerational inheritance of cardiometabolic risk. Exposure to toxic stress and mental health conditions in isolation sometimes compounded by pharmacotherapies used in treatment increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases in childhood. The multiple pathways, which adversely influence cardiometabolic outcomes, encourage clinicians to consider strategies to mitigate these factors and justify the importance of early screening and treatment for CVDRFs. SUMMARY: Mental health, health behaviors, and environmental factors co-occur and intersect in complex pathways that can increase CVD risk over the lifespan. Early detection and response can mitigate the risks associated with premature development of CVD.","output":"How to Mitigate Risk of Premature Cardiovascular Disease Among Children and Adolescents with Mental Health Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This piece aims to give glimpses of how we slide and dis/connect in embodied-virtual nodes and nets during Covid-19 lock-down, where lecturers reach from the virtual to be near students whom they normally care for in a contact university. Similar to how the concept of the global South helps us to look at the world in more encompassing richness, poetic inquiry contributes to insight by exposing diversity and difference and by grounding research in body and emotion - because traditional research might miss the grains within which the stories sing. I conducted performative interviews to engage through Zoom with three women lecturers from the Durban University of Technology, where I support staff in eLearning. For close to thirty years here, I have been ever-perplexed by how we are affected and how selves morph as we criss-cross the thin membrane between corporeal and virtual. Here, encounters are often out-the-box performances that ring with grit and great heart, as networks of tech and teacher perform feats to be near their students.

This systematic review provided an evidence-based foundation to inform opportunities to mobilize and adapt existing resources to integrate care for individuals with TBI and MHSU by comprehensively summarizing existing integrated activities and reported barriers and facilitators to care integration. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Sociological Abstracts, and Dissertations & Theses Global were independently reviewed by two reviewers based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Data on the integration activity, level and type of integration, reported barriers and facilitators, and the strategies aligning with the World Health Organizations (WHO) Framework on Integrated Person-Centred Care were extracted to form the basis for a narrative synthesis. Fifty-nine peer-reviewed articles were included, describing treatments (N = 49), programs (N = 4), or screening activities (N = 7). Studies discussing clinical integration at the micro- (N = 38) and meso- (N = 10) levels, service integration at the micro- (N = 6) and meso- (N = 5) levels, and functional integration at the meso-level (N = 1) were identified.

Novel applications of biosensors include measurements in alternate sample types, such as saliva. Biosensors based on immobilized whole cells have found new applications, for example to detect the presence of cancer and to monitor the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 101 children aged between 2 months and 2 years diagnosed with clinical bronchiolitis between September 2011 and April 2012. The demographics and clinical, laboratory, and radiological results of the patients were recorded. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The patients were followed up for at least one year for new episodes, existence of wheezing, frequency of pulmonary infections, and progression of asthma. RESULTS: In half of the patients, determinants were indicated through the PCR method, with the most frequent being respiratory syncytial virus (44%). The frequency of bronchiolitis was higher in prematures (p<0.005). There was a relationship between crowded family structure and the existence of wheezing (p=0.003), increased recurrence (p=0.014), and need for inhaler treatment (p=0.014). The frequency was higher in patients living in urban cities (p<0.001), in houses with heating stoves (p=0.001), and in houses with smokers (p=0.001). Patients living in houses with heating stoves had more severe episodes (p=0.018). Recurrent wheezing and the need for regular inhaler usage were positively correlated with high API scores (p=0.008 and p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Prematurity, exposure to smoking, living in a crowded house with heating stoves, and an urban life are the risk factors for frequent bronchiolitis. The API can be used to predict the recurrence of bronchiolitis.","output":"Risk Factors and Clinical Determinants in Bronchiolitis of Infancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of death. The mainstay method for diagnosing arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation) and cardiac conduction disorders (eg, prolonged corrected QT interval [QTc]) is by using 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). Handheld 12-lead ECG devices are emerging in the market. In tandem with emerging technology options, evaluations of device usability should go beyond validation of the device in a controlled laboratory setting and assess user perceptions and experiences, which are crucial for successful implementation in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate clinician and patient perceptions and experiences, regarding the usability of a handheld 12-lead ECG device compared to a conventional 12-lead ECG machine, and generalizability of this user-centered approach. METHODS: International Organization for Standardization Guidelines on Usability and the Technology Acceptance Model were integrated to form the framework for this study, which was conducted in outpatient clinics and cardiology wards at Westmead Hospital, New South Wales, Australia. Each patient underwent 2 ECGs (1 by each device) in 2 postures (supine and standing) acquired in random sequence. The times taken by clinicians to acquire the first ECG (efficiency) using the devices were analyzed using linear regression. Electrocardiographic parameters (QT interval, QTc interval, heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval) and participant satisfaction surveys were collected. Device reliability was assessed by evaluating the mean difference of QTc measurements within 15 ms, intraclass correlation coefficient, and level of agreement of the devices in detecting atrial fibrillation and prolonged QTc. Clinicians perceptions and feedback were assessed with semistructured interviews based on the Technology Acceptance Model. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (age: mean 57.9 years, SD 15.2; sex: male: n=64, female n=36) and 11 clinicians (experience acquiring ECGs daily or weekly 10/11, 91%) participated, and 783 ECGs were acquired. Mean differences in QTc measurements of both handheld and conventional devices were within 15 ms with high intraclass correlation coefficients (range 0.90-0.96), and the devices had a good level of agreement in diagnosing atrial fibrillation and prolonged QTc (=0.68-0.93). Regardless of device, QTc measurements when patients were standing were longer duration than QTc measurements when patients were supine. Clinicians ECG acquisition times improved with usage (P<.001). Clinicians reported that device characteristics (small size, light weight, portability, and wireless ECG transmission) were highly desired features. Most clinicians agreed that the handheld device could be used for clinician-led mass screening with enhancement in efficiency by increasing user training. Regardless of device, patients reported that they felt comfortable when they were connected to the ECG devices. CONCLUSIONS: Reliability and usability of the handheld 12-lead ECG device were comparable to those of a conventional ECG machine. The user-centered evaluation approach helped us identify remediable action to improve the efficiency in using the device and identified highly desirable device features that could potentially help mass screening and remote assessment of patients. The approach could be applied to evaluate and better understand the acceptability and usability of new medical devices.","output":"User Perceptions and Experiences of a Handheld 12-Lead Electrocardiographic Device in a Clinical Setting: Usability Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukin-35 is a potent suppressive cytokine of the IL-12 family.

More than 88% of participants displayed positive knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19. Knowledge data showed that social media and the workplace, were the main sources of information for the majority of respondents. Approximately 99.12% of respondents were aware of the viral pandemic, and the causative agent. Statistically significant association was found when compared the demographic characteristics with the mean knowledge while no statistical signicance was observed when compared demographic characteristics with the mean attitude score except with marital status.

The bilayer dynamics largely participates in orchestrating cellular workings and is characterized by substantial stability together with extreme plasticity that allows controlled morphological/topological changes. Modeling and understanding the topological change of vesicle-like membrane at the scale of a full cell has proved an elusive aim. We propose and discuss here a continuum model able to encompass the fusion/fission transition of a bilayer membrane at the scale of a Large Unilamellar Vesicle and evaluate the minimal free energy path across the transition, inspired by the idea that fusion/fission-inducing proteins have evolved in Nature towards minimal work expenditure. The results predict the correct height for the energetic barrier and provide the force field that, by acting on the membrane, can induce the transition. They are found in excellent agreement, in terms of intensity, scale, and spatial localization with experimental data on typical protein systems at play during the transition. The model may pave the way for the development of more complete models of the process where the dynamics is coupled to the fluid internal and external environment and to other applications where the topological changes do either occur or should be prevented.","output":"Topological transitions in fluid lipid vesicles: activation energy and force fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents a prothrombotic disorder, and there have been several reports of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies being present in COVID-19-infected patients.

Moreover, in at least two publications, data are provided suggesting that antibodies can arise in heparin na?ve patients or that platelet activation may not be heparin-dependent.

However, their reduced sensitivity compared to PCR has raised questions of how well they identify infectious cases. Understanding their capabilities and limitations is therefore essential for successful implementation. To address this, we evaluated six commercial LFDs on the same collection of clinical samples and assessed their correlation with infectious virus culture and cycle threshold (Ct) values. Methods: A head-to-head comparison of specificities and sensitivities was performed on six commercial rapid antigen tests using combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, and their limits of detection determined using viral plaque forming units (PFU). Three of the LFDs were selected for a further study, correlating antigen test result with RT-PCR Ct values and positive viral culture in Vero-E6 cells. This included sequential swabs and matched serum samples obtained from four infected individuals with varying disease severities. Detection of antibodies was performed using an IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, and neutralising antibodies by infectious virus assay. Finally, the sensitivities of selected rapid antigen LFTs were assessed in swabs with confirmed B.1.1.7 variant, currently the dominant genotype in the UK. Findings: Most of the rapid antigen LFDs showed a high specificity (>98%), and accurately detected 50 PFU/test (equivalent N1 Ct of 23.7 or RNA copy number of 3x106/ml). Sensitivities of the LFDs performed on clinical samples ranged from 65 to 89%. These sensitivities increased in most tests to over 90% for samples with Cts lower than 25. Positive virus culture was achieved for 57 out of 141 samples, with 80% of the positive cultures from swabs with Cts lower than 23. Importantly, sensitivity of the LFDs increased to over 95% when compared with the detection of infectious virus alone, irrespective of Ct. Longitudinal studies of PCR-positive samples showed that most of the tests identified all infectious samples as positive, but differences in test sensitivities can lead to missed cases in the absence of repeated testing. Finally, test performance was not impacted when re-assessed against swabs positive for the dominant UK variant B.1.1.7. Interpretation: In this comprehensive comparison of antigen LFD and virus infectivity, we demonstrate a clear relationship between Ct values, quantitative culture of infectious virus and antigen LFD positivity in clinical samples. Our data support regular testing of target groups using LFDs to supplement the current PCR testing capacity, to rapidly identify infected individuals in situations where they would otherwise go undetected.","output":"Comparative performance of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antigen tests demonstrates their utility for high sensitivity detection of infectious virus in clinical specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the first quarter of the 21st century, we are already facing the third emergence of a coronavirus outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Comparative genomics can inform a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Previous strains of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and Middle-East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been known to cause acute lung injuries in humans. SARS-CoV-2 shares genetic similarity with SARS-CoV with some modification in the S protein leading to their enhanced binding affinity toward the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of human lung cells. This expert review examines the features of all three coronaviruses through a conceptual lens of comparative genomics. In particular, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 that enables its survival within the host is highlighted. Susceptibility of humans to coronavirus outbreaks in the 21st century calls for comparisons of the transmission history, hosts, reservoirs, and fatality rates of these viruses so that evidence-based and effective planetary health interventions can be devised to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks. Comparative genomics offers new insights on putative and novel viral targets with an eye to both therapeutic innovation and prevention.

Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic and coinfer the geographic location of ancestral lineages as well as the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe during this time has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei, China or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration.

The approach is based on evaluating a high-fidelity model on a small number of samples properly selected from a large number of evaluations of a low-fidelity model. In particular, we will consider the class of multiscale transport models recently introduced in Bertaglia, Boscheri, Dimarco&Pareschi, Math. Biosci. Eng. (2021) and Boscheri, Dimarco&Pareschi, Math. Mod. Meth. App. Scie. (2021) as the high-fidelity reference and use simple two-velocity discrete models for low-fidelity evaluations. Both models share the same diffusive behavior and are solved with ad-hoc asymptotic-preserving numerical discretizations. A series of numerical experiments confirm the validity of the approach.","output":"Bi-fidelity stochastic collocation methods for epidemic transport models with uncertainties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article summarizes current knowledge on the related influenza B and C viruses and considers the few studies on the recently identified influenza D virus.

Widening of healthcare disparities is expected as the gap between health systems with and without adequate resources to mitigate the pandemic become more apparent. We undertook a bibliometric analysis of research related to cancer and COVID-19 to understand (1) the type of research that has been conducted (e.g. patients, services and systems) and (2) whether the pandemic has impacted the state of global cancer research as measured by research outputs to date. METHODS: An existing filter for cancer research consisting of title words and the names of specialist cancer journals was used to identify cancer and COVID-19 related articles and reviews in the Web of Science (?Clarivate Analytics) between January 2019 and February 2021. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred and forty-five publications were identified. The majority (57%) were reviews, opinion pieces or concerned with modelling impact of delays to diagnosis and treatment. The main research domains focused on managing or estimating COVID-19 risk to cancer patients accounting for 384 papers (25%). High Income countries contributed the largest volume (n = 1,115; 72%), compared to Upper Middle (n = 302; 20%), Lower Middle (n = 122; 8%) and Low Income countries (n = 2.4; 0.2%). No evidence of a reduction in global cancer research output was observed in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a shift in research focus rather than a decline in absolute output. However, there is variation based on national income and collaborations are minimal. There has been a focus on pan-cancer studies rather than cancer site-specific studies. Strengthening global multidisciplinary research partnerships with teams from diverse backgrounds with regard to gender, clinical expertise and resource setting is essential to prevent the widening of cancer inequalities.","output":"Global cancer research in the era of COVID-19: a bibliometric analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, universities shifted from predominantly in-person learning to fully online instruction in early 2020. Subsequent semesters faced continued uncertainty regarding course modalities, with institutions adopting an idiosyncratic mix of formats dependent on current community infection rates.

Performance is measured as course grades, scores on standardized course specific assessment tests, and the incidence of dropping, withdrawing, or earning a grade of an F. On average, we find grades trended significantly higher throughout the semester, although student performance on standardized course assessment tests and the incidence of students failing or dropping remained relatively unchanged. This was not true for all types of students. First-year and first-generation students did significantly worse throughout the pandemic in online courses, as compared to courses with some in-person element.

It is too early to speculate on transmission and hospitalizations. Hence, more analyses are required, particularly to connect the genomic patterns to the phenotypic attributes to reveal the binding differences and antibody response for this variant, which can then be used for therapeutic interventions. Given the urgency of the required analysis and data on the B.1.1.529 variant, we have performed a detailed investigation to provide an understanding of the impact of these novel mutations on the structure, function, and binding of RBD to hACE2 and mAb to the NTD of the spike protein. The differences in the binding pattern between the wild type and B.1.1.529 variant complexes revealed that the key substitutions Asn417, Ser446, Arg493, and Arg498 in the B.1.1.529 RBD caused additional interactions with hACE2 and the loss of key residues in the B.1.1.529 NTD resulted in decreased interactions with three CDR regions (1C3) in the mAb. Further investigation revealed that B.1.1.529 displayed a stable dynamic that follows a global stability trend. In addition, the dissociation constant (K(D)), hydrogen bonding analysis, and binding free energy calculations further validated the findings. Hydrogen bonding analysis demonstrated that significant hydrogen bonding reprogramming took place, which revealed key differences in the binding. The total binding free energy using MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA further validated the docking results and demonstrated significant variations in the binding.

Not only mutation of the CEBPA gene, but also promoter methylation, which results in silencing of CEBPA, contributes to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We sought for another differentially methylated region (DMR) that associate with the CEBPA silencing and disease phenotype. METHODS Using databases, we identified a conserved DMR in the CEBPA 3'-untranslated region (UTR). RESULTS Methylation-specific PCR analysis of 231 AML cases showed that hypermethylation of the 3'-UTR was associated with AML that had a myeloid/NK/T-cell phenotype and down-regulated CEBPA. Most of these cases were of an immature phenotype with CD7/CD56 positivity. These cases were significantly associated with lower hemoglobin levels than the others. Furthermore, we discovered that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR can enhance transcription from the CEBPA native promoter. In vitro experiments identified IKZF1 binding sites in the 3'-UTR that are responsible for this increased transcription of CEBPA. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR is a novel regulatory element of CEBPA related to myeloid/NK/T-cell lineage leukemogenesis.

In patients with pre-existing heart failure or coronary heart disease, obese individuals have a more favourable prognosis compared to individuals who are of normal weight. This paradoxical relationship between obesity and CVD has been termed the obesity paradox. This phenomenon has also been observed in patients with other cardiovascular conditions and diseases of the respiratory and renal systems. Taking into consideration the well-established relationship between osteoarthritis (OA) and CVD, emerging evidence shows that overweight and obese individuals undergoing total hip or knee replacement for OA have lower mortality risk compared with normal weight individuals, suggesting an obesity paradox. Factors proposed to explain the obesity paradox include the role of cardiorespiratory fitness (fat but fit), the increased amount of lean mass in obese people, additional adipose tissue serving as a metabolic reserve, biases such as reverse causation and confounding by smoking, and the co-existence of older age and specific comorbidities such as CVD. A wealth of evidence suggests that higher levels of fitness are accompanied by prolonged life expectancy across all levels of adiposity and that the increased mortality risk attributed to obesity can be attenuated with increased fitness.

In times of scarcity, patient prioritization based on non-medical considerations might be necessary. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to pilot test a survey to elicit public opinions on the relative importance of non-medical considerations in priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU in times of crisis. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment was used to collect social preferences for priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The six attributes were patient age, profession, guardianship, risk-conscious behavior on a societal level, health-conscious behavior, and expected ICU length of stay. The data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model. Interactions between the age and profession of the respondents and the age and profession of the patient profiles were considered. RESULTS: The mean ( standard deviation) age of respondents was 35.9  14.5 years. In all, 70% of respondents indicated that medical and/or non-medical considerations should play a role in prioritizing patients for the ICU, whereas 15% agreed with a \\"first come, first served\\" strategy and the remaining 15% had no opinion. Respondents deemed risk-conscious behavior on a societal level to be the most important non-medical factor that should be used to prioritize patients in phase three of the framework, garnering an attribute importance (AI) of 31.2%, followed by patient age (AI 16.3%) and health-conscious behavior (AI 16.0%). ICU length of stay had the lowest impact on patient prioritization for ICU admittance (AI 10.9%). Younger and older respondents attached more importance to age than respondents in the middle age group and indicated a stronger preference to prioritize patients in their own age group (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate the relative importance members of the public attach to responsible societal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We present a dynamic description of immuno-inflammatory derangements in 64 critically ill COVID-19 patients including plasma IFN&#945;2 levels and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) score measurements. RESULTS: ARDS patients presented with persistently decreased lymphocyte count and mHLA-DR expression and increased cytokine levels. Type-I IFN response was initially induced with elevation of IFN&#945;2 levels and ISG score followed by a rapid decrease over time. Survivors and non-survivors presented with apparent common immune responses over the first 3 weeks after ICU admission mixing gradual return to normal values of cellular markers and progressive decrease of cytokines levels including IFN&#945;2. Only plasma TNF-&#945; presented with a slow increase over time and higher values in non-survivors compared with survivors. This paralleled with an extremely high occurrence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

Similar to jurisdictions where this has been a more long-standing option for end-of-life care, the Supreme Courts decision in Canada included a caveat that no healthcare provider could be compelled to participate in medical assistance in dying. The Canadian Nurses Association, in alignment with numerous ethical guidelines for healthcare providers around the globe, maintains that nurses may opt out of participation in medical assistance in dying if they conscientiously object to this procedure. The realities of implementing medical assistance in dying are still unfolding. One area that has received little attention in the literature thus far is the ability of nurses who aid with, rather than administer, medical assistance in dying to conscientiously object. This is particularly significant in rural and remote areas of Canada where geographic dispersion and limited numbers of nursing staff create conditions that limit the ability to transfer care or call on a designated team. Exercising conscientious objection to medical assistance in dying in rural and remote areas, by way of policies developed with an urban focus, is one example of how the needs of rural nurses and patients may not be met, leading to issues of patient access to medical assistance in dying and retention of nursing staff. To illustrate the complexities of nurses conscientious objection to medical assistance in dying in a rural setting, we apply an ethical decision-making framework to a hypothetical case scenario and discuss the potential consequences and implications for future policy.

In solution, the N-terminal fragment of ALIX-PRD is dynamically disordered. It contains three tandem sequentially similar proline-rich motifs that compete for a single binding site on its signaling partner, TSG101-UEV, as evidenced by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Global fitting of relaxation dispersion data, measured as a function of TSG101-UEV concentration, allowed precise quantitation of these interactions. In contrast to the soluble N-terminal portion, the C-terminal tyrosine-rich fragment of ALIX-PRD forms amyloid fibrils and viscous gels validated using dye-binding assays with amyloid-specific probes, congo red and thioflavin T (ThT), and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Remarkably, fibrils dissolve at low temperatures (2 to 6 C) or upon hyperphosphorylation with Src kinase. Aggregation kinetics monitored by ThT fluorescence shows that charge repulsion dictates phosphorylation-mediated fibril dissolution and that the hydrophobic effect drives fibril formation.

However, molecular diagnostic capabilities are poorly developed in many African countries. Efforts by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and other public health agencies to scale up facilities for molecular testing across the continent are well documented, but there are few accounts from the laboratories at the frontline. Intervention: As part of an institutional response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria, signed a memorandum of understanding with a World Bank-supported institution to obtain a non-proprietary testing platform, renovated an existing molecular virology laboratory and validated the test process to make SARS-CoV-2 testing readily available for decision-making by frontline health workers. These efforts resulted in the University of Benin Teaching Hospitals inclusion in the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control COVID-19 molecular laboratory network. The laboratory achieved a turnover of 12 123 tests within 7 months of operation. Challenges faced and dealt with include incompatible equipment, limited skilled manpower, unstable (unreliable) electric power supply, disrupted procurement and supply chain, and significant overhead costs. Lessons learnt: Molecular diagnostic capability is essential in laboratory preparedness for pandemic response and can be achieved by establishing collaborative networks in low-resource settings. Recommendations: Molecular diagnostic capabilities attained during the COVID-19 pandemic should be maintained by governmental support of the local biotechnology sector, collaboration with partners and stakeholders and the expansion of diagnostics to include other diseases of public health importance. ? 2021.

Methods Probable SARS cases occurring between November 2002 and May 2003 in mainland China were compiled from different sources and geo\\\\coded into a geographical information database based on onset location. Spatial analyses including kernel density estimation, and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to characterise the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases based on onset location/date. SARS cases that got infected in Beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding Beijing were mapped, and logistic regression using a caseCcontrol design at the county level was performed to analyse the impact of travel\\\\related risk factors in the diffusion pattern. Results The SARS epidemic in mainland China spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. Counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter\\\\provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS. Conclusions This study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Our analyses confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and inter\\\\provincial freeways for its spread from epicentres to neighbouring areas, whereas trains showed no significant association. This knowledge may be important for the control of re\\\\emerging SARS, or other future emerging human\\\\to\\\\human transmittable infections.","output":"Geographical spread of SARS in mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite emerging vaccines, the world is in the midst of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Outcomes of SARS-CoV2 infection remain a major concern in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, especially for those with uncontrolled disease. Objectives: We aimed to investigate trends and outcomes of COVID-19 occurring in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic conditions treated with biologics and targeted synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs, tsDMARDs). Methods: We included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 regardless of severity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) undergoing bDMARDs or tsDMARDs treatment registered in our local COVID-19 reporting database. We collected relevant information about comorbidities, rheumatologic-related clinical activity (RAPID5, SDAI, BASDAI, DAPSA), type of DMARD and glucocorticoid use, as well as COVID-19 related data as severity (ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening forms), medication, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and death. We did a subgroup analysis among patients with a specific rheumatologic diagnosis, among different class of medication, patients who were or not hospitalized with COVID-19 looking how age, comorbidities, type of rheumatic condition and treatments impact COVID outcomes. Results: 40 COVID-19 cases (positive PCR for SARS-CoV2) (4.67%) were identified during the 6-month study period among 855 patients registered in our database of patients under biologic treatment, including 20 RA, 18 SpA, 2 PsA patients. The majority were in either low disease activity or remission, only two patients had active uncontrolled disease at the onset of coronavirus infection. 16 cases (40%) were asymptomatic and were tested RT-PCR-positive during routine follow-ups for their disease, 13 cases (32.5%) had mild and 8 cases (20%) moderate illness;severe pneumonia and critical disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome were reported in only 3 cases, 2 recovered after;the only patients who died was 69 years old, had cardiac disease, hypertension and diabetes, had undertaken regular rituximab perfusion one month before coronavirus infection and developed pulmonary embolism followed by septic shock. Extreme fatigue was the dominant COVID-19 associated symptom apart from the classical ones including fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, anosmia and ageusia myalgias and anorexia. No specific pattern for patients requiring intensive care unit admission. Conclusion: The COVID-16 infection rate in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disorders receiving biologics and tsDMARDs is pretty low;although immunosuppressed, these patients seem not to be at risk for severe COVID-19 illness and outcomes. These findings might reflect a potential protective role of certain biologics and/or JAK inhibitors for development and severity of COVID-19 in patients.","output":"Pattern of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing biological therapy: A cohort experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of mobility in large cities is a complex issue of great interest due to its economic, social, and environmental impact.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the pooled incidence of AKI and its association with mortality in patients with COVID-19 using a meta-analysis. We search Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for eligible publications reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 without language restriction. Incidence of AKI and mortality were reported. Meta-regression was used to describe the association between outcomes. From 26 studies (n=5497), the pooled incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was 8.4% (95% CI 6.0% to 11.7%) with a pooled incidence of renal replacement therapy of 3.6% (95% CI 1.8% to 7.1%). The incidence of AKI was higher in critically ill patients (19.9%) compared with hospitalized patients (7.3%). The pooled estimated odds ratio for mortality from AKI was 13.33 (95% CI 4.05 to 43.91). No potential publication bias was detected. By using meta-regression analyses, the incidence of AKI was positively associated with mortality after adjusted for age and sex (Q=26.18; p=0.02). Moreover, age (p<0.01), diabetes (p=0.02), hypertension (p<0.01) and baseline serum creatinine levels (p=0.04) were positively associated with AKI incidence in adjusted models. In conclusion, AKI is present in 8.3% of overall patients with COVID-19 and in 19.9% of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Presence of AKI is associated with 13-fold increased risk of mortality.

A resurgence of COVID-19 or related disease can be catastrophic. There is an urgent need to look for effective antiviral agents for many coronavirus strains with minimum side-effects, and maximum efficacy globally. Several, naturally-derived biomolecules have proved their excellent effect on several infectious diseases in a multi-mode fashion by targeting several pathways as well as increasing efficacy with high safety profile. Integrate computational prediction design was used in the study to examine the pharmacology of bioactive compounds of natural origin against SARS-CoV2 spike protein. Keeping these facts we have computationally examined 16 naturally occurring compounds using to evaluate their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV2 virus using the molecular docking technique. Hesperidin derivatives are known to ameliorate diabetes, co-morbidity for coronavirus, as well as help in preventing post coronavirus complications.

METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Between September 2002 and May 2016, 73 patients with subcardiac HCC and the same number of patients with non-subcardiac HCC matched by tumor size were included. Subcardiac HCC was defined as an index tumor that was located  1 cm from the pericardium in axial or coronal images. Cumulative local tumor progression (LTP) was compared between the two groups using the log-rank test. Prognostic factors for technical failure were assessed using multivariable logistic analysis. RESULTS Technical success rates between both groups were not significantly different (91.8% in the subcardiac HCC group vs. 95.9% in the non-subcardiac HCC group; p = 0.494). The cumulative LTP rates were 15.4% and 19.1% at 3 and 5 years, respectively, in the subcardiac HCC group, and 10.7% and 15.5% in the non-subcardiac HCC group, without significant difference (p = 0.862).

METHODS: Longitudinal cohort study. We included 245 adult patients monitored with an ICM indicated for the investigation of syncope. The records from days 1 to 12 March 2020 (prior to the institution of lockdown by the state government) with days 16 to 28 March 2020 were compared. RESULTS: Daily physical exercise reduced markedly after the imposition of lockdown (132 [55-233] minutes vs. 78 [21-154] minutes). The mean daytime HR prior to lockdown was 77 [69-85] bpm, whereas during lockdown it was 74 [66-81] bpm.

It has challenged the active treatment of oncology patients, having protocols that require frequent monitoring. Some patients' anxiety of the COVID-19 pandemic led to delays in treatment and impaired the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapy. Moreover, the stage migration term was coined to newly referred patients who postponed their doctor's appointment leading to late diagnosis. Prevention of COVID-19 disease among oncology patients is a priority, in order to avert morbidity, complications and mortality. In a recently published article, Waissengrin et al. compared the incidence of COVID-19 disease in oncology patients at Tel-Aviv Medical Center to the general population between March 2020 and October 2020. A lower rate of confirmed cases was demonstrated among oncology patients in comparison to the general population. This difference was attributed to the oncology patients' adherence to COVID-19 avoidance guidelines. In addition, no association was found between a specific type of cancer or oncological treatment and mortality from COVID-19. However, a significant correlation was presented between severe COVID-19 disease, old age and the presence of metastases. Waissengrin et al., support the importance of continuing the oncological care routine to avoid the devastating consequences of postponing treatments. Despite the development of a number of FDA-approved vaccines against the virus, the world is still facing challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g. variant B.1.617.2 ominous of yet more lockdowns due to a rapid rising wave of morbidity.","output":"[Oncology Care Challenges Treating Covid-19 Confirmed Cancer Patients: A Review and Recommendations]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies have shown that the relationship between ambient temperature, relative humidity and mumps has been highlighted. However, these studies showed inconsistent results. Therefore, the goal of our study is to conduct a meta-analysis to clarify this relationship and to quantify the size of these effects as well as the potential factors. Systematic literature researches on PubMed, Embase.com, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane library, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were performed up to February 7, 2022 for articles analyzing the relationships between ambient temperature, relative humidity and incidence of mumps. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by two researchers, and meta-analysis was performed to synthesize these data. We also assessed sources of heterogeneity by study region, regional climate, study population. Finally, a total of 14 studies were screened out from 1154 records and identified to estimate the relationship between ambient temperature, relative humidity and incidence of mumps. It was found that per 1 C increase and decrease in the ambient temperature were significantly associated with increased incidence of mumps with RR of 1.0191 (95% CI: 1.0129C1.0252, I(2) = 92.0%, Eggers test P = 0.001, N = 13) for per 1 C increase and 1.0244 (95% CI: 1.0130C1.0359, I(2) = 86.6%, Eggers test P = 0.077, N = 9) for per 1 C decrease. As to relative humidity, only high effect of relative humidity was slightly significant (for per 1 unit increase with RR of 1.0088 (95% CI: 1.0027C1.0150), I(2) = 72.6%, Eggers test P = 0.159, N = 9). Subgroup analysis showed that regional climate with temperate areas may have a higher risk of incidence of mumps than areas with subtropical climate in cold effect of ambient temperature and low effect of relative humidity. In addition, meta-regression analysis showed that regional climate may affect the association between incidence of mumps and cold effect of ambient temperature. Our results suggest ambient temperature could affect the incidence of mumps significantly, of which both hot and cold effect of ambient temperature may increase the incidence of mumps. Further studies are still needed to clarify the relationship between the incidence of mumps and ambient temperature outside of east Asia, and many other meteorological factors. These results of ambient temperature are important for establishing preventive measures on mumps, especially in temperate areas.

An enormous shortage in the personal protective equipment (PPE) and the spare parts (SP) for the mechanical ventilators ensued as a consequence of the failure of the centralized global supply chains. Additive manufacturing and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), as the pillars of Industry 4.0, arose as the robust noncentralized alternatives. When gathered and properly managed in the IIoT, 3D Printers (3DPs) can complement and support Healthcare 4.0 to face the current and future pandemics. Thus, this paper proposes a real-time green allocation and scheduling architecture designed and dedicated particularly for the large-scale distributed 3D printing tasks (3DPTs) of both PPE and SPs. Our proposed architecture comprises; a broker (B) and a cluster manager (CM). Dynamic status check for the 3DPs and admission control for 3DPTs are among the interconnected roles of CM. CM also performs task allocation and scheduling according to our proposed Online Ascending Load-Balancing Modified Best-Fit (OALMBF) allocation algorithm and Green Real-time Nesting Priority-Based Adaptive (GRNPA) scheduling algorithm. The performance of the proposed architecture was investigated under extremely high-load environments which resulted in a success ratio and a response rate of 99.9667% and 10.9665 seconds, respectively, for the 3000 3DPTs trial. These results proved the robustness and the scalability of our architecture that surpasses its state-of-the-art counterparts. Besides respecting the real-time requirements of the 3DPTs, the proposed architecture improves the utilization of the 3DPs and guarantees an even workload distribution.","output":"Towards Reinforcing Healthcare 4.0: A Green Real-Time IIoT Scheduling and Nesting Architecture for COVID-19 Large-Scale 3D Printing Tasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the correlation and integration between various stock exchanges of India, China, Singapore, the United States of America and, the United Kingdom.

This study aims to investigate whether serum BPIFA2 could be used as a potential biomarker of predicting fatal radiation injury in the early stage after nuclear accident. METHODS: A rabbit anti-mouse BPIFA2 polyclonal antibody was prepared to detect the expression of BPIFA2. C57BL/6J female mice were exposed to total body radiation (TBI) at different dose and Partial body radiation (PBI) at lethal dose to detect the dynamic changes of BPIFA2 in serum at different time points after irradiation by Western blot assay. RESULTS: BPIFA2 in mice serum were significantly increased at 1C12 h post-irradiation at .5C10 Gy, and increased again significantly at 3 d after 10 Gy irradiation with associated with mortality closely. It also increased rapidly after PBI and was closely related to injury degree, regardless whether the salivary glands were irradiated.

This article analyses the markets in the Mediterranean to map the drivers and feedback loops that keep fisheries in an unsustainable trajectory and reviews the key innovations in support of a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable small-scale fishing sector. We show how the current market is dominated by lack of product traceability and underappreciation of the inherent value of SSF products (e.g. local production, freshness, season dependence, quantitatively and culinary varied nature). In addition, due to a lack of organisation and the capacity to act, small-scale fishers are poised to have little to no influence over the price. In what we conceptualise as a response to the negative effects of existing market structures, we identify and classify initiatives that add value to SSF products, but not exclusively. These are the shortening of the value chain, innovation in the distribution channel, diversification in the type of product offered, promotion and education regarding SSF products, label and brand development and the empowerment of SSF communities through improved leadership, ownership, cooperation and coordination.

Typically this involves two components: (i) Using time series methods to model the baseline background distribution (the time series process that is assumed to contain no outbreak signatures), (ii) Detecting outbreak signatures using filter-based time series methods. METHODS: We consider time series models for chest radiograph data obtained from Midwest children's emergency departments. These models incorporate available covariate information such as patient visit counts and smoothed ambient temperature series, as well as time series dependencies on daily and weekly seasonal scales. Respiratory-related outbreak signature detection is based on filtering the one-step-ahead prediction errors obtained from the time series models for the respiratory-complaint background. RESULTS: Using simulation experiments based on a stochastic model for an anthrax attack, we illustrate the effect of the choice of filter and the statistical models upon radiograph-attributed outbreak signature detection. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the importance of using seasonal autoregressive integrated average time series models (SARIMA) with covariates in the modeling of respiratory-related time series data. We find some homogeneity in the time series models for the respiratory-complaint backgrounds across the Midwest emergency departments studied. Our simulations show that the balance between specificity, sensitivity, and timeliness to detect an outbreak signature differs by the emergency department and the choice of filter.

These adverse outcomes have been suspected to be more severe in lung cancer patients. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to outline patient characteristics, challenges in diagnosis and treatment, and outcomes of lung cancer patients with COVID-19. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted using EMBASE and PUBMED databases using the terms COVID and cancer. Studies that reported clinical characteristics and/or outcomes of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 were then systematically identified. Meta-analysis for COVID-19 related mortality associated with lung cancer compared to other cancer types was conducted. The results were reported as odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) using mixed-effects logistic regression model. Results The most commonly reported clinical findings in lung cancer patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough, with 68% and 61%, respectively. Laboratory and radiographic findings were consistent with broadly reported data. The meta-analysis noted a statistically significant increase in mortality rate in lung cancer patients compared to other cancer patients, OR 1.62 (95% CI: 1.06-2.48). Lung cancer patients with COVID-19 also reflected greater severity of illness and higher rates of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation. Conclusions COVID-19 in lung cancer patients is associated with severe disease and increased mortality relative to patients with other malignancies and the general population.

We focus on the post-lockdown period, which in Israel was characterized by a temporary return to normalcy. Prior to the lockdown, telemedicine accounted for about 5% of all primary care visits. It peaked at around 40% during the lockdown, and remained high, at around 20%, during the post-lockdown period. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we compare primary care episodes before and after the lockdown between patients with high and low access to telemedicine, with access defined based on their main primary care physician's propensity to adopt telemedicine during the lockdown. Increased access to telemedicine results in a 3.5% increase in primary care visits, but a 5% lower per-episode cost, so overall resource utilization is slightly lower. We find that remote visits involve slightly fewer prescriptions and more follow-ups, mainly with the same physician, which is consistent with a prolonged diagnostic path in the absence of physical examination. However, analyzing specific conditions, we find no evidence of missed diagnoses or adverse outcomes.

The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the differential predictors of over- and under-responses to COVID-19. METHODS: A large community sample from the United States and Canada (N = 6,854) completed measures of beliefs associated with over- and under-responses, along with measures of distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Over-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs about the dangerousness of COVID-19 (personal health and socio-economic threats) and COVID-19-related xenophobia (beliefs that foreigners are spreading the virus). Under-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, and beliefs that one is sufficiently healthy to be robust against the effects of COVID-19. RESULTS: In regression analyses, medium or large effects were obtained whereby over-response beliefs predicted distress (including distress associated with self-isolation) and excessive avoidance during the pandemic, whereas under-response beliefs predicted the disregard for social distancing.

This destruction could target melanocytes anywhere in the body, which could affect function of organs where they reside. Melanocytes in the skin, uveal tract and ear are similar in their physiology and morphology and share a common embryologic origin. OBJECTIVES The present work aimed to study the association of vitiligo with ocular and auditory abnormalities. METHODS This case-control study was carried out on forty vitiligo patients and twenty normal healthy controls. All patients and controls were subjected to auditory examination (Otoscopic examination and immittancemetry, pure tone audiometery to assess peripheral hearing sensitivity and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) to assess central hearing ability) and standard ocular examination including: visual acuity test, slit lamp biomicroscopy , and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS There was significant higher prevalence of hearing loss in vitiligo patients than controls. Ocular abnormalities were found to be significant higher in vitiligo patients but no significant difference regarding visual acuity. CONCLUSION Vitiligo is a systemic disease and could be associated with impairment of melanocytes function in other organs including the eyes and ears.

RNA hybridisation, antigen-antibody affinity interaction, and a variety of other biological reactions are commonly used to generate analytical signals that can be precisely detected using electrochemical, electrochemiluminescence, optical, and other methodologies and transducers. Electrochemical biosensors, in particular, correspond to the current trend of bioanalytical process acceleration and simplification. Immunosensors are based on the determination of antigen-antibody interaction, which on some occasions can be determined in a label-free mode with sufficient sensitivity.","output":"Biosensors for the Determination of SARS-CoV-2 Virus and Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Duck adenoviruses (DAdVs) include serotype 1 (DAdV-1) in the genus Atadenovirus and serotypes 2-4 (DAdV-2, 3, and 4) in the genus Aviadenovirus. DAdV-3 was initially isolated from Chinese Muscovy ducks in 2014, whereby the infected ducks exhibited yellowing and hemorrhaging in the liver, along with slight pericardial effusion, swelling, and hemorrhaging in the kidneys. In recent years, duck adenovirus infections have appeared in Muscovy duck farms in Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangdong, and other places in China. They have an incidence rate of 40 to 55% and a mortality rate of 35 to 43%, resulting in great losses to the duck breeding industry. In this study, 7 DAdV-3 strains, designated as TZ193, FJPT20161124, GX20170519, FJZZ, GDMM, AHAQ, and GDHS were isolated from Muscovy ducks in different provinces of China during 2016-2019, and their complete genomics were sequenced. Their genomes all exhibited significant deletions in ORF67, which also had G to A transitions at the 41st and 977th nt positions, resulting in a stop codon. The pathogenicity of TZ193, a novel isolate of DAdV-3, was investigated in Muscovy ducks. TZ193 caused characteristic lesions of swelling as well as hemorrhagic liver and kidney in the infected ducklings. Moreover, the mortality rate of TZ193 in 5-day-old domestic ducks was 100%. Our data provide concrete evidence for the identification of the DAdV-3 novel variant mutant in China, which effects increased mortality in ducks. This highlights the necessity for monitoring the specific molecular epidemiology of novel DAdV-3 mutants and the development of new vaccines in the future.","output":"Isolation and pathogenic characterization of duck adenovirus 3 mutant circulating in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces an Event-B formal model of the adaptive exterior light system for cars, a case study proposed in the context of the ABZ2020 conference.

To comprehensively understand the dynamics between credence cues and restaurant delivery with different infection risks, this study aims to investigate changes in cue utilization during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach Data on delivery sales, brand and review rating between 2019 and the first half of 2020 were obtained from Meituan. Fixed-effects estimation was used to investigate 579,858 restaurant observations across 338 cities in China. Findings Health concerns significantly increased the use of restaurant delivery and the increased delivery sales remained steady even after infection risk was reduced. However, cue utilization in restaurant delivery substantially changed depending on inflection risk. In the pandemic-spreading period, the sales effect of the brand increased while that of review rating decreased. The decreased effect of review rating was recovered in the pandemic-flattening period, whereas the abnormal brand effect continued only when branded restaurants had a high rating. Research limitations/implications The findings demonstrate the selective and contextual nature of cue utilization in the restaurant delivery setting. These characteristics are also manifested in a health crisis from a credence cue perspective. Practical implications The findings demonstrate the selective and contextual nature of cue utilization in the restaurant delivery setting. These characteristics are also manifested in a health crisis from a credence cue perspective. Further, this study re-conceptualizes credence quality and cues, considering their roles in risk management. The findings help develop risk management strategies based on customers' usage patterns of credence cues in health crises.

Generic masks come in standard sizes and are often perceived by patients as being uncomfortable, ill-fitting, and leaky. A significant number of patients are unable to tolerate the masks and eventually stop using their devices. The goal of this project is to develop custom-fit masks to increase comfort, decrease air leakage, and thereby improve patient compliance. A single-patient case study of a patient with variant ALS was performed to evaluate the custom-fit masks. His high nose bridge and overbite of lower jaw caused poor fit with generic masks, and he was noncompliant with his machine. Using desktop Stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, a generic mask was extended with a rigid interface such that it was complementary to the patient's unique facial contours. Patient or clinicians interactively select a desired mask shape using a newly developed computer program. Subsequently, a compliant silicone layer was applied to the rigid interface. Ten different custom-fit mask designs were made using computer-aided design software. Patient evaluated the comfort, extent of leakage, and satisfaction of each mask via a questionnaire. All custom-fit masks were rated higher than the standard mask except for two.

Spike blast incidence (INC) and severity (SEV) and leaf blast severity (LEAF) were quantified in each plot at regular intervals on a 10  10 grid (n = 100 clusters of spikes), beginning at head emergence (Feekes growth stage 10.5), for a total of nine assessments at CC, six at OK1, and six at OK2. Spike blast increased over time for 20 to 30 days before approaching a mean INC of 100% and a mean SEV of 60 to 75%. The logistic model was the most appropriate for describing the temporal dynamics of spike blast. The highest absolute rates of disease increase occurred earliest at OK1 and latest at OK2, and in all cases it coincided with major rain events. Estimated y0 values (initial blast intensity) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at OK1 than at CC or OK2, whereas rL values (the logistic rate parameter) were significantly higher at OK2 than at CC or OK1.

The prevalence remains largely unknown because of early testing supply shortages. Although it cannot currently be used to determine level of immunity, antibody testing can contribute to epidemiological studies, identify convalescent plasma donors, or satisfy curiosity about previous exposure to the virus. METHODS: 407 samples collected from hospitalized inpatients with and without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 170 remnant clinical specimens collected and frozen prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and paired serum and plasma samples from 23 convalescent plasma donors were used to determine performance characteristics of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. The sensitivity, specificity, imprecision, interferences, and sample stability were determined. These assays were then used to characterize the antibody response in serial samples from 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients. RESULTS: Both assays exhibited 100% specificity (95% CI; 99.05 C 100.00), giving no positive results in 170 specimens collected before July 2019 and 215 specimens from patients without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

They consumed glycine or BCAA (7 g twice daily) for 4 months and underwent a 1 month washout period, before crossover of supplementations. Faecal microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and immunoglobulin A (IgA), serum levels of cytokines, surrogate markers of intestinal permeability, appetite mediators, and endocannabinoids were obtained at the start and end of each supplementation. Supplementations were compared by multiple mixed linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, month of supplementation (0 and 4 in each period), and period (Period 1: first 4 months; Period 2: last 4 months). Microbiota comparisons were performed using principal coordinate analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, Shannon diversity index estimate and analysis of composition of microbiomes analysis, and Wilcoxon tests.

METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29). RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20-118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37-133]) later.

We aimed to determine and compare the accessibility, content, and accreditation details of the various orthopedic fellowship programs available at the Match website and alternative online resources. METHODS We studied eight subspecialties (Adult Reconstruction, Musculoskeletal Oncology, Foot and Ankle, Pediatric Orthopedics, Shoulder and Elbow, Orthopedic Spine Surgery, Sports Medicine, and Trauma) in a cross-sectional design during August/September 2019 for programs starting in July/August 2021. We registered the available baseline information at the SF Match site under various categories. We tried to reach the program-specific webpage through SF Match hyperlink and categorized our results into successful (direct and indirect) links and unsuccessful links with subcategorization. We also analyzed the information available at sponsoring society, FREIDA (Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database), and ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) websites. RESULT We analyzed 465 programs (874 positions) available through the SF Match website. A standardized program description was available for >80% of the programs in each subspecialty. The availability of a successful link for the program-specific webpage ranges from 35% (Pediatric Orthopedics) to 77% (Sports Medicine). Indirect links were almost twice as common as direct links. The success rates through the sponsoring society webpages vary from 3% (Shoulder and Elbow) to 53% (Pediatric Orthopedics). Failure rates after trying both (the Match and Society links) range from 10% (Musculoskeletal Oncology) to 34% (Shoulder and Elbow).

To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 606 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics to narrow down the number of initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound. In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing.

For questions on purchase habits, a lower number of respondents reported eating in a restaurant, eating takeaway meals, having lunch away from home, or buying pastries, cakes or crisps. For questions on preparation habits, an greater number of respondents reported that they usually avoided eating fried food and tried to keep their overall sugar intake down, but fewer respondents said they tried to have low-fat desserts. For questions on consumption habits, a lower number of respondents reported that they usually ate a dessert or pudding if one were available and a larger number said they made sure to eat at least one serving of vegetables or salad a day and at least three servings of fruit most days. Based on the obtained results, it may be stated that although there was an increase in the AFHC scores during the pandemic, a similar share of respondents showed improved or worsened food habits, and a similar share changed their food habits from healthy to unhealthy and from unhealthy to healthy. At the same time, a majority of changes were associated with purchase habits, which were probably forced by lockdowns and the resultant restrictions in eating out or grocery shopping.","output":"Differences in Adolescents Food Habits Checklist (AFHC) Scores before and during Pandemic in a Population-Based Sample: Polish Adolescents COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper has the goal of evaluating how changes in mobility has affected the infection spread of Covid-19 throughout the 2020-2021 years.

This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence for mobile phone reminder in enhancing immunization uptake, completeness and timeliness. This review was conducted in accordance to the PRISMA recommendations. Three online databases; PubMed, Cochrane Library and African Journals Online, were systematically searched for potentially relevant studies. Screening of records (titles/abstracts from and full-texts) was done using Covidence. Meta-analyses were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (v5.4).

Eleven RCTs assessing immunization uptake, completeness and/or timeliness by means of SMS, phone calls or a combination of voice message and SMS were included in both quantitative and qualitative synthesis. Overall, the included studies were of moderate quality. Majority of the included studies indicated that mobile phone reminders were beneficial. Meta-analyses indicated that using mobile phone reminder interventions for the review outcomes was of variable effect with high level of heterogeneity. A combination of voice message and SMS has a greater effect followed by phone calls then SMS reminders for immunization completeness. The use of SMS for immunization uptake and timeliness were largely insignificant (p > 0.05).

This study aimed to investigate the association between diet quality and prevalence of both physical and comprehensive frailty, using two validated tools, in a community-based cohort of older adults. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analyses using baseline data of 7022 participants aged  65 years in the Kyoto-Kameoka study. Diet quality was assessed by calculating the adherence scores to the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top using a validated questionnaire; the participants were stratified into quartile groups based on these scores. Physical and comprehensive frailty was assessed using the Fried phenotype model-based Frailty Screening Index and the Kihon Checklist, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression and the restricted cubic spline model were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between adherence scores and frailty prevalence. RESULTS: Higher adherence scores signified a higher intake of vitamin C, vegetables, dairy products, and fruits. Physical and comprehensive frailty prevalence was 14.2 and 35.8%, respectively. In a multivariable adjusted model, compared with the bottom adherence score quartile, the top quartile was associated with lower ORs of physical (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52C0.80) and comprehensive frailty (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.51C0.71).

Cardiac injuries are an independent predictor for a poor overall outcome after trauma. The aim of the present study was to analyze systemic inflammation as well as local cardiac inflammation after experimental limb-, neuro- and combined trauma in mice. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice received either a closed tibia fracture (Fx), isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) or a combination of both (Fx ?+ ?TBI). Control animals underwent sham procedure. After 6 and 24 ?h, systemic levels of inflammatory mediators were analyzed, respectively. Locally, cardiac inflammation and cardiac structural alterations were investigated in left ventricular tissue of mice 6 and 24 ?h after trauma. Results Mice showed enhanced systemic inflammation after combined trauma, which was manifested by increased levels of KC, MCP-1 and G-CSF. Locally, mice exhibited increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF) in heart tissue, which was probably mediated via toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Furthermore, mice demonstrated a redistribution of connexin 43 in cardiac tissue, which appeared predominantly after combined trauma. Besides inflammation and structural cardiac alterations, expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) mRNA was increased in the heart early after TBI and after combination of TBI and limb fracture, indicating a modification of energy metabolism. Early after combination of TBI and tibia fracture, nitrosative stress was increased, manifested by elevation of nitrotyrosine in cardiac tissue. Finally, mice showed a trend of increased systemic levels of cardiac troponin I and heart-fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) after combined trauma, which was associated with a significant decrease of troponin I and HFABP mRNA expression in cardiac tissue after TBI and combination of TBI and limb fracture. Conclusion Mice exhibited early cardiac alterations as well as alterations in cardiac glucose transporter expression, indicating a modification of energy metabolism, which might be linked to increased systemic- and local cardiac inflammation after limb-, neuro- and combined trauma. These cardiac alterations might predispose individuals for secondary cardiac damage after trauma that might compromise cardiac function after TBI and long bone fracture.

Medical masks have been proven to effectively block disease transmission. Radiotherapeutic departments are at unique risk for disease exposure with the repeated daily treatment schedule. A protocol of mask wearing during daily treatment was established, and the effect of wearing medical masks on dosimetry during proton beam therapy (PBT) was validated. METHODS: A department protocol of medical mask wearing was initiated after the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical masks that were made under standardized specification and regulation were obtained for analyses. The physical and dosimetric characteristics of these medical masks were measured by different proton energies using commercialized measurement tools. RESULTS: Patients and staff were able to adopt the protocol on a weekly basis, and no adverse events were reported. The average physical thickness of a single piece of medical mask was 0.5 mm with a water equivalent thickness (WET) of 0.1 mm. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that mask wearing for patients undergoing daily radiotherapy is feasible and can provide basic protection for patients and staff. The impact of mask wearing on dosimetry was only 0.1 mm in WET, which has no impact on clinical PBT treatment. A medical mask-wearing policy can be applied safely without dosimetric concerns and should be considered as a standard practice for PBT centers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Medical Mask Wearing During Treatment for Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy in COVID-19 Pandemic C An Experience of Protocol Setup and Dosimetric Evaluation for Particle/Proton Beam Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND General practice in Australia is expected to play a major role in responding to an influenza pandemic.

The analysis is based on the global fleet, using a comprehensive combination of data. The analysis confirms the importance to estimate all components at ship level, as safety qualities differ, and each vessel benefits differently from an inspection. Estimates of MVR were slightly higher than global insurance premiums with USD 13.7 to 17.8 billion. Over half of the MVR was due to other marine liabilities and hull and machinery, with cruise vessels leading to loss of life and injuries and oil tankers leading to pollution. The top 25 flags accounted for 87.9% of MVR with open registries in the lead. In terms of value of MVR per GRT, traditional flags, Non-IACS flags and owners located in low to upper middle-income countries, showed the highest values. Total MVR decreased by 4.18% due to the effects of the pandemic, but pollution risk exposure increased by 6% in 2020 as compared to 2019.

Breastfeeding is encouraged, and although there is no specific recommendation regarding wearing a face mask to prevent viral transmission to the newborn while nursing, instructions are given to keep high hygiene standards. All studies based on cases tested on hospital admission will capture more women with pregnancy complications than in the general population. Our aim was to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-positive women and their neonates, and to report short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective case series with data from medical records including all test-positive women (n = 67) who gave birth to 68 neonates from 19 March to 26 April 2020 in Stockholm, Sweden. Means, proportions and percentages were calculated for clinical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 32 years, 40% were nulliparous and 61% were overweight or obese. Further, 15% had diabetes and 21% a hypertensive disease. Seventy percent of the women had a vaginal birth. Preterm delivery occurred in 19% of the women.

METHODS: Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; study I: N = 2904, study II: N = 1267) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; study I: N = 1318, study II: N = 241). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. RESULTS: In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies.

Although there is a growing body of literature that has examined the content of vaping-related tweets, less is known about the people who generate and disseminate these messages and the role of e-cigarette advocates in the promotion of these devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify key conversation trends and patterns over time, and discern the core voices, message frames, and sentiment surrounding e-cigarette discussions on Twitter. METHODS: A random sample of data were collected from Australian Twitter users who referenced at least one of 15 identified e-cigarette related keywords during 2012, 2014, 2016, or 2018. Data collection was facilitated by TrISMA (Tracking Infrastructure for Social Media Analysis) and analyzed by content analysis. RESULTS: A sample of 4432 vaping-related tweets posted and retweeted by Australian users was analyzed. Positive sentiment (3754/4432, 84.70%) dominated the discourse surrounding e-cigarettes, and vape retailers and manufacturers (1161/4432, 26.20%), the general public (1079/4432, 24.35%), and e-cigarette advocates (1038/4432, 23.42%) were the most prominent posters. Several tactics were used by e-cigarette advocates to communicate their beliefs, including attempts to frame e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes, imply that federal government agencies lack sufficient competence or evidence for the policies they endorse about vaping, and denounce as propaganda gateway claims of youth progressing from e-cigarettes to combustible tobacco. Some of the most common themes presented in tweets were advertising or promoting e-cigarette products (2040/4432, 46.03%), promoting e-cigarette use or intent to use (970/4432, 21.89%), and discussing the potential of e-cigarettes to be used as a smoking cessation aid or tobacco alternative (716/4432, 16.16%), as well as the perceived health and safety benefits and consequences of e-cigarette use (681/4432, 15.37%). CONCLUSIONS: Australian Twitter content does not reflect the countrys current regulatory approach to e-cigarettes. Rather, the conversation on Twitter generally encourages e-cigarette use, promotes vaping as a socially acceptable practice, discredits scientific evidence of health risks, and rallies around the idea that e-cigarettes should largely be outside the bounds of health policy. The one-sided nature of the discussion is concerning, as is the lack of disclosure and transparency, especially among vaping enthusiasts who dominate the majority of e-cigarette discussions on Twitter, where it is unclear if comments are endorsed, sanctioned, or even supported by the industry.","output":"E-Cigarette Advocates on Twitter: Content Analysis of Vaping-Related Tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: While secondary pneumococcal pneumonia occurs less commonly after COVID-19 than after other viral infections, it remains unclear whether other interactions occur between SARS-CoV-2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: We probed potential interactions between these pathogens among adults aged &#8805;65y by measuring associations of COVID-19 outcomes with pneumococcal vaccination (13-valent conjugate and 23-valent polysaccharide; PCV13, PPSV23). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) using Cox proportional hazards models with doubly-robust inverse-propensity weighting. We assessed effect modification by antibiotic exposure to further test the biologic plausibility of a causal role for pneumococci. RESULTS: Among 531,033 adults, there were 3,677 COVID-19 diagnoses, leading to 1,075 hospitalizations and 334 fatalities, between 1 March-22 July, 2020. Estimated aHRs for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and mortality associated with prior PCV13 receipt were 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.72), 0.68 (0.57-0.83), and 0.68 (0.49-0.95), respectively. Prior PPSV23 receipt was not associated with protection against the three outcomes. COVID-19 diagnosis was not associated with prior PCV13 within 90 days following antibiotic receipt, whereas aHR estimates were 0.65 (0.50-0.84) and 0.62 (0.56-0.70) during risk periods 91-365d and >365d following antibiotic receipt, respectively.

There are a number of viruses known to be involved in maintaining the inflammatory state through the prolonged viral persistence and replication in the macrophages whose plasticity changes due to the infection. The viruses can trigger the pro-atherogenic cytokine response through the diverse macrophage-dependent mechanisms. There is lack of data regarding impact of viral infections on the monocyte/macrophage plasticity and possible control of inflammation in atherogenesis.

Diabetic retinopathy is a primary vision complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness among adults, with 26% prevalence among women. Tele-retina is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care remotely. Screening for diabetic retinopathy has great potential to reduce the incidence of blindness, yet there is an adverse association among screening, income, and gender. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore gender disparity in the provision of tele-retina program services for diabetic retinopathy screening in a cohort of women of low socioeconomic status (SES) receiving services in South Riverdale Community Health Centre (SRCHC) between 2014 and 2019. METHODS: Using a convergent mixed methods design, we want to understand patients', providers', administrators', and decision makers' perceptions of the facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. Multivariate logistic regression will be utilized to assess the association among client characteristics, referral source, and diabetic retinopathy screening. Guided by a grounded theory approach, systematic coding of data and thematic analysis will be utilized to identify key facilitators and barriers to the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. RESULTS: For the quantitative component, we anticipate a cohort of 2500 patients, and we expect to collect data on the overall patterns of tele-retina program use, including descriptions of program utilization rates (such as data on received and completed diabetic retinopathy screening referrals) along the landscape of patient populations receiving these services. For the qualitative component, we plan to interview up to 21 patients and 14 providers, administrators, and decision makers, and to conduct up to 14 hours of observations alongside review of relevant documents. The interview guide is being developed in collaboration with our patient partners. Through the use of mixed methods research, the inquiry will be approached from different perspectives. Mixed methods will guide us in combining the rich subjective insights on complex realities from qualitative inquiry with the standard generalizable data that will be generated through quantitative research. The study is under review by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (19-5628). We expect to begin recruitment in winter 2021. CONCLUSIONS: In Ontario, the screening rate for diabetic retinopathy among low income groups remains below 65%. Understanding the facilitators and barriers to diabetic retinopathy screening may be a prerequisite in the development of a successful screening program.

Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","output":"Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand globally, requiring massive public health responses from national and local governments.

There is, however, limited mechanistic knowledge of how the interplay between these determinants influences prostate tumor aggressiveness in AA men and other men of African ancestry. Growing evidence indicates that chronic psychosocial stress in AA populations leads to sustained glucocorticoid signaling through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), with negative physiological and pathological consequences. Compelling evidence indicates that treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with anti-androgen therapy activates GR signaling. This enhanced GR signaling bypasses androgen receptor (AR) signaling and transcriptionally activates both AR-target genes and GR-target genes, resulting in increased prostate tumor resistance to anti-androgen therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Given its enhanced signaling in AA men, GR-together with specific genetic drivers-may promote CRPC progression and exacerbate tumor aggressiveness in this population, potentially contributing to PCa mortality disparities. Ongoing and future CRPC clinical trials that combine standard of care therapies with GR modulators should assess racial differences in therapy response and clinical outcomes in order to improve PCa health disparities that continue to exist for AA men.","output":"Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While pregnant women have been identified as a potentially at-risk group concerning COVID-19 infection, little is known regarding the susceptibility of the fetus to infection.

After training, we observed that the agent places a long length lockdown to reduce the first surge of a disease. Furthermore, the agent places a combination of cyclic lockdowns and short length lockdowns to halt the resurgence of the disease. Analyzing the agent's performed actions, we discover that the agent decides movement restrictions not only based on the number of the infectious population but also considering the reproduction rate of the disease.

To delineate the impact of S1 spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor, we incubated the S1 spike protein with human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAEC). HPAEC treatment with the S1 spike protein caused disruption of endothelial barrier function, increased levels of numerous inflammatory molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-1, CCL5, CXCL10), elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a mild rise in glycolytic reserve capacity. Because low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is associated with severe cases of COVID-19, we also evaluated treatment with hemoglobin (HbA) as a potential countermeasure in hypoxic and normal oxygen environments in analyses with the S1 spike protein. We found hypoxia downregulated the expression of the ACE2 receptor and increased the critical oxygen homeostatic signaling protein, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1); however, treatment of the cells with HbA yielded no apparent change in the levels of ACE2 or HIF-1. Use of quantitative proteomics revealed that S1 spike protein-treated cells have few differentially regulated proteins in hypoxic conditions, consistent with the finding that ACE2 serves as the host viral receptor and is reduced in hypoxia. However, in normoxic conditions, we found perturbed abundance of proteins in signaling pathways related to lysosomes, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and pyrimidine metabolism.

The situation is posing important criminal challenges, as well as an ocean of social and public health issues around the world. It has not only directly affected constitutionally-guaranteed rights and individual freedoms, but also brought to the fore certain types of criminal offence that had previously been of little practical importance, such as the crime of maliciously or unintentionally causing an epidemic. Different countries and states have introduced policies to manage the emergency at different times and in different ways. The measures adopted have been the object of much criticism, also raising questions of constitutional legitimacy in countries like Italy.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, between March and June 2020, where a total of 4,700 persons were approached and 3,672 (78%) of participants (64.4% males and 35.6% females) completed the Knowledge Attitude Practices (KAP) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (p < .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (p < .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (p = .008) and isolation (p = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (p < .001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated that level of education, avoiding going to crowded places, eye, nose and mouth organs are sensitive organs to the virus, keeping physical distance due to epidemic affect by COVID-19 virus, isolation and treatment of people reduce the spread of COVID-19 virus and 14-days period of time, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with the respiratory droplets of an infected person, occupational status, health education programme needed and antibody treatment variables were significantly associated with fatigue after adjusting for age, gender and income variables.

We have shown previously that spinal application of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors induces strong antihyperalgesic effect during inflammatory pain. In this study we observed low level of DPP4 mRNA in the rat spinal dorsal horn in physiological conditions, which did not change significantly either in carrageenan-induced inflammatory or partial nerve ligation-generated neuropathic states. In na?ve animals, microglia and astrocytes expressed DPP4 protein with one and two orders of magnitude higher than neurons, respectively. DPP4 significantly increased in astrocytes during inflammation and in microglia in neuropathy. Intrathecal application of two DPP4 inhibitors tripeptide isoleucin-prolin-isoleucin (IPI) and the antidiabetic drug vildagliptin resulted in robust opioid-dependent antihyperalgesic effect during inflammation, and milder but significant opioid-independent antihyperalgesic action in the neuropathic model. The opioid-mediated antihyperalgesic effect of IPI was exclusively related to mu-opioid receptors, while vildagliptin affected mainly delta-receptor activity, although mu- and kappa-receptors were also involved. None of the inhibitors influenced allodynia.

Study findings suggest that individuals with a lifetime history of disordered eating behavior may be negatively affected by COVID-19-related anxiety, and prevention measures may disrupt daily functioning and limit access to treatment. However, data describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors are limited, and most findings focus on individuals in treatment settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the experiences of Reddit users worldwide who post in eating disorder (ED)-related discussion forums describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their overall mental health and disordered eating behavior. METHODS: Data were collected from popular subreddits acknowledging EDs as their primary discussion topic. Unique discussion posts dated from January 1 to May 31, 2020 that referenced the COVID-19 pandemic were extracted and evaluated using inductive, thematic data analysis. RESULTS: Six primary themes were identified: change in ED symptoms, change in exercise routine, impact of quarantine on daily life, emotional well-being, help-seeking behavior, and associated risks and health outcomes. The majority of users reported that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures negatively impacted their psychiatric health and contributed to increased disordered eating behaviors. Feelings of isolation, frustration, and anxiety were common. Many individuals used Reddit forums to share personal experiences, seek advice, and offer shared accountability. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit discussion forums have provided a therapeutic community for individuals to share experiences and provide support for peers with ED during a period of increased psychiatric distress. Future research is needed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behavior and to evaluate the role of social media discussion forums in mental health treatment, especially during periods of limited treatment access.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Disordered Eating Behavior: Qualitative Analysis of Social Media Posts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the mental health, quality of life, and caregiving burden between male and female informal caregivers of older adults (60 years) during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: The sample consisted of 301 female and 188 male informal caregivers of older adults in need of care (60 years). Data were used from a cross-sectional study in March 2021 that questioned a representative sample of adults aged 40 years and older from Germany. Information on informal care provision, mental health (depressive and anxiety symptoms), caregiving burden, and quality of life was assessed for the period between December 2020 and March 2021. Regression analyses, adjusted for (1) the sociodemographic background and health of the caregivers, (2) the caregiving time and caregiving tasks, and (3) the perception of impairment and danger posed by the pandemic, were conducted. RESULTS: Findings of the fully adjusted model indicated a higher level of anxiety and lower quality of life among female caregivers, compared to male caregivers. Gender differences in depression and caregiver burden were not significant in analyses that controlled for care tasks and time. Moderator analyses indicated that gender differences in caregiver's anxiety levels were influenced by the danger perceived to be posed by the pandemic: among men the danger to the care recipient, and among women the danger to themselves, increased anxiety. CONCLUSION: Female informal caregivers were more negatively affected than male informal caregivers during the pandemic, as indicated by higher levels of anxiety and lower quality of life. Gender differences in anxiety depended on the perceived danger posed by the pandemic. Thus, policy and pandemic measures should focus on gender-specific support of female caregivers who seem to be particularly vulnerable during the pandemic. More caregiver-specific support and information around protecting themselves and their care recipients are recommended. Also, further research on gender differences in care performance and their relation to psychosocial health outcomes is recommended.","output":"Gender Differences in Mental Health, Quality of Life, and Caregiver Burden among Informal Caregivers during the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: A Representative, Population-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has broad implications on stroke patient triage.

In this study, we investigated how the nonheme iron transporters divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and ferroportin (FPN) are involved in the transient suppression of iron uptake in SAMB.

In the present nationwide registry (TURKMI-2), we evaluated the treatment delays and outcomes of patients with acute MI during the Covid-19 pandemic and compaired with a recentpre-pandemic registry (TURKMI-1). METHODS: The pandemic and pre-pandemic studies were conducted prospectively as 15-day snapshot registries in the same 48 centers. The inclusion criteria for both registries were aged &#8805;18 years and a final diagnosis of acute MI (AMI) with positive troponin levels. The only difference between the 2 registries was that the pre-pandemic (TURKMI-1) registry (n=1872) included only patients presenting within the first 48 hours after symptom-onset. TURKMI-2 enrolled all consecutive patients (n=1113) presenting with AMI during the pandemic period. RESULTS: A comparison of the patients with acute MI presenting within the 48-hour of symptom-onset in the pre-pandemic and pandemic registries revealed an overall 47.1% decrease in acute MI admissions during the pandemic. Median time from symptom-onset to hospital-arrival increased from 150 min to 185 min in patients with ST elevation MI (STEMI) and 295 min to 419 min in patients presenting with non-STEMI (NSTEMI) (p-values <0.001). Door-to-balloon time was similar in the two periods (37 vs. 40 min, p=0.448). In the pandemic period, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) decreased, especially in the NSTEMI group (60.3% vs. 47.4% in NSTEMI, p<0.001; 94.8% vs. 91.1% in STEMI, p=0.013) but the decrease was not significant in STEMI patients admitted within 12 hours of symptom-onset (94.9% vs. 92.1%; p=0.075). In-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were significantly increased during the pandemic period [4.8% vs. 8.9%; p<0.001; age- and sex-adjusted Odds ratio (95% CI) 1.96 (1.20-3.22) for NSTEMI, p=0.007; and 2.08 (1.38-3.13) for STEMI, p<0.001]. CONCLUSION: The present comparison of 2 nationwide registries showed a significant delay in treatment of patients presenting with acute MI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although PCI was performed in a timely fashion, an increase in treatment delay might be responsible for the increased risk of MACE.

This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 mol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 mol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48aa0.02]aa10vs. 1.00aa0.12, ta=a150.38, Pa<a0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 mol/L CEP at 48 h p.i.

This study aimed to find miRNA targeting ?-catenin gene by bioinformatic approaches and confirm this correlation to propose new therapeutic targets for HCC. Prediction of miRNAs targeting 3'-Untranslated Regions (UTR) of ?-catenin mRNA, were done using different types of credible bioinformatic databases.

In the first step, the expression of ?-catenin was assessed in the HepG2 cell line by real-time PCR technique. Next, transduction of HepG2 cells were done by lentiviral vectors containing the desired miRNA. Then, the expression level of miRNA and the ?-catenin gene were evaluated. Based on the results obtained from different bioinformatic databases, miR-214 was selected as the potential miRNA with the highest probability in targeting ?-catenin. Furthermore, Luciferase assay results confirmed the accuracy of our bioinformatic prediction. In line with our hypothesis, after the overexpression of miR-214 in HepG2 cells, ?-catenin gene expression was reduced significantly.

The Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) includes hundreds of hospitals internationally using a federated computational approach to COVID-19 research using the EHR. Objective. We sought to develop and validate a standard definition of COVID-19 severity from readily accessible EHR data across the Consortium. Methods. We developed an EHR-based severity algorithm and validated it on patient hospitalization data from 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also used a machine learning approach to compare selected predictors of severity to the 4CE algorithm at one site. Results. The 4CE severity algorithm performed with pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of single code categories for acuity were unacceptably inaccurate - varying by up to 0.65 across sites. A multivariate machine learning approach identified codes resulting in mean AUC 0.956 (95% CI: 0.952, 0.959) compared to 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921) using expert-derived codes. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with 49% precision and recall compared against chart review at one partner institution. Discussion.

Although temperature testing is suggested as a firstline test for COVID-19, it was not reliable because many diseases have the same symptoms. Thus, we propose a deep learning method based on X-ray images that used a convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning (TL) for COVID-19 diagnosis, and using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique for producing visual explanations for the COVID-19 infection area in the lung. The low sample size of coronavirus samples was considered a challenge, thus, this issue was overridden using data augmentation techniques. The study found that the proposed (CNN) and the modified pre-trained networks VGG16 and InceptionV3 achieved a promising result for COVID-19 diagnosis by using chest X-ray images. The proposed CNN was able to differentiate 284 patients with COVID-19 or normal with 98.2 percent for training accuracy and 96.66 percent for test accuracy and 100.0 percent sensitivity.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of implementing social distancing policy, and the impact of its lifting, with the resumption of social contacts and activities, as well as the effects of mandating face masks on the temporal trend of new COVID-19 cases in Iran. Methods: We employed the interrupted time series analysis (ITSA), which is a very valuable method that can be used to evaluate the impact of the implementation of various policies in the health sector to help health policy-makers make effective decisions. Daily data were collected from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the World Health Organization from 954 public hospitals and health center settings. Data were extracted 14 days before and after the implementation of each policy. Results were computed with their 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-values equal to or less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. All data were analyzed using the open-source software R Version 3.6.1 using the nlme and car packages. Results: The slope of changes in new confirmed cases following the implementation of the social distancing policy decreased by 118.79 (P <0.001). With the resumption of social and economic activities in all provinces except for Tehran, initially the number of new daily confirmed cases was 3300, which was statistically significant (P <0.001). The slope of changes due to the implementation of this policy was 47.89 (P <0.001). A similar trend was detected with the resumption of social and economic activities in Tehran. With the implementation of the policy of mandatory use of masks, the slope of changes showed a decrease of 25.84 (P <0.001). Conclusion: Given the absence of effective drugs and vaccines against COVID-19, policy-makers have implemented non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the transmission of the disease and prevent more deaths. Social distancing may be unsustainable in the long-term, while wearing masks is both a cost-effective and efficacious measure to curb disease transmission.","output":"Interrupted time series analysis of the implementation of social distancing policy, its lifting and the mandate of wearing face masks in Iran to mitigate against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The commentary examines coronavirus memes circulating around forms of generational conflict that have risen from experiences of self-isolation.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients (severe to critical) during Jan-2011 to Feb-2018 from five hospitals, followed by a systematic analysis of cases from 2017 to 2018 (n = 289) and all previous epidemics during 2011C2017 (n = 169). RESULTS: In-hospital fatality was over 5-folds higher during the 2017C2018 (p < 0.01) in which 19 patients died (6.6%), whereas only 2 mortalities (1.2%) were observed during 2011C2017. Of the 289 hospitalized in 2017C2018, 153 were confirmed with influenza B virus, 110 with A/H1N1pdm09, and 26 A/H3N2, whereas A/H1N1pdm09 was the predominant cause of hospitalization in previous seasons combined (45%). Fatal cases in 2017C2018 were exclusively associated with either influenza B or A/H1N1pdm09. Our results show that a significant lower proportion of patients aged 14 or greater were treated with oseltamivir, during the 2017C2018 epidemic, and exhibited higher levels of clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital fatality rate might be significantly higher in the 2017C2018 season in China. A sufficient supply of oseltamivir and antiviral therapy within 48 h from onset could reduce fatality rates.

Although respiratory tract symptoms are often the initial presentation among kidney transplant recipients who contract COVID-19, other clinical features which may indicate underlying SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, are not uncommon. Hyponatremia can develop and may reflect underlying inflammation. Interferon-6 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 complications and may play a role in the inappropriately higher secretion of antidiuretic hormone leading to hyponatremia. This pathway is the so-called immuno-neuroendocrine interface. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 has been reported in a few case series of non-kidney transplant patients and only one reported kidney transplant recipient. However, the clinical course and prognostic value of hyponatremia in this population is not described in detail.

During the acute stage of neurologic disease following intracerebral inoculation, Junin antigen was detected in 100% of animals, strongly in most neurons but also to a much lesser degree in scattered astrocytes, dropping to 20% of rats at 540 days postinfection. Initially labeled in all brain areas, viral antigen gradually disappeared from hippocampus but persisted irregularly in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, Purkinje cells, pons, and medulla oblongata. Such a pattern suggests that specific neuronal subpopulations, in spite of apparently unaltered cell morphology, may persistently harbor the virus, leading on occasion to a delayed neurologic syndrome. During both the acute and chronic stages of disease, a mild inflammatory exudate was observed, characterized by the presence of T and B lymphocytes, as well as macrophages and unidentified round cells. GFAP immunostaining showed increased astrocytic reaction as infection lapsed into chronicity. Corpus callosum, hippocampus, and cerebellum exhibited the sharpest reactive astrocytosis, followed by basal ganglia, pons, and medulla oblongata, whereas in cerebral cortex it was considerably less. Astrocyte activation, which failed to correlate with viral antigen presence in neurons, seems to result from a generalized condition, possibly including diffusible brain factors triggered by viral infection.

Students additionally reported on their attitudes and experiences with online learning. Results showed that students used certain tools, such as video, audio, e-assessments, and web conferencing systems, much more often during lockdown than they had before. Their use of classic digital media, such as e-mail, social communication tools, such as chat or online forums, and other interactive tools, such as wikis or educational games, hardly changed at all. Their attitudes toward multimedia learning were positively related to their media use. In their open responses (n = 137), students identified advantages of online learning (flexibility and self-directed learning), as well as disadvantages (limited social interaction) and challenges (motivation and self-discipline). As a group, they also expressed a clear preference for a balanced combination of online- and offline teaching in the future. However, individual students did prefer fully online or offline learning modes, depending on their personal circumstances and educational goals. We view this as a call to researchers and educators alike to explore ways in which the advantages of online and face-to-face learning can best be combined to meet the changed needs and expectations of organizations, students, and teachers in a future after Corona.","output":"Austrian College Students Experiences With Digital Media Learning During the First COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been over 17 million COVID-19 infections worldwide up to July 31, 2020, but the exact transmission route remains a subject for debate Virus load in different-sized respiratory droplets is the key to address the above question Investigation on the droplet deposition characteristics during exhalation inside the respiratory tract will facilitate the understanding of their origin and importance in transmitting the respiratory infection Based on a realistic respiratory model, this study utilized the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation to investigate the deposition of droplets originating from infection sites like pharynx, larynx and trachea under three flow conditions, namely 30 L/min (representing the normal breathing condition), 60 L/min (speaking) and 180 L/min (coughing) The SST k- turbulence model integrated in ANSYS Fluent software was utilized to obtain the flow field inside the respiratory tract by solving the continuity and momentum equations, and the Lagrangian approach was used to calculate droplet motion and deposition with the discrete random walk model to account for the turbulence fluctuation effect Evaporation of droplets was not considered inside the saturated respiratory tract Droplet diameter, flow rate of the exhaling air, and complexity of the respiratory tract geometry are the most important factors in determining the deposition pattern of respiratory droplets It is revealed that the largest droplet that originates from the joint of pharynx and larynx and is able to escape out of the respiratory tract is about 20 m (30 L/min) or 10 m(60-180 L/min) in diameter;the so-called cut-off sizes for vocal cord and trachea originated droplets are 7 m (30 L/min), 5 m (60 L/min) or 3 m (180 L/min) Larynx and joint of larynx and pharynx are the most important deposition sites due to their complexity in geometry and the existence of the laryngeal jet, whose velocity is up to 102 m/s during coughing and32 m/s during speaking;the nasal cavity is also effective in trapping relatively small droplets as the airflow has a sudden change in direction before entering the oral cavity Under the investigated speaking scenario (60 L/min), the escape rate of1 m droplets is around 50%, and the maximum escape rates of 5 and 10 m droplets are respectively 13 1% and 1 3% (originating from the joint of pharynx and larynx) Although large droplets up to several hundred micrometers can be produced inside the oral cavity due to the atomization mechanism, they seldom carry pathogen Thus, for COVID-19 patents in the early stage of infection who show upper respiratory symptoms, the cut-off size of virus-laden droplets released into the environment is about 20 m;with the shifting of infection to the lower respiratory tract in the later stage, the cut-off size decreases to 7 m Respiratory droplets evaporate immediately after escaping into the indoor environments and shrink to about one third of their initial size, so airborne route is speculated to be important in the transmission of COVID-19 Further investigations considering realistic flow conditions together with droplet sampling experiments on human volunteers are necessary to confirm these cut-off sizes ? 2021, Science Press All right reserved","output":"Numerical investigation on the origin of virus-laden droplets in the respiratory tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endophthalmitis remains a serious complication following intraocular procedures.

Furthermore, more attention should be paid to confirm whether the shelter-like phenomenon happens in other malignancies due to the similar microenvironment and high expression of ACE2 in some malignancies.","output":"Evidence for residual SARS-CoV-2 in glioblastoma tissue of a convalescent patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China, on December 31, 2019, the disease has spread globally at an unimaginable speed. COVID-19 has taken a huge toll on the society and the economy, and everyone is looking forward to its end. In this work, we established a mathematical model of COVID-19 epidemic development. First, we obtained a differential equation to describe the spreading of COVID-19: , in which is the total number of patients who are infected by COVID-19 at time . There are three parameters in this equation: the spreading coefficient , which is the average number of people infected by an unquarantined patient in a unit time;the average quarantine ratio , which is the number of quarantined patients divided by the total number of patients;and the incubation period , which is the time lapse between infection and exhibition of symptoms. In addition, we have written a Python program according to our equation, and have further used our program to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic development in various places around the world, including China, Western Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, Southern Asia, and the entire world. Through numerical fitting, we have obtained the values of the spreading coefficient and the isolation ratio for these places around the world, and predicted the development of the epidemic using these parameters we obtained. In order to ensure data consistency, we have used the data from COVID-19 case reports from Johns Hopkins University. We found that using the parameters we obtained, our calculated curves of fit the actually reported values very well, and we were able to accurately predict the values of in the near future. Lastly, we calculated the value (the number of infected persons per patient at the beginning of the epidemic) to be 2.94 1/45.88, which is consistent with the current estimated value of . In summary, our results serve as a reliable guideline to understand the spreading of COVID-19 and to predict the future outcome of this epidemic, and can be provided as a reference for the government to formulate policies. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Using Mathematical Model to Analyze COVID-19 Spreading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the detailed balance temperatures recorded along all classes of stationary, uniformly accelerated worldlines in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, namely along (i) linear uniform acceleration, (ii) cusped, (iii) circular, (iv) catenary, and (v) helix worldlines, among which the Unruh temperature is the particular case for linear uniform acceleration.

Moreover, students are not used to getting various questions. Students had difficulty working on material development questions. This could be because conventional learning did not hone the ability to think reflective. For that reason, this research aimed at testing the computer- based drill learning and the conventional learning model through e-learning. The aspect that would be measured was the students' mathematical reflecting thinking. The research method was quasi-experimental by employing the pretest before the treatment and the posttest after the treatment. The research design employed two classes, the 26 students of the control class and 24 ones of the experiment class. The result revealed that a computer-based drilling learning model would be effective if it was viewed from the perspective of students' mathematical reflective thinking ability. On the other hand, the conventional learning model would not be effectively viewed from students' mathematical reflective thinking.

We aimed to evaluate the incidence of PARDS in AVB and identify the risk of RSV as a trigger pathogen for PARDS. This study is a retrospective single-center observational cohort study including children < 2 years of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit at St Marys Hospital, London, and presented with AVB in 3 years (2016C2018). Clinical and demographic data was collected; PALICC criteria were applied to define PARDS. Data was expressed as median (IQR range); non-parametric tests were used. In this study, 144 infants with acute viral bronchiolitis were admitted to PICU in the study period. Thirty-nine infants fulfilled criteria of PARDS with RSV as the most common virus identified. Bacterial infection was identified as a risk factor for development of PARDS in infants with AVB. Conclusion: AVB is an important cause of PARDS in infants. RSV is associated with a higher risk of PARDS in AVB. Bacterial co-infection is a significant risk factor for development of PARDS in AVB.

In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, identified between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with the index COVID-19 case. Non-household close contacts were defined as those who had contact for at least 30 min within 2 m of the index case. All patients with COVID-19 in Singapore received inpatient treatment, with access restricted to health-care staff. All close contacts were quarantined for 14 days with thrice-daily symptom monitoring via telephone. Symptomatic contacts underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Secondary clinical attack rates were derived from the prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts. Consenting contacts underwent serology testing and detailed exposure risk assessment. Bayesian modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of missed diagnoses and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors. FINDINGS: Between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020, 7770 close contacts (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, and 3588 social contacts) linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases were identified. Symptom-based PCR testing detected 188 COVID-19 cases, and 7582 close contacts completed quarantine without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Among 7518 (968%) of the 7770 close contacts with complete data, the secondary clinical attack rate was 59% (95% CI 49C71) for 1779 household contacts, 13% (09C19) for 2231 work contacts, and 13% (10C17) for 3508 social contacts. Bayesian analysis of serology and symptom data obtained from 1150 close contacts (524 household contacts, 207 work contacts, and 419 social contacts) estimated that a symptom-based PCR-testing strategy missed 62% (95% credible interval 55C69) of COVID-19 diagnoses, and 36% (27C45) of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic. Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 538 [95% CI 182C1584]; p=00023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (786 [386C1602]; p<00001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 392 [95% CI 207C740], p<00001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (267 [121C588]; p=0015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (307 [155C608]; p=00013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Among both household and non-household contacts, indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Most studies investigating the incidence of pediatric respiratory complications were based on self-report. METHODS We studied the incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia as well as that of pulse oximeter artifacts prospectively in 575 pediatric noncardiac surgery patients aged between 0 and 16 years operated in a tertiary pediatric university hospital. Subsequently, the incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia was determined retrospectively in 8277 patients registered in an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) of the same hospital. RESULTS In the prospective cohort, at least 1 episode of oxygen saturation (Spo2)  90% for at least 1 minute occurred in 69 of 575 cases (12%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9%-15%). Furthermore, in 35 of 575 (6%; 95% CI, 4%-8%) cases at least 1 true hypoxemic event was observed. In total, 117 episodes of Spo2  90% were observed in the prospective study, of which 3 of 117 could not be specified and 67 of 114 (54%; 95% CI, 42%-65%) episodes were classified as true hypoxemia. False-positive low Spo2 values were mainly caused by dislodgment of the pulse oximeter. In the retrospective analysis, Spo2  90% and Spo2  80% for at least 1 minute were documented in the AIMS in 18% (95% CI, 17%-19%) and 7.5% (95% CI, 7%-8%) of the cases, respectively; 31 and 10 episodes per 100 cases, respectively. The incidence of hypoxemia increased in younger age groups: Spo2  90% for at least 1 minute occurred in 56% (95% CI, 49%-63%) of neonates (170 episodes per 100 cases). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia increased with younger age, with the highest incidence in neonates. Because of the high artifact rate, unvalidated pulse oximeter data in AIMS should be interpreted with caution because only up to 65% of all hypoxemic episodes recorded during pediatric anesthesia were caused by true hypoxia.","output":"Incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia in children in relation to age."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peru declared a state of emergency on March 16 in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) transmissions; thus, the International Airport was closed and the soundscape of urban zones under the flight tracks have been changed in view of the fact that airplane traffic was suspended.

In relation with these measures, particularly with the staying at home, increasing rates of domestic violence are beginning to surface. Hence, this study was aimed at determining the prevalence of intimate partner violence against reproductive age women in northern Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. The data were collected during the period of April to May, 2020 using interviews and a self-administered standard questionnaire. The data were entered into the Epi-data manager version 4.2 and exported to SPSS 22 for analysis. The descriptive analysis such as frequency distribution, percentage, and measures of central tendency were used. This was followed by binary and multiple logistic regression analysis to infer the association between the outcome and independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 682 participants were included in the study. The prevalence of intimate partner violence against women was found to stood at 24.6% with psychological violence being the most prevalent (13.3%), followed by physical (8.3%) and sexual violence (5.3%). Women were more likely to suffer from violence if they were housewives (AOR, 95% CI (18.062 (10.088, 32.342))), age less than 30 (AOR, 95% CI (23.045 (5.627, 94.377))), women with arrange marriage (AOR, 95% CI (2.535 (1.572, 4.087))) and women with husbands age being between 31C40 (AOR, CI 95% (2.212 (1.024, 4.777))).

This study aimed to investigate the frequency and severity of symptoms of COVID-19 in patients with CRS and to assess the association between the status of CRS symptoms and the quality of life (QoL) of the patients. METHODS In this observational and cross-sectional study, 207 adult CRS patients participated. The patients, who presented the symptoms of COVID-19, were examined by taking the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. A questionnaire was completed by each patient, regarding their demographic and clinical data. In addition, the GA2LEN and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) standard questionnaires were used to identify the comorbid allergic condition and QoL of CRS patients. RESULTS The frequency of patients with COVID-19 was 25 (12.1%) of which 22 were treated as outpatients, 2 of them admitted in wards and 1 at intensive care unit. The severity of hyposmia in the patients was 2 (8%) as mild, 5 (20%) moderate, and 11 (72%) as anosmia. The most common allergic and underlying comorbid diseases were allergic rhinitis (88%) and thyroid disorders (28%). Further, the average SNOT-22 score in 4 SNOT-22 domains (nasal, otologic, sleep, and emotional symptoms) was significantly decreased in CRS patients after a period of one year since the pandemic started (40.1  18.0 vs. 46.3  17.7; P < .0001). DISCUSSION This study showed a low frequency of COVID-19 in patients with CRS and about the same rate of infection positivity in the general population; therefore, we concluded that CRS could not be considered as a risk factor for COVID-19.

Many of the emerging SSE initiatives are close to cooperatives in their governance and management. This paper presents perspectives of cooperative apexes/federations from India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines and South Korea who represent close to 140 million members on the SSE. While the overall outlook of regional cooperatives towards engagement within the SSE is positive, their involvement is limited. The strength of cooperatives lies in their history, presence across countries and sectors, and the Cooperative Identity. However, the perception about cooperatives and their chequered performance is seeing the rise of SSE organisations (SSEOs). Cooperatives as people-centred organisations with a strong foundation in their identity, have the power to steer SSE initiatives in the post-pandemic world. This paper makes the case for centering cooperatives and Cooperative Identity within the SSE but is limited to the views of nine cooperative apexes/federations from seven countries.

To overcome the physical isolation and collect impressions, the How are you? online questionnaire was created and shared as a conversation among friends. Text mining techniques have been applied to almost one hundred replies, to highlight similarities and differences in the experiences lived during the lockdown, changes in daily actions, thoughts and reflections. Our findings show that the lockdown period was experienced as a moment of physical and relational confinement, provoking feelings such as fear, sadness and restlessness concerning the near future. However, it appears that many respondents accepted this lockdown as an opportunity to reorder their own lives, in terms of physical activities such as daily habits, and personal relationships and priorities. The fresco on which the paper is based is unique in terms of time, space, gender and professions.

The newly synthesized nanoparticle was nontoxic and efficient at a single dose, showing sustained drug release for 15 days in vitro.

Human serum albumin (HSA) decreased the efficacy of both GaTP and CDGaTP in a concentration-dependent manner. The NTMs incubated with GaTP or CDGaTP significantly produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating potential inhibition of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase. The single-dose CDGaTP displayed a prolonged intracellular inhibitory activity in an in vitro macrophage infection model against both NTMs. In addition, CDGaTP, not GaTP, was effective in a murine lung M. avium infection model when delivered via intranasal administration.

However, in critically ill patients with COVID-19 the immune system is inadequately activated leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acute kidney injury, which is associated with higher mortality. Therefore, we characterized local complement deposition as a sign of activation in both lungs and kidneys from patients with severe COVID-19. Using immunohistochemistry we investigated deposition of complement factors C1q, MASP-2, factor D (CFD), C3c, C3d and C5b-9 as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive neutrophils and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in lungs and kidneys from 38 patients who died from COVID-19. In addition, tissue damage was analyzed using semi-quantitative scores followed by correlation with complement deposition. Autopsy material from non-COVID patients who died from cardiovascular causes, cerebral hemorrhage and pulmonary embolism served as control (n=8). Lung injury in samples from COVID-19 patients was significantly more pronounced compared to controls with formation of hyaline membranes, thrombi and edema. In addition, in the kidney tubular injury was higher in these patients and correlated with lung injury (r=0.361*). In autopsy samples SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected in 22% of the lungs of COVID-19 patients but was lacking in kidneys. Complement activation was significantly stronger in lung samples from patients with COVID-19 via the lectin and alternative pathway as indicated by deposition of MASP-2, CFD, C3d and C5b9. Deposits in the lung were predominantly detected along the alveolar septa, the hyaline membranes and in the alveolar lumina. In the kidney, complement was significantly more deposited in patients with COVID-19 in peritubular capillaries and tubular basement membranes. Renal COVID-19-induced complement activation occurred via the lectin pathway, while activation of the alternative pathway was similar in both groups. Furthermore, MPO-positive neutrophils were found in significantly higher numbers in lungs and kidneys of COVID-19 patients and correlated with local MASP-2 deposition. In conclusion, in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection complement was activated in both lungs and kidneys indicating that complement might be involved in systemic worsening of the inflammatory response. Complement inhibition might thus be a promising treatment option to prevent deregulated activation and subsequent collateral tissue injury in COVID-19.","output":"Complement Activation via the Lectin and Alternative Pathway in Patients With Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study examines the impact of the policies against the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 on outpatient facilities through a direct comparison of the key performance indicators measured in an ordinary and pandemic scenario.

For epitope mapping, in this study, a series of 51 partially overlapping fragments covering entire NS1 protein were expressed with a GST-tag and then screened by a monoclonal antibody (mAb). Through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), linear epitope-containing fragment, the overlapping region of NS1-18 and NS1-19 (residues 145-152), was located. Then a set of peptides derived from that overlapping region with deletions were expressed and subjected to ELISA and Western blot for further mapping purpose. Results indicated that the motif of (146)EHARW(150) is the minimal unit of the linear epitope recognized by that monoclonal antibody (mAb). Western blot showed that this epitope could be recognized by JEV-positive serum from pigs. Furthermore, it was found that the epitope is highly conserved among JEV strains through sequence alignments analysis. Notably, none of the homologous regions on NS1 proteins of other flavivirus could react with the mAb when they were tested for cross-reactivity, suggesting the potential clinical application of this epitope in differential diagnosis.","output":"Identification of a virus-specific and conserved B-cell epitope on NS1 protein of Japanese encephalitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among health-care workers (HCW) can assess past exposure and possible immunity, which varies across different regions, populations and times.

An English-language version of these guidelines was created based on the contents of the original Japanese-language version. The purpose of this guideline is to assist medical staff in making appropriate decisions to improve the prognosis of patients undergoing treatment for sepsis and septic shock. We aimed to provide high-quality guidelines that are easy to use and understand for specialists, general clinicians, and multidisciplinary medical professionals. J-SSCG 2016 took up new subjects that were not present in SSCG 2016 (e.g., ICU-acquired weakness [ICU-AW], post-intensive care syndrome [PICS], and body temperature management). The J-SSCG 2020 covered a total of 22 areas with four additional new areas (patient- and family-centered care, sepsis treatment system, neuro-intensive treatment, and stress ulcers). A total of 118 important clinical issues (clinical questions, CQs) were extracted regardless of the presence or absence of evidence. These CQs also include those that have been given particular focus within Japan.

METHODS: In 2012-2016, a community-based cohort of PWID who had injected within the past month were enrolled in a study to assess HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) andMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections and their related risk factors. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews, serological testing and spirometry. Baseline data were used for a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and correlates of OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with OLD. RESULTS: Among 516 participants who had complete spirometry and interview results, the mean age was 43.3 years, 73.6% were male, 9.5% were Black, 91.1% smoked cigarettes and 18.2% had OLD. Few (9.6%) PWID with OLD reported a previous diagnosis of COPD although many (44.7%) reported related symptoms.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all consecutive admissions to ED from 1 January to 9 April in both 2019 and 2020. According to the ED discharge ICD-9-CM code, patients were grouped in urological and respiratory patients. We evaluated the type of access (self-presented/ambulance), discharge priority code, ED discharge (hospitalization, home), need for urological consultation or urgent surgery. RESULTS: The number of urological diagnoses in ED was inversely associated to COVID-19 diagnoses (95% confidence interval -0.41/-0.19; Beta = -0.8; P < .0001). The average access per day was significantly lower after 10 March 2020 (1.5  1.1 vs 6.5  2.6; P < .0001), compared to reference period. From 11 March 2020, the inappropriate admissions to ED were reduced (10/45 vs 96/195; P = .001). Consequently, the patients admitted were generally more demanding, requiring a higher rate of urgent surgeries (4/45 vs 4/195; P = .02). This reflected in an increase of the hospitalization rate from 12.7% to 17.8% (Beta = 0.88; P < .0001) during 2020.

RESULTS: A thematic content analysis yielded four core themes: (1) educational impact, (2) time management, (3) challenges encountered, and (4) preferences for the future. The online modality was well-received, and all participants agreed that online sessions were time saving and that their performance was improved due to enhanced utility of time; however, they indicated that they encountered some challenges, including methodological, content perception, technical, and behavioral challenges during sessions and online exams. Most of the preclinical students preferred online learning for the upcoming academic years. CONCLUSION: Synchronized online classes were well-accepted by the medical students. This represents significant and promising potential for the future of medical education. The principles of the online learning model and learning outcomes should be rigorously and regularly evaluated to monitor its effectiveness.","output":"The sudden transition to synchronized online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: a qualitative study exploring medical students perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four emergency shelters were instituted in Lisbon during COVID-19, and are still in operation.

In this study, we investigated NSAIDs as potential inhibitors for chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 to find out the best candidates, which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. We also predicted the effect of NSAIDs on the arachidonic pathway and evaluated the hepatotoxicity of the compounds using systems biology techniques. Molecular docking was conducted via AutoDock Vina to estimate the interactions and binding affinities between selected NSAIDs and the main protease. Molecular docking results showed the presence of 10 NSAIDs based on lower binding energy (kcal/mol) toward the 3CLpro inhibition site compared to the co-crystal native ligand Inhibitor N3 (?6.6 kcal/mol). To validate the docking results, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations on the top inhibitor, Talniflumate, were performed. To obtain differentially-expressed genes under the 27 NSAIDs perturbations, we utilized the L1000 final Z-scores from the NCBI GEO repository (GSE92742). The obtained dataset included gene expression profiling signatures for 27 NSAIDs. The hepatotoxicity of NSAIDs was studied by systems biology modeling of Disturbed Metabolic Pathways.

Viral gene therapy enables targeted delivery of therapeutic transgenes and represents an attractive platform for tackling acquired and inherited cardiovascular diseases in the future. Current cardiovascular gene therapy trials in humans mainly focus on improving cardiac angiogenesis and function. Encouragingly, local delivery of therapeutic transgenes utilising first-generation human adenovirus serotype (HAd)-5 is safe in the short term and has shown some efficacy in drug refractory angina pectoris and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Despite this success, systemic delivery of therapeutic HAd-5 vectors targeting cardiovascular tissues and internal organs is limited by negligible gene transfer to target cells, elimination by the immune system, liver sequestration, off-target effects, and episomal degradation. To circumvent these barriers, cardiovascular gene therapy research has focused on determining the safety and efficacy of rare alternative serotypes and/or genetically engineered adenoviral capsid protein-modified vectors following local or systemic delivery. Pre-clinical studies have identified several vectors including HAd-11, HAd-35, and HAd-20C42-42 as promising platforms for local and systemic targeting of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In the past, clinical gene therapy trials were often restricted by limited scale-up capabilities of gene therapy medicinal products (GTMPs) and lack of regulatory guidance. However, significant improvement of industrial GTMP scale-up and purification, development of novel producer cell lines, and issuing of GTMP regulatory guidance by national regulatory health agencies have addressed many of these challenges, creating a more robust framework for future adenoviral-based cardiovascular gene therapy. In addition, this has enabled the mass roll out of adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. KEY MESSAGES: First-generation HAd-5 vectors are widely used in cardiovascular gene therapy. HAd-5-based gene therapy was shown to lead to cardiac angiogenesis and improved function. Novel HAd vectors may represent promising transgene carriers for systemic delivery. Novel methods allow industrial scale-up of rare/genetically altered Ad serotypes.

In this study, we describe the activities process at a community cafeteria located within a housing complex and operated by resident volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide inexpensive meals. We also report the preliminary results of the impact of such activities on the residents.MethodThis case study was conducted at the community cafeteria Tate Kitchen 'Sakura' located within a Tokyo housing complex with a high ageing population. We collected data on the cafeteria activities during February to May, 2020. The data sources were daily activity records of the cafeteria, dialogues between volunteers and residents, and photos of activities. We qualitatively assessed the effects of the activities on the residents by classifying interviews with ten users and six volunteer staff based on the Kawakita Jiro (KJ) method.ResultsDuring the observation period, regular meetings were held among board members and volunteers, and operations of the cafeteria were verified and modified by referring to the COVID-19 prevention guide for citizens, advice from health professionals, and residents' opinions. It was determined that activities would continue without cessation; the cafeteria, managed mainly by volunteers under the food hygiene control system required for commercial restaurants, was open five days a week to maintain food security and ensure the health of the residents. The number of meals sold at the cafeteria was halved in May (n = 2,149) as a result of the modification in operations. However, the number of meals delivered to each household increased from March because of increased demand. Qualitative analyses using KJ method showed that users perceived that these continued activities were effective in securing food, maintaining social interaction and promoting health, and health promotion, while volunteers perceived that the activities were effective in promoting social interaction and health.ConclusionThe resident volunteers continually confirmed their commitment to the principle of protecting food security and health within the community. They continued to operate the cafeteria by referring to available information on COVID-19 preventive measures, adopting the COVID-19 preventive measures, and involving all stakeholders.

The use of selenium as a tool in organic synthesis and as a pharmacological agent goes back to the middle of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The rediscovery of ebselen and its investigation in clinical trials have motivated the search for new organoselenium molecules with pharmacological properties. Although ebselen and diselenides have some overlapping pharmacological properties, their molecular targets are not identical. However, they have similar anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, possibly, via activation of transcription factors, regulating the expression of antioxidant genes. In short, our knowledge about the pharmacological properties of simple organoselenium compounds is still elusive. However, contrary to our early expectations that they could imitate selenoproteins, organoselenium compounds seem to have non-specific modulatory activation of antioxidant pathways and specific inhibitory effects in some thiol-containing proteins. The thiol-oxidizing properties of organoselenium compounds are considered the molecular basis of their chronic toxicity; however, the acute use of organoselenium compounds as inhibitors of specific thiol-containing enzymes can be of therapeutic significance. In summary, the outcomes of the clinical trials of ebselen as a mimetic of lithium or as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 proteases will be important to the field of organoselenium synthesis. The development of computational techniques that could predict rational modifications in the structure of organoselenium compounds to increase their specificity is required to construct a library of thiol-modifying agents with selectivity toward specific target proteins.","output":"Toxicology and pharmacology of synthetic organoselenium compounds: an update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The current risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in schools continues to be a subject of controversy.

AI would be a powerful tool to fight against this pandemic outbreak by predicting the number of cases in advance. Deep learning-based time series techniques are considered to predict world-wide COVID-19 cases in advance for short-term and medium-term dependencies with adaptive learning. Initially, the data pre-processing and feature extraction is made with the real world COVID-19 dataset. Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID 19 cases, multivariate LSTM models employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model.

We also found an increased MAPK10 genetic mutation rate and decreased mRNA expression in older patients. Low MAPK10 and NRF2 expression levels were associated with shorter survival and poorer prognosis due to positive correlation with microvascular invasion, tumor thrombus, elevated AFP levels, and larger tumor size. Conclusion: NRF2 expression and oxidative stress mechanism in HCC patients are influenced by age. This magnifies the need to consider patients' age in treatment strategies and guidelines and re-evaluates the application of studies' age-standardized findings in older patients who are usually excluded from relevant research.","output":"The Age-Specific Features and Clinical Significance of NRF2 and MAPK10 Expression in HCC Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a strong risk factor for complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) The effect of T2DM medications on COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 131 patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, we have previously found that metformin use prior to hospitalization is associated with reduced mortality Here we continue to investigate the effects of inpatient use of T2DM medications, including metformin, acarbose, insulin, and sulfonylureas, on the mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM during hospitalization We found that patients using metformin and acarbose, alone or both together, after admission were significantly more likely to survive than those who did not use either metformin or acarbose Thus, our analyses suggest that inpatient use of metformin and acarbose together or alone during hospitalization should be studied in randomized trials","output":"Inpatient Use of Metformin and Acarbose Is Associated with Reduced Mortality of COVID-19 Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly identified pathogen able of human transmission that causes a mortality of almost 40%.

CASE SUMMARY A 24-year-old female with community-acquired pneumonia presented with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. To maintain adequate sedation and ventilation and reduce airway pressure, several relaxation strategies were used including high-dose intravenous lorazepam, fentanyl, and cisatracurium. After 18 days of high-dose continuous infusion of lorazepam (maximum dose 50 mg/h), the patient developed severe lactic acidosis secondary to propylene glycol toxicity, the main diluent of lorazepam. The acidosis temporarily resolved with bicarbonate administration and discontinuation of lorazepam. Her renal function remained stable for a time (serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, urine output 100-200 mL/h). However, after several more days, the patient's condition deteriorated, and she ultimately died. DISCUSSION Previous cases of propylene glycol toxicity secondary to high-dose lorazepam infusion have occurred in patients with compromised renal function. Our patient's renal function remained stable throughout the hospital course, which caused us to look further for an explanation for the propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, propylene glycol was determined to be the probable cause of lactic acidosis. Since this case occurred, our intensive care unit has instituted recommendations for the prevention of lorazepam-associated propylene glycol toxicity. CONCLUSIONS Our case highlights the development of propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis secondary to high-dose lorazepam infusion not associated with renal dysfunction.","output":"Propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis in a patient with normal renal function: a proposed mechanism and monitoring recommendations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat Internet hospitals have emerged as a critical technology to bring epidemic-related online services and medical support to the public However, there is little and very new scientific literature exploring the effects of internet hospitals on psychological burden and disease cognition in major public health emergencies like COVID-19 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals in relieving psychological burden and increasing disease cognition during the early outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: This survey was conducted from January 26, 2020 to February 1, 2020, which was the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China The platform used to the consultation was the WeChat public account of our hospital People all over the country could apply for the free consultation as long as they had access to the WeChat The procedure of free COVID-19 consultation services was as follows: First, people must answer a list of questions to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 Next, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire after confirmation of their willingness to participate voluntarily Then, clinicians would communicated with people on their symptoms and psychological state, whether they developed COVID-19, prevention and control of the disease, and whatever questions until the people actively ends the online consultation Finally, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire again The questionnaire included: general information, general health questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), their worries, disease cognition and medical needs RESULTS: The total number of internet consultation was 4120 The consultation content mainly included 60 4%(2489/4120) respiratory symptoms such as cough, expectoration and fever and 24 8% (1023/4120) disease knowledge, anxiety and fear A total of 1530 people filled out questionnaires before and after internet consultation 91 4% (1398/1530) of the people had psychological stress reaction before internet consultation, which was significantly higher than that after consultation (17 0%, 260/1530) (2=1704 800, P 001) There was no significant difference in the percentage of people who expressed worry about the COVID-19 pandemic before and after internet consultation (2=0 710, P= 43) However, the degree of worry after internet consultation was significantly alleviated than that before internet consultation (t=90 638, P= 001) The main worries before and after consultation were the disease's danger and the risk for family and relatives to be infected The scores of self-assessment risk after internet consultation was significantly lower than those before consultation (t=95 694, P= 001) After consultation, the people' cognition of the symptoms, transmission routes and preventive measures of COVID-19 was higher than that before consultation, the difference was statistically significant (t=-106 105, -80 456 and -152 605 respectively, all P= 001) The score of medical needs after internet consultation was (1 6  0 8), lower than that before consultation (3 3  1 2), the difference was statistically significant (t=45 765, P 001) CONCLUSIONS: During the early outbreak of COVID-19, internet hospital can help relieving psychological burden and increasing disease cognition of people through timely and rapid spread of COVID-19 prevention and control knowledge Internet hospitals should be an important part of a new medical model in public health emergency system CLINICALTRIAL: Not applicable","output":"The Effects of Internet Hospitals on Psychological Burden and Disease Cognition during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China: cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Participatory visual research can offer critical insight into the experiences of those most affected by health issues.

Examples include non-dignified care, lack of respect when giving care, discrimination and abandonment of care. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes towards obstetric violence in a cohort of medical students in India and the UK. STUDY DESIGN An online survey was sent to 240 UK and 280 Indian medical students. This incorporated a video showing a dramatized scenario of obstetric violence. The survey assessed participant's demographics and prior knowledge of obstetric violence. Participants scored their perceptions of eight behaviours in the video on visual analogue scales. Participants were asked to reflect on their own practice and score this. Comparisons of survey responses between UK and Indian participants were made using chi squared/Student's t-test. RESULTS 62 Indian medical students and 58 UK medical students completed the survey. Indian medical students were significantly more likely to be male (p < 0.001). 26 % of UK participants had previously heard the term obstetric violence, compared to 34 % of Indian participants (p = 0.15). Both were able to correctly define obstetric violence at similar rates (32 % versus 34 %). Indian medical students were significantly less critical (p < 0.001) of all eight scored behaviours in the video of obstetric violence compared to their UK counterparts. UK medical students were significantly less likely to agree that the video had changed their perception on how teams should behave and act in this context (p < 0.001). 90 % of UK participants and 38 % of Indian participants had received training in professional behaviours. 14 % of UK participants had seen examples of obstetric violence in clinical practice compared to 49 % of Indian participants. CONCLUSIONS UK and Indian medical students were able to identify behaviours associated with obstetric violence, although the majority were previously unaware of the term. Indian medical students in this study were less critical of obstetric violence in the video, which may be because of cultural reasons, greater numbers of male students, greater exposure to obstetric violence or less training on professional behaviours.

Characterization of SARS-CoV N multimerization may thereby help us better understand the coronavirus assembly. In the current work, using the yeast two-hybrid technique, an unexpected interaction between residues 1-210 and 211-290 (central region) of the SARS-CoV N protein was detected, and SPR results further revealed that the SR-rich motif (amino acids 183-197) of SARS-CoV N protein is responsible for such an interaction. Chemical cross-linking and gel-filtration analyses indicated that the residues 283-422 of the SARS-CoV N protein have multimeric ability, although the full-length N protein is prone to exist predominantly as dimers. In addition, the multimeric ability of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could be weakened by the SR-rich motif interaction with the central region (amino acids 211-290). All of these data suggested that the SR-rich motif of the SARS-CoV N protein might play an import role in the transformation of the SARS-CoV N protein between the dimer and multimer during its binding to its central region for self-association or dissociation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that diabetic nephropathy is amongst the independent risk factors that predicts unfavourable outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection. While we still lack conclusive mechanistic insights into how nephrons are rapidly lost upon SARS-CoV2 infection and why patients with diabetic nephropathy are more susceptible to severe outcomes upon SARS-CoV2 infection, here, we discuss several aspects of the interface of COVID-19 with diabetic nephropathy. We identify the shortage of reliable rodent models of diabetic nephropathy, limited treatment options for human diabetic nephropathy and the lack of knowledge about virus-induced signalling pathways of regulated necrosis, such as necroptosis, as key factors that explain our failure to understand this system.

METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in geographically diverse medical centers in North America were included. Demographics, symptoms, laboratory data results, and outcomes were recorded. Linear and logistic regression identified factors associated with liver injury, in-hospital mortality, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Among 1555 patients in the cohort, most (74%) had an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during hospitalization, which was very severe (> 20  upper limit of normal [ULN]) in 3%. Severe acute liver injury (ALI) was uncommon, occurring in 0.1% on admission and 2% during hospitalization. No patient developed acute liver failure (ALF). Higher ALT was associated with leukocytosis (per mL(3)) ( 10.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7C12.6, p < 0.001) and vasopressors use ( 80.2, 95%CI 21.5C138.8, p = 0.007). In-hospital mortality was associated with ALT > 20  ULN (unadjusted OR 6.0, 95%CI 3.1C11.5, p < 0.001), ALP > 3  ULN (unadjusted OR 4.4, 95%CI 2.5C7.7, p < 0.001), and severe ALI (unadjusted OR 6.8, 95%CI 3.0C15.3, p < 0.001) but lost significance after adjusting for covariates related to severe COVID-19 and hemodynamic instability. Elevated ALP and ALT were associated with longer LOS, admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Transaminase elevation is common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Severe ALI is rare, and ALF may not be a complication of COVID-19.

This illness is poorly understood as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease severity, even younger adults, children, and those not hospitalized. While the precise definition of long COVID may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute COVID-19. Other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments in long COVID, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long COVID may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g. lung, brain, and heart) and pathological inflammation (e.g. from viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity). The associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnoea, prior psychiatric disorders, and specific biomarkers (e.g. D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count), although more research is required to substantiate such risk factors. While preliminary evidence suggests that personalized rehabilitation training may help certain long COVID cases, therapeutic drugs repurposed from other similar conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome, also hold potential.

Given the high social and economic cost of these viruses, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of how the airways defend against virus infection. Viruses entering cells by endocytosis are killed when delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Lysosome delivery is facilitated by non-canonical autophagy pathways that conjugate LC3 to endo-lysosome compartments to enhance lysosome fusion. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that non-canonical autophagy protects mice from lethal IAV infection of the airways. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity murine-adapted IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV infection was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy slowed fusion of IAV with endosomes and reduced activation of interferon signalling. This was consistent with conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showing that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leukocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy pathways in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence mechanism that can restrict IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.","output":"The WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 required for non-canonical autophagy limit lethal respiratory infection by influenza A virus at epithelial surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Employee social network strategies play a key role in firm strategies and organizational performance.

There is already a significant literature on the immediate impact of the outbreak, as well as on speculation on the future evolution of the industry. This paper seeks to contribute to this discussion by assessing a year into the crisis the demand related aspects and passenger behavioural impacts of the pandemic. Specifically, the paper aims to identify discrete market segments of air passengers according to their shared attitudes and preferences about air travel in light of the COVID-19 crisis, as well as past behaviour and future travel intentions. To achieve this, we analyse data from a large (n = 2096) online questionnaire survey of air passengers in Norway. The cluster analysis identifies four distinct passenger segments, with each displaying varying attitudes, behaviours, and levels of concern about air travel. One of these groups, described as the Apprehensive Elders, were identified as having the highest level of concern about flying, and subsequently showed a sharp decline in their intention to travel in the future. Another group, termed the Cautious Commuters, showed similarly enhanced levels of concerns about flying, but maintained a high propensity to fly following the pandemic despite these concerns.

Any knowledge thus gained should clarify how the pandemic has affected the overall physical and mental health of these individuals. The CHSS approach to measuring health status should help evaluate general populational needs, treatments, and programs in the COVID-19 context.Study significance. There is a lack of research on how populational health is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the context of physical and mental health functioning among the general population. This study holds significant potential in three main areas. First, the US faces an unprecedented and sweeping pandemic, which threatens both the quality of life and life itself across a broad populational spectrum. It is urgent to enhance our understanding of how COVID-19 affects the general population, which requires a rapid investigation of its widespread effects on physical and mental health. Second, the knowledge gained from exploring the relationship between COVID-19 and physical/mental health status will help design new clinical and community interventions that are tailored to general populational needs. Any new health and welfare interventions must be evaluated based on their actual impact. Third, a reliable, valid, and practical outcome measure is a priority area for understanding the physical and mental health consequences of COVID-19. Although physical and mental health care outcomes can be assessed through a variety of parameters, such as satisfaction and cost, health status is the most important.","output":"COVID-19 Health Status Scale (CHSS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During infectious disease outbreaks, the weakest communities are more vulnerable to infection and its deleterious effects. In Israel, the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have unique demographic and cultural characteristics that place them at higher risk of infection. OBJECTIVE: To examine socioeconomic and ethnic differences in rates of COVID-19 testing, confirmed cases and deaths, and to analyze patterns of transmission in ethnically diverse communities. METHODS: A cross-sectional ecologic study design was used. Consecutive data on rates of COVID-19 diagnostic testing, lab-confirmed cases, and deaths collected from March 31 through May 1, 2020, in 174 localities across Israel (84% of the population) were analyzed by socioeconomic ranking and ethnicity. RESULTS: Tests were performed on 331,594 individuals (4.29% of the total population). Of those, 14,865 individuals (4.48%) were positive for COVID-19 and 203 died (1.37% of confirmed cases). Testing rate was 26% higher in the lowest SE category compared with the highest. The risk of testing positive was 2.16 times higher in the lowest socioeconomic category, compared with the highest. The proportion of confirmed cases was 4.96 times higher in the Jewish compared with the Arab population. The rate of confirmed cases in 2 Ultra-Orthodox localities increased relatively early and quickly. Other Jewish and Arab localities showed consistently low rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of socioeconomic ranking. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally different communities reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak and to government measures, resulting in different outcomes. Socioeconomic and ethnic variables cannot fully explain communities' reaction to the pandemic.

This research explored factors affecting their decision making in the context of social determinants of health. A mixed methods design applying an explanatory sequential approach commenced with an online questionnaire followed by in-depth interviews with a sample of the same participants. The majority (56%) of participants indicated a positive intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but a substantially high proportion (44%) were uncertain or had no intention to be vaccinated. Significant factors affecting vaccine uptake included inadequate and sometimes misleading information leading to poor perceptions of vaccine safety. The personal benefits of vaccinationsuch as reduced social restrictions and increased mobilitywere perceived more positively than health benefits. Additionally, access issues created a structural barrier affecting uptake among those with positive or uncertain vaccination intentions. Understanding factors affecting vaccine uptake allows for more targeted, equitable and effective vaccination campaigns, essential given the importance of widespread COVID-19 vaccination coverage for public health.

The focus will be on the use of genomic testing for paediatric rare diseases. Methods This will be a four-year mixed-methods research programme using clinic observations, interviews and surveys. Study 1 consists of qualitative interviews with designers/implementers of the GMS in Year 1 of the research programme, along with documentary analysis to understand the intended outcomes for the Service. These will be revisited in Year 4 to compare intended outcomes with what happened in practice, and to identify barriers and facilitators that were encountered along the way. Study 2 consists of clinic observations (pre-test counselling and results disclosure) to examine the interaction between health professionals and parents, along with follow-up interviews with both after each observation. Study 3 consists of a longitudinal survey with parents at two timepoints (time of testing and 12 months post-results) along with follow-up interviews, to examine parent-reported experiences and outcomes. Study 4 consists of qualitative interviews and a cross-sectional survey with medical specialists to identify preparedness, facilitators and challenges to mainstreaming genomic testing. The use of theory-based and prespecified constructs will help generalise the findings and enable integration across the various sub-studies.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is a major structural protein of CoVs, binds to the viral RNA genome to form the virion core and results in the formation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. We have solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HCoV-OC43 N protein (N-NTD) (residues 58 to 195) to a resolution of 2.0?. The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD is a single domain protein composed of a five-stranded -sheet core and a long extended loop, similar to that observed in the structures of N-NTDs from other coronaviruses. The positively charged loop of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contains a structurally well-conserved positively charged residue, R106. To assess the role of R106 in RNA binding, we undertook a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments and docking simulations to characterize the interaction between R106 and RNA. The results show that R106 plays an important role in the interaction between the N protein and RNA. In addition, we showed that, in cells transfected with plasmids that encoded the mutant (R106A) N protein and infected with virus, the level of the matrix protein gene was decreased by 7-fold compared to cells that were transfected with the wild-type N protein. This finding suggests that R106, by enhancing binding of the N protein to viral RNA plays a critical role in the viral replication. The results also indicate that the strength of N protein/RNA interactions is critical for HCoV-OC43 replication.","output":"Crystal structure-based exploration of the important role of Arg106 in the RNA-binding domain of human coronavirus OC43 nucleocapsid protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whether the COVID-19 has natural or laboratory roots, it has so far posed serious challenges for many of the current human paradigms and the longer it takes, the greater impacts it will have on today's world order.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. RESULTS: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology.

The papers generally argue that controlled human infection (CHI) is ethically acceptable if (1) the risks to participants are low and therefore acceptable, (2) the scientific quality of the research is high, (3) the research has high social value, (4) participants give full informed consent, and (5) there is fair selection of participants.

This paper therefore looks specifically at the arguments relating to condition 3 'high social value' and condition 5 'fair selection of participants' and shows that whereas they may be valid, they are not sound. It is highly unlikely that the conditions that are necessary for ethical CHI trials to take place will be fulfilled.

RbCoV HKU14 was able to replicate in HRT-18G and RK13 cells with cytopathic effects. Northern blotting confirmed the production of subgenomic mRNAs coding for the HE, S, NS5a, E, M, and N proteins. Subgenomic mRNA analysis revealed a transcription regulatory sequence, 5'-UCUAAAC-3'. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RbCoV HKU14 formed a distinct branch among Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, being most closely related to but separate from the species Betacoronavirus 1. A comparison of the conserved replicase domains showed that RbCoV HKU14 possessed <90% amino acid identities to most members of Betacoronavirus 1 in ADP-ribose 1-phosphatase (ADRP) and nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), indicating that RbCoV HKU14 should represent a separate species. RbCoV HKU14 also possessed genomic features distinct from those of other Betacoronavirus subgroup A coronaviruses, including a unique NS2a region with a variable number of small open reading frames (ORFs). Recombination analysis revealed possible recombination events during the evolution of RbCoV HKU14 and members of Betacoronavirus 1, which may have occurred during cross-species transmission. Molecular clock analysis using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes dated the most recent common ancestor of RbCoV HKU14 to around 2002, suggesting that this virus has emerged relatively recently.

Of these, restaurant workers are among the high-risk professionals usually affected by WMSDs. In Ethiopia, evidence on the burden of musculoskeletal disorder and contributing factors among restaurant workers were very limited. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of self-reported WMSDs and contributing factors among restaurant workers in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2020 to March 2020 among restaurant workers in Gondar city. A two-stage sampling technique was used to choose 633 study subjects. A structured Nordic questioner was used to collect the data. Data was entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to Stata version 14.0 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were computed. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to measure the association between WMSDs and independent variables. In the multivariable analysis, a P value of <0.05 was used to declare a statistically significant association. To check the goodness of fit, the Hosmer and Lemeshow test was used. RESULTS: The prevalence of WMSDs among restaurant workers in the past 12 months was 81.5% [95% CI (78.18C84.44)]. Attending primary education [AOR: 2.14, 95% CI (1.17C3.90)], attending secondary education [AOR: 1.71 (1.02C2.86)], and job satisfaction [AOR: 1.90, 95%CI (1.13C3.19)] were significantly associated with WMSDs.

One factor in this pessimism seems to be concern that covid might always be able to re-emerge because of the ongoing presence of unrecognised asymptomatic cases.

If superspreaders are responsible for most of the spread, then, with the average number of secondary cases fixed at say R0=2.5, we have to conclude that superspreaders are relatively rare. When towards the end of an elimination program, there are very few infected people, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, that small number of people may well not include any superspreaders. As a result, chance effects may make extinction likely. Nevertheless it is clear an attempt at elimination will require a rather onerous lockdown.

Chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions refer to chronic diseases that can be managed in primary care settings, including angina, asthma, and diabetes, with hospitalizations for these conditions considered potentially avoidable with adequate primary care interventions. Socioeconomic inequities in the risk of hospitalization have been observed in several health systems globally. While there are multiple studies examining the association between socioeconomic status and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, these studies have not been systematically reviewed. The objective of this study is to systematically identify and describe socioeconomic inequalities in hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions amongst adult populations in economically developed countries reported in high-quality observational studies published in the peer-reviewed literature. METHODS Peer-reviewed literature was searched in six health and social science databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ASSIA, and IBSS using search terms for hospitalization, socioeconomic status, and chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Study titles and abstracts were first screened followed by full-text review according to the following eligibility criteria: 1) Study outcome is hospitalization for selected chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions; 2) Primary exposure is individual- or area-level socioeconomic status; 3) Study population has a mean age  1 SD < 75 years of age; 4) Study setting is economically developed countries; and 5) Study type is observational. Relevant data was then extracted, and studies were critically appraised using appropriate tools from The Joanna Briggs Institute. Results were narratively synthesized according to socioeconomic constructs and type of adjustment (minimally versus fully adjusted). RESULTS Of the 15,857 unique peer-reviewed studies identified, 31 studies met the eligibility criteria and were of sufficient quality for inclusion. Socioeconomic constructs and hospitalization outcomes varied across studies. However, despite this heterogeneity, a robust and consistent association between lower levels of socioeconomic status and higher risk of hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions was observed. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review is the first to comprehensively identify and analyze literature on the relationship between SES and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, considering both aggregate and condition-specific outcomes that are common to several international health systems. The evidence consistently demonstrates that lower socioeconomic status is a risk factor for hospitalization across global settings. Effective health and social interventions are needed to reduce these inequities and ensure fair and adequate care across socioeconomic groups.

Therefore, we used fuzzy logic to develop fuzzy mathematical model for control of transmission and spreading of COVID19. The fuzzy control of early transmission and spreading of coronavirus by fuzzy mathematical model will be very effective. The proposed research work is on fuzzy mathematical model of intelligent decision systems under the spherical fuzzy information. In the proposed work, we will develop a newly and generalized technique for COVID19 based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) methods under spherical fuzzy environment. Finally, an illustrative the emergency situation of COVID-19 is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the suggested method, along with a sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, showing the feasibility and reliability of its results.","output":"A new emergency response of spherical intelligent fuzzy decision process to diagnose of COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most viral vaccines are based on inducing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the virus envelope or spike glycoproteins.

Limited access to specialized care facilities and expanding patient populations, combined with unprecedented mobility restrictions imposed by the coronavirus disease pandemic, are currently stressing the need for remote solutions in this field. Studies in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been heterogeneous in objectives and methodology but generally support the concept that TM interventions produce clinical benefits, cost-effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Nonetheless, data on live interaction between patients and health care providers for MS teleconsultation purposes remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of planned real time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet for patients with MS. METHODS: A total of 20 patients with MS presenting at a specialized MS center in Belgium were recruited for this study. One teleconsultation was scheduled for each participant. Patients were provided a unique hyperlink by mail in advance, leading them automatically and directly to the virtual waiting room, where they could accept or decline our incoming call. All teleconsultations were performed by a trained medical student with the intention to keep the conversation similar to what is usually discussed during a classic face-to-face MS consultation; no remote physical exams were performed. The approach was considered feasible if at least 80% of the planned TM visits could be successfully completed at the foreseen moment. Patient satisfaction (technical quality, convenience, and overall quality of care) was evaluated at the end of each teleconsultation by means of 5-point Likert scales containing the categories very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied, and highly satisfied. RESULTS: Out of 20 consultations, 17 were successfully completed (85%). Failures were due to patients not responding (n=2) and technical issues (n=1). Out of the 17 consultations, 17 patients declared themselves satisfied or highly satisfied for technical quality, 15 patients for convenience, and 16 patients for overall quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: Planned real time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet is feasible and highly appreciated in patients with MS. Incorporation of such services in routine clinical MS practice is expected to improve access to specialized care facilities for affected patients.","output":"Feasibility of Real Time Internet-Based Teleconsultation in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis: Interventional Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Acute grief appears more severe after COVID-19 deaths than natural deaths. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) also appears prevalent following COVID-19 deaths. Researchers hypothesize that specific loss characteristics and pandemic-related circumstances may precipitate more severe grief following COVID-19 deaths compared to (other) natural deaths. Systematic research on these hypotheses may help identify those most at risk for severe grief reactions, yet it is scant. Objective To compare loss characteristics, loss circumstances, and grief levels among people bereaved due to COVID-19, natural, and unnatural causes. Methods Adults bereaved through COVID-19 (n = 99), natural causes (n = 1006), and unnatural causes (n = 161) completed an online survey. We administered self-report measures of demographic variables (i.e., age, gender), loss characteristics (i.e., time since loss, relationship with the deceased, intensive care admission, expectedness of death), loss circumstances (i.e., saying goodbye appropriately, COVID-19 infection, quarantine, financial setbacks, social support satisfaction, altered funeral arrangements, funeral satisfaction), and prolonged grief symptoms. Results COVID-19 deaths (vs. other deaths) more often were parental deaths and less often child deaths. COVID-19 deaths (vs. natural deaths) were more often unexpected and characterized by an inability to say goodbye appropriately. People bereaved due to COVID-19 (vs. other deaths) were more often infected and quarantined. COVID-19 deaths (vs. other deaths) more often involved intensive care admission and altered funeral arrangements. COVID-19 deaths yielded higher grief levels than natural deaths (but not unnatural deaths). Expectedness of the death and the inability to say goodbye appropriately explained this effect. Conclusions Bereavement due to COVID-19 is characterized by a unique set of loss characteristics and circumstances and elevated grief levels. Improving opportunities to say goodbye before and after death (e.g., by means of rituals) may provide an important means to prevent and reduce severe grief following COVID-19 deaths.

While there is some research regarding acute care for post-COVID patients, there is a need for information later in the recovery process.3Most of those in the post-acute phase have cardiopulmonary complications, but there is increased evidence of neurological and orthopedic components.4 This case series aims to discuss the physical therapy treatment of two post-COVID patients based on NYU's categorizations 'debility with COVID-19,' or 'neurological with COVID-19' and highlight their differences.5 CASE DESCRIPTION: Two subjects admitted to an acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) facility after hospital stay of 42 (subject A) and 64 days (subject B), due to COVID- 19. The latter being longer due to development of a lacunar stroke. Both are male with an average age of 54.5 years. Each received symptom specific physical therapy 2-3hrs, 6-7 days/week. Subject A received cardiopulmonary therapy, nightly CPAP, standard balance and strengthening exercises. Limitations were O2 desaturation and orthostatic hypotension. Patient B received functional strengthening, balance and blocked motor control exercises to promote neural plasticity. AIR length of stay was 17 days for patient A and 28 days for patient B. OUTCOMES: Outcome measures included the Berg Balance Score (BBS), 6 min walk test, and 10m walk test. O2 saturation levels and heart rate were monitored with activity. For patient A, BBS improved by 19 points, 6 min walk improved by more than 100ft, limited primarily by O2 desaturation. No significant change in gait speed was made, but he transitioned from rolling walker to cane. For patient B, BBS improved by 36 points, 6 min walk improved by over 800ft, and gait speed by .32 m/s. Patient B received a right ankle-foot orthotic and required a rolling walker. Neither subject required O2 at discharge. Patient A was at an independent level, but had decreased cardiovascular endurance and activity tolerance. Patient B was largely independent but required intermittent supervision with some higher level activities, primarily due to motor control deficits. DISCUSSION: By the end of their inpatient rehabilitation stay, both patients made statistically significant improvements in all measured outcomes. This suggests while a primary focus will be on treatment of pulmonary impairments, there should also be adjustments made based on their individual presentation of COVID and neuromuscular deficits. In conclusion, the outcomes of this case series demonstrate the efficacy of treating post-COVID patients with variable presentations in the acute inpatient rehabilitation physical therapy setting.","output":"Acute inpatient rehabilitation of two post-covid presentations: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) local recurrence after radical nephrectomy is uncommon. When feasible, surgical removal remains the primary treatment strategy; nevertheless, local RCC relapse management is controversial, and less invasive procedures may represent an attractive option to achieve oncologic control. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of image-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) for RCC local recurrence in patients initially treated with nephrectomy with curative intent. 10 consecutive patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous MWA of a total of 10 retroperitoneal nodules. Inclusion criteria were: histologically verified retroperitoneal metastases, previous radical nephrectomy, lesion no larger than 3 cm, no other metastatic site elsewhere. All the procedures were performed under moderate sedation choosing the most favorable patient decubitus. If deemed necessary, pneumodissection was induced before ablation. After the antenna placement inside the target lesion, thermal ablation was achieved by maintenance of a power of 100 W for a total time between 2 and 4 min. All patients were observed overnight and discharged the following day if clinically stable. Technical success was obtained in 100% of patients. One patient was re-treated to complete oncologic response with repeat MWA. No major complications were observed. No patients demonstrated local recurrence at a mean follow-up of 26 months. MWA is a safe and effective treatment strategy for loco-regional relapse of RCC following radical nephrectomy.

Assessing case density and spread of infection is critical and relies largely on clinical testing data. However, clinical testing suffers from known limitations, including test availability and a bias towards enumerating only symptomatic individuals. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has gained widespread support as a potential complement to clinical testing for assessing COVID-19 infections at the community scale. The efficacy of WBE hinges on the ability to accurately characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. To date, a variety of sampling schemes have been used without consensus around the appropriateness of grab or composite sampling. Here we address a key WBE knowledge gap by examining the variability of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater grab samples collected every 2 hours for 72 hours compared with corresponding 24-hour flow-weighted composite samples. Results show relatively low variability (mean for all assays = 741 copies 100 mL-1, standard deviation = 508 copies 100 mL-1) for grab sample concentrations, and good agreement between most grab samples and their respective composite (mean deviation from composite = 159 copies 100 mL-1). When SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are used to calculate viral load, the discrepancy between grabs (log10 difference = 12.0) or a grab and its associated composite (log10 difference = 11.8) are amplified. A similar effect is seen when estimating carrier prevalence in a catchment population with median estimates based on grabs ranging 62-1853 carriers. Findings suggest that grab samples may be sufficient to characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, but additional calculations using these data may be sensitive to grab sample variability and warrant the use of flow-weighted composite sampling. These data inform future WBE work by helping determine the most appropriate sampling scheme and facilitate sharing of datasets between studies via consistent methodology.","output":"Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Concentration and Loading Variability from Grab and 24-Hour Composite Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Mojave Desert of North America has become fire\\\\prone in recent decades due to invasive annual grasses that fuel wildfires following years of high rainfall.

We tested our predictions in two experimental studies. In Study 1, American participants evaluated the same costs (public shaming, deaths and illnesses, and police abuse of power) as more acceptable when they resulted from efforts to minimize C19's health impacts, than when they resulted from non-health C19 efforts (e.g., prioritizing economic costs) or efforts unrelated to C19 (e.g., reducing traffic deaths). In Study 2, New Zealand participants less favorably evaluated the quality of a research proposal empirically questioning continuing a C19 elimination strategy in NZ than one questioning abandoning an elimination strategy, although both proposals contained the same amount of methodology information. This finding suggests questioning elimination approaches is morally condemned, a similar response to that found when sacred values are questioned. In both studies, condition effects were mediated by lowered moral outrage in response to costs resulting from pursuing health-minded C19 efforts.

RESULTS Demographic data, travel history, clinical features, and outcomes were summarized and compared between COVID-19 confirmed and non-confirmed cases. The first two confirmed cases were Chinese nationals, admitted on Jan. 25. The third confirmed case was a Filipino, admitted on Mar. 8. Trends toward confirmed COVID-19 cases not reporting international travel and being admitted to SLH from the densely populated area of Manila city were observed during Mar. 8-29. All 42 of the 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were adults, 40% were aged 60 years and above and 55% were male. Three were health workers. Among individuals with suspected COVID-19, confirmed cases were more likely to be older, Filipino, not report international travel history and have at least one underlying disease, particularly diabetes, report difficulty in breathing, and a longer duration of symptoms. In over 90% of non-COVID-19 cases, the alternative diagnosis was respiratory. Nine (21%) confirmed cases died. The median duration from symptoms onset to death was 11.5 (range: 8-18) days.

It was already shown to inhibit growth and pathogenic mechanisms of a variety of enveloped RNA viruses and it was now found that circulating H(2)S is higher in Covid 19 survivors compared to fatal cases. H(2)S release is triggered by carbon monoxide (CO) from the catabolism of heme by inducible heme oxygenase (HO-1) and heme proteins possess catalytic activity necessary for the H(2)S signalling by protein persulfidation. Subjects with a long promoter for the HMOX1 gene, coding for HO-1, are predicted for lower efficiency of this mechanism. SARS-cov-2 exerts ability to attack the heme of hemoglobin and other heme-proteins thus hampering both release and signalling of H(2)S. Lack of H(2)S-induced persulfidation of the K(ATP) channels of leucocytes causes adhesion and release of the inflammatory cytokines, lung infiltration and systemic endothelial damage with hyper-coagulability. These events largely explain the sex and age distribution, clinical manifestations and co-morbidities of Covid-19. The understanding of this mechanism may be of guidance in re-evaluating the ongoing therapeutic strategies, with special attention to the interaction with mechanical ventilation, paracetamol and chloroquine use, and in the individuation of genetic traits causing increased susceptibility to the disruption of these physiologic processes and to a critical Covid 19.

We reported herein a case of CCF in a patient diagnosed with GBD, having a previous history of inactive GO, a diagnostic challenge, since the first presumed diagnosis in patients with GBD is always GO. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three previous reports in the medical literature in which the CCF was diagnosed in a GBD patient with a history of GO. Abbreviations: CCF = Carotid Cavernous Fistula, GBD = Graves-Basedow disease, GO = Graves' ophthalmopathy, CS = cavernous sinus, SOV = superior ophthalmic vein, ICA = internal carotid artery, IOP = intraocular pressure.","output":"A tricky case of unilateral orbital inflammation: carotid cavernous fistula in Graves-Basedow disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurological symptoms are frequently reported in patients suffering from COVID-19. Common CNS-related symptoms include anosmia, caused by viral interaction with either neurons or supporting cells in nasal olfactory tissues. Diffuse encephalopathy is the most common sign of CNS dysfunction, which likely results from the CNS consequences of the systemic inflammatory syndrome associated with severe COVID-19. Additionally, microvascular injuries and thromboembolic events likely contribute to the neurologic impact of acute COVID-19. These observations are supported by evidence of CNS immune activation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in autopsy tissue, along with the detection of microvascular injuries in both pathological and neuroimaging studies. The frequent occurrence of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 has generated different hypotheses, among which viral interaction with perivascular cells is particularly attractive, yet unproven. A distinguishing feature of CSF findings in SARS-CoV-2 infection is that clinical signs characteristic of neurotropic viral infections (CSF pleocytosis and blood-brain barrier injury) are mild or absent. Moreover, virus detection in CSF is rare and often of uncertain significance. In this review, we provide an overview of the neurological impact that occurs in the acute phase of COVID-19, and the role of CSF biomarkers in the clinical management and research to better treat and understand the disease. In addition to aiding as diagnostic and prognostic tools during acute infection, the use of comprehensive and well-characterized CSF and blood biomarkers will be vital in understanding the potential impact on the CNS in the rapidly increasing number of individuals recovering from COVID-19.","output":"Neurochemical biomarkers to study CNS effects of COVID-19: A narrative review and synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 causes higher viral loads in infected hosts, increasing the risk of close proximity airborne transmission through breathing, speaking and coughing.

However, its role in acute lung injury has not been elucidated. Acute lung injury is associated with disruption of the alveolo-capillary barrier leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, however, high positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and aggravate lung injury. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate the p53/p21 pathway to maintain homeostasis and avoid massive cell apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of specific p53- and p21-dependent gene signatures and a validated senescence profile. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed changes in the nuclear envelope and the underlying chromatin, DNA damage and activation of the Tp53/p21 pathway. Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury due to increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, treatment with lopinavir and/or ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury. The activation of these mechanisms was associated with early markers of senescence, including expression of senescence-related genes and increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells. Autopsy samples from lungs of patients with ARDS revealed increased senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Collectively, these results suggest that acute lung injury activates p53/p21 as an antiapoptotic mechanism to ameliorate damage, but with the side effect of induction of senescence.","output":"Activation of p21 limits acute lung injury and induces early senescence after acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents an isolation room model with a patient carrying acute air born disease with an effective ventilation system being functioned. Different models have been simulated with different vent position and the results have been observed. With the unruly rise in the spread of the COVID-19, it is paramount to restrain the virus propagation within the hospital premises. The purpose of the research is to control the virus dissemination caused by sneezing, by altering the position of the ventilation i.e. air inlet and outlet, by using flow across the room to direct it towards the outlet with maintaining a negative pressure. The negative strain helps in confining the air-borne transmission of the deadly virus from spreading across the room and not letting them permeate outside the isolated region. An isolation room model has been studied using computational fluid dynamics, by setting up a discrete phase model by using injection spray modelling to observe the permeation of the virus droplets. The behaviour of these aerosol droplets are studied using simple-semi implicit method for the equation associated with pressure by specifying the droplet size. By altering inlet and outlet locations we are able to minimise the spread of these harmful droplets by using the flow from the air inlet to go against the diffusing droplets.

Access to diagnostic point-of-care tests (POCTs) for RTIs might reduce this over-prescription. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic performance and clinical feasibility of a recently developed diagnostic POCT for respiratory viruses, the mariPOC(?), in a Dutch primary healthcare setting. METHODS: In patients with RTI symptoms presenting to a family practice during the 2015C2016 winter season, we determined the tests sensitivity and specificity relative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing performed in a laboratory. The clinical feasibility of the POCT was evaluated by interviewing general practitioners (GPs). RESULTS: One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 54.9% of the patients (n = 204). For influenza A virus (n = 24), sensitivity of the POCT was 54.2% and specificity was 98.9%; for influenza B virus (n = 18), sensitivity was 72.2% and specificity 99.5%; and for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 12), sensitivity was 50.0% and specificity 100%. In samples with higher viral load, sensitivity was 85.7% for influenza A, 78.6% for influenza B and 85.7% for RSV. The availability of a diagnostic test for respiratory viruses was appreciated by both patients and GPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that diagnostic POCTs for respiratory viruses might contribute to a precise and evidence-based diagnosis of RTIs and could positively influence prescription of antibiotics by GPs.

Where restarting research activities is permitted, investigators need to evaluate the risks and benefits of resuming data collection and adapt procedures to minimize risk. OBJECTIVES: In the context of the multicountry Household Air Pollution Intervention (HAPIN) trial conducted in rural, low-resource settings, we developed a framework to assess the risk of each trial activity and to guide protective measures. Our goal is to maximize the integrity of reseach aims while minimizing infection risk based on the latest scientific understanding of the virus. METHODS: We drew on a combination of expert consultations, risk assessment frameworks, institutional guidance and literature to develop our framework. We then systematically graded clinical, behavioral, laboratory and field environmental health research activities in four countries for both adult and child subjects using this framework. National and local government recommendations provided the minimum safety guidelines for our work. RESULTS: Our framework assesses risk based on staff proximity to the participant, exposure time between staff and participants, and potential viral aerosolization while performing the activity. For each activity, one of four risk levels, from minimal to unacceptable, is assigned and guidance on protective measures is provided. Those activities that can potentially aerosolize the virus are deemed the highest risk. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a systematic, procedure-specific approach to risk assessment for each trial activity, we were able to protect our participants and research team and to uphold our ability to deliver on the research commitments we have made to our staff, participants, local communities, and funders. This framework can be tailored to other research studies conducted in similar settings during the current pandemic, as well as potential future outbreaks with similar transmission dynamics.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in July 2020, in Egypt. An-online-based questionnaire was used to collect data. It included items to record demographic data, and an assessment of knowledge, the perception of healthcare facilities preparedness, and HCW confidence about applying infection prevention measures.

The objectives of this work were to assess the incidence of initially normal chest CT in a cohort of consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms and to compare their clinical characteristics and their outcome to matched patients with typical COVID-19 lesions at initial CT. METHODS: From March 6(th) to April 22(nd), all consecutive adult patients referred to the COVID-19 clinic of our Emergency Department were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a normal initial chest CT after second reading was 1:1 matched based on sex, age and date of CT acquisition to a patient with positive RT-PCR and initial chest CT with typical COVID-19 lesions. Clinical data, laboratory results and outcomes (major being mechanical ventilation and/or death) were compared between both groups, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemars chi-squared test and/or exact McNemars test where appropriate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven chest CT out of 1091 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.0C6.7) in symptomatic patients with positive RT-PCR were normal, with a median onset of symptoms of 4.5 days (IQR [1.25C10.25]).

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors.

The gastric transection was performed by an initial 60 mm firing of 4.5 mm staples at the antrum and successive 60 mm firings of 3.5 mm staples at the gastric body and fundus toward the left diaphragmatic crus. A 36 Fr bougie was used to calibrate the gastric tube. The staple line was systematically reinforced with a partial-thickness running suture. RESULTS The overall complications and SLL rate were 20/378 (5.29%) and 9/378 (2.38%), respectively. SLLs were managed by laparoscopic (n=2) or open (n=1) exploration, drainage and endoscopic self-expandable covered stent, computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage (n=2), or a self-expandable covered stent alone (n=4). Medical support including total parenteral nutrition and adapted antibiotics was started in all patients. The combined treatment modalities were successful in all cases. CONCLUSIONS SLL was the most common complication of LSG accounting for half of the overall complications.

However, beyond AHR3, there was a higher viscosity of the reactive system, which caused a reduction in the mobility of the polymer chains, thus disfavoring the swelling capacity. The reinforced hydrogel proposed in this study (AHR3) could represent a contribution to overcoming the problems of land dryness present in Colombia, an issue that will worsen in the coming years due to the climate emergency.","output":"Hydrogels Are Reinforced with Colombian Fique Nanofibers to Improve Techno-Functional Properties for Agricultural Purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Gut microbiome research has rapidly advanced with good perspectives for the diagnostics and/or therapy of a plethora of diseases, including metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases and various types of cancer. In this study, we examined the composition of the fecal microbiota of eligible children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We found a negative effect of HSCT treatment on microbiome bacterial diversity and richness with microbial monodominance by pathogenic bacteria in pediatric ALL patients after 3 months. The changes in the gut microbiota were associated with systemic inflammation on day + 28. However, promisingly, we have observed an association between bacterial diversity and physical exercise during HSCT treatment. Our findings provide additional support for the importance of investigating the gut microbiome in children with cancer. ABSTRACT: Gut microbiome impairment is a serious side effect of cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) treatment on gut microbiota composition in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fecal microbiotas were categorized using specific primers targeting the V1CV3 region of 16S rDNA in eligible pediatric ALL patients after HSCT (n = 16) and in healthy controls (Ctrl, n = 13). An intra-hospital exercise program was also organized for child patients during HSCT treatment. Significant differences in gut microbiota composition were observed between ALL HSCT and Ctrl with further negative effects. Plasma C-reactive protein correlated positively with the pathogenic bacteria Enterococcus spp. and negatively with beneficial bacteria Butyriccocus spp. or Akkermansia spp., respectively (rs = 0.511, p = 0.05; rs = ?0.541, p = 0.04; rs = ?0.738, p = 0.02). Bacterial alpha diversity correlated with the exercise training characteristics. Therefore, specific changes in the microbiota of children were associated with systemic inflammation or the ability to exercise physically during HSCT treatment.","output":"Gut Microbiome Suffers from Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Childhood and Its Characteristics Are Positively Associated with Intra-Hospital Physical Exercise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virtual classroom teaching-learning, online meetings, and discussions are becoming most popular throughout the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic event There is a need to enhance the engagement and thinking ability of the students during a virtual classroom using suitable tools This study explores the perspective of engineering students and staff members towards virtual classroom teaching-learning in India and Ghana-West Africa This study also proposes teaching-learning approaches to motivate students for effective engagement and thinking As an outcome, problem-solving skills and necessary graduate attributes of the students will be developed and accomplished The participants involved in the survey include 194 students and staff members from engineering colleges and universities in India and Ghana- West Africa The questionnaire-based research method is used to collect the perspective of students and staff The disciplines in engineering such as Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Computer Engineering are considered for analysis The survey gives the challenges and benefits of virtual learning faced by the students and staff members It also gives the expectation of the students and staff doing a virtual meeting The research findings show that peer interaction teaching-learning methodologies such as brainstorming, role plays, group discussion, case studies, animated videos, games, and activities are best suitable in a virtual classroom to overcome the challenges addressed by the students and staff members Based on the analysis of the survey, ICTbased tools, and applications for incorporating interactive teaching-learning methodologies have been listed with strategies and approaches to motivate and engage the students effectively in a virtual classroom environment ? 2021, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology All rights reserved","output":"Peer interaction teaching-learning approaches for effective engagement of students in virtual classroom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring COVID-19 vaccination coverage among nursing home residents and staff is important to ensure high coverage rates and guide patient-safety policies.

Given the current lack of medical treatments and the projected increase in dementia prevalence, a focus on prevention through risk reduction is needed. OBJECTIVE: We aim to increase dementia risk knowledge and promote changes in dementia risk behaviors at individual and population levels. METHODS: The Island Study Linking Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease (ISLAND) is a long-term prospective, web-based cohort study with nested interventions that will be conducted over a 10-year period. Target participants (n=10,000) reside in Tasmania and are aged 50 years or over. Survey data on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to modifiable dementia risk factors will be collected annually. After each survey wave, participants will be provided with a personalized dementia risk profile containing guidelines for reducing risk across 9 behavioral and lifestyle domains and with opportunities to engage in educational and behavioral interventions targeting risk reduction. Survey data will be modeled longitudinally with intervention engagement indices, cognitive function indices, and blood-based biomarkers, to measure change in risk over time. RESULTS: In the initial 12 months (October 2019 to October 2020), 6410 participants have provided baseline data. The study is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment targets are feasible and efforts are ongoing to achieve a representative sample.

Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading around the globe1,2. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and show that inhibition of these pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication. We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

People with CPPS have much higher rates of psychological disorders (anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing) that increase the severity of chronic pain and worsen quality of life. Myofascial therapy, manual therapy, and treatment of trigger points are proven therapeutic options for this syndrome. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of capacitive resistive monopolar radiofrequency (CRMRF) at 448kHz as an adjunct treatment to other physiotherapeutic techniques for reducing pain and improving the quality of life of patients with CPPS. METHODS: This triple-blind (1:1) randomized controlled trial will include 80 women and men with CPPS. Participants will be randomized into a CRMRF activated group or a CRMRF deactivated group and receive physiotherapeutic techniques and pain education. The groups will undergo treatment for 10 consecutive weeks. At the beginning of the trial there will be an evaluation of pain intensity (using VAS), quality of life (using the SF-12), kinesiophobia (using the TSK-11), and catastrophism (using the PCS), as well as at the sixth and tenth sessions. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will show that CRMRF benefits the treatment of patients with CPPS, together with physiotherapeutic techniques and pain education.

Split ventilation allows a single ventilator to be used for more than one patient but is not practicable due to requirements for matched patient settings, risks of cross-contamination, harmful interference between patients and the inability to individualize ventilator support parameters. We hypothesized that a system could be developed to circumvent these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A novel delivery system was developed to allow individualized peak inspiratory pressure settings and PEEP using a pressure regulatory valve, developed de novo, and an inline PEEP booster. One-way valves, filters, monitoring ports and wye splitters were assembled in-line to complete the system and achieve the design targets. This system was then tested to see if previously described limitations could be addressed. The system was investigated in mechanical and animal trials (ultimately with a pig and sheep concurrently ventilated from the same ventilator). The system demonstrated the ability to provide ventilation across clinically relevant scenarios including circuit occlusion, unmatched physiology, and a surgical procedure, while allowing significantly different pressures to be safely delivered to each animal for individualized support. CONCLUSIONS: In settings of limited ventilator availability, systems can be developed to allow increased delivery of ventilator support to patients. This enables more rapid deployment of ventilator capacity under constraints of time, space and financial cost. These systems can be smaller, lighter, more readily stored and more rapidly deployable than ventilators. However, optimizing ventilator support for patients with individualized ventilation parameters will still be dependent upon ease of use and the availability of medical personnel.","output":"Delivery system can vary ventilatory parameters across multiple patients from a single source of mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In patients with no-option critical limb-threatening ischemia, venous foot arterialization can be considered the last chance before major amputation.

After passing through these snares with a needle and a guidewire and closing the snares, the guidewire is pulled through the proximal arterial sheath and the distal venous sheath. Thus, the arterial-venous connection is created. A covered stent is, then, placed between the artery and the vein to avoid leakage.

However, it is difficult to guarantee accuracy and avoid obstacles in puncture process. Therefore, developing a viable path planning method is particularly important. In this research, the bending deformation law of flexible needles during puncture was studied and the puncture path was planned to provide a feasible method for clinical application of flexible needles. METHODS: According to the researchs that have been conducted, the path of the flexible needle in the tissue could be considered as a circular arc stitching. This research studied the calculation method of arc radius and obtained its actual value by the puncture experiments. Based on the arc model, the spatial transformation method of three-dimensional path planning was studied. In addition, a simplified particle swarm optimization (PSO) was applied into the process of path planning by changing the central angle of arc and the rotation angle of the needle body. RESULTS: The results of Experiment 1 showed that the path radius of the flexible needle pierced into gelatin prosthesis was influenced by four parameters, which were needle diameter, tip angle, puncture speed and the weight ratio of gelatin powder. As the needle diameter and tip angle increased, the radius of needle path tended to increase, but when the puncture speed and gelatin mass ratio increased, the radius of needle path decreased. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the distances of needle tip apart from target point were 3.2 mm (barrier-free experiments) and 1.8 mm (obstacle experiments). CONCLUSIONS: This research links the intelligent algorithm with the flexible needle puncture tissue process, which has high value in future clinical application.

Upon randomization (N = 91), participants were asked to either wear or not wear a mask while completing an online survey that assessed their willingness to be spontaneous in various imagined social situations (e.g., willingness to express ideas in public). As expected, participants who completed the survey while wearing a face mask reported higher levels of anticipated spontaneity, declaring they would have been more willing to express their ideas in the proposed interactions than those who did not wear a mask. Results support the hypothesis that anti-COVID face masks reduce objective self-awareness by drawing others focus away from the persons face.

There is a growing literature on predictors of adherence behaviours to social distancing measures, however, there are no comprehensive insights into the nature and types of non-adherence behaviours. To address this gap in the literature, we studied non-adherence in terms of counts of infringements and people's accounts on their behaviours in a representative sample of North London residents. We focused on the following social distancing rules: keeping 2 mts. distancing, meeting family and friends, and going out for non-essential reasons. A mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used comprising an online survey (1st - 31st May 2020) followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews held with a purposive sample of survey respondents (5th August - 21st September 2020). A negative binomial regression model (quantitative) and Framework Analysis (qualitative) were undertaken. 681 individuals completed the survey, and 30 individuals were interviewed. We integrated survey and interview findings following three levels of the Social Ecological model: individual, interpersonal and community levels. We identified non-adherence behaviours as unintentional (barriers beyond individual's control) and intentional (deliberate decision). Unintentional adherence was associated with and reported as emotional inability to stay at home, lack of controllability in keeping 2 mts. distancing, social responsibility towards the community and feeling low risk. Intentional non-adherence included individual risk assessment and decision-making on the extent to following the rules, support from friends, and perceived lack of adherence in the local area.

The recently developed RISE UP score has very good discriminatory value with respect to short-term mortality in older patients in the emergency department (ED). It consists of six items: age, abnormal vital signs, albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin. We hypothesized that the RISE UP score could have discriminatory value with regard to 30-day mortality in ED patients with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective analysis. Setting: Two EDs of the Zuyderland Medical Centre (MC), secondary care hospital in the Netherlands. Participants: The study sample consisted of 642 adult ED patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 3rd until May 25th 2020. Inclusion criteria were: 1) admission to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and 2) positive result of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or (very) high suspicion of COVID-19 according to the chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Outcome: Primary outcome was 30-day mortality, secondary outcome was a composite of 30-day mortality and admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Within 30 days after presentation, 167 patients (26.0%) died and 102 patients (15.9%) were admitted to ICU. The RISE UP score showed good discriminatory value with respect to 30-day mortality (AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.73-0.81), and to the composite outcome (AUC 0.72, 95% CI 0.68-0.76).

Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting. We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen, new need for mechanical ventilation (high-flow oxygen or non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, new need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen, new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, quality of life, adverse events (any grade), and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We included five RCTs with 7452 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mean age of 59 years, of whom 3886 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low-flow oxygen (n=4409) or mechanical ventilation (n=1025) at baseline. We identified two ongoing studies, one was suspended due to a lack of COVID-19 patients to recruit. Risk of bias was considered to be of some concerns or high risk for clinical status and safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information to these outcomes. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 7 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Considering the initial severity of condition, only one study showed a beneficial effect of remdesivir in patients who received low-flow oxygen at baseline (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.66, 435 participants), but conflicting results exists from another study, and we were unable to validly assess this observations due to limited availability of comparable data. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 participants, data not pooled, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases the chance of clinical improvement in terms of duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen at up to day 28 (3 studies, 1691 participants, data not pooled, very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir decreases or increases the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for mechanical ventilation at up to day 28 (high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 32 more; 3 studies, 6696 participants; very low-certainty evidence); new need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98; RD 72 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 118 fewer to 5 fewer; 1 study, 573 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22; RD 84 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 204 fewer to 98 more; 1 study, 138 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that remdesivir may decrease the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for invasive mechanical ventilation (67 fewer participants amongst 1000 participants; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77; 2 studies, 1159 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported quality of life. Remdesivir probably decreases the serious adverse events rate at up to 28 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90; RD 63 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 94 fewer to 25 fewer; 3 studies, 1674 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases adverse events rate (any grade) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 82 fewer to 158 more; 3 studies, 1674 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the currently available evidence, we are moderately certain that remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 in hospitalised adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening. There were insufficient data available to validly examine the effect of remdesivir on mortality in subgroups depending on the extent of respiratory support at baseline. Future studies should provide additional data on efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID-19 research, especially for different population subgroups. This could allow us to draw more reliable conclusions on the potential benefits and harms of remdesivir in future updates of this review. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.","output":"Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in southern China in late 2002. It first spread within Guangdong Province and then to other parts of China. Via air travelers, it quickly reached various countries around the globe, causing several major hospital outbreaks. Within weeks, the causative agent, a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified, thanks to an unprecedented international effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its origin was quickly traced to wild animals traded locally for culinary purposes. Masked palm civet and some other species seem to have acted as intermediate hosts. Since then, SARS-like coronaviruses were found in different bat species in China and elsewhere, and bats are now regarded as the wildlife reservoir for SARS-CoV. Fortunately, the SARS outbreak could be contained within months. Until July 2003, it had caused 8096 cases, with 774 deaths. Once adequate measures such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts were strictly adhered to, further transmission between human beings could be interrupted. SARS is an example of how rapidly an infectious agent can spread in the modern world. At the same time, it should serve as a showcase of how international cooperation and modern science can help to combat the spread of infectious diseases.","output":"SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of WeChat follow-up management of infants who underwent ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair on parents' disease knowledge and quality of life.

This differs from the case-fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic. While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy-makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: Pubmed, Medline, SSRN, and Medrxiv were searched using a set of terms and Boolean operators on 25/04/2020 and re-searched 14/05/2020, 21/05/2020, and 16/06/2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by both authors. Meta-analysis was performed in Stata 15.1 using the metan command, based on IFR and confidence intervals extracted from each study. Google/Google Scholar was used to assess the grey literature relating to government reports. RESULTS: After exclusions, there were 24 estimates of IFR included in the final meta-analysis, from a wide range of countries, published between February and June 2020. The meta-analysis demonstrated a point-estimate of IFR of 0.68% (0.53-0.82%) with high heterogeneity (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence on COVID-19 until July, 2020, the IFR of the disease across populations is 0.68% (0.53-0.82%). However, due to very high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to know if this represents a wholly unbiased point estimate. It is likely that, due to age and perhaps underlying comorbidities in the population, different places will experience different IFRs due to the disease. Given issues with mortality recording, it is also likely that this represents an underestimate of the true IFR figure. More research looking at age-stratified IFR is urgently needed to inform policy-making on this front.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of published research data on COVID-19 infection-fatality rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an exceptional public healthcare emergency that affected all countries.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of 425 patients who underwent lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer without preoperative radiation therapy between November 2012 and October 2017. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) in the IIP area except the lung cancer site was measured in each patient. RESULTS Thirty-one of the 425 patients (7.3%) showed findings of IIP in chest CT. Five of the 31 patients (16.1%) developed acute exacerbation (AE) after lung resection (AE+ group). Twenty-six of the 31 patients (83.9%) did not develop AE (AE- group). In the AE+ group, 18F-FDG SUVmax in the IIP area was significantly higher (1.9  0.6 vs. 2.7  0.7, p = 0.02) compared with that in the AE- group. The receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an SUVmax threshold score of 2.55 (p = 0.02) for AE. There was no 90-day mortality in the patients with SUVmax < 2.55 (n = 25). On the other hand, the 90-day mortality rate in patients with SUVmax  2.55 (n = 6) was 33.3% (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS 18F-FDG PET/CT may predict AE after lung resection and could be related to short-term survival in lung cancer patients with IIP.

Based on the author's clinical experience, several gesture commands were designed carefully to complete a single X-ray examination. Four radiographers were randomly recruited for the study. They were asked to perform gesture commands in front of a computer integrated with a gesture-based touchless controller. The translational movements of the tip of their thumb and index finger while performing different gesture commands were recorded for analysis. Although individual operators were free to decide the extent of movement and the speed at which their fingers and thumbs moved while performing these gesture commands, the result of our study demonstrated that all operators could perform our proposed gesture commands with good consistency, suggesting that motion-sensing technology could, in practice, be integrated into radiographic examinations. To summarize, although the implementation of motion-sensing technology as an input command in radiographic examination might inevitably slow down the examination throughput considering that extra procedural steps are required to trigger specific gesture commands in sequence, it is advantageous in minimizing the potential of the pathogen contamination during image operation and image processing that leads to cross infection.","output":"A user report on the trial use of gesture commands for image manipulation and X-ray acquisition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The loss of the senses of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) are rather common disorders, affecting up to 20% of the adult population. Yet, this condition has not received the attention it deserves, most probably because per se such a disorder is not life threatening. However, loss of olfactory function significantly reduces the quality of life of the affected patients, leading to dislike in food and insufficient, exaggerated or unbalanced food intake, unintentional exposure to toxins such as household gas, social isolation, depression, and an overall insecurity. Not only is olfactory dysfunction rather prevalent in the healthy population, it is, in many instances, also a correlate or an early indicator of a panoply of diseases. Importantly, olfactory dysfunction is linked to the two most prominent neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Anosmia and hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) affect a majority of patients years before the onset of cognitive or motor symptoms, establishing olfactory dysfunction as early biomarker that can enable earlier diagnosis and preventative treatments. In the current health crisis caused by SARS-CoV2, anosmia and dysgeusia as early-onset symptoms in virus-positive patients may prove to be highly relevant and crucial for pre-symptomatic Covid-19 detection from a public health perspective, preceding by days the more classical respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, tightness of the chest or fever. Thus, the olfactory system seems to be at the frontline of pathologic assault, be it through pathogens or insults that can lead to or at least associate with neurodegeneration.

On Saturdays, illnesses are simulated by simulated patients. After each encounter, faculty experts, psychologists and peer group members provide the participants with 360 feedback. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course which had been established 2 years beforehand has now been switched to an online class within one week. Friday units were visualized in power-point presentations and tutorial videos were discussed. On Saturdays, the cases were simulated by simulated patients and transmitted via a telemedicine platform.

DESIGN: Prospective national population based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). SETTING: All 194 obstetric units in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March 2020 and 14 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of maternal hospital admission and infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, fetal loss, caesarean birth, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, and neonatal unit admission. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of admission to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was 4.9 (95% confidence interval 4.5 to 5.4) per 1000 maternities. 233 (56%) pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were from black or other ethnic minority groups, 281 (69%) were overweight or obese, 175 (41%) were aged 35 or over, and 145 (34%) had pre-existing comorbidities. 266 (62%) women gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 196 (73%) gave birth at term. Forty one (10%) women admitted to hospital needed respiratory support, and five (1%) women died. Twelve (5%) of 265 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of them within the first 12 hours after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Most pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a close reading of the news media and official reports from government departments, Parliament select committees and the National Audit Office, among others, this paper frames the UK government's uses of accounting and accountability in its response to COVID-19. This is by using the categories of apparatuses of security, Foucault's schematic of government for economising on the uses of state power. Findings: The paper shows that an important role for accounting is in the process of enabling the government to gauge the extent of the crisis and produce calculations to underpin its response, what Foucault called normalisation. This role was unlike statistics and economics. The government relied most on monthly statistical reporting and budgeting flexibilities. By contrast, the multi-year Spending Review and financial reporting were not timely enough. That said, financial reporting fed into financial sustainability projections and enabled audit that could provide potential accountability regarding regularity, probity, value for money and fairness. The authors findings suggest that, conceptually, accountability should be added to the objectCsubject element of Foucault's apparatuses of security because of its significance for governments' ability to pursue crisis objectives that require popular assent. Practical implications: In view of the ongoing uncertainty, with the crisis extending over longer budget and financial reporting periods, a Spending Review is becoming ever more necessary for better planning, without limiting, however, the budget flexibilities that have proven so useful for rapid government responses. Moreover, the government should continue its accounting reforms post COVID-19 so that improved accountability and audit can contribute to enhanced future financial resilience. Originality/value: This is the first paper to apply Foucault's notion of apparatuses of security to an analysis of government accounting and accountability practices. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Accounting and accountability practices in times of crisis: a Foucauldian perspective on the UK government's response to COVID-19 for England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to potential adverse effects on the mental health status of a wide range of people. This study aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among general population in Hong Kong. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale;level of fear was evaluated using the Fear of COVID-19 scale;and coping strategies were assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify key factors associated with these mental health variables. Of the 555 participants, 53.9% experienced moderate to very high levels of psychological distress, 31.2% experienced a high level of fear of COVID-19, and 58.6% showed moderate to high resilient coping. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that living with family members, current alcohol consumption, and higher level of fear were associated with higher levels of psychological distress;perceived stress due to a change in employment condition, being a frontline worker, experiencing moderate to very high distress, and healthcare service use to overcome the COVID-19 related stress in past 6 months were associated with a higher level of fear;and perceived better mental health status was associated with a moderate to high resilient coping.

This study describes the emergency department (ED)-based care for patients presenting with COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) to five hospitals in a large, academic health system during the initial surge in New York City, examining both respiratory modality choice and settings. For those managed with noninvasive respiratory support, we also aimed to explore the association between ED boarding time and patient morbidity and mortality. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of ED patients presenting from 3/1/2020 to 7/10/2020 with COVID-19-related AHRF and requiring ICU admission at any time during their hospitalization. Patient demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness (Mortality Probability Model III on admission), clinical course, including the use, settings (initial and changes), and duration of respiratory support modalities (ie, noninvasive ventilation [NIV], high flow nasal cannula [HFNC], invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), as well as hospital site, were collected through validated electronic query and standardized manual chart abstraction. AHRF severity was defined using a PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PF): 200-300 (mild), 100-199 (moderate), and <100 (severe). For patients without a PaO2, the PF was imputed using SpO2/FiO2 ratio using previously validated non-linear conversion. Boarding was defined as the time interval from ED request for admission to ED departure. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of ICU admission, intubation, or mortality within 48 hours of ED arrival. Descriptive analyses stratified by boarding duration and AHRF were completed. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine the association between ED boarding and the primary outcome. Results: A total of 679 ED patients with COVID-19 AHRF required ICU admission during the study period. They were managed with low flow oxygen only (261, 38.4%), or with NIV (120, 17.7%), HF (51, 7.5%), and/or IMV (99, 14.6%), with setting ranges detailed in Table 1. Of the patients with a known PF ratio (N=418), 110 (26.35%) had mild, 34 (5.0%) had moderate, and 274 (40.4%) had severe AHRF. Of these patients, 279 (41.1%) had a change documented to their settings, with increased likelihood of adjustments with longer boarding time (p<0.001) and higher AHRF severity (p<0.001). Median boarding duration across all site was 9.5 hours (IQR 5.3-16.9 hours) with site variation. AHRF severity and support modality were not associated with differences of boarding time (p = 0.77 and p=0.54). Controlling for age, sex, race, and severity of illness, boarding time was not associated with worse patient outcomes in 48 hours (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.08, p=0.17) Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, critically ill patients presented to the ED and boarded for long periods of time, requiring prolonged ventilatory management. Despite the surge state and resource limitations, boarding times did not worsen post-ED outcomes for patients managed with non-invasive modalities.

In spite of that, there are still massive challenges that have not been resolved. Although the incidence of tuberculosis has decreased in the developed world, it is still a significant public health problem in the rest of the world. There are still over 2 million deaths annually from tuberculosis, with most of these occurring in the developing world. Even with the development of new pharmaceuticals to treat tuberculosis, there is no indication that the disease will be eradicated. Respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pertussis are other respiratory infectious diseases with special problems of their own, from vaccine development to vaccine coverage.

Clinically, Coptidis rhizoma can be used for hepatic and biliary disorders, yet details in the therapies of liver diseases and underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that Coptidis rhizoma aqueous extract (CRAE) against CCl(4)-induced acute liver damage was related to antioxidant property. In the present study, the protection of CRAE on chronic liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) in rats and its related mechanism were explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS The CCl(4)-induced chronic liver damage model was established, and CRAE's protective effect was examined. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, serum and liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were then measured. The histological changes were observed under microscopy and then computed in numerical score. The normal or damaged cells were isolated and related signaling pathway was evaluated. RESULT Serum AST and ALT activities were significantly decreased in rats treated with different doses of CRAE, indicating its protective effect against CCl(4)-induced chronic liver damage. Observation on serum SOD activity revealed that CRAE might act as an anti-oxidant agent against CCl(4)-induced chronic oxide stress. Histological study supported these observations. Erk1/2 inhibition may take part into CRAE's effect on preventing hepatocyte from apoptosis when exposed to oxidative stress.

These selection rules determine the scaling of a system's observables (to all orders in the strength of the symmetry-breaking perturbation) as it transitions from symmetric to symmetry-broken. We specifically analyze periodically driven (Floquet) systems subject to two driving fields, where the first field imposes a spatio-temporal symmetry, and the second field breaks it, imposing a symmetry in synthetic dimensions. We tabulate the resulting synthetic symmetries for (2+1)D Floquet group symmetries and derive the corresponding selection rules for high harmonic generation (HHG) and above-threshold ionization (ATI). Finally, we observe experimentally HHG selection rules imposed by symmetries in synthetic dimensions.

The rate of depression in HIV is three times higher than the general population. Differences in biomarkers in neuroendocrine and inflammatory pathways are one possible explanation for the increased prevalence of depression in individuals with HIV, especially biological women. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review identifying differences in neuroendocrine factors leading to depression in men versus women with HIV. METHODS A comprehensive search of 8 databases was performed, followed by title and abstract screening and later full-text screening by two independent researchers. A risk of bias assessment was completed. RESULTS Twenty-six full-text articles were included in the review. Significant correlations between depression and neuroendocrine marker levels were found for cortisol (both sexes), testosterone (only in men), oxytocin (only tested in women), and estradiol (only in women). No significant correlation between depression and hormone level was found for prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS), or sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Nearly all studies included only men or women and did not directly compare neuroendocrine markers between the two sexes. One study found that the correlation between cortisol levels and depression scores was stronger in women than men. CONCLUSION Neuroendocrine systems are highly active in the brain and important in the development and persistence of mental illness. Given that HIV can, directly and indirectly, impact hormone signaling, it is likely contributing to the high rate of depression in individuals with HIV. However, few studies explore neuroactive hormones in depression and HIV, nor how this connection may differ between the sexes.

Capturing trends in livestock mortality at localised or national levels is essential to planning, monitoring and evaluating interventions and programs aimed at decreasing mortality rates. However, livestock mortality data is disparate, and indicators used have not been standardised. This review aims to assess livestock mortality indicator definitions reported in literature, and define the ages where mortality has greatest impact. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, limited to articles focussed on mortality of cattle, sheep and goats. Peer-reviewed articles in Web of Science until year 2020 were assessed for inclusion of age-based definitions for mortality indicators and data on age distribution of mortality. Indicator definitions for each species were collated and similar terms and age groups most targeted were compared. The cumulative distribution of age at mortality was compared across studies graphically where possible; otherwise, age patterns for mortality were collated. Results: Most studies reported mortality risk rather than rate, and there was little agreement between indicator definitions used in the literature. The most common indicators reported were perinatal and neonatal mortality in cattle, and for perinatal, neonatal and pre-weaning mortality indicators for sheep and goats. Direct comparison of age distribution of mortality was only possible for cattle, which found that approximately 80% of all mortalities within the first 12 months had occurred by six months of age. A significant finding of the study is the variation in age groups for which mortality is reported, which impedes the comparison of mortality risk across studies, particularly for sheep and goats.

As the COVID-19 crisis is an unusual and complex problem, combinations of diverse factors such as health risk perception, knowledge, norms and beliefs, attitudes and behaviors are closely associated with individuals' intention to enjoy the experience economy but also their concerns that the experience economy will trigger further spread of the infectious diseases.

Relations between pleasure-seeking via the experience economy and individuals' anxiety-level about an infectious hotspot seem to differ between East Asians and Europeans who are known to prioritize so-called interpersonal- and independent self-schemes, respectively. Our study also indicates the heterogeneity in the populations, i.e., these relations differ within the respective populations. Another finding shows that the Japanese population is particularly concerned about their local community potentially becoming an infectious hotspot and hence expecting others to comply with their particular social norms.

Further, the relationship between motor map expression and motor impairment is not well understood. We used long-duration ICMS in the rat to test the hypothesis that repeated seizure activity (cortical kindling) increases the extent of overlapping cortical representation where multiple forelimb movements are evoked to stimulation. Cortical kindling (n = 7) significantly expanded (100%) forelimb motor maps characterized by a proportional increase in both complex and simple movement representation areas, and significantly increased (285%) overlapping forelimb representation compared to sham-kindled controls (n = 5). In a second experiment, motor maps were derived with long-duration ICMS under acute cortical application of bicuculline (n = 6) to reduce intracortical inhibition or saline control (n = 10). Bicuculline also significantly expanded forelimb motor maps (108%) but without increasing representational overlap. Moreover, expanded map areas in bicuculline rats evoked qualitatively distinct forelimb movements to long-duration, but not short-duration (n = 5), ICMS that were truncated.

Worldwide, this pandemic had a huge impact on the mental health of people in many countries causing similar reaction in terms of emotions and concerns at the population level. Our study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of Italian university students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the period immediately after the first lockdown through the administration of a questionnaire on the personal websites of students attending their undergraduate courses at the Universit Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. We used the Patient-Health-Engagement-Scale, Self-Rating-Anxiety-Scale, and Self-Rating-Depression-Scale to assess engagement, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms of our sample. RESULTS: The sample size was 501 subjects, of which 35.33% were classified as anxious and 72.93% as depressed. Over 90% of respondents had good understanding of the preventive measures despite over 70% suffered from the impossibility of physically seeing friends and partners. Around 55% of students would have been willing to contribute much more to face the pandemic. An increase in the occurrences of anxiety was associated with being female, being student of the Rome campus, suffering from the impossibility of attending university, being distant from colleagues, and being unable of physically seeing ones partner. Performing physical activity reduced this likelihood. CONCLUSION: University students are at risk of psychological distress in the case of traumatic events. The evolution of the pandemic is uncertain and may have long-term effects on mental health.

This study aimed to establish a simple method for evaluating cell retention in lungs and to develop reproducible approaches for efficient cell delivery into mouse and pig lungs. Human lung epithelial cells including normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE) cells and human lung epithelial cell line A549 were infected with pSicoR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) lentivirus. GFP-labeled NHBE cells were delivered via a modified intratracheal cell instillation method into the lungs of C57BL/6J mice. Two days following cell delivery, GFP ELISA-based assay revealed a substantial cell-retention efficiency (10.48  2.86%, n = 7) in mouse lungs preinjured with 2% polidocanol. When GFP-labeled A549 cells were transplanted into Yorkshire pig lungs with a tracheal intubation fiberscope, a robust initial cell attachment (22.32% efficiency) was observed at 24 h. In addition, a lentiviral vector was developed to induce the overexpression and apical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-GFP fusion proteins in NHBE cells as a means of ex vivo CFTR gene transfer in nonprogenitor (relatively differentiated) lung epithelial cells.

A prototype and a scenario were used as mediating materials. The result consists of two parts. The first part is comprised of the participants reflections on how timelines can be used to display information in CM information systems. According to the participants, timelines should present: deadlines, information sent to the public, incoming and outgoing information, an overview of where the current activities belong in the CM process and what has been going on since the last shift during shift changes. Timelines should not only display the listed information, but also provide functionality for adjusting the timescale so that information can be presented in alternative temporal perspectives.

However, associations between different dimensions of social isolation and functional health are unclear. We assessed the varied effects of social isolation on health among a nationwide sample of older adults from China. METHODS: We assessed social isolation among 5,419 people aged 65 and older who took part in both the 2011 and 2014 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Social isolation includes objective social isolation (kinlessness and lack of social contacts) and subjective social isolation. Four functional health outcomes were examined: self-rated health (SRH), activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and cognitive function measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used multivariable regression analyses to examine the associations between social isolation and health outcomes. RESULTS: Older people who never married or who had recently lost a spouse were more likely to report poor SRH (OR=2.44) and difficulty with IADLs (ORs=1.46) than those who were married and lived with a spouse. Older people who never gave birth were less likely to report cognitive impairment (OR=0.53) than those who had living children, while older people who had recently lost a child were more likely to report poor SRH than those who had living children (OR=1.32). Older people who had no children visiting were more likely to report difficulty with IADLs than those who had children visiting (OR=1.25). In terms of subjective social isolation, older people who felt lonely were more likely to report poor SRH, cognitive impairment, and difficulty with ADLs and IADLs (ORs=1.19, 1.27, 1.28 and 1.21, respectively), and older people who had no one to talk to were more likely to report poor SRH, cognitive decline, and difficulty with ADLs and IADLs (ORs=2.08, 5.32, 2.06 and 1.98, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Kinlessness, lack of social contacts and subjective social isolation may impact various dimensions of health in older people. Due to the varied health consequences of social isolation, targeted health interventions should be developed to address relevant situations of social isolation.

BLCA, HNSC, KIRC, KIRP, LGG, PCPG, PRAD, TGCT, and THCA patients carrying rs10774671-A (OAS1) genotype may be more likely to have poor COVID-19 outcomes relative to those who carry rs10774671-G, because individuals carrying rs10774671-A will have lower expression of OAS1, which serves as a protective factor against SARS-CoV-2 processes and poor COVID-19 outcomes. SARS-CoV-2-required genes were correlated with TME, immune infiltration, overall survival, and anti-cancer drug sensitivity. CHOL patients may have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than healthy subjects.

The objective of this study was to explore the experiences and perceptions of health care workers (HCWs) in primary health care in the management of COVID-19 with respect to medical response experiences, socio-cultural and religious reforms, psychological impressions, and lessons learned. METHODS: This was a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Six focus group discussions were conducted across various stakeholders working frontline in the management of COVID-19 (managerial, public health/field/community and primary care health centers). They participated in semi-structured, in-depth group discussions from 11th to 20th May 2020. All discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Forty participants were involved in this study. Three themes emerged related to the medical response experiences, including the rapid re-structuring of the PHC services, use of technology and challenges of working on COVID-19. Perceptions on the socio-cultural and religious reforms included changes in social and religious norms, and anticipated gaps in accessing health care among the vulnerable groups (elderly, expatriates, and individuals with low economic status). Perceptions on psychological disturbances were themed as consequences of social distancing, management of dead bodies, exhaustion among the health care workers, and risk of exposure. Finally, lessons learned were centered around building on the existing epidemiological and public health capacities, improving access to health care and overcoming resistance to change. Most participants labelled their experience in COVID-19 as an experience of wisdom in which learning was a continuous process. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study amongst primary HCWs revealed certain aspects of response to COVID-19 in Muscat, Oman. Results has unfolded various aspects of COVID-19. The situation was perceived by primary HCWs as a new experience that challenged the primary health care; enforced the utilization of public health/epidemiological skills, and linked to unfavorable socio-religious and psychological events.","output":"The Experiences and Perceptions of Health-Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Muscat, Oman: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, a 74-year-old man affected by end-stage renal disease and on peritoneal dialysis was referred to an emergency room in Modena, Northern Italy, due to fever and respiratory symptoms.

Moreover, the individuals behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India.

We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity.

METHODS: In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, almost all mothers giving birth (N = 470) in the Zithulele Hospital catchment area of the OR Tambo District were recruited and repeatedly assessed for 2 years after birth with 84.7-96% follow-up rates. During the cohort assessment we found that some mothers had received standard antenatal and HIV care (SC) (n = 313 mothers), while others had received SC, supplemented with home-visiting by CHWs before and after birth (HV) (n = 157 mothers, 37 CHWs). These visits were unrelated to the cohort study. Multiple linear and logistic regressions evaluated maternal comorbidities, maternal caretaking, and child development outcomes over time. RESULTS: Compared to mothers receiving SC, mothers who also received home visits by CHWs were more likely to attend the recommended four antenatal care visits, to exclusively breastfeed at 3 months, and were less likely to consult traditional healers at 3 months.

Our primary goal is to understand some of the complex coupled dynamics between factors that ultimately regulate the epidemic case load. As potentially crucial factors, we focus on population mobility and vaccination patters (both related to risk of contracting the SARS-Cov2 virus). These factors may in turn depend on demographic parameters (which are unrelated to the epidemic evolution), but also on the population response to the epidemic outbreak itself. In our work, we use correlation analyses, in conjunction with open source data from US states, to investigate the type and strength (1) of the relationships between demographic measures and epidemic, mobility and vaccination timelines during our established time window; (2) of the bidirectional coupling between these timelines. We showed that the wide between-state differences in epidemic outcome correspond to between-state differences in demographic measures (such as density, income, political affiliation). As a potential underlying mechanism, we found that demographic measures are also predictive of the degree of coupling between epidemic timelines (on one hand) and vaccination and mobility timelines (on the other hand), coupling which can be broadly interpreted as the populations behavioral response to the epidemic. In support of this idea, our analysis shows this response to be tightly correlated with epidemic outcome. This suggests that a states demographic profile may be invaluable to generating predictions on the epidemic evolution in the respective state, and that this information may be used to understand the weaknesses of a state and how to compensate for them to improve epidemic outcome (e.g., via state centralized incentives, and customized mitigation strategies).","output":"State-dependent patterns and coupling between the vaccination schedule, population mobility and the COVID epidemic outline, in the US states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secure messaging (SM), asynchronous communication between patients and clinicians, is an increasingly popular tool among patients to contact clinicians about their care.

Twenty clinicians in medical oncology and radiation oncology participated in audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed the problems with using SM, such as difficulty interpreting low-quality messages, the amount of time needed to devote to responding, and its potential to negatively affect the patient-clinician relationship. Techniques employed to manage such problems consisted of using different forms of communication and utilizing messaging to expedite workloads. The philosophical rationale of clinicians toward SM was that it can improve patient care and this form of communication is already embedded within existing patient care.

About 70% (6230) of the cases were men; the mean age was 30.0 years (SD=13.3), and 90.5% were <50 years of age. Only 64 (0.7%) of the cases had symptoms at diagnosis. Cough was the most common among symptomatic cases reported in 48 (75.0%), while fever was the least. Overall, 4346 (48.5%) have recovered from the virus; and a total of 52 deaths were reported with a case fatality rate of 1.2%. However, we should interpret the reported case fatality rate cautiously since in 44 (84.6%) of those reported as COVID-19 death, the virus was detected from dead bodies. CONCLUSION: Despite the steady increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases, Ethiopia has so far avoided the feared catastrophe from the pandemic due to the milder and asymptomatic nature of the disease. However, with the current pattern of widespread community transmission, the danger posed by the pandemic remains real. Thus, the country should focus on averting COVID-19-related humanitarian crisis through strengthening COVID-19 surveillance and targeted testing for the most vulnerable groups.","output":"COVID-19 in Oromia Region of Ethiopia: a review of the first 6 months' surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate nurses perceptions of oral healthcare provision to inpatients in Japanese hospitals and the infection control measures taken by them after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown, to promote collaborative oral healthcare in hospitals. METHOD: The participants were 1,037 nurses working in inpatient wards at four hospitals in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey, approximately six months after the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: More than 90% of the 734 nurses participating in this study positively perceived the preventive effect of oral healthcare on aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and viral infection. However, approximately half of them had negative perceptions about their knowledge and confidence regarding the control of COVID-19 with oral healthcare provision, and 84.7% expected to be provided with the necessary information by oral health professionals. Further, 537 nurses (73.2%) provided oral healthcare to their patients; nine nurses (1.7%) responded that those patients who received oral healthcare decreased after the lockdown; and 12 (2.4%) responded that they could no longer collaborate with oral health professionals because of the lockdown. Additionally, 41.7 % of them used neither protective glasses nor face shields even after the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that almost all the nurses positively perceived the effect of oral healthcare on the prevention of viral infection and pneumonia. However, some nurses perceived that their oral healthcare provision and collaborative oral healthcare were negatively affected. It also showed that most nurses knowledge, confidence, and use of infection control measures were insufficient. This study proposes that oral health professionals should support nurses in providing oral healthcare by providing them with information on COVID-19 infection control measures to prevent infection transmission through oral healthcare.","output":"Nurses Perceptions of Oral Healthcare Provision After COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sonography has become the imaging technique of choice for guiding intraoperative interventions in abdominal surgery. Due to artefacts from residual air content, however, videothoracoscopic and open intraoperative ultrasound-guided thermoablation of lung malignancies are impossible. Lung flooding is a new method that allows complete ultrasound imaging of lungs and their tumours. METHODS Fourteen resected tumourous human lung lobes were examined transpleurally with B-mode ultrasound before (in atelectasis) and after lung flooding with isotonic saline solution. In two swine, the left lung was filled with 15 ml/kg isotonic saline solution through the left side of a double-lumen tube. Lung tumours were simulated by transthoracic ultrasound-guided injection of 5 ml of purified bovine serum albumin in glutaraldehyde, centrally into the left lower lung lobe. The rate of tumour detection, the severity of disability caused by residual gas, and sonomorphology of the lungs and tumours were assessed. RESULTS The ex vivo tumour detection rate was 100% in flooded human lung lobes and 43% (6/14) in atelectatic lungs. In all cases of atelectasis, sonographic tumour imaging was impaired by residual gas. Tumours and atelectatic tissue were isoechoic. In 28% of flooded lungs, a little residual gas was observed that did not impair sonographic tumour imaging. In contrast to tumours, flooded lung tissue was hyperechoic, homogeneous, and of fine-grained structure. Because of the bronchial wall three-laminar structure, sonographic differentiation of vessels and bronchi was possible. In all cases, malignant tumours in the flooded lung appeared well-demarcated from the lung parenchyma. Adenocarcinoma, squamous, and large cell carcinomas were hypoechoic. Bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma was slightly hyperechoic. Transpleural sonography identifies endobronchial tumour growth and bronchial wall destruction. With transthoracic sonography, the flooded animal lung can be completely examined in vivo. There is no residual gas, which interferes with ultrasound. Pulmonary vessels and bronchi are clearly differentiated. Simulated lung lesions can easily be detected inside the lung lobe. CONCLUSIONS Lung flooding enables complete lung sonography and tumour detection. We have developed a novel method that efficiently uses ultrasound for guiding intraoperative interventions in open and endoscopic lung surgery.","output":"Lung flooding enables efficient lung sonography and tumour imaging in human ex vivo and porcine in vivo lung cancer model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has garnered the attention of scientists worldwide in the search for an effective treatment while also focusing on vaccine development.

METHODS: Respiratory aerosol emissions are measured in 40 (24 males and 16 females) healthy, non-trained singers phonating the phoneme /a/ at seven specific frequencies at varying vocal intensity levels. RESULTS: Increasing frequency of phonation was positively correlated with particle production (r = 0.28, p < 0.001). Particle production rate was also positively correlated (r = 0.37, p < 0.001) with the vocal intensity of phonation, confirming previously reported findings. The primary mode (particle diameter ~0.6 m) and width of the particle number size distribution were independent of frequency and vocal intensity. Regression models of the particle production rate using frequency, vocal intensity, and the individual subject as predictor variables only produced goodness of fit of adjusted R(2) = 40% (p < 0.001). Finally, it is proposed that superemitters be defined as statistical outliers, which resulted in the identification of one superemitter in the sample of 40 participants. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest there remain unexplored effects (e.g., biomechanical, environmental, behavioral, etc.) that contribute to the high variability in respiratory particle production rates, which ranged from 0.2 particles/s to 142 particles/s across all trials. This is evidenced as well by changes in the distribution of participant particle production that transitions to a more bimodal distribution (second mode at particle diameter ~2 m) at higher frequencies and vocal intensity levels.","output":"Characterizing respiratory aerosol emissions during sustained phonation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current approach to treating endometriosis is often inadequate or intolerable for many patients. Until more effective therapies are available, we should aim to maximize the effectiveness of our current options. Optimization may be possible by reducing nocebo effects, which are the negative therapeutic effects not directly caused by a treatment. Awareness of these effects, how they arise, and the factors influencing them, is invaluable if we aim to limit their magnitude. The unique nature of endometriosis diagnosis and management is especially prone to nocebo effects due to multiple factors, including diagnostic delays, feelings of invalidation, social transmission of expectations, and persistent symptoms despite numerous treatments. This commentary discusses the origins of these effects in people with endometriosis, methods of limiting nocebo effects, and future research directions. LAY SUMMARY: The term nocebo describes the undesirable effects of a medication or treatment that patients may experience which are not directly caused by the treatment (e.g. tiredness from a sugar pill). These arise from pre-existing expectations toward a treatment and are influenced by multiple external factors, including past experiences, online media, personal beliefs, and personality factors. Endometriosis is a disease characterized by cells like those from the inside of the uterus growing outside of the uterus. The complex nature of endometriosis diagnosis and management creates an environment where nocebo effects may affect treatment outcomes. We may be able to limit nocebo effects through awareness and simple actions that strengthen patientCdoctor relationships. Effective therapeutic relationships with doctors are crucial in limiting negative expectations and are established through empathy, honesty, and support. Therapeutic relationships built on trust may allow healthcare providers to address negative expectations, nocebo effects, and the misinformation affecting endometriosis management.","output":"Nocebo effects in the treatment of endometriosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explore the spaceCtime and mortality dynamics of recent infectious diseases outbreaks which have occurred in a large number of developed and developing countries We fully acknowledge the heterogeneity of infectious diseases We find that many outbreaks exhibit spatial dependence, due to the international movement of people and goods All countries are exposed to these negative cross-border health externalities, which can be triggered by climate shocks The mortality consequences are much more severe in developing countries Paying attention to spatial dependence has important implications for economic research and international policymaking","output":"Spatial dynamics of major infectious diseases outbreaks: A global empirical assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: One of the risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is postulated to be vitamin D deficiency. To understand better the role of vitamin D deficiency in the disease course of COVID-19, we undertook a retrospective case-control study in the North West of England (NWE). OBJECTIVE: To examine whether hospitalisation with COVID-19 is more prevalent in individuals with lower vitamin D levels. METHODS: The study included individuals with results of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) between 1 st April 2020 and 29th January 2021. Patients were recruited from two districts in NWE. The last 25(OH)D level in the previous 12 months was categorised as 'deficient' if less than 25 nmol/L and 'insufficient' if 25-50 nmol/L. RESULTS: 80,670 participants were entered into the study. Of these, 1,808 were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, of whom 670 died. In a primary cohort, median serum 25(OH)D in participants who were not hospitalised with COVID-19 was 50.0 [interquartile range, IQR 34.0-66.7] nmol/L versus 35.0 [IQR 21.0-57.0] nmol/L in those admitted with COVID-19 (p <0.005). There were similar findings in a validation cohort (median serum 25(OH)D 47.1 [IQR 31.8-64.7] nmol/L in non-hospitalised versus 33.0 [IQR 19.4-54.1] nmol/L in hospitalised patients). Age-, sex- and seasonal variation-adjusted odds ratios for hospital admission were 2.3-2.4 times higher among participants with serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L, compared to those with normal serum 25(OH)D levels, without any excess mortality risk.

There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases; (2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation); and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; health behavior engagement; and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects. RESULTS: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19-related news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001), strength of meditation habit (P<.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001) and strength of meditation habit (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 and outline how continued participation in health behaviors such as physical activity and mindfulness meditation reduce worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is then applied to analyze the driving forces behind the embodiment changes. The empirical results show that Chinas energy embodied in both normal and processing exports first increased in 2005-2008, dropped in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, and then rose again after 2009, and finally dropped in 2014-2015. The embodied energy in trade as a percentage of total energy consumption in China was relatively stable before and after the global financial crisis, at around 28% over the 2005-2008 period, and 22% over the 2009-2015 period. The contribution of the aggregate embodied intensity (AEI) of exports to Chinas aggregate energy intensity dropped from 30% in 2005 to 21% in 2015. Among Chinas trading partners, the United States, Japan and Korea together accounted for around half of Chinas embodied energy and AEI in exports in 2005, but their shares dropped to only one third in 2015. Energy efficiency improvement played the key role in reducing the embodied energy and intensity in Chinas exports.

T lymphocytes first identified in the chordate lineage and constitute a highly sophisticated branch of adaptive immune system. Apart from B cells, it is the only cell type that exhibits antigenic specificities; achieved by gene rearrangement. T cells are unique with respect to diversity of their subsets, which have distinct effector specificities, proliferative abilities, memory generation, and life span. T cells are impactful in viral infections by virtue of their capability to combat intracellular pathogens. The effector functions of T cells are mediated through cytokines/chemokines and by direct cytotoxicity of infected cells. T cell response can be beneficial or detrimental to host; prognosis depending on qualitative and quantitative differences in the response. Persistent viral infections are associated with functionally suboptimal, exhausted T cell responses, which are unable to clear virus. Specific subsets such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) dampen antiviral responses; thereby favouring viral persistence. However, Tregs protect the host from immunopathology by limiting perpetual inflammation. Certain other subsets such as Th17 cells may contribute to autoimmune component of viral infections. The importance of T cells is highlighted by the fact that modern vaccination and therapeutic approaches focus on modulating T cell frequencies and effector functions.

As student perceptions are influenced by a range of contextual and institutional factors beyond the classroom, we expected that students would be overall sanguine to the project given that access, technology integration, and family and government support during the pandemic shutdown would mitigate the negative consequences. RESULTS: Students overall reported positive academic outcomes. However, students reported increased stress and anxiety and difficulties concentrating, suggesting that the obstacles to fully online learning were not only technological and instructional challenges but also social and affective challenges of isolation and social distancing. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that the specific context of the pandemic disrupted more than normal teaching and learning activities. Whereas students generally responded positively to the transition, their reluctance to continue learning online and the added stress and workload show the limits of this large scale social experiment.

Upon viral infection, host cells initiate the innate antiviral response, which primarily involves type I interferons (I-IFNs), to enable rapid elimination of the invading virus. Previous studies revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection limits the expression of I-IFNs in vitro and in vivo, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely elucidated. In the present study, we performed data mining and longitudinal data analysis using SARS-CoV-2-infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and ferrets, and the results confirmed the strong inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the induction of I-IFNs. Moreover, we identified genes that are negatively correlated with IFNB1 expression in vitro and in vivo based on Pearson correlation analysis. We found that SARS-CoV-2 activates numerous intrinsic pathways, such as the circadian rhythm, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, peroxisome, and TNF signaling pathways, to inhibit I-IFNs. These intrinsic inhibitory pathways jointly facilitate the successful immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host innate antiviral response in vitro and in vivo, providing theoretical evidence for targeting these immune evasion-associated pathways to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection activates a subset of intrinsic pathways to inhibit type I interferons in vitro and in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A critical situation pushes human behaviour towards different directions with some aspects of behaviour being irrevocable.

RESULTS: 'Tinocordiside' docked very well at the center of the interface of ACE2-RBD complex, and was found to be well stabilized during MD simulation. Tinocordiside incorporation significantly decreased electrostatic component of binding free energies of ACE2-RBD complex (23.5 and 17.10 kcal/mol in the trajectories without or with the ligand, respectively). As the basal rate constant of protein association is in the order of 5, (105 to 106 M-1 S-1 ), there might be no big conformational change or loop reorganization, but involves only local conformational change typically observed in diffusion-controlled association. Taken together, the increase in global flexibility of the complex, clearly indicates the start of unbinding process of the complex. CONCLUSION: It indicates that such an interruption of electrostatic interactions between the RBD and ACE2, and the increase in global flexibility of the complex, would weaken or block SARS-CoV-2 entry and its subsequent infectivity. We postulate that natural phytochemicals like Tinocordiside could be the viable options for controlling SARS-CoV-2 contagion and its entry into host cells.","output":"Tinocordiside from Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) May Curb SARS-CoV-2 Contagion by Disrupting the Electrostatic Interactions between Host ACE2 and Viral S-Protein Receptor Binding Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Treatment for COVID-19 was ambiguous in the beginning of the pandemic. At that time, the conventional medical system was grappling to cope with the rapidly spreading pandemic. The potential of Ayurveda, one of the branches of traditional Indian medicine (TIM), with a 5000 year old history, employing medicines derived from plants and other natural sources, against COVID-19 has been explored through a comparative retrospective open-label study. METHODS: Reported here are the remedial effects of Ayurvedic medicines alone or in combination with Allopathic treatment on 59 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients, across multiple COVID-19 care centers in Ahmedabad, India. The patients were confirmed for COVID-19 infection through RT-qPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. With informed consents from the patients, the sourced data was divided into Allopathic and Ayurvedic [AlloAyur] (n = 41) and Ayurvedic only[Ayur] (n = 18) groups, based on the type of treatment the patients decided to receive, that is Ayurvedic medicines with Allopathic treatment or Ayurvedic medicines alone, respectively. Ayurvedic medicines included oral doses and nasal drops; the dosage and regime were decided based on the recommendations from Ayurvedic texts. The Allopathic medicines included Azithromycin, Vitamin-C and anti-histamines. Acetaminophen was also administered when necessary, by the attending physician. The patients were observed for symptomatic improvement. RESULTS: Primary outcome of this study was the symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Data collected over a period of two months, showed that more patients exhibited symptomatic relief in Ayur goup (83.33%) than in the AlloAyur group (48.78%) within the first 13 days of treatment. No visible adverse effects were observed. This indicated faster and safe symptomatic resolution among those treated with Ayurvedic medicines alone. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving only Ayurvedic medicines on average were symptomatically relieved faster than those receiving Allopathic and Ayurvedic medicines together.","output":"Comparative Retrospective Open-label Study of Ayurvedic Medicines and Their Combination with Allopathic Drugs on Asymptomatic and Mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of Twitter hashtags at medical conferences has revolutionized the way healthcare professionals interact and advance their education.

This represented an unexpected transition from traditional learning to what can be considered e-learning. This, together with the psychological distress that may be associated with the experience of lockdown, might have affected students' performance. It was hypothesised that grit may be a protective factor in such situations. Indeed, compared to their less gritty peers, individuals with higher levels of grit are expected to exhibit greater persistence in the pursuit of goals despite setbacks. Within educational contexts, grit is portrayed as a potentially important influence on outcomes such as achievement level, retention and probability of graduation. A longitudinal study was conducted using an online survey in order to assess the moderated mediation effect of grit on students' achievement. One hundred seventy-six undergraduate students from two universities in the north of Italy participated in the survey. The results showed that grit affects students' grades in final exams; perceived self-efficacy in the management of complex problems had a mediation effect on grades, while psychological distress moderated the first part of the mediation process.

We aimed to study the prevalence of hyperlipasemia and acute pancreatitis in a large inpatient cohort of COVID-19 patients and their impact on clinical outcomes. Methods Retrospective chart review of all hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at an 8-hospital health system in Michigan, USA was performed between February 1,2020 through April 1,2020 with inclusion of patients with obtained lipase levels. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate associations between hyperlipasemia and degree of hyperlipasemia and clinical outcomes of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. COVID-19 attributed pancreatitis was defined as an episode fulfilling criteria for acute pancreatitis defined earlier, a temporally associated diagnosis of COVID-19 and an exclusion of the most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis (gallstones, alcohol use, class IA/IB/II medication (by Badalov classification) use, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, or metabolic etiologies (hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia (>1000mg/ dl)). Results Prevalence of hyperlipasemia was 26.6% and of acute pancreatitis 0.33% in 301 patients with COVID-19. Patients with hyperlipasemia were older (p=0.044) and more likely to have chronic kidney disease (p=0.002) (Table 1). A total of 158 (52.5%) of patients reported at least one gastrointestinal symptom (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea), and the presence of any gastrointestinal symptoms was not associated with the presence of hyperlipasemia (p=0.790). Neither presence of hyperlipasemia or its severity stratified into mild (60-120 U/L), moderate (120-180 U/L), and severe (>180 U/L) categories were associated with increased rates of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission or increased mortality (Table 2). Acute pancreatitis occurred in two patients of which one case was biliary in origin. Prevalence of COVID-19 acute pancreatitis in the reported cohort was 0.33%. Of the other patients with hyperlipasemia, 18 underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and an intra-abdominal process was identified in only two patients, with colitis identified in one patient, and ileus in another. Discussion and Conclusions Acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients is rare while hyperlipasemia is common.

During the COVID19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic reached almost 100,000 deaths in the United States, highlighting the urgent need to identify pain killers with reduced liability so they can be safely prescribed. One approach to develop safe pain killers is to combine existing opioid analgesics with drugs reducing respiratory depression. Using our novel biotechnology platforms in larval zebrafish, we propose to identify new molecular targets and drugs with potent analgesic properties, reduced respiratory liability, and without addictive properties. METHODS Combining targeted mutagenesis and phenotype-based drug screening approaches in larval zebrafish in vivo,we can quickly and effectively identify new molecular targets and screen new drug compounds to either target respiratory depression, analgesia (Zaig and Montandon, 2021, eLife), as well as addiction. We first screened customized drug libraries targeting voltage-gated calcium channels and the adenylyl cyclase pathway, two molecular pathways involved in pain. We are also creating mutants using CRISPR-cas9 in first generation zebrafish embryos to identify new molecular targets. Using our new models, we quantified respiratory depression by fentanyl in day post-fertilization 7 larvae, as well as the nociceptive response to formalin. RESULTS To determine the role of calcium channels opioid-mediated effects, we combined fentanyl and the calcium channel activators nefiracetam (1M) or FLP-64176 (1M). Both nefiractem and FLP-64176 prevented respiratory depression by fentanyl (1M). To target the adenylyl cyclase pathway, we combined fentanyl and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors pentoxifylline (50M), roflumilast (1M), or dipyridamole (100M). Pentaxifylline prevented respiratory depression by fentanyl but not roflumilast and dipyridamole. To perform targeted mutagenesis, we injected 4 single guide RNAs targeting the orpm1 gene, i.e. the gene coding for -opioid receptors. Six days later, we measured respiratory depression by fentanyl in knockout larvae or controls. In oprm1-/- knockout larvae, respiratory depression by fentanyl was substantially reduced compared to controls, therefore confirming the validity of our targeted mutagenesis approach. We are currently targeting the genes coding for calcium channels and phosphodiesterases to determine whether they can be molecular targets for respiratory depression and/or analgesia. DISCUSSION The successful identification of new drug combinations to prevent respiratory depression while preserving analgesia suggests that our drug discovery platform in larval zebrafish will substantially accelerate the identification of new opioid drugs with reduced morbidity and mortality. Our platform is also being leveraged to discover non-opioid pain killers with reduced side-effects.","output":"Discovery of Novel Pain Therapies Without Side-effects by Combining Targeted Mutagenesis and Phenotype-based Drug Screening in Larval Zebrafish."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) has rabidly spread all over the world.

Virus-encoded subunits of the replication complex mediate its interaction with membranes. As replication platforms, RNA viruses use the cytoplasmic surfaces of different membrane compartments, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, endo/lysosomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes. Closterovirus infections are accompanied by formation of multivesicular complexes from cell membranes of ER or mitochondrial origin. So far the mechanisms for vesicles formation have been obscure. In the replication-associated 1a polyprotein of Beet yellows virus (BYV) and other closteroviruses, the region between the methyltransferase and helicase domains (1a central region (CR), 1a CR) is marginally conserved. Computer-assisted analysis predicts several putative membrane-binding domains in the BYV 1a CR. Transient expression of a hydrophobic segment (referred to here as CR-2) of the BYV 1a in Nicotiana benthamiana led to reorganization of the ER and formation of ~1-m mobile globules. We propose that the CR-2 may be involved in the formation of multivesicular complexes in BYV-infected cells. This provides analogy with membrane-associated proteins mediating the build-up of virus factories in cells infected with diverse positive-strand RNA viruses (alpha-like viruses, picorna-like viruses, flaviviruses, and nidoviruses) and negative-strand RNA viruses (bunyaviruses).","output":"Beet yellows virus replicase and replicative compartments: parallels with other RNA viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to physical distancing guidelines, the closure of nonessential businesses, and the closure of public schools, the role of telehealth for the delivery of psychological services for children has never been more debated However, the transition to teleassessment is more complicated for some types of assessment than others For instance, the remote administration of achievement and intelligence tests is a relatively recent adaptation of telehealth, and despite recommendations for rapid adoption by some policymakers and publishing companies, caution and careful consideration of individual and contextual variables and the existing research literature, as well as measurement, cultural and linguistic, and legal and ethical issues, is warranted The decision to use remotely administered achievement and intelligence tests is best made on a case-by-case basis after consideration of these factors We discuss each of these issues as well as implications for practice and policy, as well as issue provisional guidance for consideration for publishing companies interested in these endeavors moving forward (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Public Significance Statement-The current review describes a number of factors that may reduce the accuracy of standardized tests, like intelligence tests, when they are given remotely Additionally, it highlights the importance of considering the purpose of assessment, client cultural and linguistic background, as well as ethical and legal decision making, on the use and interpretation of standardized test results (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Teleassessment with children and adolescents during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and beyond: Practice and policy implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The accurate and prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required for the control and treatment of the coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Prior to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, stable patients with chronic conditions attended the facility or support groups to obtain their medication. During the COVID-19 epidemic, these patients would be put at risk if they had to travel and gather in groups to receive medication. The Metropolitan Health Services, therefore, decided to offer home delivery of medication. A system of home delivery was rapidly established by linking the existing chronic dispensing unit system with the emerging approach to community-orientated primary care in the Metro. Medication was delivered as usual to primary care pharmacies, but then a variety of means were used to disseminate the parcels to local non-profit organisations, where they could be delivered by a city-wide network of community health workers (CHWs). Innovations included various ways of delivering the parcels, including via Uber, bicycles and electric scooters, as well as Google forms to monitor the success of the initiative. It was estimated that up to 200 000 parcels per month could be delivered in this way via 2500 CHWs. The new system was established throughout the Metropole, and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are further discussed. The initiative may prevent COVID-19 amongst people with comorbidities who would be at risk of more severe diseases.

Therefore, in addition to vaccination, the use of supplements to support the immune system may be important. The purpose of this study was to synthesize evidence on the possible effect of low serum vitamin D levels (25[OH]D<20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L) on COVID-19 infection and outcomes. METHODS: We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect without any language restrictions for articles published between January 1 and December 15, 2020. We performed 3 meta-analyses (called vitamin D and COVID-19 infection meta-analysis [D-CIMA], vitamin D and COVID-19 severity meta-analysis [D-CSMA], and vitamin D and COV ID-19 mortality meta-analysis [D-CMMA] for COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality, respectively) to combine odds ratio values according to laboratory measurement units for vitamin D and the measured serum 25(OH)D level. RESULTS: Twenty-one eligible studies were found to be relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 infection/outcomes (n=205,869). The D-CIMA meta-analysis showed that individuals with low serum vitamin D levels were 1.64 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32 to 2.04; p<0.001) more likely to contract COVID-19. The D-CSMA meta-analysis showed that people with serum 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L were 2.42 times (95% CI, 1.13 to 5.18; p=0.022) more likely to have severe COVID-19.

Participants were 222 socioeconomically and racially diverse older adults (aged 70C90 years; 38% Black; 13% Hispanic) systematically recruited from the Bronx, NY. Loneliness was measured in two ways, with a retrospective trait measure (the UCLA Three Item Loneliness Scale) and an aggregated momentary measure assessed via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) across 14 days. Inflammatory markers included both basal levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-) and LPS-stimulated levels of the same cytokines. Multiple regression analyses controlled for age, body-mass index, race, and depressive symptoms. Moderation by gender and race were also explored. Both higher trait loneliness and aggregated momentary measures of loneliness were associated with higher levels of CRP ( = 0.16, p = 0.02;  = 0.15, p = 0.03, respectively). There were no significant associations between loneliness and basal or stimulated cytokines and neither gender nor race were significant moderators.

We obtained epidemiological information on febrile illness outbreaks and oral pharyngeal swabs from students in the outbreaks to test for influenza virus. We surveyed schools that did not report febrile illness outbreaks. We developed multi-level models to identify and evaluate factors associated with serious influenza outbreaks and explored the association of vaccine coverage and outbreaks using multi-stage regression models. We identified a total of 748 febrile illness outbreaks involving 8176 students in Beijing; 462 outbreaks were caused by influenza virus. Adjusted regression modeling showed that large class size (odds ratio (OR) = 2.38) and the number of days from identification of the first case to initiation of an intervention (OR = 1.17) were statistically significant and positively associated with serious outbreaks, and that high vaccination coverage (relative risk (RR) = 0.50) was statistically significant and negatively associated with outbreaks. Multi-stage regression modeling showed that RR decreased fastest when vaccination coverage was 45% to 51%.

An important part of the immune response is the activation of the inflammasome. G6PD-deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and human monocytic (THP-1) cells were used as models to investigate whether G6PD modulates inflammasome activation. A decreased expression of IL-1 was observed in both G6PD-deficient PBMCs and PMA-primed G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) THP-1 cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or LPS/nigericin stimulation. The pro-IL-1 expression of THP-1 cells was decreased by G6PD knockdown at the transcriptional and translational levels in an investigation of the expression of the inflammasome subunits. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and downstream c-Fos expression were decreased upon G6PD knockdown, accompanied by decreased AP-1 translocation into the nucleus. Impaired inflammasome activation in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells was mediated by a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NOX signaling, while treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) enhanced inflammasome activation in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells. G6PD knockdown decreased Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli clearance in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells and G6PD-deficient PBMCs following inflammasome activation.

Staff did not report known contact with ill visitors. All staff were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The tigers and most temporally and geographically associated cases had genetic sequences in clade 20G and B.1.2. Tiger sequences were 3-6 single nucleotide polymorphisms different from the positive tiger keeper (Figure). Figure. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis from a portion of clade 20G showing divergence estimates from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome with sequences from humans living in Tennessee and Malayan tigers sampled during the outbreak investigation in October 2020. Sequence analysis showed 3-6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) differences between one human tiger keeper and all three tiger sequences. Differences are indicated by one-step edges (lines) between colored dots (individual SARS-CoV-2 sequenced infections). Numbers indicate unique sequences. Note not all analyzed sequences are shown in this figure. Conclusion Using a One Health approach, we concluded the index tiger was likely infected via transmission from an ill visitor at an exhibit observation point or unidentified asymptomatic staff. Infection spread to the other 2 tigers and tiger-to-human transmission to 2 staff is possible thereafter. The zoo was advised on infection control practices for humans and animals, and no additional cases were identified.

Quantitative models play an important role in understanding food systems' expected responses to shocks and stresses. Here, we present a stylised mathematical model of a national-level food system that incorporates domestic supply of a food commodity, international trade, consumer demand, and food commodity price. We derive a critical compound parameter signalling when domestic supply will become unsustainable and the food system entirely dependent on imports, which results in higher commodity prices, lower consumer demand and lower inventory levels. Using Bayesian estimation, we apply the dynamic food systems model to infer the sustainability of the UK pork industry. We find that the UK pork industry is currently sustainable but because the industry is dependent on imports to meet demand, a decrease in self-sufficiency below 50% (current levels are 60-65%) would lead it close to the critical boundary signalling its collapse. Our model provides a theoretical foundation for future work to determine more complex causal drivers of food system vulnerability.","output":"A mathematical model of national-level food system sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unexpected discontinuation of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) exam in January 2021 carries both risks and opportunities for medical education in the United States.

This has prompted public health agencies to recommend a symptom- and/or time-based strategy for discontinuation of isolation precautions, which, for hospitalized patients, results in significant use of personal protective equipment. Due to the inability of current molecular diagnostic assays to differentiate between the presence of remnant viral RNA (i.e., noninfectious) and replication-competent (i.e., infectious) virus, there has been interest in determining whether laboratory tests can be used to predict an individuals likelihood of transmitting the virus to others.

Recently, a bat CoV was detected in the Republic of Korea; its entire genome was sequenced and reported to be genetically similar to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the two Korean bat CoV strains 16BO133 and B15-21, to estimate the likelihood of an interaction between the Korean bat CoVs and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. METHODS: The phylogenetic analysis was conducted with the maximum-likelihood (ML) method using MEGA 7 software. The Korean bat CoVs receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein was analyzed by comparative homology modeling using the SWISS-MODEL server. The binding energies of the complexes were calculated using PRODIGY and MM/GBGA. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses of the entire RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, spike regions, and the complete genome revealed that the Korean CoVs, along with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, within BetaCoVs. However, the two Korean CoVs were distinct from SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the spike gene of the Korean CoVs, which is involved in host infection, differed from that of SARS-CoV-2, showing only 66.8%C67.0% nucleotide homology and presented deletions within the RBD, particularly within regions critical for cross-species transmission and that mediate interaction with ACE2. Binding free energy calculation revealed that the binding affinity of Korean bat CoV RBD to hACE2 was drastically lower than that of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: 112 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Volumetric percentage of infection and density of the lung were measured by a computer-aided software. Clinical parameters were recorded to reflect disease progression. Baseline data and dynamic change were compared between two groups and a decision-tree algorithm was developed to determine the cut-off value for classification. Results: 93 patients were finally included and were divided into common group (n = 76) and severe group (n = 17) based on current criteria. Compared with common patients, severe patients experienced shorter advanced stage, peak time and plateau, but longer absorption stage. The dynamic change of volume and density coincided with the clinical course. The interquartile range of volumetric percentage of the two groups were 1.0-7.2% and 11.4-31.2%, respectively. Baseline volumetric percentage of infection was significantly higher in severe group, and the cut-off value of it was 10.10%.

This session highlights cross-cutting genetic and genomic analyses that illuminate the relationships between substance use disorders (SUDs) and aspects of health and disease beyond the known relationships with other psychiatric disorders. This is a topic that has gotten very little attention in the past. It is timely, given multiple global health crises, as it addresses the role of SUDs in respiratory and cardiometabolic illness, COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS C each among the leading contributors to mortality. The first talk will showcase findings from a phenome-wide analysis (PheWAS) of alcohol and cannabis involvement, using medical center data. It demonstrates that genetic liability for substance use has a profound effect on multiple bodily systems. For example, genetic liability for cannabis use predicted respiratory illness while that for alcohol use predicted heart disease. Individuals with SUDs are at higher risk to develop severe cases of COVID-19. The second talk examines genetic correlations between COVID-19 severity phenotypes and 1014 heritable traits, and reveals that the largest genetic causality proportions were for alcohol use frequency, smoking and cannabis use. Third, we pivot from the current pandemic to the ongoing HIV epidemic to discuss the impact of cocaine abuse among HIV+ individuals. The findings showed cocaine use increased viral load, worsened progression, accelerated mortality, and increase the latent viral reservoir. Specific DNA methylation and gene expression differences that appear to be biological mediators of these relationships were uncovered. The last talk addresses the mediating role of behavioral disinhibition, which is genetically correlated with SUD, using a multivariate GWAS approach to creating a broad genetic measure of externalizing behavior (EXT). Pooling data from 1.5 million people, more than 500 genetic loci were discovered. A PheWAS showed that EXT-PRS was associated with 255 of the 1335 disease phenotypes tested (FDR < 0.05). Individuals with higher EXT-PRS showed poorer health in nearly every bodily system. To conclude, the panel will discuss the importance of considering the genetics of SUDs more broadly, to better understand both psychiatric and somatic disorders and the enormous health burden arising from them.

However, varying definitions of what constitute dance have led to a rather heterogenous body of evidence about such potential effects, leaving the picture piecemeal at best. It remains unclear what exact parameters may be driving positive effects. We believe that this heterogeneity of evidence is partly due to a lack of a clear definition of dance for such empirical purposes. A differentiation is needed between (a) the effects on the individual when the activity of dancing is enjoyed as a dancer within different dance domains (e.g., professional/high-art type of dance, erotic dance, religious dance, club dancing, Dance Movement Therapy (DMT), and what is commonly known as hobby, recreational or social dance), and (b) the effects on the individual within these different domains, as a dancer of the different dance styles (solo dance, partnering dance, group dance; and all the different styles within these). Another separate category of dance engagement is, not as a dancer, but as a spectator of all of the above. Watching dance as part of an audience has its own set of psychophysiological and neurocognitive effects on the individual, and depends on the context where dance is witnessed. With the help of dance professionals, we first outline some different dance domains and dance styles, and outline aspects that differentiate them, and that may, therefore, cause differential empirical findings when compared regardless (e.g., amount of interpersonal contact, physical exertion, context, cognitive demand, type of movements, complexity of technique and ratio of choreography/improvisation). Then, we outline commonalities between all dance styles. We identify six basic components that are part of any dance practice, as part of a continuum, and review and discuss available research for each of them concerning the possible health and wellbeing effects of each of these components, and how they may relate to the psychophysiological and health effects that are reported for dancing: (1) rhythm and music, (2) sociality, (3) technique and fitness, (4) connection and connectedness (self-intimation), (5) flow and mindfulness, (6) aesthetic emotions and imagination. Future research efforts might take into account the important differences between types of dance activities, as well as the six components, for a more targeted assessment of how dancing affects the human body.","output":"A Practice-Inspired Mindset for Researching the Psychophysiological and Medical Health Effects of Recreational Dance (Dance Sport)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Question We aimed to investigate the effect of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine on sperm parameters of patients with a normal and abnormal semen analysis.

We propose a prospective cohort study to verify the relationship between built environment features and leisure-time and transport-related physical activity in adults from Sao Paulo city, Brazil. METHODS: Prospective multilevel cohort, denominated ISA-Physical Activity and Environment. It will build on the Health Survey of Sao Paulo in 2015 (Inqurito de Sade de S?o Paulo (ISA) in Portuguese). The Health Survey of Sao Paulo, originally designed as a cross-sectional survey, had a multi-stage sample, covering 150 census tracts distributed in five health administrative areas. Data collection was performed by face-to-face interviews until December 2015 and the sample comprised 4043 individuals aged 12 years or more. The ISA-Physical Activity and Environment study will reassess people who are aged 18 years or more in 2020, including telephone and household interviews. The primary outcome will be leisure-time and transport-related physical activity, assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire long version.

This is a narrative review study based on the studies published related with different aspects of COVID-19. The highest numbers of active cases are in the USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, as well as Colombia and the disease surveillance system must operate more quickly, timely, effectively, and sensitively in these countries. What is clear is that the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number is significantly higher than one and its transmission power is extremely high. In general, it can be stated that mortality and fatality risk due to COVID-19 in men, age increase, severity of disease, systemic disease, as well as inadequate access to the sufficient health-care services will increase. There is currently no specific treatment and effective vaccine for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus pandemic is more consistent with the epidemiological triangle model, which emphasizes that the disease is the result of the interaction of three factors of host, agent, and environment. Therefore, prevention and treatment activities should focus on cutting the virus transmission chain. The main way to deal with viral epidemics is prevention. The emerging of this ruthless virus has once again reminded us that communicable diseases should never be underestimated and forgotten. Considering the rapid transmission of COVID-19, the health-care authorities and workers should consider timely detection and safeguards to prevent the transmission to healthy individuals.","output":"Aspects of Epidemiology, Pathology, Virology, Immunology, Transmission, Prevention, Prognosis, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have performed highly accurate numerical simulations to investigate prolonged dispersion of novel coronavirus-laden droplets in classroom air. Approximately 10,900 virus-laden droplets were released into the air by a teacher coughing and tracked for 90 min by numerical simulations. The teacher was standing in front of multiple students in a classroom. To estimate viral transmission to the students, we considered the features of the novel coronavirus, such as the virus half-life. The simulation results revealed that there was a high risk of prolonged airborne transmission of virus-laden droplets when the outlet flow of the classroom ventilation was low (i.e., 4.3 and 8.6 cm/s). The rates of remaining airborne virus-laden droplets produced by the teacher coughing were 40% and 15% after 45 and 90 min, respectively. The results revealed that students can avoid exposure to the virus-laden droplets by keeping a large distance from the teacher (5.5 m), which is more than two times farther than the currently suggested social distancing rules. The results of this study provide guidelines to set a new protection plan in the classroom to prevent airborne transmission of virus-laden droplets to students.","output":"Computational investigation of prolonged airborne dispersion of novel coronavirus-laden droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins have been recently shown to restrict HIV-1 and other viruses. Here we provide evidence that IFITM proteins, particularly IFITM2 and IFITM3, specifically antagonize the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), thereby inhibiting viral infection. IFITM proteins interact with HIV-1 Env in viral producer cells, leading to impaired Env processing and virion incorporation. Notably, the level of IFITM incorporation into HIV-1 virions does not strictly correlate with the extent of inhibition. Prolonged passage of HIV-1 in IFITM-expressing T lymphocytes leads to emergence of Env mutants that overcome IFITM restriction. The ability of IFITMs to inhibit cell-to-cell infection can be extended to HIV-1 primary isolates, HIV-2 and SIVs; however, the extent of inhibition appears to be virus strain-dependent. Overall, our study uncovers a mechanism by which IFITM proteins specifically antagonize HIV-1 Env to restrict HIV-1 infection, and provides insight into the specialized role of IFITMs in HIV infection.","output":"IFITM Proteins Restrict HIV-1 Infection by Antagonizing the Envelope Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to articulate the impact of COVID-19 on marketing.

Previous studies remain controversial regarding whether metformin is associated with reduced risk for COVID-19 diabetic patients. Thus, this meta-analysis is performed. Method: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify all relevant studies published prior to October 2020 according to the established inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis was reported in conformity to the Preferred Reporting Project declared by the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the association between metformin use and mortality for COVID-19 patients. A random-effect or fixed-effect model was used based on heterogeneity significance. Subgroup analysis was performed based on in-hospital-use or home-use, and different sample sizes. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection were also performed. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan software (version 5.3; Cochrane library) and STATA 12.0 statistical software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX), and all P values were two-tailed, the test level was 0.05. Result: 97 articles were obtained from the database search, and 5 articles obtained from other sources. 8 articles involving 11,169 participants were included. Most studies were considered moderate quality. A statistically significant association between metformin use and decreased mortality of COVID-19 patients was found (OR 0.53, 95%CI: 0.34, 0.83, P=0.005, I(2)=77%). In the subgroup analyses, home-use of metformin was also associated with a reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.54, 95%CI: 0.35, 0.84, P=0.006, I(2)=66%), and one study reporting in-hospital use did not find reduced mortality among COVID-19 patients taking metformin (OR 1.65, 95%CI: 0.71, 3.86, P=0.247). For sample size >1,000, no statistically significant reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.84, 95%CI: 0.57, 1.26, P=0.41, I(2)=73%) was found, however, for sample 1,000, a statistically significant reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.29, 95%CI: 0.19, 0.44 P<0.00001, I(2)=0%) was found.

Beggs test (z=0.37, P=0.711) and Eggers test (t=-1.98, P=0.096) did not detect a significant risk of publication bias. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis demonstrates that metformin use is associated with decreased mortality for COVID-19 diabetic patients. However, only one study investigating the in-hospital use of metformin. More high-quality original studies are needed to further explore the association between metformin use and mortality risk of COVID-19.","output":"Is Metformin Use Associated With a Decreased Mortality for COVID-19 Diabetic Patients?

Two specific risk factors are most prominent, old age and the presence of co-morbidity. Recent studies have shown that patients with compromised renal function, especially those treated with renal replacement therapy or having received a kidney transplant are at a much higher risk for severe COVID infection and increased mortality. This may be in part due to the increased prevalence of co-morbid conditions in these patients but specific alterations in their immune system, reflecting premature immunological aging, may be equally important. In this review the different aspects, in particular thymus function and memory T cell expansion, of uremia-associated immunological aging are reviewed with respect to COVID 19 infection. In essence, the decreased generation of naive T cells may be instrumental in suboptimal anti-viral immune responses while the relatively uncontrolled expansion of effector T cells may facilitate the feared phase of the COVID-19 infection with excessive and live-threatening inflammation of the lung parenchyma.","output":"Uremia-Associated Immunological Aging and Severity of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the demand for hospital beds for COVID-19 patients is key for decision-making and planning mitigation strategies, as overwhelming healthcare systems has critical consequences for disease mortality.

Standard methods, like the Kaplan-Meier estimator, require prior assumptions that are untenable given current knowledge. Using real-time surveillance data from the first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Galicia (Spain), we aimed to model the time-to-event and event probabilities of patients hospitalized, without parametric priors and adjusting for individual covariates. We applied a nonparametric Mixture Cure Model and compared its performance in estimating hospital ward/ICU lengths-of-stay to the performances of commonly used methods to estimate survival. We showed that the proposed model outperformed standard approaches, providing more accurate ICU and hospital ward length-of-stay estimates. Finally, we applied our model estimates to simulate COVID-19 hospital demand using a Monte Carlo algorithm.

In silico and in vitro studies suggest that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Three clinical trials comparing sofosbuvir/daclatasvir-based regimens with a comparator in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were combined in a meta-analysis. The primary outcomes measured were clinical recovery within 14 days of randomization, time to clinical recovery and all-cause mortality. A two-step approach was used to analyse individual-level patient data. The individual trial statistics were pooled using the random-effects inverse-variance model. RESULTS: Our search identified eight studies of which three met the inclusion criteria (n = 176 patients); two studies were randomized and one was non-randomized. Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. Clinical recovery within 14 days of randomization was higher in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arms compared with control arms [risk ratio = 1.34 (95% CI = 1.05-1.71), P = 0.020].

It is particularly developed in the northern part of the country, where 70% of the whole Italian cattle population is reared. The cattle industry development in the rest of the country is hampered by the hard orography of the territories and a variety of socioeconomic features leading to the persistence of the traditional rural farming systems. The differences in the farming systems (industrial vs. traditional) also affect the health status of the farms. Whereas, Enzootic Bovine Leukosis (EBL) is almost eradicated across the whole country, in Southern Italy where Bovine Tuberculosis and Brucellosis are still present and Bluetongue is endemic due to the presence of the competent vector (Culicoides imicola), less investments are aimed at controlling diseases with economic impact or at improving farm biosecurity. On the other hand, with the eradication of these diseases in most part of the country, the need has emerged for reducing the economic burden of non-regulated endemic disease and control programs (CPs) for specific diseases have been implemented at regional level, based on the needs of each territory (for instance common grazing or trading with neighboring countries). This explains the coexistence of different types of programs in force throughout the country. Nowadays in Italy, among cattle diseases with little or no EU regulations only three are regulated by a national CP: Enzootic Bovine Leukosis, Bluetongue and Paratuberculosis, while Bovine Genital Campylobacteriosis and Trichomonosis are nationwide controlled only in breeding bulls. For some of the remaining diseases (Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Streptococcus agalactiae) specific CPs have been implemented by the regional Authorities, but for most of them a CP does not exist at all. However, there is a growing awareness among farmers and public health authorities that animal diseases have a major impact not only on the farm profitability but also on animal welfare and on the use of antibiotics in livestock.

METHODS: Silica gel column chromatographic separation was used to isolate compounds. Crude extract and isolated compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans via the broth dilution method. Docking studies were performed with E. coli DNA-Gyrase B and human DNA topoisomerase II by using AutoDock Vina. ADMET were predicted by SwissADME, PreADMET, and OSIRIS Property predictions. The optimized structures and molecular electrostatic potential surface of the isolated compounds were predicted by DFT analysis using B3LYP/6-31G basis levels. RESULTS: Silica gel column chromatographic separation afforded five compounds 1C5 of which N-methyl-2,3-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-1-indol (1) is reported herein for the first time, along with known C-benzylated dihydrochalcone uvaretin (2), bis(2-ethylheptyl) phthalate (3), lupeol (4) and suberosin derivative (5). Dichloromethane roots extract of U. scheffleri showed potent antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC = 6.25 g/mL) compared to gentamicin (MIC=5 g/mL). In silico, molecular docking analysis of compounds (1and 3C5) showed strong interaction with E. coli DNA gyrase B with a binding energy value ranging from ?6.9 to ?6.0 kcal/mol compared to ciprofloxacin ?7.2 kcal/mol, whereas analysis against human topoisomerase II showed binding energy value ranging from ?5.9 to ?5.3 kcal/mol compared to vosaroxin (?6.2 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: The results obtained suggest that N-methyl-2,3-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-1-indol (1) and coumarin (5) are potential topoisomerase II  inhibitors and might be used as anticancer agents. The ADMET studies showed the highest drug-likeness properties for studied compounds other than bis(2-ethylheptyl) phthalate (3). DFT calculations suggested that studied compounds showed the lowest gap energy and were chemically reactive, and isolated compounds may serve as potential drug candidates that corroborate with the traditional uses of studied plants.","output":"Antimicrobial Activity, in silico Molecular Docking, ADMET and DFT Analysis of Secondary Metabolites from Roots of Three Ethiopian Medicinal Plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe impact of chronic health conditions (CHC) on serostatus post-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is unknown. MethodsWe assessed serostatus post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among fully vaccinated participants recruited between April 2021 through August 2021 in 18 years and older residents of Jefferson County, Kentucky, USA. Serostatus was determined by measuring SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G (Spike IgG) antibodies via enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) in peripheral blood samples. ResultsOf the 5,178 fully vaccinated participants, 51 were seronegative and 5,127 were seropositive. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR=13.49; 95% CI: 4.88-37.3; P<0.0001) and autoimmune disease (OR=11.34; 95% CI: 5.21-24.69; P<0.0001) showed highest association with negative serostatus in fully vaccinated participants. The absence of any CHC was strongly associated with positive serostatus (OR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.19-0.73; P=0.003). The risk of negative serostatus increased in the presence of two CHCs (OR=2.82; 95% CI: 1.14-7) to three or more CHCs (OR=4.52; 95% CI: 1.68-12.14). Similarly, use of 2 or more CHC related medications was significantly associated with seronegative status (OR=6.08; 95%: 2.01-18.35). ConclusionsPresence of any CHC, especially CKD or autoimmune disease, increased the likelihood of seronegative status among individuals who were fully vaccinated to SAR-CoV-2. This risk increased with a concurrent increase in number of comorbidities, especially with multiple medications. Absence of any CHC was protective and increased the likelihood of a positive serological response post-vaccination.

Research to prevent or treat skeletal muscle cramping in patients receiving dialysis is hindered by poorly understood pathophysiology, lack of an accepted definition, and the absence of a standardized measurement method. The Kidney Health Initiative, a public-private partnership between the American Society of Nephrology and US Food and Drug Administration, convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to define a set of patient-reported outcome measures for use in clinical trials to test the effect of new dialysis devices, new KRTs, lifestyle/behavioral modifications, and medications on skeletal muscle cramping. Upon determining that foundational work was necessary, the workgroup undertook a multistep process to elicit concepts central to developing the basis for demonstrating content validity of candidate patient-reported outcome measures for skeletal muscle cramping in patients on dialysis. The workgroup sought to (1) create an accepted, patient-endorsed definition for skeletal muscle cramping that applies to all dialysis modalities, (2) construct a conceptual model for developing and evaluating a skeletal muscle cramping-specific patient-reported outcome measure, and (3) identify potential questions from existing patient-reported outcome measures that could be modified or adapted and subsequently tested in the dialysis population. We report the results of the workgroup efforts, provide our recommendations, and issue a call to action to address the gaps in knowledge and research needs we identified. These action steps are urgently needed to quantify skeletal muscle cramping burden, assess the effect, and measure meaningful changes of new interventions to improve the experience of patients receiving dialysis and suffering from skeletal muscle cramping.","output":"Conceptual Framework for Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Clinical Trials of Skeletal Muscle Cramping Experienced in Dialysis: A Kidney Health Initiative Workgroup Report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a reflection upon a social innovation lab process used to establish and build an ongoing culture of sustainability (COS) within a new multi-tenant commercial office building. It seeks to answer two key questions: (1) what are the design tensions that emerge when constructing co-design processes meant to encourage social innovation in a complex system while working from inside that complex system;(2) in building commons governance structures in a complex system, what are realistic expectations for the voluntary participation when multiple organizations with different core mandates are involved? This paper's primary results come from reflecting upon the COS development coming from the social innovation lab process and adaptations process needed for it to work within a place-based context. The COS intervention itself is still in process and was disrupted by COVID-19, so these findings are still preliminary. Participatory co-design research often involves a great deal of complexity and tacit knowledge, so the key finding here is the surfacing of four core sources of tension that arise when developing a co-design process for the management of a commons: the allocation of costs for co-ordinating collective action, balancing a homogeneous platform for action with heterogeneous participants, physical building infrastructure and social co-design approaches, and between-tenant organization leadership and co-design approaches.

METHODS: The patients who received scans with CT Ark or Brilliance 64 CT were enrolled. Their lung images were divided into two groups according to the scanner. The objective evaluation methods of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were used. The subjective evaluation methods including the evaluation of the fine structure under the lung window and the evaluation of the general structure under the mediastinum window were compared. Kappa method was used to assess the reliability of the subjective evaluation. The subjective evaluation results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. SNR and CNR were tested using independent sample t tests. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in somatotype of enrolled subjects. The Kappa value between the two observers was between 0.68 and 0.81, indicating good consistency. For subjective evaluation results, the rank sum test P value of fine structure evaluation and general structure evaluation by the two observers was  0.05. For objective evaluation results, SNR and CNR between the two CT scanners were significantly different (P<0.05).

They were quarantined in airborne infection isolation rooms for at least 14 days with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests after hospital discharge. Twelve (34.3%) of them had re-positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and none of them presented any COVID-19 signs or symptoms during the entire quarantine period. In this study, the re-positive patients were more likely to be diagnosed in the early stage of the disease with a longer hospital stay. Virus re-infection is impossible in this high standard isolation setting, and reactivation is also unlikely, so that residual virus nucleic acid should be the possible reason for this phenomenon.

Although it is primarily a respiratory illness, other manifestations, such as Guillain-Barr syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, and immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, have been described. We present a case of a patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab with a marked biochemical improvement. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we present a Caucasian patient with COVID-19 who developed a marked elevation of inflammatory parameters with ferritin 36,023 g/L, but also elevated C-reactive protein 334 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase 1074 U/L, 1 week after admission to the intensive care unit. He met five of eight criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but he lacked the high fever and cytopenia seen in the majority of cases. He was treated with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, and over the next days, a rapid decrease in ferritin and C-reactive protein levels was observed. However, his respiratory failure only improved gradually, and he was weaned off the respirator 11 days later. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may induce a hyperinflammatory clinical picture and in some cases develop into hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In our patient's case, therapeutic interleukin-6 blockade abrogated signs of hyperinflammation but did not seem to improve pulmonary function. Measurement of ferritin and C-reactive protein, as well as quantification of interleukin-6 on indication, should be performed in patients with severe COVID-19.

Unexpectedly, the daily average ozone concentration profile was practically indistinguishable from that of the past two years for the same time span in the calendar. So, we compared surface meteorology data, CO, NOx and O3 hourly concentrations in the MCMA from the ozone season (from March 1 to May 31) for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Also, TROPOMI satellite data on column count of CO, NO2 and HCHO, above a sparse grid of surface points in the MCMA, were also compared for March, April, and May 2020 with those from 2019. Population density used as a background variable to increase understanding of the observed differences allowed us to propose that reductions in NOx were so drastic that ozone formation moved rapidly from a VOC sensitive region towards a NOx sensitive region. The relevance of that unplanned policy provides impacts of contingent short-term emissions control actions during very high pollution episodes. Further analysis of these and other related data concerning VOC speciation and emissions patterns during the coronavirus lockdown may provide guidelines to enhance emission control policies in the post-COVID-19 times to come.","output":"Ozone over Mexico City during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Improving nursing students' knowledge and clinical judgment related to mechanical ventilation (MV) is paramount, considering the heightened need for MV due to the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

(c) What can instructors do to help alleviate their online students' perceived levels of language anxiety? In addition to an exploration of the guiding questions, the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale, which was developed by Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986), is described in detail as well as how language educators can use it as a tool in their own classrooms to measure their students' perceived language anxiety levels. The pedagogical implications include recommended techniques and interventions for helping online language learners feel less isolated, less anxious, and more connected to their teacher and to their peers. Given the large number of students who are currently engaged in online or remote language learning due to COVID-19, it is important to consider how affective factors, such as anxiety, can impede learning outcomes. Furthermore, language educators and their students were required to transition rapidly to the online environment without sufficient time or preparation for it, which is an additional cause of stress for both students and instructors alike.

Objective: To examine the potential association between COVID-19 vaccination and SSNHL. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study and case series involved an up-to-date population-based analysis of 555 incident reports of probable SSNHL in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) over the first 7 months of the US vaccination campaign (December 14, 2020, through July 16, 2021). In addition, data from a multi-institutional retrospective case series of 21 patients who developed SSNHL after COVID-19 vaccination were analyzed. The study included all adults experiencing SSNHL within 3 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination who submitted reports to VAERS and consecutive adult patients presenting to 2 tertiary care centers and 1 community practice in the US who were diagnosed with SSNHL within 3 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination. Exposures: Receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine produced by any of the 3 vaccine manufacturers (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) used in the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of reports of SSNHL after COVID-19 vaccination recorded in VAERS and clinical characteristics of adult patients presenting with SSNHL after COVID-19 vaccination. Results: A total of 555 incident reports in VAERS (mean patient age, 54 years [range, 15-93 years]; 305 women [55.0%]; data on race and ethnicity not available in VAERS) met the definition of probable SSNHL (mean time to onset, 6 days [range, 0-21 days]) over the period investigated, representing an annualized incidence estimate of 0.6 to 28.0 cases of SSNHL per 100a?000 people per year. The rate of incident reports of SSNHL was similar across all 3 vaccine manufacturers (0.16 cases per 100a?000 doses for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and 0.22 cases per 100 000 doses for Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine). The case series included 21 patients (mean age, 61 years [range, 23-92 years]; 13 women [61.9%]) with SSNHL, with a mean time to onset of 6 days (range, 0-15 days).
