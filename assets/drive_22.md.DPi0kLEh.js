Our approach is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed in the COVID-19 epidemic. Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but obeying rigorous distancing constraints.","output":"Confinement strategies in a simple SIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO. The clinical manifestation and disease progression in COVID-19 patients varies from minimal symptoms to severe respiratory issues with multiple organ failure. Understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host cells will provide key insights into the effective molecular targets for the development of novel therapeutics. Recent studies have identified virus-mediated phosphorylation or activation of some major signaling pathways, such as ERK1/2, JNK, p38, PI3K/AKT and NF-&#954;B signaling, that potentially elicit the cytokine storm that serves as a major cause of tissue injuries. Several studies highlight the aggressive inflammatory response particularly 'cytokine storm' in SARS-CoV-2 patients. A depiction of host molecular dynamics triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in the form of a network of signaling molecules will be helpful for COVID-19 research. Therefore, we developed the signaling pathway map of SARS-CoV-2 infection using data mined from the recently published literature. This integrated signaling pathway map of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 326 proteins and 73 reactions. These include information pertaining to 1,629 molecular association events, 30 enzyme catalysis events, 43 activation/inhibition events, and 8,531 gene regulation events.

This phenotype is induced by viral endoribonucleases, including SOX in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), muSOX in murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), BGLF5 in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and vhs in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Here, we performed comparative transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) upon expression of these herpesviral endonucleases in order to characterize their effect on the host transcriptome. Consistent with previous reports, we found that approximately two-thirds of transcripts were downregulated in cells expressing any of these viral endonucleases. Among the transcripts spared from degradation, we uncovered a cluster of transcripts that systematically escaped degradation from all tested endonucleases. Among these escapees, we identified C19ORF66 and reveal that this transcript is protected from degradation by its 3' untranslated region (UTR). We then show that C19ORF66 is a potent KSHV restriction factor by impeding early viral gene expression, suggesting that its ability to escape viral cleavage may be an important component of the host response to viral infection. Collectively, our comparative approach is a powerful tool to pinpoint key regulators of the viral-host interplay and led us to uncover a novel KSHV regulator.IMPORTANCE Viruses are master regulators of the host gene expression machinery. This is crucial to promote viral infection and to dampen host immune responses. Many viruses, including herpesviruses, express RNases that reduce host gene expression through widespread mRNA decay. However, it emerged that some mRNAs escape this fate, although it has been difficult to determine whether these escaping transcripts benefit viral infection or instead participate in an antiviral mechanism. To tackle this question, we compared the effect of the herpesviral RNases on the human transcriptome and identified a cluster of transcripts consistently escaping degradation from all tested endonucleases. Among the protected mRNAs, we identified the transcript C19ORF66 and showed that it restricts Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. Collectively, these results provide a framework to explore how the control of RNA fate in the context of viral-induced widespread mRNA degradation may influence the outcome of viral infection.","output":"C19ORF66 Broadly Escapes Virus-Induced Endonuclease Cleavage and Restricts Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we aimed to investigate psychological well-being, depression, and stress among healthcare professionals and non-healthcare professionals in Turkey.

SARS-COV-2 spike polypeptides are primed by the host transmembrane TMPRSS2 protease, triggering virus fusion with epithelial cell membranes followed by an endocytotic internalisation process that bypasses normal endosomal activation of cathepsin-mediated innate immunity; viral co-opting of TMPRSS2 thus favors microbial survivability by attenuating host inflammatory responses. In contrast, most early hormone-dependent prostate cancers express TMPRSS2:ERG fusion genes arising from deletions that eliminate the TMPRSS2 coding region while juxtaposing its androgen-inducible promoter and the open reading frame of ERG, upregulating pro-inflammatory ERG while functionally disabling TMPRSS2. Moreover, inflammatory oxidative DNA damage selects for TMPRSS2:ERG-fused cancers, whereas patients treated with antiinflammatory drugs develop fewer of these fusion-dependent tumors. These findings imply that TMPRSS2 protects the prostate by enabling endosomal bypass of pathogens which could otherwise trigger inflammation-induced DNA damage that predisposes to TMPRSS2:ERG fusions. Hence, the high oncogenic selectability of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions may reflect a unique pro-inflammatory synergy between androgenic ERG gain-of-function and fusogenic TMPRSS2 loss-of-function, cautioning against the use of TMPRSS2-inhibitory drugs to prevent or treat early prostate cancer.","output":"The secret identities of TMPRSS2: Fertility factor, virus trafficker, inflammation moderator, prostate protector and tumor suppressor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report is an account of the authors' experiences as organizers of WiML's \\"Un-Workshop\\" event at ICML 2020.

Methods: We developed a simple likelihood-based framework to estimate the instantaneous asymptomatic proportion of infectious diseases. Taking the COVID-19 epidemics in Hong Kong as a case study, we applied the estimation framework to estimate the reported asymptomatic proportion (rAP) using the publicly available surveillance data. We divided the time series of daily cases into four stages of epidemics in Hong Kong by examining the persistency of the epidemic and compared the rAPs of imported cases and local cases at different stages. Results: As of July 31, 2020, there were two intermittent epidemics in Hong Kong. The first one was dominated by imported cases, accounting for 63.2% of the total cases, and the second one was dominated by local cases, accounting for 86.5% of the total cases. The rAP was estimated at 23.1% (95% CI: 10.8-39.7%) from January 23 to July 31, and the rAPs were estimated at 22.6% (95% CI: 11.1-38.9%) among local cases and 38.7% (95% CI: 9.0-72.0%) among imported cases. Our results showed that the rAPs of local cases were not significantly different between the two epidemics, but increased gradually during the first epidemic period. In contrast, the rAPs of imported cases in the latter epidemic period were significantly higher than that in the previous epidemic period. Conclusion: Hong Kong has a high rAP of imported COVID-19 cases and should continue to strengthen the detection and isolation of imported individuals to prevent the resurgence of the disease.","output":"Estimating the Instantaneous Asymptomatic Proportion With a Simple Approach: Exemplified With the Publicly Available COVID-19 Surveillance Data in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and AimsDescribed during World War II, continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) enables continuous administration of intrathecal drugs, offering several anesthetic options versus single shot technique, although underutilised.Here we present 4 cases of CSA performed for patients undergoing urgent upper abdominal and lower extremity orthopedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, observations of gaseous and particulate pollutants during the COVID-19 lockdown, as well as numerical modelling were integrated to explore the underlying causes of the nonlinear response of nitrate mitigation to nitric oxides (NO(x)) reduction. We found that, due to less NO(x) titration effect and the transition of ozone (O(3)) formation regime caused by NO(x) emissions reduction, a significant increase of O(3) (by  69%) was observed during the lockdown period, leading to higher atmospheric oxidizing capacity and facilitating the conversion from NO(x) to oxidation products like nitric acid (HNO(3)). It is proven by the fact that 26C61% reduction of NO(x) emissions only lowered surface HNO(3) by 2C3% in Hebi and Nanjing, eastern China. In addition, ammonia concentration in Hebi and Nanjing increased by 10% and 40% during the lockdown, respectively. Model results suggested that the increasing ammonia can promote the gas-particle partition and thus enhance the nitrate formation by up to 20%. The enhanced atmospheric oxidizing capacity together with increasing ammonia availability jointly promotes the nitrate formation, thereby partly offsetting the drop of NO(x).

EEG suppression was less likely in patients with cancer, preoperative alcohol, opioid or benzodiazepine consumption, and intraoperative nitrous oxide exposure. CONCLUSIONS Although EEG suppression was associated with increasing anaesthetic administration and comorbidities, the hypothesis that intraoperative EEG suppression is a predictor of postoperative mortality was only supported if it was coincident with low MAP.

A recent study revealed COVID-19 main protease (M(pro)) is responsible for the proteolytic mutation of this virus and is essential for its life cycle. Thus inhibition of this protease will eventually lead to the destruction of this virus. In-Silico Molecular docking was performed with the Native ligand and the 15 flavonoid based phytochemicals of Calendula officinals to check their binding affinity towards the COVID-19 main protease. Finally, the top 3 compounds with the highest affinity have been chosen for molecular dynamics simulation to analyses their dynamic properties and conformational flexibility or stability. In-Silico Docking showed that major phytochemicals of Calendula officinals i.e. rutin, isorhamnetin-3-O--D, calendoflaside, narcissin, calendulaglycoside B, calenduloside, calendoflavoside have better binding energy than the native ligand (inhibitor N3). MD simulation of 100 ns revealed that all the protease-ligand docked complexes are overall stable as compare to M(pro)-native ligand (inhibitor N3) complex. Overall, rutin and caledoflaside showed better stability, compactness, and flexibility. Our in silico (Virtual molecular docking and Molecular dynamics simulation) studies pointed out that flavonoid based phytochemicals of calendula (rutin, isorhamnetin-3-O--D, calendoflaside) may be highly effective for inhibiting M(pro) which is the main protease for SARS-CoV-2 causing the deadly disease COVID-19. Rutin is already used as a drug and the other two compounds can be made available for future use.

A long appreciated, yet elusively defined relationship exists between the lytic-latent switch and viral non-coding RNAs 3,4. Here, we identify miRNA-mediated inhibition of miRNA processing as a novel cellular mechanism that human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) exploits to disrupt mitochondrial architecture, evade intrinsic host defense and drive the latent-lytic switch. We demonstrate that virus-encoded miR-aU14 selectively inhibits the processing of multiple miR-30 family members by direct interaction with the respective pri-miRNA hairpin loops. Subsequent loss of miR-30 and activation of miR-30/p53/Drp1 axis triggers a profound disruption of mitochondrial architecture, which impairs induction of type I interferons and is necessary for both productive infection and virus reactivation. Ectopic expression of miR-aU14 was sufficient to trigger virus reactivation from latency thereby identifying it as a readily drugable master regulator of the herpesvirus latent-lytic switch. Our results show that miRNA-mediated inhibition of miRNA processing represents a generalized cellular mechanism that can be exploited to selectively target individual members of miRNA families. We anticipate that targeting miR-aU14 provides exciting therapeutic options for preventing herpesvirus reactivations in HHV-6-associated disorders like myalgic encephalitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long-COVID.","output":"Selective inhibition of microRNA processing by a herpesvirus-encoded microRNA triggers virus reactivation from latency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Changes on body composition have an impact on the survival of haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of the reduction of physical activity due to COVID19 lockdown on body composition in HD patients. METHOD: Retrospective and observational study including 149 HD patients. Nutritional and Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) data were recorded before and after COVID19 lockdown (mean of 148  20 days between determinations). RESULTS: Over the 49 days of COVID19 lockdown, we observed a decrease in normohydrated weight (NHW) of 1.01  3.59 kg mainly secondary to a reduction on total body water (TBW) 0.95  3.78 L (extracellular water 0.45  1.58 L and intracellular water 0.41  2.36 L). There was also a small loss on lean tissue index (LTI) of 0.28  2.42 kg/m(2), with an increase of fat tissue index (FTI) 0f 0.02  2.82 kg/m(2). Twenty-three patients presented COVID19 infection, of which 21 required admission (median of 10 [4-16] days). Patients who presented COVID19 were older (70.7  12.0 vs 64.9  16.6 years, NS) with higher Charlson index (7.48  2.77 vs 6.33  2.65, p = 0.07). Patients with COVID19 infection presented a greater loss on LTI (-1.18  3.15 bs -0.16  2.30 kg/m(2); p = 0.22), FTI (-0.41  3.38 vs 0.06  2.74 kg/m(2); p = 0.54); BMI (-1.49  2.14 vs -0.25  0.96 kg/m(2); p = < 0.01) and NHW (-4.00  6.33 vs -0.62  2.90 kg; p = < 0.01) compared to patients without COVID19 infection. The length of hospitalization was associated with greater loss of BMI and NHW, resulting, therefore, in overhydration. There also had lower serum phosphorus (3.6  0.8 vs 5.2  0.8 mg/dl; p = 0.01) and serum albumin (3.5  0.4 vs 4.0  0.1 g/dl; p = 0.01). Seven patients died during hospitalization. Deceased patients were older (78.4  6.6 vs 67.4  12.4 years; p = 0.01), presented higher comorbidity (estimated by Charlson index 10.0 [8.0-11.0] vs 6.5 [4.3-8.0]; p = 0.02) and were more overhydrated (3.4  3.6 vs 1.9  1.9; p = 0.34). Although not statistically different, they had lower LTI (10.4  2.1 vs 12.0  3.4 kg/m(2); p = 0.18) and lower serum albumin (3.4  0.6 vs 3.9  0.4 g/dl; p = 0.08) compared to survivors. Patients who survived COVID19 infection had longer hospitalization (57% were discharged between twelfth and forty third day; mean hospitalization 14.6  11.5 days). Deceased patients died within the first 12 days of hospitalization (6.8  4.1 days). CONCLUSION: COVID19 lockdown induced a weight reduction on HD patients due to decrease in total body water. COVID19 infection increased this reduction, inducing greater loss on lean and fat tissue composition. Moreover, COVID19 impact on body composition was magnified with the length of hospitalization.","output":"MO910 CHANGE IN BODY COMPOSITION MEASURED BY BIOIMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY AFTER COVID19 LOCKDOWN IN HAEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, disinfection practices and microbial load reduction have become even more important and rigorous.

There have been a lot of challenges to the majority of people, especially diabetic patients, which might result in an increased risk of developing complications and significant lifestyle changes, including physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and psychological distress. Objective This study aims to assess the impact of coronavirus disease lockdown on children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) mellitus in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Methods This is a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study which was conducted in pediatric patients, aged 18 years old, with type I diabetes, who were attending the endocrine clinic at the King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. A total of 250 patients were identified from the hospital databases, a total of 164 patients were included in the study, and one of the parents/guardians was interviewed through mobile phone after taking their consent. Results The medication compliance during the lockdown has significantly increased as the percentage of children who did not miss any dose of medications increased to 92.7% in comparison to 70.7% before the lockdown (P=0.000). Also, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)-related intensive care unit admission had significantly decreased during the lockdown (P=0.001). Regarding the number of consumed meals, it increased from 53.7% up to 68.3% before and during the lockdown period, respectively (P=0.005). In addition, there was no significant change in children's psychological health during the lockdown period (p= 0.123). Conclusion The study indicates that there was an increase in compliance to medications, a significant decrease in intensive care unit and emergency department admission due to hypo/hyperglycemia during the lockdown period.

This study compares the training outcome of single modality training with multimodality training of basic laparoscopic skills. METHODS Thirty-six medical students without laparoscopic experience performed six training sessions of 45 min each, one per day, in which four different basic tasks were trained. Participants in the single-modality group (S) (n = 18) practiced solely on a virtual reality (VR) simulator. Participants in the multimodality group (M) (n = 18) practiced on the same VR simulator (2x), a box trainer (2x), and an augmented reality simulator (2x). All participants performed a pre-test and post-test on the VR simulator (the four basic tasks + one additional basic task). Halfway through the training protocol, both groups performed a salpingectomy on the VR simulator as interim test. RESULTS Both groups improved their performance significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank, P < 0.05). The performances of group S and group M in the additional basic task and the salpingectomy did not differ significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, P > 0.05). Group S performed the four basic tasks in the post-test on the VR faster than group M (P  0.05), which can be explained by the fact that they were much more familiar with these tasks.

OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic with those of influenza patients in previous influenza seasons at the same hospital DESIGN: Admission rates, clinical measurements, and clinical outcomes from confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 1 and April 30, 2020, were compared with those from confirmed influenza cases in the previous five influenza seasons (8 months each) beginning September 1, 2014. SETTING: Large tertiary care teaching hospital in Boston, MA PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and influenza inpatients MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographics and medical history, mortality, incidence and duration of mechanical ventilation, incidences of vasopressor support and renal replacement therapy, and hospital and intensive care admissions. RESULTS: Data was abstracted from medical records of 1052 influenza patients and 582 COVID-19 patients. An average of 210 hospital admissions for influenza occurred per 8-month season compared to 582 COVID-19 admissions over 2 months. The median weekly number of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 17 (IQR: 4, 34) compared to a weekly median of 1 (IQR: 0, 2) influenza patient (p=0.001). COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation (31% vs 8%) and had significantly higher mortality (20% vs. 3%; p<0.001 for all). Relatively more COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation lacked pre-existing conditions compared with mechanically ventilated influenza patients (25% vs 4%, p<0.001). Pneumonia/ARDS secondary to the virus was the predominant cause of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients (94%) as opposed to influenza (56%).

Initially, these were characterized by a shortage of vaccine supply, and specific risk groups were prioritized. Once supply was guaranteed and vaccination coverage saturated, the focus shifted from risk groups to anti-vaxxers, the underaged population, and regions of low coverage. At the same time, hopes to reach herd immunity by vaccination campaigns were put into perspective by the emergence and spread of more contagious and aggressive viral variants. Particularly, concerns were raised that not all vaccines protect against the new-emerging variants. Methods and findingsA model designed to predict the effect of vaccination campaigns on the spread of viral variants is introduced. The model is a comprehensive extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 2.0 (http://covidsim.eu/). The model is age and spatially stratified, incorporates a finite (but arbitrary) number of different viral variants, and incorporates different vaccine products. The vaccines are allowed to differ in their vaccination schedule, vaccination rates, the onset of vaccination campaigns, and their effectiveness. These factors are also age and/or location dependent. Moreover, the effectiveness and the immunizing effect of vaccines are assumed to depend on the interaction of a given vaccine and viral variant. Importantly, vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Individuals can be immunized completely, only partially, or fail to be immunized against one or many viral variants. Not all individuals in the population are vaccinable. The model is formulated as a high-dimensional system of differential equations, which is implemented efficiently in the programming language Julia. As an example, the model was parameterized to reflect the epidemic situation in Germany until November 2021 and predicted the future dynamics of the epidemic under different interventions. In particular, without tightening contact reductions, a strong epidemic wave is predicted. At the current state, mandatory vaccination would be too late to have a strong effect on reducing the number of infections. However, it would reduce mortality. An emergency brake, i.e., an incidence-based stepwise lockdown would be efficient to reduce the number of infections and mortality. Furthermore, to specifically account for mobility between regions, the model was applied to two German provinces of particular interest: Saxony, which currently has the lowest vaccine rollout in Germany and high incidence, and Schleswig-Holstein, which has high vaccine rollout and low incidence. ConclusionsA highly sophisticated and flexible but easy-to-parameterize model for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is introduced. The model is capable of providing useful predictions for the COVID-19 pandemic, and hence provides a relevant tool for epidemic decision-making. The model can be adjusted to any country, to derive the demand for hospital and ICU capacities as well as economic collateral damages.","output":"Predicting the impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns - a flexible age-dependent, spatially-stratified predictive model, accounting for multiple viral variants and vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In response to the devastating effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, several vaccine prototypes have been developed, with the Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) platform being the first to receive emergency use authorization Although taken to market on an unprecedented timeline, the safety profile of the drug during clinical trials was shown to be favorable Shortly after release, reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrated a higher-than-average rate of anaphylaxis to the vaccine that has been the cause for concern for safety officials and the general public alike Here, we present a unique case of protracted anaphylaxis in a recipient of the BNT162b2 Case Summary: The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of multiple allergic reactions who presented with respiratory distress and hives after receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2, despite premedication with IV steroids and diphenhydramine The refractory nature of her reaction was demonstrated by edema of her tongue (visualized on nasolaryngoscopy), requiring an epinephrine infusion for nearly 3 days She was discharged from the hospital with instructions not to receive the second dose of the vaccine Conclusion: Although the exact etiology of anaphylaxis secondary to this messenger RNA-based vaccine is not completely clear, our literature search and review of the patient's course support either polyethylene glycol versus other excipient-related allergy as a possible cause Based on the protracted nature to our patient's anaphylaxis, critical care management for patients with a true anaphylactic reaction to BNT162b2 may require monitoring for an extended period of time","output":"Prolonged Anaphylaxis to Pfizer Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine: A Case Report and Mechanism of Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the learning environment at all levels of education.

Many computational methods have been proposed to predict disease-related genes, but how to make full use of multi-source biological data to enhance the ability of disease-gene prediction is still challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for predicting disease-related genes by using fast network embedding (PrGeFNE), which can integrate multiple types of associations related to diseases and genes. Specifically, we first constructed a heterogeneous network by using phenotype-disease, disease-gene, protein-protein and gene-GO associations; and low-dimensional representation of nodes is extracted from the network by using a fast network embedding algorithm. Then, a dual-layer heterogeneous network was reconstructed by using the low-dimensional representation, and a network propagation was applied to the dual-layer heterogeneous network to predict disease-related genes. Through cross-validation and newly added-association validation, we displayed the important roles of different types of association data in enhancing the ability of disease-gene prediction, and confirmed the excellent performance of PrGeFNE by comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we developed a web tool that can facilitate researchers to search for candidate genes of different diseases predicted by PrGeFNE, along with the enrichment analysis of GO and pathway on candidate gene set.

However, China lacks a quantitative assessment tool for care risk. Thus, we attempted to develop a care risk scale for homebound OPWD. METHODS: A care risk scale, with initially 18 items, was designed based on a systematic literature review, expert consultation, and a pilot study with 20 OPWD. The initial scale was validated among 1,045 homebound OPWD in Ningbo, China from November 1, 2020 to July 30, 2021. After removing three items that lacked discrimination power, the reliability and validity of the remaining 15 items was evaluated. Factor extraction was performed via principal axis factoring and Cattells scree plot analysis, with the resulting factors then being subjected to a varimax rotation. RESULTS: The final scale consisted of 15 items assessed on a 5-point Likert scale that loaded on to three different factors, including dementia symptoms (four items), family support (four items), and home environment (seven items). These three factors were found to explain 72.9% of the cumulative variance. The overall Cronbachs alpha for the final scale was 0.907. The correlation coefficients in the item-to-total analysis ranged from 0.511 to 0.662. CONCLUSION: The validation analysis indicated satisfactory reliability and validity of the 15-item scale for assessing care risk of homebound OPWD.

Our report was designed to investigate HCV prevalence and genotype, in addition to the clinical use of HCV core antigen (HCVcAg), within multiple HD facilities in Thailand. METHODS: This cross\\\\sectional report was investigated between January and June 2019. HCV infection was assessed by anti-HCV and confirmed active infection by measuring HCV RNA and HCVcAg. HCV genotype was determined by phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of NS5B region. RESULTS: Overall, 140 of 3,305 (4.2%) patients in 15 dialysis centers had anti-HCV positive. Among them, HCV RNA was further assessed in 93 patients and was detectable in 59 (63.4%) persons. Considering HCV viremia, HCVcAg measurement exhibited high accuracy (96.8%), sensitivity (94.9%) and specificity (100%) in comparison with HCV RNA testing. Moreover, individuals infected with HCV received a longer duration of dialysis vintage when compared to anti-HCV negative controls. The major sub-genotypes were 1a, 1b, 3a, 3b, 6f and 6n. Regarding phylogenetic analysis, there were 7 clusters of isolates with high sequence homology affecting 17 individuals, indicating possible HCV transmission within the same HD centers. CONCLUSIONS: HCV frequency and common sub-genotypes in HD centers were different from those found in the Thai general population. HCVcAg might be an alternate testing for viremia within resource-limited countries. Enhanced preventive practices, dialyzer reuse policy and better access to antiviral therapy are crucial for HCV micro-elimination within HD facilities.","output":"Prevalence and genotype distribution of hepatitis C virus within hemodialysis units in Thailand: role of HCV core antigen in the assessment of viremia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The purpose of this study is to determine the metaphorical perceptions of preschool teachers in regard with the concept of inclusive education.

Hypothesis: HBS is more advantageous than hypertonic saline in the treatment of calves with severe metabolic acidosis. Animals: Twenty\\\\eight dehydrated, inappetent calves with neonatal diarrhea. Methods: In 2 consecutive clinical studies, calves were initially treated with saline (5.85%; 5 mL/kg body weight [BW] over 4 minutes; study I: N = 16) or bicarbonate solution (8.4%; 10 mL/kg BW over 8 minutes; study II: N = 12), respectively, followed by oral administration of 3 L isotonic electrolyte solution 5 minutes after injection. Clinical and laboratory variables were monitored for 72 hours. Results: Treatment failed in 6 calves of study I and in 1 calf of study II as indicated by a deterioration of the general condition. All treatment failures had more severe metabolic acidosis compared with successfully treated calves before treatment. In the latter, rehydration was completed within 18 hours after injection; metabolic acidosis was corrected within 24 hours (study I) and 6 hours (study II) after injection. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Diarrheic calves with slight metabolic acidosis (base excess [BE] >?10 mM) can be treated successfully with hypertonic saline.

Accordingly, the respiratory tract has been the main research focus, with some other studies outlining the effects on the neurological, cardiovascular, and renal systems. However, concerning SARS-CoV-2 outcomes on skeletal muscle, scientific evidence is still not sufficiently strong to trace, treat and prevent possible muscle impairment due to the COVID-19. Simultaneously, there has been a considerable amount of studies reporting skeletal muscle damage in the context of COVID-19. Among the detrimental musculoskeletal conditions associated with the viral infection, the most commonly described are sarcopenia, cachexia, myalgia, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and Guillain-Barr Syndrome. Of note, the risk of developing sarcopenia during or after COVID-19 is relatively high, which poses special importance to the condition amid the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The yet uncovered mechanisms by which musculoskeletal injury takes place in COVID-19 and the lack of published methods tailored to study the correlation between COVID-19 and skeletal muscle hinder the ability of healthcare professionals to provide SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with an adequate treatment plan.

Our objective was to identify how pharmacists roles were portrayed in images on Twitter for World Pharmacists Day (WPD) 2020. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis was undertaken to evaluate the images of pharmacists on WPD. Tweets were included that had a photo or image, used 1 of 5 WPD hashtags and were posted between September 24 and 26, 2020. Thematic analysis was performed independently by 2 investigators. Tweets were categorized into 5 groups: 1) drug distribution roles, 2) patient care roles, 3) no described roles, 4) not professional/unprofessional roles and 5) not relevant. Subgroup analysis was performed for the users who posted the tweets. RESULTS: Of the 970 tweets analyzed, only 11% of the overall tweets portrayed the patient care roles of pharmacists, whereas 51% portrayed drug distribution roles and 29% did not describe any particular roles of pharmacists. These proportions were similar between subgroups of tweeters. DISCUSSION: WPD is intended to promote and advocate for the pharmacy profession. The results of our study show poor messaging of pharmacists roles and reflect a missed opportunity to showcase the full scope of pharmacy practice.

Congeneric model fit of a three-item scale cannot be tested with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) without additional assumptions because the number of degrees of freedom is equal to zero. A more rigorous tau-equivalent model, assuming equality of factor loadings can be tested instead. The objective of this study was to demonstrate this approach with an example of the psychometric study of the Polish version of the Three-Item Loneliness Scale (TILS), and to discuss the arising problems and possible solutions. There seems to be a high need for such analysis because currently, some properties of CFA make it an approach still predominant over Item Response Theory (IRT) models in the quality of life research.

Furthermore, multi-group CFAs provided support for strict measurement invariance of this model. To the Authors knowledge, it is the first practical application of a tau-equivalent model to testing the factorial validity of an ultra-short scale and probably the first empirical case of tau-equivalent measurement invariance in psychological literature in general. TILS showed good criterion validity and satisfactory reliability. Unidimensionality of three-item scales can be examined with a tau-equivalent model that has some favorable psychometric properties.

Although the overall fatality rate is low, there is significant mortality among hospitalized patients. There is limited information exploring the impact of Covid-19 in community hospital settings in ethnically diverse populations. We aimed to identify risk factors for Covid-19 mortality in our institution. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized in our institution for Covid 19 from March 1st to June 21st 2020. It comprised of 425 discharged patients and 245 expired patients. Information was extracted from our EMR which included demographics, presenting symptoms, and laboratory data. We propensity matched 245 expired patients with a concurrent cohort of discharged patients. Statistically significant covariates were applied in matching, which included age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The admission clinical attributes and laboratory parameters and outcomes were analyzed. Results. The mean age of the matched cohort was 66.9 years. Expired patients had a higher incidence of dyspnea (P < 0.001) and headache (0.031). In addition, expired patients had elevated CRP- hs (mg/dl)  123 (< .0001), SGOT or AST (IU/L)  54 (p < 0.001), SGPT or ALT (IU/L)  41 (p < 0.001), and creatinine (mg/dl)  1.135 (0.001), lower WBC counts (k/ul)  8.42 (0.009).

Applying the value-belief-norm theory and leaner regression analysis, we analysed whether the same determinants influenced pro-environmental behaviour in 2011 and 2020. The results revealed that the impact of determinants differed. In 2020, the main factor of pro-environmental behaviour was the perception of environmental problems but not self-transcendence values dimension. Furthermore, self-enhancement values and awareness of behavioural consequences negatively influenced pro-environmental behaviour in 2020.

It can accumulate okadaic acid (OA) and other toxins in its group, which makes it unsuitable for human consumption, producing harvesting bans to avoid intoxications. The duration of those bans depends in part on the depuration kinetics of the toxin in this species. In this work, this kinetics was studied by means of fitting different models to depuration data experimentally obtained, using naturally contaminated cockles. Cockles depurated OA faster than most other bivalve species studied. Models that include Michaelis-Menten kinetics describe the depuration better than those using a first order exponential decrease to describe the first (or the only) compartment. One-compartment models were not able to describe the final part of the depuration curve, in which OA was depurated very slowly. Therefore, two-compartment models were needed. Esters were depurated at a much faster rate than the free form of the toxin; however, no significant esterification was detected during the process. The slow depuration rate suggests that other bivalve species could be used as sentinels to monitor cockle populations, but caution should be taken when toxin concentrations are very high.","output":"Okadaic Acid Depuration from the Cockle Cerastoderma edule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious viral contamination of the hospital environment is poorly understood. METHODS: housed in a dedicated COVID-19 unit at an academic medical center. Environmental samples were taken within 24 hours of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test (day 1) and again on days 3, 6, 10 and 14. Patients were excluded if samples were not obtained on days 1 and 3. Surface samples were obtained with flocked swabs pre-moistened with viral transport media from seven locations inside (bedrail, sink, medical prep area, room computer, exit door handle) and outside the room (nursing station computer). RNA extractions and RT-PCR were completed on all samples. RT-PCR positive samples were used to inoculate Vero E6 cells for 7 days and monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE). If CPE was observed, RT-PCR was used to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We enrolled 14 patients (Table 1, Patient Characteristics) between October 2020 and May 2021. A total of 243 individual samples were obtained C 97 on day 1, 98 on day 3, 34 on day 6, and 14 on day 10. Overall, 18 (7.4%) samples were positive via RT-PCR C 9 from bedrails (12.9%), 4 from sinks (11.4%), 4 from room computers (11.4%) and 1 from the exit door handle (2.9%). Notably, all medical prep and nursing station computer samples were negative (Figure 1). Of the 18 positive samples, 5 were from day 1, 10 on day 3, 1 on day 6 and 2 on day 10. Only one sample, obtained from the bedrails of a symptomatic patient with diarrhea and a fever on day 3, was culture-positive (Figure 2). Table 1. Patient Characteristics [Image: see text] Figure 1. Proportion of RT-PCR Positive Samples by Sample Day and Location [Image: see text] Figure 2.

As expected, more samples were considered contaminated via RT-PCR compared to cell culture, supporting the conclusion that the discovery of genetic material in the environment is not an indicator of contamination with live infectious virus. More studies including RT-PCR and viral cell culture assays are needed to determine the significance of discovering SARS-CoV-2 RNA versus infectious virus in the clinical environment.

METHODS: This was a prospective caseCcontrol study. Forty-six patients who had COVID-19 were successfully treated, and 38 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Fundus photography was taken using fundus fluorescein angiography (FA; Visucam 500; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany). Retinal vascular caliber was analyzed with IVAN, a semi-automated retinal vascular analyzer (Nicole J. Ferrier, College of Engineering, Fundus Photography Reading Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA). Central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE), and arteryCvein ratio (AVR) were compared between groups. RESULTS: The mean age was 37.8  9.5 years in the COVID-19 group (n = 46) and 40  8 years in the control group (n = 38) (p = 0.45). The mean CRAE was 181.56  6.40 in the COVID-19 group and 171.29  15.06 in the control group (p = 0.006).

Patient characteristics, RR practices, and hospital context and/or mechanism influence post-RR outcomes. We aim to describe and compare RR function and outcomes within our institution's multiple sites. METHODS: We conducted a 3-year retrospective study to compare RR use, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between our hospital's central campus (CC) and 2 satellite campuses (SCs). RR training and procedures are uniform across all campuses. RESULTS: Among the 2935 RRs reviewed, 1816 occurred during index admissions at the CC and 405 occurred at SCs. CC, when compared with SCs, had higher age at RR (3.2 years vs 1.4 years), prevalence of complex chronic conditions (62.4% vs 34.4%), surgical complications (20.2% vs 5%), severity of illness, and risk of mortality (P < .001). CC had higher daytime RR activations, longer time from admission to RR, and more activations by nurses (P < .001). Respiratory diagnoses were most prevalent uniformly, but cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic diagnoses were higher at CC (P < .001). Cardiac and/or respiratory arrests during RR and transfers to the ICU were similar. Cardiorespiratory interventions post-RR, hospital length of stay, and mortality were higher and ICU stay was shorter (P < .01) in the CC. Outcomes were mainly affected by patient characteristics and not RR factors on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Patient illness severity, RR characteristics, and outcomes are significantly different in our multisite locations. Outcomes are predominantly affected by patient severity and not RR characteristics.

Chronic diseases include a broad range of diseases that can be communicable or non-communicable. Chronic diseases are often associated with modifications of normal physiological levels of various analytes that are routinely measured in serum and other body fluids, as well as pathological findings, such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Identification of at-risk populations, early diagnosis, and prediction of prognosis play a major role in preventing or reducing the burden of chronic diseases. Biomarkers are tools that are used by health professionals to aid in the identification and management of chronic diseases. Biomarkers can be diagnostic, predictive, or prognostic. Several individual or grouped biomarkers have been used successfully in the diagnosis and prediction of certain chronic diseases, however, it is generally accepted that a more sophisticated approach to link and interpret various biomarkers involved in chronic disease is necessary to improve our current procedures. In order to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased coverage of the literature, first a primary frame of the manuscript (title, headings and subheadings) was drafted by the authors working on this paper. Second, based on the components drafted in the preliminary skeleton a comprehensive search of the literature was performed using the PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Multiple keywords related to the topic were used. Out of screened papers, only 190 papers, which are the most relevant, and recent articles were selected to cover the topic in relation to etiological mechanisms of different chronic diseases, the most recently used biomarkers of chronic diseases and finally the advances in the applications of multivariate biomarkers of chronic diseases as statistical and clinically applied tool for the early diagnosis of chronic diseases was discussed. Recently, multivariate biomarkers analysis approach has been employed with promising prospect. A brief discussion of the multivariate approach for the early diagnosis of the most common chronic diseases was highlighted in this review. The use of diagnostic algorithms might show the way for novel criteria and enhanced diagnostic effectiveness inpatients with one or numerous non-communicable chronic diseases. The search for new relevant biomarkers for the better diagnosis of patients with non-communicable chronic diseases according to the risk of progression, sickness, and fatality is ongoing. It is important to determine whether the newly identified biomarkers are purely associations or real biomarkers of underlying pathophysiological processes. Use of multivariate analysis could be of great importance in this regard.","output":"Biomarkers of non-communicable chronic disease: an update on contemporary methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cloud computing enables remote execution of users tasks. The pervasive adoption of cloud computing in smart cities services and applications requires timely execution of tasks adhering to Quality of Services (QoS).

Maximizing the performance and minimizing the energy in a cloud data center is challenging. In this paper, we propose a performance and energy optimization bi-objective algorithm to tradeoff the contradicting performance and energy objectives. An evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization is for the first time proposed using system performance counters. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a realistic cloud dataset in a cloud computing environment.

Making use of a structural estimation model of labour market dynamics, we estimate differences in market power that workers face depending on their sector of activity, their age, sex, location and educational level. In particular, we show that differences in cross-sectional market power are significant and higher than variations over the ten-year time span of our data. In contrast to findings of labour market power in developed countries such as the US, we document significant market power of employers in Peru vis-\\\\\`a-vis the tertiary educated workforce, regardless of age and sector. In contrast, for the primary educated workforce, market power seems to be high in (private) services and manufacturing. For secondary educated workers, only the mining sector stands out as moderately more monopsonistic than the rest of the labour market. We also show that at least for the 2010s, labour market power declined in Peru. We contrast these findings with similar estimates obtained for the United States where we are able to show that increases in labour market power are particularly acute in certain sectors, such as agriculture and entertainment and recreational services, as well as in specific geographic areas where these sectors are dominant. Moreover, we show that for the US, the labour market power has gradually increased over the past ten years, in line with the general rise in inequality. Importantly, we show that the pervasive gender pay gap cannot be linked to differential market power as men face higher labour market power than women. We also discuss possible reasons for these findings, including for the differences of labour market power across skill levels.

Understanding the accuracy and limitations of statistical methods to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0, in the context of emerging epidemics is therefore vital to ensure appropriate interpretation of results and the subsequent implications for control efforts. METHODS: Using simulated epidemic data we assess the performance of 7 commonly-used statistical methods to estimate R0 as they would be applied in a real-time outbreak analysis scenario - fitting to an increasing number of data points over time and with varying levels of random noise in the data. Method comparison was also conducted on empirical outbreak data, using Zika surveillance data from the 2015-2016 epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean. RESULTS: We find that most methods considered here frequently over-estimate R0 in the early stages of epidemic growth on simulated data, the magnitude of which decreases when fitted to an increasing number of time points. This trend of decreasing bias over time can easily lead to incorrect conclusions about the course of the epidemic or the need for control efforts. CONCLUSIONS: We show that true changes in pathogen transmissibility can be difficult to disentangle from changes in methodological accuracy and precision in the early stages of epidemic growth, particularly for data with significant over-dispersion. As localised epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 take hold around the globe, awareness of this trend will be important for appropriately cautious interpretation of results and subsequent guidance for control efforts.","output":"A comparative analysis of statistical methods to estimate the reproduction number in emerging epidemics with implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 worldwide pandemic has caused the world to stop.

In March 2020, the social distancing caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic imposed several challenges to be faced related to the migration from classroom teaching to remote teaching: technological (and pedagogical) training of the teaching staff, support for students, training of the staff and the adequacy of the Information technology infrastructure. In this work, we will deal with faculty development. Although there was no institutionalized faculty development structure, a group of teachers involved in the various training courses promoted since 2017 by the institution, under the Deanery of Undergraduate coordination, was responsible for training to help teachers to use the institutional platforms. Individual training was also proposed to meet specific needs. Following the first bare step of familiarization with the platforms, the next phase was to raise the need for qualification of remote activities in the teaching staff through innovative teaching methodologies. Maintaining remote education led to the expansion of the group of teachers responsible for supporting remote activities. Furthermore, post-graduate (masters and doctoral students) acted as monitors from the different courses of the university. They were selected to assist teachers individually to make the appropriate use of teaching strategies and technological platforms.

Oral consent was obtained prior to the questionnaire survey. The information collected in the survey included demographic characteristics, psychological symptoms, COVID-19-related information, and demands for psychological education and interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between related factors and mental health status. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was 3.4% and 22.8%, respectively. The dominant epidemic-related factors were having confirmed cases in the community (odds ratio [OR], 2.75, 95% CI, 2.37-3.19) and having confirmed friends (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.69-3.52) for the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Nevertheless, major traditional risk factors such as general or poor health status and always drinking alcohol were still the dominant factors associated with the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Overall, 67.3% and 26.8% workers reported desire for psychological education and interventions, respectively. LIMITATIONS: All assessments were self-reported, resulting in a risk of method bias.

Patients were divided into two groups according to their PAS scores as with dysphagia (n = 15) and without dysphagia (n = 11). Active range of motion (AROM) and muscle strength were measured. Proprioception measurement of the cervical region was performed with a laser marker placed on the head of the patients, and the deviation from the middle target was noted in centimeters. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups in terms of gender, age, height, weight, diagnosis, AROM, and the muscle strength of the cervical region (p > 0.05).

While smoking in pregnancy has declined over time, it remains consistently higher in women with lower socioeconomic circumstances. Furthermore, fewer women in this group will successfully quit during pregnancy. AIM: This study explores the barriers to smoking cessation experienced by socially disadvantaged pregnant women and investigates how interactions with health providers can influence their smoking cessation journey. METHODS: Women (either pregnant or birthed in the previous 10 years, who smoked or quit smoking in pregnancy) were recruited from a metropolitan public hospital antenatal clinic in South Australia and community organisations in surrounding suburbs. Seventeen women participated in qualitative semi-structured small focus groups or interviews. The focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. FINDINGS: Four interconnected themes were identified: 1) smoking embedded in womens challenging lives and pregnancies, 2) cyclic isolation and marginalisation, 3) feeling disempowered, and 4) autonomy and self-determination. Themes 3 and 4 are characterised as being two sides of a single coin in that they coexist simultaneously and are inseparable. A key finding is a strong unanimous desire for smoking cessation in pregnancy but women felt they did not have the necessary support from health providers or confidence and self-efficacy to be successful. CONCLUSION: Women would like improvements to antenatal care that increase health practitioners understanding of the social and contextual healthcare barriers faced by women who smoke in pregnancy. They seek improved interventions from health providers to make informed choices about smoking cessation and would like women-centred care. Women feel that with greater support, more options for cessation strategies and consistency and encouragement from health providers they could be more successful at antenatal smoking cessation.

The result analysis was performed descriptively, in four analytical categories. RESULTS: The publishing involved aspects related to insufficient personal protective equipment, feelings of fear and stigma, the need for psychological and psychiatric support and the possibility of post-outbreak mental disorders. CONCLUSION: All mentioned aspects have a direct impact on the mental health of professionals, demanding the creation of strategies that minimize the emotional burnout of workers, considering that each country and culture reacts differently to the disease.","output":"Mental health of healthcare professionals in China during the new coronavirus pandemic: an integrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel and slightly shocking results of semi-analytic modelling for the outbreak of 3rd wave of Covid-19 pandemic in a key affected countries with low level of vaccination (India and Russia) are presented in the current analytical research.

Positive news are that key countries suffered from pandemic such as USA, France, Great Britain, Turkey, and Argentina should be excluded from our analysis as successful cases of countries with sufficient level of vaccination provided by their governments for citiziens of that countries;nonetheless, Brazil should be excluded insofar by obvious reason that most of the statistic data for Brazil is questionable.

Several factors especially the impaired immune response, heightened inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state contribute to the increased disease severity. However, there are many contentious issues about which the evidence is rather limited. There are some theoretical concerns about the effects of different anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. Similarly, despite the recognition of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), and the role of ACE2 in lung injury; there are conflicting results with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in these patients. Management of patients with diabetes in times of restrictions on mobility poses some challenges and novel approaches like telemedicine can be useful.

Any disturbance in the regulation process can lead to neurological developmental diseases, such as autism and schizophrenia. Histone variants are important components of epigenetic regulation. The function and mechanisms of the macroH2A (mH2A) histone variant during brain development are unknown. Here, we show that deletion of the mH2A isoform mH2A1.2 interferes with neural stem cell differentiation in mice. Deletion of mH2A1.2 affects neurodevelopment, enhances neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, and reduces NPC differentiation in the developing mouse brain. mH2A1.2-deficient mice exhibit autism-like behaviors, such as deficits in social behavior and exploratory abilities. We identify NKX2.2 as an important downstream effector gene and show that NKX2.2 expression is reduced after mH2A1.2 deletion and that overexpression of NKX2.2 rescues neuronal abnormalities caused by mH2A1.2 loss. Our study reveals that mH2A1.2 reduces the proliferation of neural progenitors and enhances neuronal differentiation during embryonic neurogenesis and that these effects are at least in part mediated by NKX2.2. These findings provide a basis for studying the relationship between mH2A1.2 and neurological disorders.","output":"MacroH2A1.2 deficiency leads to neural stem cell differentiation defects and autism-like behaviors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic posed great challenges for teachers and students, as teaching had to take place despite the restriction of classroom teaching. For attendance lessons and events with patient contact alternatives had to be arranged at short notice between mid-March and the beginning of the semester in mid-April. OBJECTIVE: Description of the concept and implementation in the student teaching at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Medical Center Mainz in complete digital form in spring 2020. PRESENTATION OF CONCEPT: Lectures, examination course and practical training in ophthalmology take place in the 5th and 6th semester of the study of human medicine. The basis of the new concept were the former course curricula. Implemented concepts included a complete revision and implementation of lectures as video podcasts, examination videos, online examination conferences, interactive patient cases, narrated videos of surgery, anamnesis videos of patients and the design of the virtual patient room, a live online practice with presentation and examination of patients including transmission of the slit-lamp image to reproduce anterior and posterior segment examination. An evaluation showed a very positive reception of the new concept by students. DISCUSSION: Within a tight timeframe of 4 weeks a complete revision of the ophthalmology course was achieved. The implementation was time-consuming, with the largest share in the media production of examination videos, interactive patient cases and video podcasts of the lectures. We consider a reduction of classroom teaching for parts of the learning objectives that can be represented by such videos to be possibly useful. An independent digital appropriation of such content may enable a more productive learning environment in face-to-face teaching.","output":"Umsetzung eines digitalen Semesters Augenheilkunde w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared complement fixation (CF) for the measurement of antibodies against influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (para-1, para-2, and para-3) with 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA kits, A and B). The IgG ELISA kits compared very well with each other except for the influenza A and B IgG ELISAs. The IgG ELISAs, in general, did not agree with CF In contrast, the IgM ELISAs compared well with CF and each other except for the consensus parainfluenza panel from ELISA B. The poor agreement of the IgG ELISAs with the CF test can be explained by the increased sensitivity of the ELISAs and differences between CF antigens and the ELISA antigens. The influenza A and influenza B ELISA antigens differed between both kits, which may explain their poor agreement. The ELISA is a suitable replacement for CF, providing greater sensitivity, isotype specificity, and ease of use.","output":"Comparison of complement fixation with two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of antibodies to respiratory viral antigens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is widespread concern that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of child maltreatment. However, reports in the scientific literature documenting rates of child maltreatment during this period are scarce. This study was designed to explore whether the incidence of child maltreatment among patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients of all ages presenting to a pediatric Emergency Department trauma center, who also had a child abuse report filing or a sentinel injury diagnosis related to their index visit. All such patients who presented to this institution from March through July of 2017 through 2020 were included in the study. RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated an increase in the incidence of child maltreatment in May and June of 2020 and that there was an overall shift in distribution of types of child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant increase in the proportion of emotional/psychological abuse (2.52 % before the pandemic to 7.00 % during the pandemic, p &#8804; 0.0001) and non-medical neglect (31.5%-40.0%, p &#8804; 0.0001).

The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. METHODS: We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education.

Since then, all hospitals have required a complete restructuring of their usual facilities and the treatments provided. Our goal was to detail the remodeling of a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze pitfalls to avoid increasing surgical department burdens. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data affecting patients during their admission in our institution during March 2020. Data from general admission, intensive care units, and elective and emergency surgeries were collected and analyzed. All patients who underwent a surgical procedure were reviewed to elucidate limitations in the deployment of the hospital transformation to a COVID-19 hospital. RESULTS: A total of 688 patients have been treated in our institution. Of those, 186 required intensive care. More than 120 new intensive care beds have been created during this period, and a decrease in elective surgeries of more than 75% was observed. Inadvertent COVID-19 patients accounted for 70%. Thirty percent of the patients who underwent surgery while infected with COVID-19 died in our institution. CONCLUSIONS: The complete reorganization of surgical departments will be requested during the outbreak and adaptive solutions are needed in order to avoid increased mortality rates and infection among patients and to promote maximal optimization of surgical spaces.

Using daily data from January 2015 to December 2020 and using both endogenous and exogenous structural breaks, we examine the behavior of the related series before and during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of investigating whether the degree of persistence has changed since the onset of COVID-19. We found that precious metals and oil exhibit long memory and are mean reverting regardless of the sample considered as the fractional parameter d < 0.5. However, when structural breaks are taken into consideration, an increase in persistence is found during the COVID-19 as compared to the period before it. In addition, the fractionally cointegrated vector autoregressive (FCVAR) model of Johansen and Nielsen (2010, 2012) is used to examine the existence of long-run relationship among precious metals and oil price. We find the integrated parameters at d < 0.5 for all samples except for the pre-COVID-19 sample. This highlights that the FCVAR is a better fit for the full sample and the COVID-19 and the COVID-19 pandemic period sub-samples, as the fractional parameter is d < 0.5 while the CVAR model is better fit for the pre-COVID-19 period where d> 0.5. Both cointegration techniques alongside the parameter stability tests lend support to the existence of a persistence and stable long-run relationships among the series irrespective of the sample period considered.

Emerging or reemerging diseases are those that (re)occur in regions, groups or hosts that were previously free from these diseases: dengue virus; chikungunya virus; Zika virus; West Nile fever and malaria. In Europe, these infections are mostly imported; however, due to the presence of competent mosquitoes and the number of trips both to and from endemic areas, these pathogens are potentially emergent or re-emergent. Present and future climatic conditions, as well as meteorological, environmental and demographic aspects are risk factors for the distribution of different vectors and/or diseases. This review aimed to identify and analyze the existing literature on the transmission of mosquito borne diseases and those factors potentially affecting their transmission risk of them in six southern European countries with similar environmental conditions: Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In addition, we would identify those factors potentially affecting the (re)introduction or spread of mosquito vectors. This task has been undertaken with a focus on the environmental and climatic factors, including the effects of climate change. We undertook a systematic review of the vectors, diseases and their associations with climactic and environmental factors in European countries of the Mediterranean region. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and used explicit and systematic methods to identify, select and critically evaluate the studies which were relevant to the topic. We identified 1302 articles in the first search of the databases. Of those, 160 were selected for full-text review. The final data set included 61 articles published between 2000 and 2017.39.3% of the papers were related with dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus or their vectors. Temperature, precipitation and population density were key factors among others. 32.8% studied West Nile virus and its vectors, being temperature, precipitation and NDVI the most frequently used variables. Malaria have been studied in 23% of the articles, with temperature, precipitation and presence of water indexes as the most used variables.

Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DR?1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpesvirus 7, (HHV7), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci outside the HLA associated with viral antibody response (P < 5.0  10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, and CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for HHV7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P = 5.0  10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P = 1.1  10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P = 1.1  10-8 EBV nuclear antigen.

A virus is a unique cellular parasite, dependent upon the host for reproduction and nourishment in a variety of different ways. Since, as with the other types of parasites, the host and the parasite have necessarily evolved together. It is a distortion to consider the resistance of the host, without considering the evolutionary steps in the development of this extreme form of parasitism; therefore, this chapter reviews some of the ideas put forward about host-agent interactions in plants as well as in animals. The importance of genes in regulating the resistance to disease, including parasites and parasitoids, is apparent if the disease is considered to be an important evolutionary force. The selective effects of viruses have not yet been adequately studied. Continued attempts to find a correlation between the different blood groups and differing severity of smallpox infection clearly searched for selective forces, but the results were inconclusive. Most of the knowledge of genetic resistance to virus disease rests on the study of resistance to selected agents in various inbred strains of mice and chickens, rather than on any knowledge of the effects of genetic resistance in a natural heterozygous population. The increasing frequency, however, with which genetic resistance is found, is in itself an evidence that these genes are important in natural outbred populations. In addition, there are increasing numbers of virus diseases, in which the viral agent seems to be inherited in a mendelian fashion.","output":"Genetics of Resistance of Animals to Viruses: I.

Screening, early diagnosis, and surgical techniques might increase patients survival, leading to a rise in the health-related consequences of anti-neoplastic therapies, such as cardiotoxicity following anthracycline treatments. Alongside conventional therapies, physical activity seems to reduce treatment side effects, improving quality of life either after a breast cancer diagnosis or in the early steps post-surgery. This review offers a general framework for the role of anthracycline in the physio-pathological mechanisms of cardiotoxicity and the effect of exercise on cancer treatment side effects. Moreover, we propose the type and the timing of exercise to better assist patients and reduce the pressure on the health care system in breast cancer patients undergoing anthracycline. ABSTRACT: The increase in breast cancer (BC) survival has determined a growing survivor population that seems to develop several comorbidities and, specifically, treatment-induced cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially those patients treated with anthracyclines. Indeed, it is known that these compounds act through the induction of supraphysiological production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which appear to be central mediators of numerous direct and indirect cardiac adverse consequences. Evidence suggests that physical exercise (PE) practised before, during or after BC treatments could represent a viable non-pharmacological strategy as it increases heart tolerance against many cardiotoxic agents, and therefore improves several functional, subclinical, and clinical parameters. At molecular level, the cardioprotective effects are mainly associated with an exercise-induced increase of stress response proteins (HSP60 and HSP70) and antioxidant (SOD activity, GSH), as well as a decrease in lipid peroxidation, and pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio. Moreover, this protection can potentially be explained by a preservation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform distribution. Despite this knowledge, it is not clear which type of exercise should be suggested in BC patient undergoing anthracycline treatment. This highlights the lack of special guidelines on how affected patients should be managed more efficiently. This review offers a general framework for the role of anthracyclines in the physio-pathological mechanisms of cardiotoxicity and the potential protective role of PE. Finally, potential exercise-based strategies are discussed on the basis of scientific findings.","output":"The Beneficial Role of Physical Exercise on Anthracyclines Induced Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the coming weeks and months SARS-CoV-2 may ravage countries with weak health systems and populations disproportionately affected by HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and other infectious diseases.

Methods In November 2020, we conducted the LOST in Lombardia survey, a telephone-based cross-sectional study on a sample of 4,400 individuals representative of the general population aged 65 years from Lombardy region, Northern Italy. Individuals with diagnosed tinnitus and/or hearing loss were asked whether their conditions had improved or deteriorated in 2020 compared to 2019. Results Overall, 8.1% of older adults reported a diagnosis of tinnitus and 10.5% of hearing loss. In 2020 compared to 2019, among individuals with tinnitus, those with increasing severity (5.0%) were similar to those decreasing it (5.3%). Among individuals with hearing loss, more people reported an increase (13.6%) than a decrease (3.2%) in their disease severity. No individual with a diagnosis in 2020 of tinnitus (n = 6) or hearing loss (n = 13) had COVID-19. The incidence of tinnitus was lower in 2020 (rate: 14.8 per 10,000 person-years) than in previous years (rate in 1990C2019: 36.0 per 10,000 person-years;p = 0.026). There was no change in the incidence of hearing loss (p = 0.134). Conclusions In this large representative sample of older adults, on average neither COVID-19 confinement nor SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to increase the severity or incidence of tinnitus.

AIM: To investigate the risk factors associated with ARDS in COVID-19, and compare the characteristics of ARDS between Wuhan and outside Wuhan in China. METHODS: Patients were enrolled from two medical centers in Hunan Province. A total of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19, who had either been discharged or had died by March 15, 2020, were included in this study. We retrospectively collected the patients clinical data, and the factors associated with ARDS were compared by the 2 test, Fishers exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Significant variables were chosen for the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. In addition, literature in the PubMed database was reviewed, and the characteristics of ARDS, mortality, and biomarkers of COVID-19 severity were compared between Wuhan and outside Wuhan in China. RESULTS: Compared with the non-ARDS group, patients in the ARDS group were significantly older, had more coexisting diseases, dyspnea, higher D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein. In univariate logistic analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS included older age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04), coexisting diseases (OR = 3.94), dyspnea (OR = 17.82), dry/moist rales (OR = 9.06), consolidative/mixed opacities (OR = 2.93), lymphocytes (OR = 0.68 for high lymphocytes compared to low lymphocytes), D-dimer (OR = 1.41), albumin (OR = 0.69 for high albumin compared to low albumin), alanine aminotransferase (OR = 1.03), aspartate aminotransferase (OR = 1.02), LDH (OR = 1.02), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.04) and procalcitonin (OR = 17.01). In logistic multivariate analysis, dyspnea (adjusted OR = 27.10), dry/moist rales (adjusted OR = 9.46), and higher LDH (adjusted OR = 1.02) were independent risk factors. The literature review showed that patients in Wuhan had a higher incidence of ARDS, higher mortality rate, and higher levels of biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity than those outside Wuhan in China.

RESULTS: Ten topics were common across U.S. counties during the 2018C2019 influenza season. In the overall analyses, two of these topics (i.e., Vaccine Science Matters and Big Pharma) were associated with attitudes and behaviors. The topic concerning vaccine science in November-February was positively correlated with attitudes in February-March, r = 0.09, BF(10) = 3. Moreover, among respondents who did not discuss the influenza vaccine with family and friends, the topic about vaccine fraud and children in November-February was negatively correlated with attitudes in February-March and with vaccination in February-March, and April-May (rs = ?0.18 to ?0.25, BF(10) = 4C146).

To this end, we compiled a novel dataset of annotated meeting transcripts, including human rephrasing of action items. We use state-of-the-art supervised text generation techniques and establish a strong baseline based on BART and UniLM (two pretrained transformer models). Due to the nature of natural speech, language is often broken and incomplete and the task is shown to be harder than an analogous task over email data. Particularly, we show that the baseline models can be greatly improved once models are provided with additional information. We compare two approaches: one incorporating features extracted by coreference-resolution. Additional annotations are used to train an auxiliary model to detect the relevant context in the text. Based on the systematic human evaluation, our best models exhibit near-human-level rephrasing capability on a constrained subset of the problem. ? 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics","output":"Automatic Rephrasing of Transcripts-based Action Items"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on disability, an under-researched area of inequality, and subjective well-being. According to social production function theory, people with a disability do not have the same opportunities as people without disabilities to obtain resources, instrumental goals, and ultimately subjective well-being.

The social system of a country (macro level) also shapes the gap in subjective well-being between both groups. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the gap in subjective well-being between people with and without disabilities. How is this gap linked to social participation and labour market integration, and how does the welfare-state regime shape the gap in subjective well-being between people with and without disabilities? The core of this research are multilevel analyses of cumulative European Social Survey data from 31 European countries. The results reveal that people with disabilities show significantly lower subjective well-being than people without disabilities. Welfare-state regimes have an effect on this gap, with social-democratic (and family-oriented) Nordic countries performing best in providing equal living conditions for people with and without disabilities.","output":"How the Welfare-State Regime Shapes the Gap in Subjective Well-Being Between People With and Without Disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adolescents is common and debilitating. In contrast to adult PTSD, relatively little is known about the neurobiology of adolescent PTSD, nor about how current treatments may alter adolescent neurodevelopment to allow recovery from PTSD. Improving our understanding of biological mechanisms of adolescent PTSD, taken in the context of neurodevelopment, is crucial for developing novel and personalized treatment approaches. In this review, we highlight prevailing constructs of PTSD and current findings on these domains in adolescent PTSD. Notably, little data exist in adolescent PTSD for prominent adult PTSD constructs, including threat learning and attentional threat bias. Most work to date has examined general threat processing, emotion regulation, and their neural substrates. These studies suggest that adolescent PTSD, while phenomenologically similar to adult PTSD, shows unique neurodevelopmental substrates that may impair recovery but could also be targeted in the context of adolescent neuroplasticity to improve outcomes. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data suggest abnormal frontolimbic development compared with typically developing youths, a pattern that may differ from resilient youths. Whether current treatments such as trauma-focused psychotherapy engage these targets and restore healthy neurodevelopment remains an open question. We end our review by highlighting emerging areas and knowledge gaps that could be addressed to better characterize the biology underlying adolescent PTSD. Emerging studies in computational modeling of decision making, caregiver-related transmission of traumatic stress, and other areas may offer new targets that could harness adolescent neurobehavioral plasticity to improve resilience and recovery for some of our most vulnerable youths.","output":"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and the Developing Adolescent Brain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A first report of unveiling the fractality and fractal nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) responsible for the pandemic disease widely known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is presented The fractal analysis of the electron microscopic and atomic force microscopic images of 40 coronaviruses (CoV), by the normal and differential box-counting method, reveals its fractal structure The generalised dimension indicates the multifractal nature of the CoV The higher value of fractal dimension and lower value of Hurst exponent (H) suggest higher complexity and greater roughness The statistical analysis of generalised dimension and H is understood through the notched box plot The study on CoV clusters also confirms its fractal nature The scale-invariant value of the box-counting fractal dimension of CoV yields a value of 1 820 The study opens the possibility of exploring the potential of fractal analysis in the medical diagnosis of SARS CoV-2","output":"Is SARS CoV-2 a Multifractal?-Unveiling the Fractality and Fractal Structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, healthcare professionals worldwide abruptly shifted from an in-person to a telehealth service delivery model.

With limited healthcare and challenging living conditions, people living in poverty may be particularly susceptible to endemic and emerging diseases. Similarly, wildlife is impacted by human influences, including pathogen sharing, especially for species in close contact with people and domesticated animals. Here we investigate human and animal contacts and human health in a community living around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. We used contact and health survey data to identify opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, focusing mostly on people and the endangered mountain gorilla. We conducted a survey with background questions and self-reported diaries to investigate 100 participants health, such as symptoms and behaviours, and contact patterns, including direct contacts and sightings over a week. Contacts were revealed through networks, including humans, domestic, peri-domestic, and wild animal groups for 1) contacts seen in the week of background questionnaire completion, and 2) contacts seen during the diary week. Participants frequently felt unwell during the study, reporting from one to 10 disease symptoms at different intensity levels, with severe symptoms comprising 6.4% of the diary records and tiredness and headaches the most common symptoms. After human-human contacts, direct contact with livestock and peri-domestic animals were the most common. The contact networks were moderately connected and revealed a preference in contacts within the same taxon and within their taxa groups. Sightings of wildlife were much more common than touching. However, despite contact with wildlife being the rarest of all contact types, one direct contact with a gorilla with a timeline including concerning participant health symptoms was reported. When considering all interaction types, gorillas mostly exhibited intra-species contact, but were found to interact with five other species, including people and domestic animals. Our findings reveal a local human population with recurrent symptoms of illness in a location with intense exposure to factors that can increase pathogen transmission, such as direct contact with domestic and wild animals and proximity among animal species. Despite significant biases and study limitations, the information generated here can guide future studies, such as models for disease spread and One Health interventions.","output":"Community health and human-animal contacts on the edges of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we discussed a 22-year-old pregnant woman (gestational age: 32 weeks) infected with COVID-19 who presented with fever (39.1 C) and respiratory symptoms. Thoracic computed tomography could not be obtained due to pregnancy. PCR testing was positive. The patient was treated with supportive care and anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents; however, general health status deteriorated and patient was admitted to intensive care unit on day 3. After admission to COVID-19 ICU, clinical picture was rapidly worsened with development of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption (CytoSorb?, Cytosorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) was planned and performed with regular intervals in order to remove inflammatory cytokines from circulation and to relieve systemic inflammatory response. The fever response and CRP elevation were controlled by hemoadsorption and cytokine filter performed in alternate days. On day 7 of ICU admission, it was decided to terminate pregnancy due to worsening hypoxemia and a healthy, premature infant was born. On day 2 after cesarean section, the patient was intubated and mechanical ventilation support was initiated. However, the patient showed an increasingly complicated clinical course and died on day 22 after ICU admission. It is seen that COVID-19 positivity carries an important risk for both mother and fetus, particularly in those at advanced stages of gestation, by physiological changes in the mother during pregnancy.

Multiple public health interventions have been implemented worldwide to decrease the transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the implemented public health interventions to control the spread of the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Science Direct and MedRxiv for relevant articles published in English up to March 16, 2021. We included quasi experimental studies, clinical trials, cohort studies, longitudinal studies, case-control studies and interrupted time series. We included the studies that investigated the effect of the implemented public health measures to prevent and control the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). RESULTS: The database search using the predefined combinations of Mesh terms found 13,497 studies of which 3595 in PubMed, 7393 in Science Direct 2509 preprints in MedRxiv. After removal of the duplicates and the critical reading only 18 articles were included in this systematic review and processed for data extraction. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions and non-pharmaceutical measurements were effective in decreasing the transmission of COVID-19. The included studies showed that travel restrictions, borders measures, quarantine of travellers arriving from affected countries, city lockdown, restrictions of mass gathering, isolation and quarantine of confirmed cases and close contacts, social distancing measures, compulsory mask wearing, contact tracing and testing, school closures and personal protective equipment use among health workers were effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Effective public health measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The popularity of online learning, such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), continues to increase among students.

Currently, 78 species and 17 genera of paramyxoviruses are classified and harbored by multiple natural reservoirs, including rodents, bats, birds, reptiles, and fish. Jeilongvirus has been proposed as a novel paramyxovirus genus containing J-, Beilong, and Tailam viruses, found in wild rodents. Using RT-PCR, 824 Apodemus agrarius individuals were examined for the prevalence of paramyxovirus infections. Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 108 (13.1%) rodents captured at 14 trapping sites in Korea. We first present two genetically distinct novel paramyxoviruses (genus Jeilongvirus), Paju Apodemus paramyxoviruses 1 (PAPV-1) and 2 (PAPV-2), from A. agrarius. Six PAPV strains were completely sequenced using next-generation and Sanger sequencing. PAPV-1 genome comprised 19,716 nucleotides, with eight genes (3-N-P/V/C-M-F-SH-TM-G-L-5), whereas PAPV-2 genome contained 17,475 nucleotides, with seven genes (3-N-P/V/C-M-F-TM-G-L-5). The disparity between PAPV-1 and -2 revealed the presence of the SH gene and length of the G gene in the genome organization. The phylogenies of PAPV-1 and -2 belong to distinct genetic lineages of Jeilongvirus despite being from the same natural host. PAPV-1 clustered with Beilong and Tailam viruses, while PAPV-2 formed a genetic lineage with Mount Mabu Lophuromys virus-1. PAPV-1 infected human epithelial and endothelial cells, facilitating the induction of type I/III interferons, interferon-stimulated genes, and proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this study provides profound insights into the molecular epidemiology, virus-host interactions, and zoonotic potential of novel rodent-borne paramyxoviruses. Importance Paramyxoviruses are a critical public health and socio-economic burden to humans. Rodents play a crucial role in transmitting pathogens to humans. In the last decade, novel paramyxoviruses have been discovered in different rodents. Here, we found that Apodemus agrarius harbored two distinct genotypes of the novel paramyxoviruses, Paju Apodemus paramyxovirues 1 (PAPV-1) and 2 (PAPV-2), possessing unique genome structures that are responsible for encoding TM and G proteins of different sizes. In addition, PAPV-1 infected human epithelial and endothelial cells, facilitating the induction of type I/III IFNs, ISGs, and proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, this study provides significant insights into molecular prevalence, virus-host interactions of paramyxoviruses. These observations raise the awareness of physicians and scientists about the emergence of new rodent-borne paramyxoviruses.","output":"Novel Paju Apodemus Paramyxovirus 1 and 2, Harbored by Apodemus agrarius in The Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread.

Heterogeneity, in terms of population interactions, is ingrained in the foundation of the country. Malaysian policies and social distancing measures are based on daily infections and R0 (average number of infections per infected person), estimated from the data. Models of the Malaysian COVID-19 spread are mostly based on the established SIR compartmental model and its variants. These models usually assume homogeneity and symmetrical full mixing in the population;thus, they are unable to capture super-spreading events which naturally occur due to heterogeneity. Moreover, studies have shown that when heterogeneity is present, R0 may be very different and even possibly misleading. The underlying spreading network is a crucial element, as it introduces heterogeneity for a more representative and realistic model of the spread through specific populations. Heterogeneity introduces more complexities in the modelling due to its asymmetrical nature of infection compared to the relatively symmetrical SIR compartmental model. This leads to a different way of calculating R0 and defining super-spreaders. Quantifying a super-spreader individual is related to the idea of importance in a network. The definition of a super-spreading individual depends on how super-spreading is defined. Even when the spreading is defined, it may not be clear that a single centrality always correlates with super-spreading, since centralities are network dependent. We proposed using a measure of super-spreading directly related to R0 and that will give a measure of spreading regardless of the underlying network. We captured the vulnerability for varying degrees of heterogeneity and initial conditions by defining a measure to quantify the chances of epidemic spread in the simulations. We simulated the SIR spread on a real Malaysian network to illustrate the effects of this measure and heterogeneity on the number of infections. We also simulated super-spreading events (based on our definition) within the bounds of heterogeneity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly defined measure. We found that heterogeneity serves as a natural curve-flattening mechanism;therefore, the number of infections and R0 may be lower than expected. This may lead to a false sense of security, especially since heterogeneity makes the population vulnerable to super-spreading events.","output":"Modelling Heterogeneity and Super Spreaders of the COVID-19 Spread through Malaysian Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19) has rapidly emerged as a global pandemic with multi-system involvement Involvement of the endocrine system is expected in COVID-19 as the interplay between severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS CoV-2) and the endocrine system occurs at multiple levels The widespread presence of ACE-2 receptors on various tissues suggests scope for direct viral infection The interactions via the activation of inflammatory mediators and indirect immune-mediated damage are also postulated Evidence so far suggests that COVID-19 can cause functional hypopituitarism by direct and indirect effects on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis resulting in inappropriate adrenal response to stress Several reports highlight possible immune-mediated damage to thyroid glands resulting in subacute thyroiditis COVID-19 is implicated in precipitating hyperglycemia in known diabetics and uncovering insulin resistance in those previously undiagnosed COVID-19 has also been shown to trigger Type 1 Diabetes with ketosis Various mechanisms including direct virus-induced beta cell apoptosis and immune-mediated beta-cell damage have been demonstrated The presence of virus in semen has unclear clinical significance at present In this mini-review summarize the endocrine manifestations reported so far in COVID-19 disease and explore mechanisms to decipher how SARS CoV-2 may affect various endocrine organs","output":"Endocrine involvement in COVID-19: Mechanisms, clinical features, and implications for care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transcription of the subgenomic mRNA of Sindbis virus (SINV) is initiated at a subgenomic promoter (SP).

This preliminary study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and to assess the potential risk factors in chickens of northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2020 to June 2021. A total of 768 serum samples from three zones were collected. To investigate the presence of antibodies against IBV, the indirect ELISA serological test was applied. Positivity for anti-IBV antibodies was observed in 23.96% (95% CI: 20.98C27.14) of the samples. The mixed-effect logistic regression analysis of potential risk factors showed that IBV prevalence was significantly higher in young chickens than adults (p < 0.001) and higher in intensive farm type than in extensive type (p < 0.001). Based on the production purposes of the chickens, the odds of seropositivity for IB was significantly higher in layers than in broilers (p < 0.001) and dual purposes (p < 0.001). This study revealed higher seroprevalence in farms which had the all-in-all-out rearing method than in farms with different batches in one house with a significant difference (p < 0.001), higher seroprevalence in the poor ventilated type than in good ones (p < 0.001), and higher seroprevalence in the houses that did not remove used litter at all than houses of completely disposed and partially disposed litter (p=0.002).

To date, all the available RCTs were characterized by an extracorporeal approach in performing UD, undermining potential benefits of a totally minimally invasive procedure. In this study, we aimed to report perioperative and 6-months (mo) outcomes from the first RCT comparing ORC and RARC with totally intracorporeal (i) UD. METHODS Patients were eligible for randomization if they had a diagnostic TURBt with cT2-4, cN0, cM0, or recurrent high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and no anesthesiologic contraindications to robotic surgery. Patients were enrolled with a covariate adaptive randomization process based on the following variables: BMI, ASA score, baseline haemoglobin, planned UD, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cT-stage. Primary endpoint was to demonstrate the superiority of RARC with i-UD in terms of a 50% transfusions rate's reduction. RESULTS Overall, 116 consecutive patients (58 RARC, 58 ORC) were enrolled. Among primary endpoint, overall perioperative transfusion rates were significantly lower in the RARC cohort (RARC: 22% vs ORC: 41%; p=0.046). CONCLUSIONS This prospective randomized trial observed 22% and 41% overall perioperative transfusion rates in RARC- and ORC-treated patients, respectively, confirming a significant benefit in favour to RARC with i-UD. However, perioperative complications, hospital stay, and 6-mo HRQoL were largely comparable between groups. Oncologic and functional outcomes will be assessed at longer follow-up to observe potential differences between arms.","output":"Ropen Radical Cystectomy Versus Robot-Assisted Radical Cystectomy with Intracorporeal Urinary Diversion: Early Outcomes of a Single Center Randomised Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An important focus for innovation in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is theoretical investigations.

The clinical benefit of FLT3 inhibitors in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia has been limited by rapid generation of resistance mutations, particularly in codon Asp835 (D835). We aimed to assess the highly selective oral FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS In this phase 1-2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia who either were refractory to induction therapy or had relapsed after achieving remission with previous treatment. Patients were enrolled into one of seven dose-escalation or dose-expansion cohorts assigned to receive once-daily doses of oral gilteritinib (20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 450 mg). Cohort expansion was based on safety and tolerability, FLT3 inhibition in correlative assays, and antileukaemic activity. Although the presence of an FLT3 mutation was not an inclusion criterion, we required ten or more patients with locally confirmed FLT3 mutations (FLT3mut+) to be enrolled in expansion cohorts at each dose level. On the basis of emerging findings, we further expanded the 120 mg and 200 mg dose cohorts to include FLT3mut+ patients only. The primary endpoints were the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib. Safety and tolerability were assessed in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of gilteritinib). Responses were assessed in the full analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and who had at least one datapoint post-treatment). Pharmacokinetics were assessed in a subset of the safety analysis set for which sufficient data for concentrations of gilteritinib in plasma were available to enable derivation of one or more pharmacokinetic variables. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02014558, and is ongoing. FINDINGS Between Oct 15, 2013, and Aug 27, 2015, 252 adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia received oral gilteritinib once daily in one of seven dose-escalation (n=23) or dose-expansion (n=229) cohorts. Gilteritinib was well tolerated; the maximum tolerated dose was established as 300 mg/day when two of three patients enrolled in the 450 mg dose-escalation cohort had two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 diarrhoea and grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events irrespective of relation to treatment were febrile neutropenia (97 [39%] of 252), anaemia (61 [24%]), thrombocytopenia (33 [13%]), sepsis (28 [11%]), and pneumonia (27 [11%]). Commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (92 [37%] of 252]), anaemia (86 [34%]), fatigue (83 [33%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (65 [26%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (47 [19%]). Serious adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (98 [39%] of 252; five related to treatment), progressive disease (43 [17%]), sepsis (36 [14%]; two related to treatment), pneumonia (27 [11%]), acute renal failure (25 [10%]; five related to treatment), pyrexia (21 [8%]; three related to treatment), bacteraemia (14 [6%]; one related to treatment), and respiratory failure (14 [6%]). 95 people died in the safety analysis set, of which seven deaths were judged possibly or probably related to treatment (pulmonary embolism [200 mg/day], respiratory failure [120 mg/day], haemoptysis [80 mg/day], intracranial haemorrhage [20 mg/day], ventricular fibrillation [120 mg/day], septic shock [80 mg/day], and neutropenia [120 mg/day]). An exposure-related increase in inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was noted with increasing concentrations in plasma of gilteritinib. In-vivo inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation occurred at all dose levels. At least 90% of FLT3 phosphorylation inhibition was seen by day 8 in most patients receiving a daily dose of 80 mg or higher. 100 (40%) of 249 patients in the full analysis set achieved a response, with 19 (8%) achieving complete remission, ten (4%) complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, 46 (18%) complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery, and 25 (10%) partial remission INTERPRETATION: Gilteritinib had a favourable safety profile and showed consistent FLT3 inhibition in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. These findings confirm that FLT3 is a high-value target for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia; based on activity data, gilteritinib at 120 mg/day is being tested in phase 3 trials.

Given the regional disparities in incidence and mortality in the general population, we aimed to describe local characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Montreal. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort of consecutive adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of H?pital du Sacr-Coeur de Montral with confirmed COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Between 20 March and 13 May 2020, 75 patients were admitted, with a median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of 62 [53-72] yr and high rates of obesity (47%), hypertension (67%), and diabetes (37%). Healthcare-related infections were responsible for 35% of cases. The median [IQR] day 1 sequential organ failure assessment score was 6 [3-7]. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was used in 57% of patients for a median [IQR] of 11 [5-22] days. Patients receiving IMV were characterized by a moderately decreased median [IQR] partial pressure of oxygen:fraction of inspired oxygen (day 1 PaO2:FiO2 = 177 [138-276]; day 10 = 173 [147-227]) and compliance (day 1 = 48 [38-58] mL/cmH2O; day 10 = 34 [28-42] mL/cmH2O) and very elevated estimated dead space fraction (day 1 = 0.60 [0.53-0.67]; day 10 = 0.72 [0.69-0.79]). Overall hospital mortality was 25%, and 21% in the IMV patients. Mortality was 82% in patients &#8805; 80 yr old. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Montreal were similar to those reported in the existing literature.

Convalescent plasma can be a therapeutic option for these patients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of convalescent plasma is crucial to optimize such therapeutic approach. Here, we describe a COVID-19 patient who was deeply immunosuppressed following rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and concomitant chemotherapy for chronic lymphoid leukemia. His long-term severe T and B cell lymphopenia allowed to evaluate the treatment effects of convalescent plasma. Therapeutic outcome was monitored at the clinical, biological and radiological level. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (IgM, IgG and IgA) and neutralizing activity were assessed over time before and after plasma transfusions, alongside to SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification and virus isolation from the upper respiratory tract. Already after the first cycle of plasma transfusion, the patient experienced rapid improvement of pneumonia, inflammation and blood cell counts, which may be related to the immunomodulatory properties of plasma. Subsequently, the cumulative increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies due to the three additional plasma transfusions was associated with progressive and finally complete viral clearance, resulting in full clinical recovery. In this case-report, administration of convalescent plasma revealed a stepwise effect with an initial and rapid anti-inflammatory activity followed by the progressive SARS-CoV-2 clearance.

Objective: This study was a comprehensive economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of using the IBS for single-donor apheresis platelets (AP) and random-donor pooled platelet concentrates (PC) versus AP and PC without the IBS in the United States in patient populations in which platelets are commonly transfused. Methods: All data used in this analysis were summarized from existing published sources (primarily indexed in MEDLINE) and data on file at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois) and Cerus Corporation (Concord, California). A literature-based decision-analytic model was developed to assess the economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with the use of AP and PC treated with the IBS for several conditions and procedures that account for a considerable proportion of the platelet usage in the United States: acute lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, coronary artery bypass graft, and hip arthroplasty Risks of infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, or bacterial agents were incorporated into the model. Possible benefits of reduction of the risk of emerging HCV like pathogens and elimination of the need for gamma irradiation were explored in sensitivity analyses. Results: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained by using AP + IBS versus untreated AP ranged from $1,308,833 to $4,451,650 (without bacterial testing) and $4,759,401 to $22,968,066 (with bacterial testing). Corresponding figures for PC + IBS versus untreated PC ranged from $457,586 to $1,816,060. Inclusion of emerging HCV like virus and the elimination of the need for gamma irradiation improved the cost-effectiveness to a range of $177,695 to $1,058,127 for AP without bacterial testing, $176,572 to $1,330,703 for AP with bacterial testing, and $22,888 to $153,564 for PC. The model was most likely to be affected by mortality from bacterial contamination, IBS effect on platelet utilization, and the inclusion of potential benefits (ie, gamma irradiation and/or emergent HCVlike virus). The model was relatively insensitive to changes in the IBS price and viral transmission risks. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of pathogen inactivation via the IBS for platelets is comparable to that of other accepted blood safety interventions (eg, nucleic acid amplification technology). The IBS for platelets may be considered a desirable strategy to increase the safety of platelet transfusions and a potential insurance against the threat of emerging pathogens.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of transfusion of platelet components prepared with pathogen inactivation treatment in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The arts-and the arts and culture sector-offer fertile ground for achieving a culture of health in the United States.

First, we describe what is required to help primary care professionals and trainees learn about eHealth. Second, we elaborate on how eHealth education might be provided. DISCUSSION: We consider four essential topics. First, an understanding of existing evidence-based eHealth applications and conditions for successful development and implementation. Second, required digital competencies of providers and patients. Third, how eHealth changes patient-provider and provider-provider relationships and finally, understanding the handling of digital data. Educational activities to address these topics include eLearning, blended learning, courses, simulation exercises, real-life practice, supervision and reflection, role modelling and community of practice learning. More specifically, a CanMEDS framework aimed at defining curriculum learning goals can support eHealth education by describing roles and required competencies. Alternatively, Kerns conceptual model can be used to design eHealth training programmes that match the educational needs of the stakeholders using eHealth. CONCLUSION: Vocational and CPD training in General Practice needs to build on eHealth capabilities now.

In this study, we constructed a computational framework to estimate the probability of virus transmission between potential hosts based on the hypothesis that the major barrier to virus infection is differences in cell-receptor sequences among species. Information regarding host susceptibility to virus infection was collected to classify the cross-species infection propensity between hosts. Evolutionary divergence matrices and a sequence similarity scoring program were used to determine the distance and similarity of receptor sequences. The discriminant analysis was validated with cross-validation methods. The results showed that the primary structure of the receptor protein influences host susceptibility to cross-species viral infections. Pair-wise distance, relative distance, and sequence similarity showed the best accuracy in identifying the susceptible group. Based on the results of the discriminant analysis, we constructed ViCIPR (http://lcbb3.snu.ac.kr/ViCIPR/home.jsp), a server-based tool to enable users to easily extract the cross-species infection propensities of specific viruses using a simple two-step procedure. Our sequence-based approach suggests that it may be possible to identify virus transmission between hosts without requiring complex structural analysis. Due to a lack of available data, this method is limited to viruses whose receptor use has been determined. However, the significant accuracy of predictive variables that positively and negatively influence virus transmission suggests that this approach could be improved with further analysis of receptor sequences.","output":"Prediction of cross-species infection propensities of viruses with receptor similarity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 was declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization At present, the virus has spread throughout the world, leading to millions of cases and is further increasing Objective: The main objective of this study is to review the impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health of frontline workers, isolated and quarantined people and the general population Methods: The relevant articles were extracted from PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct database by using the keywords Mental health, COVID-19, Impact of COVID-19, Frontline workers, Quarantine, Isolation, Immunity and Economy The retrieved articles were included in the study based on inclusion criteria to perform the review All the selected scientific articles were critically reviewed and the information is summarized in this narrative review Results: The majority of the studies stated that frontline health workers were at an increased risk of depression The infected, suspects and quarantined people were reported with high stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal thoughts The pandemic has devastated the worlds economy, which has severely impacted global mental health Conclusion: Mental health should be taken into account, and necessary interventional initiatives need to be considered both by the health authorities and the government to minimize the adversity of the consequences The pandemic may disappear with the discovery of new vaccines or medications, but its negative impact on mental health may persist, particularly among vulnerable populations Thus, mental health must be a matter of concern in the present scenario ? 2020 Bentham Science Publishers","output":"Impact of covid-19 on mental dimension of health: A sensitive issue to be addressed at the earliest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the start of the academic year in September 2020 was a unique time for those transitioning to a new school.

Objective: We sought to compare utilization of telephone and asynchronous virtual care for dermatologic concerns 3 months before (December 2019-February 2020) and during the pandemic (March-May 2020) across patient populations. Methods: A retrospective study was performed using a national claims database with >280 million patients within the COVID-19 Research Database to identify monthly telephone and asynchronous virtual visits by diagnosis, age, income, and patient race/ethnicity. Results: Although overall visits for dermatologic concerns decreased by 27.2% during the pandemic, telephone and asynchronous visits increased significantly. Patients most likely to use telephone visits during the pandemic were of older age (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.043, p < 0.001), African American race (RRR = 2.03, p < 0.001), and household income <$29,000 (RRR = 1.51, p < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-three consecutive patients (16 women; mean age, 63.5 y; range, 25-92 y) undergoing fluoroscopically guided (n = 32) or computed tomography-guided (n = 1) percutaneous transabdominal gastrostomy (n = 26) or gastrojejunostomy (n = 7) were prospectively enrolled in a single-center study. Each patient had three synthetic absorbable suture T-fasteners inserted and were followed until all gastropexy button-locks released naturally, were cut by a health care provider, or were lost to follow-up. Patients or caregivers were contacted weekly to determine timing of gastropexy button-lock release and assess for postprocedural complications. RESULTS All three T-fastener button-type suture locks released naturally in 14 of 33 patients (42.4%) at a median of 29.5 days (mean, 26.7 d; range, 8-40 d). One or more T-fastener sutures were cut in 10 of 33 patients (30.3%), and nine patients (27.3%) were lost to follow-up. Accounting for patient censorship, T-fasteners in all 33 patients remained intact for a median of 35 days. Local infections developed in three patients (9%) on days 22, 25, and 34. CONCLUSIONS Relative to nonabsorbable gastropexy sutures, absorbable suture gastropexy anchors offer the potential to reduce complications associated with long gastropexy indwelling times. However, absorbable gastropexy anchor buttons usually remain intact for longer than 3 weeks after insertion. A postprocedural plan for gastropexy inspection and removal within 3 weeks should continue to be emphasized to avoid local complications, even for absorbable suture kits.","output":"Prospective evaluation of absorbable gastropexy anchor indwelling time in 33 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus has closed adults and children at home.

Over two dozen cases of in-flight transmissions have been documented. To understand these risks, a characterization of the airplane cabin microbiome is necessary. Our study team collected 229 environmental samples on ten transcontinental US flights with subsequent 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that bacterial communities were largely derived from human skin and oral commensals, as well as environmental generalist bacteria. We identified clear signatures for air versus touch surface microbiome, but not for individual types of touch surfaces. We also found large flight-to-flight beta diversity variations with no distinguishing signatures of individual flights, rather a high between-flight diversity for all touch surfaces and particularly for air samples. There was no systematic pattern of microbial community change from pre- to post-flight. Our findings are similar to those of other recent studies of the microbiome of built environments. In summary, the airplane cabin microbiome has immense airplane to airplane variability. The vast majority of airplane-associated microbes are human commensals or non-pathogenic, and the results provide a baseline for non-crisis-level airplane microbiome conditions.

Among the reasons for the expansion of these diseases and the appearance of new neuropathogens are globalization, global warming, and the increased proximity between humans and wild animals due to human activities such as deforestation. Neurotropism affecting normal brain function is shared by organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Neuroinfections caused by these agents activate immune responses, inducing neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and neurodegeneration. Purinergic signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway associated with these neuropathologies. During neuroinfections, host cells release ATP as an extracellular danger signal with pro-inflammatory activities. ATP is metabolized to its derivatives by ectonucleotidases such as CD39 and CD73; ATP and its metabolites modulate neuronal and immune mechanisms through P1 and P2 purinergic receptors that are involved in pathophysiological mechanisms of neuroinfections. In this review we discuss the beneficial or deleterious effects of various components of the purinergic signaling pathway in infectious diseases that affect the CNS, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, bacterial meningitis, sepsis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria.

It is a multidomain protein that integrates readout of different histone modification states and DNA methylation with enzymatic histone ubiquitylation activity.

Here, we compared two splicing variants (V1, V2) of murine UHRF1 (mUHRF1) with human UHRF1 (hUHRF1). We show that insertion of nine amino acids in a linker region connecting the different TTD and PHD histone modification-binding domains causes distinct H3K9me3-binding behaviour of mUHRF1 V1. Structural analysis suggests that in mUHRF1 V1, in contrast to V2 and hUHRF1, the linker is anchored in a surface groove of the TTD domain, resulting in creation of a coupled TTD-PHD module. This establishes multivalent, synergistic H3-tail binding causing distinct cellular localization and enhanced H3K9me3-nucleosome ubiquitylation activity. In contrast to hUHRF1, H3K9me3-binding of the murine proteins is not allosterically regulated by phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate that interacts with a separate less-conserved polybasic linker region of the protein.

It has become apparent that outbreaks of RSV in the elderly are associated with increased hospitalization rates. However, little data exists on the severity of such viral RTIs in adults, particularly the need for hospitalization, respiratory support and intensive care. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational single-center study at ?stfold Hospital Trust, Norway, during three winter seasons 2015C2018. Patients 18 years with either influenza A, influenza B, RSV A/B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1C4 or adenovirus detected in respiratory specimens were included, if they were hospitalized 14 days prior or following the detection date, with signs of RTI. Hospital records on treatment and outcome were investigated, as well as mortality of all causes up to 30 days from discharge. RESULTS: Of the 1222 infection events that were included, influenza A was the most frequent virus detected (39%), while 179 infection events (14.6%) were due to RSV. Influenza B counted for 24% of the infection events, human metapneumovirus 13%, parainfluenza virus 9% and adenovirus 1%. Patients admitted with RSV more often suffered from COPD and congestive heart failure than patients with influenza A. In addition, RSV patients were overrepresented in the urgent response NEWS score (National Early Warning Score) category 5. RSV patients also showed signs of more severe inflammation, with WBC 11.1  10(9)/L and CRP >100 mg/L, and they were more often treated with antibiotic agents during their hospital stay. However, we found no differences in the need for ICU admission or mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with RSV had more often high values for markers of inflammation and elevated NEWS score when compared to patients hospitalized with other common respiratory viruses. Taken into account that they suffered more frequently from comorbidities like COPD, these patients needed hospitalization more urgently. These findings highlight the need for further investigations on RSV disease in adults and the elderly.","output":"Clinical Outcome of Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Hospitalized Adults in Norway: High Degree of Inflammation and Need of Emergency Care for Cases With Respiratory Syncytial Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer patients are a population at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and, also of developing severe complications due to the infection, which is especially true when they are undergoing immunosuppressive treatment.

One of their most controversial and puzzling features is their distinctive caudal anatomy, which has been suggested as a mechanism to facilitate caudal autotomy. Several researchers have described putative fracture planes in mesosaur caudal vertebrae - unossified regions in the middle of caudal vertebral centra - that in many extant squamates allow the tail to separate and the animal to escape predation. However, the reports of fracture planes in mesosaurs have never been closely investigated beyond preliminary descriptions, which has prompted scepticism. Here, using numerous vertebral series, histology, and X-ray computed tomography, we provide a detailed account of fracture planes in all three species of mesosaurs. Given the importance of the tail for propulsion in many other aquatic reptiles, the identification of fracture planes in mesosaurs has important implications for their aquatic locomotion. Despite mesosaurs apparently having the ability to autotomize their tail, it is unlikely that they actually made use of this behaviour due to a lack of predation pressure and no record of autotomized tails in articulated specimens. We suggest that the presence of fracture planes in mesosaurs is an evolutionary relic and could represent a synapomorphy for an as-yet undetermined terrestrial clade of Palaeozoic amniotes that includes the earliest radiation of secondarily aquatic tetrapods.","output":"Conflicting evidence for the use of caudal autotomy in mesosaurs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus disease that has been declared as a global pandemic in 2019.

This pandemic represents a great work risk for all health professionals, it includes dental professionals who are in constant contact with saliva, which represents one of the main routes of transmission of the disease. This is due to the fact that a wide variety of oral tissues and cells are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and that they express the ACE2 receptor, which is the main route of entry of the virus into cells, as well as the proteins TMPRSS and furin that contributes to the binding of the virus to the host cells. According to recent studies, some of the oral cells most susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 are the epithelial cells of the salivary glands. This explains the presence of the virus in the saliva of infected patients and provides scientific evidence that supports the use of saliva as a biofluid that offers the opportunity to develop new detection and diagnostic techniques. This is because saliva is much easier to collect compared to nasopharyngeal swab. However, the presence of the virus in saliva, also represents a great source of transmission, since the main form of infection is through microscopic drops that are generated when infected people cough or sneeze.

In this study, we identified PEDV membrane (M) protein as a new antagonist of type I IFN production in both human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells and porcine kidney PK-15 cells and determined the antagonistic mechanism used by M protein to target IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), an important regulator of type I IFN production. IRF7 is phosphorylated and activated by TBK1 and IKK in response to viral infection. We found that PEDV M protein interacted with the inhibitory domain of IRF7 and significantly suppressed TBK1/IKK-induced IRF7 phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF7, leading to the decreased expression of type I IFN, although it did not affect the interaction between TBK1/IKK and IRF7. As expected, overexpression of M protein significantly increased PEDV replication in porcine cells. The M proteins of both epidemic PEDV strains and vaccine strain showed similar antagonistic effect on type I IFN production, and the 1-55 region of M protein was essential for disruption of IRF7 function by interacting with IRF7.

The expansion of inosine-containing tRNAs in eukaryotes followed the transformation of the homodimeric bacterial enzyme TadA, which generates I34 in tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Leu), into the heterodimeric eukaryotic enzyme ADAT, which modifies up to eight different tRNAs. The emergence of ADAT and its larger set of substrates, strongly influenced the tRNA composition and codon usage of eukaryotic genomes. However, the selective advantages that drove the expansion of I34-tRNAs remain unknown. Here we investigate the functional relevance of I34-tRNAs in human cells and show that a full complement of these tRNAs is necessary for the translation of low-complexity protein domains enriched in amino acids cognate for I34-tRNAs. The coding sequences for these domains require codons translated by I34-tRNAs, in detriment of synonymous codons that use other tRNAs. I34-tRNA-dependent low-complexity proteins are enriched in functional categories related to cell adhesion, and depletion in I34-tRNAs leads to cellular phenotypes consistent with these roles.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and accurate diagnosis requires assessment through detailed clinical history, examination, and objective tests. Diagnostic challenges exist as many adolescents can present with asthma-like symptoms but do not respond to asthma treatment and risk being mis-diagnosed. Under-recognition of asthma symptoms and denial of disease severity must also be addressed. The over-reliance on short-acting beta-agonists in the absence of anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma is now deemed unsafe. Adolescents with mild asthma benefit from symptom-driven treatment with combination inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) on an as-required basis. For those with moderate-to-persistent asthma requiring daily controller therapy, maintenance and reliever therapy using the same ICS-LABA controller simplifies treatment regimes, while serving to reduce exacerbation risk. A developmentally staged approach based on factors affecting asthma control in early, middle, and late adolescence enables better understanding of the individuals therapeutic needs.

The e-mental health intervention CoPE It has been developed to offer standardized and manualized support to overcome psychological distress caused by the pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of CoPE It in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms, and improving self-efficacy, and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). Furthermore, the intervention's usability, feasibility, and participants' satisfaction with CoPE It was evaluated (tertiary outcome). The study protocol has been published previously. Methods: A bicentre longitudinal study was conducted from April 27th 2020 to May 3rd 2021. N = 110 participants were included in the analyses. The intervention consisted of four modules featuring different media promoting evidence-based methods of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Difference in psychological distress between baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1) were analyzed by repeated measure analysis of covariance. Mixed linear models were applied to assess moderating effects. Depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, self-efficacy, and mindfulness were compared between baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1) via t-tests. Usability of the CoPE It intervention and participants' satisfaction was evaluated by calculation means and frequencies. Results: Primary outcome: A significant effect of time on psychological distress at post-intervention (T1) after controlling for age, gender, education, mental illness and attitudes toward online interventions was found. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, and mindfulness were a significant moderators of the relationship between time and psychological distress for consistent wording. Secondary outcomes: There was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety, and a significant increase in self-efficacy and mindfulness between baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1). Tertiary outcomes: 95.83% of the participants thought the CoPE It intervention was easy to use and 87.50% were satisfied with the CoPE It intervention in an overall, general sense. Conclusion: The e-mental health CoPE It intervention seems to be an effective approach in reducing psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and in enhancing self-efficacy and mindfulness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among these institutional mechanisms, the constitution in Taiwan entrusts presidents with the authority to act immediately in response to an emergency based on the principle of necessity. The objective of this paper is to gain insight into the following questions: (1) How does the Taiwanese government respond to a pandemic and to what extent does this situation affect the Taiwanese governmental emergency response powers? (2) Do the Taiwanese governmental interventions contradict democratic values and civil liberties? By analyzing the boundaries and limitations of the presidential emergency power, demonstrating practical examples of the different views of Taiwanese presidents regarding their use of the emergency power to address catastrophic disasters, and exploring preemptive actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors argue two points: (1) Taiwans administrative response to COVID-19 reveals a tendency toward having authority vastly centralized at the legislative level through blank-check authorization, and this represents the presumptive allocation of power embodied in the Republic of China Constitution, which has gradually expanded. (2) The vague and unfettered legal authorization by the CDC and the COVID-19 Special Act may diminish the substantial rule of law in the long run. This article demonstrates, by applying the assessment from a variety of key principles of constitutionalism, Taiwan exhibited how it has integrated institutional memories and past lessons. However, there continues to be in Taiwan an overdependent reliance on statutory authorization with the inherent risk of a slippery slope in exploiting legal authorization, coupled with administrative blind spots, that can generate disproportionate public measures. This leverage, we argue, supersedes the presidents discretionary emergency power, enabling emergency legislation without proper oversight, prevailing over ordinary constitutional order, and possibly producing a corrosive effect on civil liberties and the rule of law in the long term.","output":"Sham Legality: Analyzing Taiwanese Experiences in Responding to COVID-19 in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While quantitative analytical skills have always been a part of modern biomedical training, the big data revolution and digital research environment have increased the importance of computational approaches for biomedical graduate education.

Here, we describe a flipped approach that combined a preexisting online course with group problem solving sessions to effectively and efficiently teach biomedical Ph.D. students key concepts in the use of the Python programming language for research. Following the COVID-19 related shutdowns in March 2020, we successfully adapted this approach to an all-online version where the formerly in-person problem-solving sessions occurred in small groups over Zoom. We found that students in both in-person and remote flipped formats showed increased confidence using Python and related this to their thesis research. Following the shift to the fully remote format, the lack of a physically present instructor seemed to increase students reliance on their classmates, which in turn promoted peer learning and support.

However, few studies have directly tested whether participants' responses in RCS studies were similar to those found in panel studies. To address this gap, we compared the responses to 33 items, 28 of which were further grouped into four aggregates (Affections, Worries, States, Health concerns), over 8 weeks during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Denmark in a RCS study (overall N = 5,993, per measurement occasion 616  n  964) with the responses in a largely equivalent panel study (993  n  2,546 across measurement occasions).

An up-to-date understanding of how best to target this therapy (e.g. arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) aim) in these patients is urgently required. OBJECTIVES: To address how oxygen therapy should be targeted in adults with ARDS (particularly ARDS secondary to COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses) and requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit, and the impact oxygen therapy has on mortality, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, requirement for renal replacement therapy, and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 May 2020 for ongoing or completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors independently assessed all records in accordance with standard Cochrane methodology for study selection. We included RCTs comparing supplemental oxygen administration (i.e. different target PaO2 or SpO2 ranges) in adults with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We excluded studies exploring oxygen administration in patients with different underlying diagnoses or those receiving non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, or oxygen via facemask. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author performed data extraction, which a second review author checked. We assessed risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of the evidence for the following outcomes; mortality at longest follow-up, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, and requirement for renal replacement therapy. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one completed RCT evaluating oxygen targets in patients with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. The study randomized 205 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to either conservative (PaO2 55 to 70 mmHg, or SpO2 88% to 92%) or liberal (PaO2 90 to 105 mmHg, or SpO2 &#8805; 96%) oxygen therapy for seven days. Overall risk of bias was high (due to lack of blinding, small numbers of participants, and the trial stopping prematurely), and we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. The available data suggested that mortality at 90 days may be higher in those participants receiving a lower oxygen target (odds ratio (OR) 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 3.27). There was no evidence of a difference between the lower and higher target groups in mean number of days ventilated (14.0, 95% CI 10.0 to 18.0 versus 14.5, 95% CI 11.8 to 17.1); number of days of catecholamine use (8.0, 95% CI 5.5 to 10.5 versus 7.2, 95% CI 5.9 to 8.4); or participants receiving renal replacement therapy (13.7%, 95% CI 5.8% to 21.6% versus 12.0%, 95% CI 5.0% to 19.1%). Quality of life was not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are very uncertain as to whether a higher or lower oxygen target is more beneficial in patients with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We identified only one RCT with a total of 205 participants exploring this question, and rated the risk of bias as high and the certainty of the findings as very low. Further well-conducted studies are urgently needed to increase the certainty of the findings reported here.

'Daboju' is a C. morifolium cultivar with important ornamental and medicinal values, and is often used in the treatment of colds, blurred vision, dizziness, and itchy skin. As the morphological characteristics of C. morifolium 'Daboju' are very similar to those of other C. morifolium cultivars, they are often confused in practice. However, the medicinal value and practical use of C. morifolium depends on using the correct rapid and accurate identification of C. morifolium 'Daboju' and its differentiation from other, morphologically similar C.  morifolium cultivars. Twenty-one polymorphic start codon-targeted (SCoT) primers were amplified in 21 distinct C. morifolium cultivars. One cultivar-specific DNA marker was developed with the aim of the rapid and accurate identification of C. morifolium 'Daboju' and its differentiation from other, similar C. morifolium cultivars. Twenty-one polymorphic start codon-targeted (SCoT) primers were amplified in 21 distinct C. morifolium cultivars. One cultivar-specific 385-bp amplicon (named SCoT36-385), amplified only in C. morifolium 'Daboju' (and in all samples of this cultivar), was identified, cloned, and sequenced. Subsequently, a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker (named DBJF/DBJR), generating a 360-bp amplicon, was developed from SCoT36-385 and tested for amplification in all 21 C. morifolium cultivars, ten C. morifolium 'Daboju' populations, and different simulated adulterations of 'Daboju' with other cultivars. The primers amplified the specific 360-bp-long DNA fragment in all the tested C. morifolium 'Daboju' samples but failed in the absence of 'Daboju'. The detection limit of the SCAR primer pair (DBJF/DBJR) was 100 pg of DNA extracted from C. morifolium 'Daboju'. Hence, this SCAR marker has a very high detection sensitivity, and can be used for accurate and rapid identification of C. morifolium 'Daboju'. It can play an important role in ensuring the quality of medicinal preparations and protecting C. morifolium 'Daboju' germplasm resources in breeding programs and in identifying lines generated from this cultivar.","output":"Development and Application of a Cultivar-Specific Sequence-Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) Marker for the Detection of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.

In a prototype, FPRs recognize peptides containing N-formylated methionine such as those produced in bacteria and mitochondria, thereby serving as pattern recognition receptors. The repertoire of FPR ligands, however, has expanded rapidly to include not only N-formyl peptides from microbes but also non-formyl peptides of microbial and host origins, synthetic small molecules and an eicosanoid. How these chemically diverse ligands are recognized by the three human FPRs (FPR1, FPR2 and FPR3) and their murine equivalents is largely unclear. In the absence of crystal structures for the FPRs, site-directed mutagenesis, computer-aided ligand docking and structural simulation have led to the identification of amino acids within FPR1 and FPR2 that interact with several formyl peptides.

Effect modification between DM and obesity was assessed with a statistical interaction term and an exploration of stratum-specific effects. RESULTS: Out of 3,533 patients, a total of 1,134 (32%) had DM, 1,256 (36%) had obesity, and 430 (12%) had both.

It is currently unclear how highly modular social networks influence the persistence of contagious pathogens that generate lifelong immunity in their hosts when between-group interactions are age-dependent. This trait occurs in social species with communal nurseries, where juveniles are reared together for a substantial period in burrows or similar forms of containment and are thus in isolation from contact with individuals in other social groups. Our main objective was to determine whether, and to what extent, such age-dependent patterns of between-group interactions consistently increased the fade-out probability of contagious pathogens that generate lifelong immunity in their hosts. We hypothesised that in populations of species where juveniles are raised in communal nurseries, a high proportion of recovered adults in a group would form a 'protective barrier' around susceptible juveniles against pathogen transmission, thereby increasing the probability of epidemic fade-out in the population. To test this idea we implemented a spatially implicit individual-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for a large range of generic host and pathogen traits. Our results indicate that (i) the probability of epidemic fade-out was consistently higher in populations with communal nurseries, especially for highly contagious pathogens (high basic reproduction number, R0 ) and (ii) communal nurseries can counteract the cost of group-living in terms of infection risk to a greater extent than variation in other traits.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per meter cubed of air were pooled, and their distribution was described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed were analyzed after categorization as less than 1 m, from 1 to 4 m, and greater than 4 m. Findings: Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies were included in the review. Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non-intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P < .001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (&#8804;1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P = .22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0  103 copies/m3 (0.4  103 to 3.1  103 copies/m3) in clinical areas to 9.7  103 copies/m3 (5.1  103 to 14.3  103 copies/m3) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9  103 to 40  103 copies/m3 and 3.8  103 to 7.2  103 TCID50/m3), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 m; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 m. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.","output":"Assessment of Air Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in Hospital Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate immune sensing of viral molecular patterns is essential for development of antiviral responses. Like many viruses, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has evolved strategies to circumvent innate immune detection including low CpG levels in the genome, glycosylation to shield essential elements including the receptor binding domain, RNA shielding and generation of viral proteins that actively impede anti\\\\viral interferon responses. Together these strategies allow widespread infection and increased viral load. Despite the efforts of immune subversion, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection activates innate immune pathways inducing a robust type I/III interferon response, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and recruitment of neutrophils and myeloid cells. This may induce hyperinflammation or alternatively, effectively recruit adaptive immune responses that help clear the infection and prevent reinfection. The dysregulation of the renin\\\\angiotensin system due to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, together with the activation of type I/III interferon response, and inflammasome response converge to promote free radical production and oxidative stress. This exacerbates tissue damage in the respiratory system but also leads to widespread activation of coagulation pathways leading to thrombosis. Here, we review the current knowledge of the role of the innate immune response following SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, much of which is based on the knowledge from SARS\\\\CoV and other coronaviruses. Understanding how the virus subverts the initial immune response and how an aberrant innate immune response contributes to the respiratory and vascular damage in COVID\\\\19 may help explain factors that contribute to the variety of clinical manifestations and outcome of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.","output":"Innate immunity during SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2: evasion strategies and activation trigger hypoxia and vascular damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Investigate if the OMERACT Psoriatic Arthritis MRI Scoring System (PsAMRIS), including a novel total inflammation score, shows sensitivity to change with an agent (abatacept) known to impact clinical outcomes in PsA. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of randomized phase IIb study of abatacept in patients with PsA and inadequate DMARD response. Participants received one of three abatacept dosing regimens (ABA3, ABA10 or ABA30/10 mg/kg [30 mg/kg switched to 10 mg/kg after two doses]) or placebo until day (D)169, then ABA10 through D365. MRIs at baseline, D85, D169 and D365 were centrally evaluated by two readers blinded to chronological order and treatment arm. Synovitis, osteitis, tenosynovitis, periarticular inflammation, bone erosions, joint space narrowing and bone proliferation were assessed using PsAMRIS. A novel total inflammation score was tested. RESULTS: MRIs for 123 patients were included. D169: ABA10 and ABA30/10 significantly reduced MRI synovitis and tenosynovitis, respectively, vs placebo (differences -0.966 [p = 0.039] and -1.652 [p = 0.014], respectively). Synovitis in the placebo group increased non-significantly from baseline to D169; total inflammation and tenosynovitis decreased non-significantly; all measures improved significantly after switch to ABA10 (-1.019, -0.940, -2.275 [p < 0.05], respectively, D365 vs D169). Structural outcomes changed minimally across groups. CONCLUSION: Adults with PsA receiving ABA10 and ABA30/10 demonstrated significant resolution of inflammatory components of disease, confirmed by MRI, with synovitis and tenosynovitis improvements consistent with previously reported clinical responses for these doses. Results indicate that reduction in OMERACT PsAMRIS inflammation scores may provide proof of tissue-level efficacy in PsA clinical trials.

This study assesses vaccine uptake among this group during the first month of its availability. METHODS: A national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19 vaccine, sources of HCWs information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern, and anxiety level using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Of the 1058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%) were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not enrolled. In a bivariate analysis, not enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those >40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005), Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with uptake were being a Saudi national (aOR = 1.918, 95 %CI = 1.363C2.698, P < 0.001), working in an intensive care unit (aOR = 1.495, 95 %CI = 1.083C2.063, P = 0.014), and working at a university hospital (aOR = 1.867, 95 %CI = 1.380C2.525, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low level of vaccine uptake was observed especially in female HCWs, those younger than 40 years old, and those who used social media as their source of vaccine information. This survey provides important information for public health authorities in order to scale up vaccination campaigns targeting these HCWs to increase vaccine enrollment and uptake.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine uptake among healthcare workers in the fourth country to authorize BNT162b2 during the first month of rollout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in many aspects of life across the globe including education provision This pandemic led to major and rapid restructuring of curricula and assessments as student suddenly moved to unfamiliar learning environment Active involvement of students in the education process and curricula reform is encouraged This paper aimed to explore pharmacy student leaders' perspectives related to their learning during COVID-19 pandemic in terms of strengths, weakness, opportunities, challenges and recommendations to move forward A meeting with pharmacy student leaders was convened Each student leader individually reflected on their experiences using a structured SWOC (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Challenges) framework which was then used to guide discussion Each student then rated anonymously the importance and the probability of the themes to come up with overall score Online learning came with both negative and positive aspects from the students' point of view Despite the efforts that were made by the college and students to adapt to the new educational system, there were drawbacks that may have affected the quality of the education However, during these unprecedented circumstances, the pandemic has given pharmacy students plenty of opportunities that could positively affect their future career and the delivery of pharmacy education Pharmacy programmes need to implement strategies within their programmes about disaster preparedness and build student resilience and wellbeing","output":"A SWOC analysis on the impact of COVID-19 through pharmacy student leaders' perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the year 2015, new Zika virus (ZIKV) broke out in Brazil and spread away in more than 80 countries.

To the best of our knowledge, no case of pancreatic NEC with mismatch repair deficiency has been reported to date. We describe a 62-year-old patient who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for a NEC located in the pancreatic head, with peripancreatic lymph node metastases. Tumor necrosis was prominent and the Ki67 proliferative index was 60%. One year after the diagnosis, the patient experienced recurrence with a left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, which was surgically removed, followed by standard cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy. Neoplastic cells showed combined loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in both primary tumor and lymph node metastasis. Microsatellite instability (MSI) test using a mononucleotide repeats pentaplex PCR (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-22, and NR-24) revealed minimal mononucleotide shifts showing deletion of less than 3 bp at NR-21, BAT-26, NR-24, and NR-22 loci. MLH1 methylation analysis revealed absence of the gene promoter methylation. BRAF and KRAS mutations were not detected. In gut, NECs' mismatch repair deficiency phenotype has been reported in about 10% of cases, and it represents an independent factor of more favorable outcome.

In this study, we conducted beach litter surveys to quantify and characterize marine litter from six beach transects in this region for the first time using the OSPAR beach litter monitoring guideline. A total of 29,456 items weighting 529,432 g was recorded from 12 surveys in two monitoring campaigns in December 2019 (dry season) and in June 2020 (rainy season). Plastic was the most abundant type of litter in terms of quantity (a total of 26,662 items) and weight (325,606 g), followed by paper and cardboard, cloth, wood, metal, glass and ceramics, rubber and other items. Meanwhile, ropes (less than 1 cm in diameter) and plastic bags accounted for the major parts of sampled plastic items, i.e., 20.18% and 14.46%, respectively. In general, a higher percentage of marine litter, particularly the fishing related items, was found in the rainy season than in the dry season, possibly due to increased fishing and aquaculture activities. In contrast, a reduction pattern of the single use plastics in the rainy season might be due to the decreased tourism activities during the Covid pandemic period. This study not only showed the magnitude of litter pollution, but also provided valuable information that could help decision making to better control and reduce marine litter in the region. In addition, insights from this study indicate that there is an urgent need to design collection, reuse and recycling programs in the area.

The objective is to develop rigorous criteria for the recognition of impact processes that assist in distinguishing impact from other potential erosional processes, particularly thermal fatigue, which has recently been advocated specifically for asteroids. Impact in rock is a process that is centrally to bilaterally symmetric, resulting in highly crushed, high-albedo, quasicircular depressions surrounded by volumetrically prominent spall zones. Containing central glass-lined pits in many cases, such features provide distinctive evidence of impact that is not duplicated by any other process. Additional evidence of impact can include radial fracture systems in the target that emanate from the impact point and clusters of fragments that attest to the lateral acceleration and displacement of each one. It is also important to note that impact produces a wide variety of fragment shapes that might totally overlap with those produced by thermal fatigue; we consider fragment shape to be an unreliable criterion for either process. The stochastic nature of the impact process will result in exponential survival times of surface rocks; that is, rock destruction initially is relatively efficient, but it is followed by ever increasing surface times for the last rock remnants. Thermal fatigue, however, is essentially a thermal-equilibrium process. The corresponding distribution of survival times should be much more peaked in comparison, presumably Gaussian, and diagnostically different from that due to impact. Given the abundance of evidence that has been gleaned from returned Apollo rocks and soils, it is surprising how little has been learned about the impact process from the photography of rocks and boulders taken by the astronauts on the lunar surface. This suggests that it will require rocks and soils returned from asteroids to evaluate the relative roles of thermal versus impact-triggered rock erosion, particularly when both processes are likely to be operating.","output":"EROSION OF LUNAR SURFACE ROCKS BY IMPACT PROCESSES: A SYNTHESIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019 an outbreak of a new corona virus was reported in the city Wuhan, China.

This project explored experiences of older people in Mexico and Scotland during the pandemic and examined the potential of everyday technology to help maintain social connectedness. A mixed methods approach included secondary analysis of large-scale datasets alongside primary data.

The findings demonstrate that advantages and disadvantages accumulated in the life course determine how older people select, optimize and compensate for new ways of staying socially connected during the pandemic in both countries. The use of technologies among older people is further mediated by structural inequalities with differences found between Mexico and Scotland in specific patterns identified. Further, stereotypes about older age and technology use are obstacles to the use of technology, as they affect the perception of self-efficacy by older people.

Pre-covid-19, five patients were interviewed face-to-face twice (shortly after a primary care consultation for potential lung cancer symptom(s) and 2C5 months later). The general practitioner (GP) they last saw was interviewed face-to-face once. During the covid-19 pandemic, an additional 15 patients were interviewed once via telephone.

Results The findings from our thematic analysis suggest that patients prefer active safety, as part of thorough and logical diagnostic uncertainty management. Passive safety netting may be perceived as dismissive and cause delayed reconsultation. GP safety netting strategies are not always understood, potentially causing patient worry and dissatisfaction. Telephone consultations and the diagnostic overshadowing of COVID-19 on respiratory symptoms impacted GPs safety netting strategies and patients appetite for active follow up measures. Conclusions Safety netting guidelines do not yet offer solutions that have been proven to promote symptom vigilance and timely reconsultation for low-risk lung cancer symptoms.

We identified the seasonality of rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, human parainfluenza viruses 1C3 (HPIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) from the 52060 respiratory samples tested between 2009 and 2015 and then confirmed the same by a generalised linear model. We also investigated the relationship between meteorological factors and viral seasonality. Non-enveloped viruses were present throughout the year. Following logistic regression adenovirus, influenza viruses A, B, RSV and HMPV preferred low temperatures; RSV and influenza A virus preferred a narrow humidity-range and HPIV type 3 preferred the season with lower humidity. A change (i.e. increase or decrease) in specific meteorological factors is associated with an increase in activity of specific viruses at certain times of the year.","output":"Association between viral seasonality and meteorological factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The governance for smart cities will be more citizen-centric and government policies will be based on the demand of the citizen.

Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19 only a few respondents had utilized virtual laboratories and most felt that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement. However, the experience generated opportunities including exploration of unfamiliar technologies, new collaborations, and revisiting the physiology laboratory curriculum and structure.

Current patient load makes collecting clinical data almost impossible even though we need that information more than ever. Objective We wanted to deploy a system that automatically and autonomously retrieves clinical data from our patients suffering from SARS-CoV2 that arrive at hospital admission to collect that information for further analysis. Design We designed a daemon in PHP programming language connected to a MySQL MariaDB database that continuously searches for new patients consulting at hospital. We collected medical history, disease records, regular medication, physical exploration, vital signs, blood chemistry and count, and finally, microbiology testing of SARS-CoV2 (both PCR and ELISA antibody testing). As we don't have access to any API service (out-of-the-box connection to the data mainframe), we took advantage of web-scraping (brute-force data extraction from webpages using HTTP protocol) applied to our hospital web interface. Setting Monitoring was made between 1st March, 2020 and 15th April, 2020 (during worst Coronavirus outbreak phase of the country), using only one computer connected to the hospital network. The number of patients identified was 259, each one with 344 clinical and testing variables. Results Using this technique, we collected data of 259 hematologic patients without human intervention and more than 300 variables have been analyzed. Nowadays, manual revision of certain aspects of the database (e.g., comorbidities) is needed and some data needs to be manually entered due to the lack of proper codification. In the future, with the development of semantic-matching technologies, fully autonomous building of the databases will be possible. In the meantime, our technique can solve the capture of enormous amount of clinical information without effort. With that information, observational studies, even a prognosis score using machine learning, have been developed in our center.

Previous studies on OmpA usually focus on its interaction with the host cells and its role in vaccine development. However, the impact of OmpA on the virulence of S. maltophilia to host cells and the effects on apoptosis remain unclear. In this study, we exposed purified recombinant S. maltophilia OmpA (rOmpA) to HEp-2 cells and investigated the effects of OmpA on epithelial cell apoptosis. Morphologic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that HEp-2 cells stimulated with rOmpA multiple apoptosis features, including nuclear roundness and pyknosis, chromatin aggregation, and phosphatidylserine eversion. We found that rOmpA regulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-xL in HEp-2 cells, leading to changes in mitochondria permeability and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factors into the cytoplasm. These subsequently activate the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway that promote apoptosis. We also observed that rOmpA enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species and increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels in HEp-2 cells. Collectively, our data suggested that rOmpA induced epithelial cells apoptosis via mi-tochondrial pathways.

This exploratory, survey-based study compared individuals perceptions of working from home and from their employers workplace, paying particular attention to how these experiences differed for individuals with and without dogs and/or cats. Participants reported they had more opportunities to socialize with other people and experienced less work-family conflict when they worked at the office. When working from home, participants indicated they spent more quality time with their pets and family members, and compared to those without dogs, dog owners were more likely to report socializing with others and getting a healthy amount of physical activity. Follow-up studies are needed to investigate whether these findings persist after the threat of COVID-19 abates and to see how characteristics of pet owners (e.g., personality, job type) and pets (e.g., species, age, behavior) impact any benefits or costs associated with being in the company of pets while teleworking. ABSTRACT: In Spring of 2020, the novel coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) prompted an unprecedented number of individuals across the United States to begin working from home. Prior research has identified both positive and negative impacts of teleworking on employee well-being, and this study built on that research to explore perceptions regarding how companion animals factor into the teleworking experience. Individuals who had experience working from home and from their employers office completed an online survey about those experiences. Participants reported spending more quality time with their companion animals and family members when they worked from home. Furthermore, when working from home, individuals with dogs were more likely than those without dogs to report they socialized with other people, got a healthy amount of physical activity, and took at least one 15-min walk during the workday. Some participants, particularly those in households containing both dogs and cats, indicated that their pets created distractions during the workday. Future studies can build on this research by investigating whether the findings persist once the novel coronavirus is no longer a threat, and by paying close attention to the characteristics of pets, owners, and household dynamics that may influence the effects of pet ownership on the teleworking experience.","output":"The Experience of Teleworking with Dogs and Cats in the United States during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical teaching is about giving a student a collaborative experience of the art and skill of the practice of medicine.

To protect against these adverse conditions and promote recovery, cells undergo dramatic changes upon exposure to stress. This involves activation of signaling pathways, cell cycle arrest, translational reprogramming and reorganization of the cytoplasm. Notably, many stress conditions cause a global inhibition of mRNA translation accompanied by the formation of cytoplasmic condensates called stress granules, which sequester mRNA together with RNA-binding proteins, translation initiation factors, and other components. Stress granules are highly conserved in eukaryotes suggesting that they perform an important function during the stress response. Over the years, many different roles have been assigned to stress granules, including translational control, mRNA storage, regulation of mRNA decay, antiviral innate immune response, and modulation of signaling pathways. Most of our understanding, however, has been deduced from correlative data based upon the composition of stress granules and only recently have technological innovations allowed hypotheses for stress granule function to be directly tested.

The incidence and severity of anesthetic complications in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an increased incidence of intra- and postoperative complications in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to those with negative testing. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing complications for children under 18 years of age who underwent anesthesia between April 28 and September 30, 2020 at a large, academic pediatric hospital. Each child with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test within the prior 10 days was matched to a patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, age, gender, and procedure. Children who were intubated prior to the procedure, underwent organ transplant surgery, or had severe COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the risk difference of a composite of intra- or postoperative respiratory complications in children positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those with negative testing. Secondarily, we used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for respiratory complications before and after adjustment using propensity scores weighting to adjust for possible confounders. Other secondary outcomes included neurologic, cardiovascular, hematologic, and renal complications, unanticipated postoperative admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 9,812 general anesthetics that had a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 test were identified. Sixty encounters occurred in patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing preoperatively and 51 were included for analysis. The matched controls cohort included 99 encounters. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher incidence of respiratory complications (11.8% vs 1.0%; risk difference 10.8%, 95% CI 1.6-19.8%; P = 0.003). After adjustment, the odds ratio for respiratory complications was 14.37 (95% CI 1.59-130.39; P = 0.02) for SARS-CoV-2 positive children as compared to controls. There was no occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, postoperative pneumonia, or perioperative mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher rates of perianesthetic respiratory complications than matched controls with negative testing. However, severe morbidity was rare and there were no mortalities. The incidence of complications was similar to previously published rates of perianesthetic complications in the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection. This risk persisted after adjustment for preoperative upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting an increased risk in symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Anesthetic Complications Associated with SARS-CoV-2 in Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises a real public health problem.

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out based on phone interviews of 1073 adults aged over 18 years from 4 to 12 April 2020 in Mashhad, Khorasan-Razavi Province, as the second largest city of Iran. A systematic random sampling was carried out using fixed phone number lists provided by Telecommunication Company of Khorasan-Razavi Province. Phone interviews were carried out by trained interviewers from the Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) at various times of the day. The survey included sociodemographic questions, perceived social support scale (MSPSS) and questions about self-isolation during the Nowruz holiday. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 20.5% of participants reported poor compliance with stay at home orders during the first 2 weeks of Nowruz. Clear social gradients were not found in stay-at-home compliance. When controlling socio-demographic factors, perceived social support, interestingly, both fostered and hindered peoples compliance with stay at home orders, depending on the source of support from family members (OR = .874, 95% CI = .803, .950, p < .005), friends (OR = 1.147, 95% CI = 1.076, 1.222, p < .001) and a significant other person (OR = .926, 95% CI = .849, 1.010, p = .084).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from throat swab sample CT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts, coagulation system factor levels, myocardial injury indexes, and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively). Moreover, there were significant differences in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group (p = 0.029, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively), and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated (p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, and hypersensitive troponin T (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p < 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.","output":"Correlation Between Relative Nasopharyngeal Virus RNA Load and Lymphocyte Count Disease Severity in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research to assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID\\\\19 in China has found that many are psychologically stressed, raising concerns about the psychological well\\\\being of physicians and nurses involved in the acute COVID\\\\19 outbreak.","output":"Psychological distress found among exposed health care workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like all other positive-strand RNA viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces rearrangements of intracellular membranes that are thought to serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the viral replicase machinery. The most prominent membranous structures present in HCV-infected cells are double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). However, their composition and role in the HCV replication cycle are poorly understood. To gain further insights into the biochemcial properties of HCV-induced membrane alterations, we generated a functional replicon containing a hemagglutinin (HA) affinity tag in nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B), the supposed scaffold protein of the viral replication complex. By using HA-specific affinity purification we isolated NS4B-containing membranes from stable replicon cells. Complementing biochemical and electron microscopy analyses of purified membranes revealed predominantly DMVs, which contained viral proteins NS3 and NS5A as well as enzymatically active viral replicase capable of de novo synthesis of HCV RNA. In addition to viral factors, co-opted cellular proteins, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAP-A) and VAP-B, that are crucial for viral RNA replication, as well as cholesterol, a major structural lipid of detergent-resistant membranes, are highly enriched in DMVs. Here we describe the first isolation and biochemical characterization of HCV-induced DMVs. The results obtained underline their central role in the HCV replication cycle and suggest that DMVs are sites of viral RNA replication.

We set out to assess the extent of uptake of these ART delivery models and to describe barriers to uptake of either facility-based or community-based models. METHODS: Between December 2019 and February 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods study entailing a cross-sectional health facility survey (n = 116) and in-depth interviews (n = 16) with ART clinic managers in ten case-study facilities as well as six focus group discussions (56 participants) with patients enrolled in differentiated ART models. Facilities were selected based on the 10 geographic sub-regions of Uganda. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA (v13) while qualitative data were analysed by thematic approach. RESULTS: Most facilities 63 (57%) commenced implementation of differentiated ART delivery in 2018. Fast Track Drug Delivery was the most common facility-based model (implemented in 100 or 86% of health facilities). Community Client-Led ART Delivery was the most popular community model (63/116 or 54%). Community Drug Distribution Points had the lowest uptake with only 33 (24.88%) facilities implementing them.

This study aims to explore the efficacy and possible mechanism of a Mindful Living With Challenge (MLWC) intervention designed for Chinese COVID-19 survivors in alleviating their psychological problems caused by both the disease and the pandemic. Methods: This study is a protocol for a randomized controlled trial. More than 1600 eligible participants will be assigned 1:1 to an online MLWC intervention group or a waitlist control group. All participants will be asked to complete online questionnaires at baseline , post-program, and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome is mental health status which includes PTSD and other psychological symptoms (i.e. depression, anxiety). The secondary outcomes are related physical symptoms including fatigue and sleeplessness assessed by verified scales such as the Fatigue Scale-14, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In addition, Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Nonattachment Scale, the Stillness Scale, the Resilience Style Questionnaire and the Social Support Scale will be used to assess the mindfulness, stillness, nonattachment level, resilience and perceived social support before and after the intervention, which may be the possible mediators and moderators of the link between the MLWC intervention and target outcomes.

METHODS: First, we investigated via circular dichroism (CD) the conformational behaviour of this thymine-bearing nucleopeptide with temperature: we observed CD spectral changes particularly passing from 15 to 35 C. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of the nucleopeptide was also conducted on nucleopeptide solid samples. Additionally, CD binding and in silico investigations were performed with BSA as a model protein. In particular, molecular dockings were run using as targets some of the main SARS-CoV-2 proteins. RESULTS: The temperature-dependent CD behaviour reflected the three-dimensional rearrangement of the nucleopeptide at different temperatures, with a higher exposure to the solvent of its chromophores at higher temperatures compared to a more stacked structure at low temperature. SEM analysis of nucleopeptide samples in the solid state showed a granular morphology, with a low roughness and some thread structures. Moreover, we found through spectroscopic studies that the modified peptide bound the albumin target by inducing significant changes to the protein secondary structure. CONCLUSION: CD and in silico studies suggested that the nucleopeptide bound the BSA protein with high affinity according to different binding modes, as testified by binding energy scores lower than -11 kcal/mol. Interestingly, a predictive study performed on 3CLpro and other SARS-CoV-2 protein targets suggested the potential ability of the nucleopeptide to bind with good affinity the main protease of the virus and other relevant targets including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, especially when complexed with RNA, the papain-like protease, and the coronavirus helicase at the nucleic acid binding site.","output":"Evidence of protein binding by a nucleopeptide based on a thymine-decorated L-diaminopropanoic acid through CD and in silico studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy can lead to a severe condition in the patient, which is challenging for obstetricians and anaesthesiologists. Upon severe COVID-19 and a lack of improvement after multidrug therapy and mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is introduced as the last option. Such treatment is critical in women with very preterm pregnancy when each additional day of the intrauterine stay is vital for the survival of the newborn. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 38-year-old woman at 27 weeks of gestation treated with multidrug therapy and ECMO. The woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with increasing fever, cough and dyspnoea. The course of the pregnancy was uncomplicated. She was otherwise healthy. At admission, she presented with severe dyspnoea, with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95% on passive oxygenation, heart rate of 145/min, and blood pressure of 145/90. After confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, she received steroids, remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy. The foetus was in good condition. No signs of an intrauterine infection were visible. Due to tachypnea of 40/min and SpO2 of 90%, the woman was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Due to circulatory failure, the prothrombotic activity of the coagulation system, further saturation worsening, and poor control of sedation, she was qualified for veno-venous ECMO. An elective caesarean section was performed at 29 weeks on ECMO treatment in the ICU. A preterm female newborn was delivered with an Apgar score of 7 and a birth weight of 1440 g. The newborn had no laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19. The placenta showed the following pathological changes: large subchorionic haematoma, maternal vascular malperfusion, marginal cord insertion, and chorangioma. CONCLUSIONS: This case presents the successful use of ECMO in a pregnant woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome in the course of severe COVID-19. Further research is required to explain the aetiology of placental disorders (e.g., maternal vascular malperfusion lesions or thrombotic influence of COVID-19). ECMO treatment in pregnant women remains challenging; thus, it should be used with caution. Long-term assessment may help to evaluate the safety of the ECMO procedure in pregnant women.","output":"Placental pathology in a pregnant woman with severe COVID-19 and successful ECMO treatment: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a ubiquitous health concern and a global pandemic. In an effort to slow the disease spread and protect valuable healthcare resources, cessation of nonessential surgery, including many orthopaedic procedures, has become commonplace.

This study employed robust fixed-effects panel models to empirically identify the mitigating effects of infectious diseases, via urban parks, on the suicide rate, and to examine gender differences in this regard, based on previous experiences in Seoul, Korea. We found that the differentiating mitigating effect did not significantly affect suicide rates during the 2015 MERS epidemic. However, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, wherein the number of confirmed cases was very high and diffused nationwide, urban parks significantly reduced the suicide rates for both men and women. The role of parks as a mitigator was more enhanced in cities with a high number of confirmed cases if it was associated with economic shocks. However, this effect was significant only in the suicide rates of men, not women. During a pandemic, urban parks can help maintain social interaction and sustain physical activities (i.e., walking and exercise) while maintaining physical distance. National and local governments should develop urban parks to actively control the suicide rate influenced by movement restriction measures inevitably occurring during the spread of infectious diseases.","output":"Urban parks as a potential mitigator of suicide rates resulting from global pandemics: Empirical evidence from past experiences in Seoul, Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the world will remember 2020 as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was also an exceptional year in at least one other aspect.

Objective: To compare intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) plus methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone as initial therapy in MIS-C. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study drawn from a national surveillance system with propensity score-matched analysis. All cases with suspected MIS-C were reported to the French National Public Health Agency. Confirmed MIS-C cases fulfilling the World Health Organization definition were included. The study started on April 1, 2020, and follow-up ended on January 6, 2021. Exposures: IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was persistence of fever 2 days after the introduction of initial therapy or recrudescence of fever within 7 days, which defined treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included a second-line therapy, hemodynamic support, acute left ventricular dysfunction after first-line therapy, and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary analysis involved propensity score matching with a minimum caliper of 0.1. Results: Among 181 children with suspected MIS-C, 111 fulfilled the World Health Organization definition (58 females [52%]; median age, 8.6 years [interquartile range, 4.7 to 12.1]). Five children did not receive either treatment. Overall, 3 of 34 children (9%) in the IVIG and methylprednisolone group and 37 of 72 (51%) in the IVIG alone group did not respond to treatment.

Meanwhile, as the intensity of the pandemic escalates, digital health tools such as the Internet of Things (IoT), biosensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) are being deployed to address the twin goals of social distancing and health care in a \\"no touch\\" emergency state. Permanent integration of digital technologies into every aspect of post-pandemic civic life-health care, disease tracking, education, work, and beyond-is considered by governments and technology actors around the world.

In this article, we describe new and critically informed approaches to democratize COVID-19 digital health innovation policy, especially when the facts are uncertain, the stakes are high, and decisions are urgent, as they often are in the course of a pandemic. In addition, we introduce a potential remedy to democratize pandemic innovation policy, the concept of \\"epistemic competence,\\" so as to check the frames and framings of the pandemic innovation policy juggernaut and the attendant power asymmetries. We suggest that if epistemic competence, and attention to not only scientific knowledge but also its framing are broadly appreciated, they can help reduce the disparity between the enormous technical progress and investments made in digital health versus our currently inadequate understanding of the societal dimensions of emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and extreme digital connectivity on the planet.","output":"COVID-19 Digital Health Innovation Policy: A Portal to Alternative Futures in the Making."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 45 papers.

METHODS: We included 850 patients with MS treated with interferon beta formulations, from 2015 to 2019, seen at the MS Clinical Care and Research Centre (Federico II University of Naples, Italy) and with linkage to routinely-collected healthcare data (prescription data, hospital admissions, outpatient services). We extracted and computed clinical outcomes (relapses, 6-month EDSS progression using a roving EDSS as reference), persistence (time spent on a specific interferon beta formulation), adherence (medication possession ratio (MPR)), healthcare resource utilization and costs (annualized hospitalization rate (AHR), costs for hospital admissions and DMTs). To evaluate differences between interferon beta formulations, we used linear regression (adherence), Poisson regression (AHR), mixed-effect regression (costs), and Cox-regression models (time varying variables); covariates were age, sex, treatment duration, baseline EDSS and adherence. RESULTS: Looking at clinical outcomes, rates of relapses and EDSS progression were lower than studies run on previous cohorts; there was no differences in relapse risk between interferon beta formulations. Risk of discontinuation was higher for Betaferon?/Extavia? (HR = 3.28; 95%CI = 2.11, 5.12; p<0.01). Adherence was lower for Betaferon?/Extavia?

Since that meeting, the importance of using telehealth and digital diabetes technologies has been demonstrated amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. This article summarizes the panel's discussion of the opportunities, obstacles and requisites for advancing use of these technologies as a standard of care for the management of diabetes.","output":"The Digital/Virtual Diabetes Clinic - the Future is Now.

Yet, little research investigated how adolescents and their families could be supported during this time. Our two-wave study had three aims. First, we examined life satisfaction and academic self-efficacy trajectories among ethnic minority and majority adolescents. Second, we considered the role of the home learning environment (learning conditions and parental involvement) in explaining ethnic status group differences. Third, we studied pandemic-related familial factors that contributed to positive home learning environments. The sample comprised 121 ethnic minority (Mage = 14.04; SD = 1.25; 53% female) and 105 ethnic majority adolescents (Mage = 14.36; SD = 1.25; 59% female) in Germany. Results of repeated measures analyses of covariances (ANCOVAs) showed distinct trajectories in adolescents' adjustment (Time  Ethnic status group interaction: ?p2 = .02 for academic self-efficacy and ?p2 = .03 for life satisfaction). Whereas ethnic minority adolescents reported stable academic self-efficacy and a decrease in life satisfaction, ethnic majority adolescents reported stable life satisfaction and an increase in academic self-efficacy. Accounting for learning conditions reduced the differences between minority and majority adolescents to nonsignificance. Parental involvement did not explain these differences, although it was itself important for adjustment outcomes in both groups. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that good student-teacher communication, a positive family climate and fathers' short-time work contributed to the home learning environment. Findings highlight the decisive role of the family context during home-learning and the importance of learning conditions in overcoming educational disparities.

Durable long-term humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies secreted by plasma cells that preexist subsequent exposures and by memory B cells that rapidly respond to infections once they have occurred. In the midst of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019, it is important to define our current understanding of the unique roles of memory B cells and plasma cells in immunity and the factors that control the formation and persistence of these cell types.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I2 = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I2 = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I2 = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I2 = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.","output":"Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease pandemic and the growing movements for social and racial equality have increased awareness of disparities in American health care that exist on every level.

There are over 23 million confirmed COVID-19 cases that have cause over 800 thousand deaths worldwide as of August 19th, 2020. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 presents a surface \\"spike\\" protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor to infect host cells. In addition to the respiratory tract, SARS-Cov-2 can also infect cells of the oral mucosa, which also express the ACE2 receptor. The spike and ACE2 proteins are highly glycosylated with sialic acid modifications that direct viral-host interactions and infection. Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) has a strong affinity for sialic acid modified proteins and can be used as an antiviral agent. Here, we report that MASL targets the ACE2 receptor, decreases ACE2 expression and glycosylation, suppresses binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and decreases expression of inflammatory mediators by oral epithelial cells that cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

Over 5 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 330,000 deaths have been recorded worldwide. Transmission is primarily spread through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets, the mouth, and/or nose secretions. Health care professionals (HCPs), including dental HCPs, are recognized to be at considerably high risk for infection due to the close proximity to patients and aerosol-generating procedures. During pregnancy, HCPs may be at even higher risk since pregnancy substantially increases the susceptibility to infectious diseases. OBJECTIVES: Here, we present the posed risks and potential effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal health. Current prevention and management strategies for COVID-19 on pregnant dental and HCPs are also discussed. RESULTS: Significant progress is being made in understanding the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of COVID-19. Pregnant women are affected more adversely with viral illnesses, although evidence of vertical transmission of COVID-19 is controversial. Based on the presence of atypical symptoms, the significant numbers of asymptomatic individuals who are COVID-19 positive, and the high susceptibility to viral diseases observed in pregnant women, recommendations have been put forth to limit the exposure of COVID-19-positive or even suspected cases to pregnant HCPs, and these are likely to evolve as new information becomes available. CONCLUSION: Pregnant HCPs require extra caution: not only are they considered a high-risk population, but their work at the frontline in a pandemic may expose them to additional risks. Complete awareness of the effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal/infant health, as well as prevention and management guidelines for pregnant HCPs, will allow for a safer work environment. Health care institutional policies aimed at protecting pregnant HCPs should consider avoiding their assignment as first responders, especially if equally trained staff are available.

Nineteen metal compounds that exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect during a previous screening run with a 100 microM fixed dose were tested with a 72-hour exposure over a wide range of concentrations (from 0.1 microM to 1000 microM), to produce dose-effect curves to permit extrapolation of the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values for each metal compound. This allows the establishment of a suitable range of doses for individual metal species, for use in the subsequent Balb/3T3 assay based on a two-stage concurrent cytotoxicity and morphological transformation protocol. Another 13 metal compounds were also tested, to determine whether the Balb/3T3 cell transformation assay is really a valuable in vitro model in relation to the problem of metal speciation. Of the metal compounds assayed, 26 showed a dose related cytotoxic response with calculated IC50 values ranging from 0.25 microM (CH3HgCl) to 140 microM [(C5H5)2TiCl2], whereas six metal compounds, namely (NH4)6Mo7O24*4H2O, CH3AsO(OH)2, C2H6AsNaO2(3H2O, KBr, CrCl3*6H2O and (NH4)2[TiO(C2O4)2]*H2O, displayed no observable cytotoxicity or low cytotoxicity at all the doses tested.

Dose-effect curves and IC50 values of different chemical forms of individual metal compounds of As, Br, Cr, Hg, Ir, Pt, Te, Ti and V (cationic/anionic inorganic or organometallic species) showed clearly how the chemical nature of the metal strongly influences the toxic response. This confirms that the Balb/3T3 cell line is a valuable in vitro model with respect to the problem of metal speciation. This is a fundamental aspect to be considered when incorporating the results from in vitro cell transformation assays of the carcinogenic potential of metal compounds into regulatory testing schemes.

Results were matched to interim weekly surveillance viral testing and symptom data. RESULTS: With the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, 15 (14.0%) students were seropositive at semester start; 29 (27.1%) students were seropositive at semester end; 10 (9.3%) were seropositive at both times. With the AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay, 17 (16.3%) students were seropositive at semester start, 37 (35.6%) were seropositive at semester end, and 16 (15.3%) were seropositive at both times.

It is argued that developing more sensitive, easy to administer, and valid MCI screening tools for use in primary care settings may initiate timely clinical and personal care planning and treatment, enabling early access to programs and services. Including functional competence measures in screening tests makes them more ecologically valid and may help to identify cognitive deficits at an earlier stage. OBJECTIVE: We aim to conduct a preliminary evaluative study comparing the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the BrainFx Screen (referred to as SCREEN hereafter), a novel digital tool designed to assess functional competence and detect early signs of cognitive impairment, with the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment, a validated and highly sensitive tool that detects MCI in the older adult population. We will also investigate the perceived usefulness and integration of the SCREEN into primary care practice to identify demonstrable impacts on clinical workflow and health care providers (HCP) perceptions of its success as a screening tool. Patients perceptions of completing the SCREEN and its impact on their quality of life will also be explored. METHODS: This study has a concurrent, mixed methods, prospective, and quasi-experimental design. Participants will be recruited from 5 primary care family health teams (FHTs; defined by multidisciplinary practice and capitated funding) across southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants will include HCPs, patients, care partners, and FHT administrative executives. Patients 55 years and older with no history of diagnoses for MCI, dementia, or Alzheimer disease rostered in one of the FHTs participating in the study will be eligible to participate. Their care partners will help triangulate the qualitative data collected from patients. Participating FHTs will identify an occupational therapist from their site to participate in the study; this HCP will both administer the research protocol and participate in semistructured in-depth interviews and questionnaires. Principal component analysis will be conducted on the SCREEN data to understand the test components better. Tests comparing sensitivity, specificity, and test-retest reliability will assess the validity of SCREEN as a screening tool for MCI. RESULTS: This paper describes the study protocol and its activities to date. Data collection was halted early because of COVID-19 restrictions on research activity, and data analysis is currently in progress. CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the project, we anticipate having an initial comparative evaluation of the SCREEN as a tool for early detection of MCI in primary care older adult patient populations. Resource constraints on this research study limit our ability to conduct a randomized controlled trial; however, the results will assist developers of the SCREEN in determining whether rigorous controlled testing is warranted.

It remains challenging to define a proper threshold to classify LVA, and it is unknown whether unipolar, bipolar, and the recently introduced omnipolar voltage mapping techniques are complementary or contradictory in classifying LVAs. Therefore, this study examined similarities and dissimilarities in unipolar, bipolar, and omnipolar voltage mapping and explored the relation between various types of voltages and conduction velocity (CV). METHODS: Intraoperative epicardial mapping (interelectrode distance 2 mm, 1900 sites) was performed during sinus rhythm in 21 patients (4813 years, 9 male) with atrial volume overload. Cliques of 4 electrodes (22 mm) were used to calculate the maximal unipolar, bipolar, and omnipolar voltages and mean CV. Areas with maximal bipolar or omnipolar clique voltage 0.5 mV were defined as LVA. RESULTS: The maximal unipolar clique voltage was not only larger than maximal bipolar clique voltage but also larger than maximal omnipolar clique voltage (7.08 [4.22C10.59] mV versus 5.27 [2.39C9.56] mV and 5.77 [2.58C10.52] mV, respectively, P<0.001). In addition, the largest bipolar clique voltage was on average 1.66 (range: 1.0C59.0) times larger to the corresponding perpendicular bipolar voltage pair. LVAs identified by a bipolar or omnipolar threshold corresponded to a broad spectrum of unipolar voltages and, although CV was generally decreased, still high CVs and large unipolar voltages were found in these LVAs. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial volume overload, there were considerable discrepancies in the different types of LVAs. Additionally, the identification of LVAs was hampered by considerable directional differences in bipolar voltages. Even using directional independent omnipolar voltage to identify LVAs, high CVs and large unipolar voltages are present within these areas. Therefore, a combination of low unipolar and low omnipolar voltage may be more indicative of true LVAs.","output":"Identification of Low-Voltage Areas: A Unipolar, Bipolar, and Omnipolar Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the lockdown, various changes of dietary habits are observed, including both positive and negative ones.

The study aimed to analyze the changes in the food choice determinants of secondary school students in a national sample of Polish adolescents within the Polish Adolescents COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population. The study was conducted in May 2020, based on the random quota sampling of schools (for voivodeships and counties) and a number of 2448 students from all the regions of Poland participated. The Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ) (36 items) was applied twiceto analyze separately current choices (during the period of COVID-19 pandemic) and general choices (when there was no COVID-19 pandemic). For both the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, sensory appeal and price were indicated as the most important factors (with the highest scores). However, differences were observed between the scores of specific factors, while health (p < 0.0001) and weight control (p < 0.0001) were declared as more important during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the period before, but mood (p < 0.0001) and sensory appeal (p < 0.0001) as less important.

If a coal mining enterprise loses its SLO, it may face risks in operations, which may lead to value chain risks. One of the causes of enterprise failure as related to coal mining operations is the inability to reliably assess/manage risk holistically and the inability to understand that lack of SLO is a critical risk. Although financial risks are typically assessed for mining projects, lack of SLO risk should also be taken into account starting as early as the bankable feasibility study. Furthermore, as it is difficult to establish a proactive decision-making policy for SLO risk in coal mining operations, the Operational Risk Management (ORM) methodology is probably a good tool to apply towards that goal. For this reason, a Mining Operational Risk Management Model (MORMM) was developed to incorporate risk probabilities and risk severities evaluated by experts. The final risk assessment is coded using Risk Assessment Codes (RACs). A hypothetical scenario was developed utilizing the MORMM model in order to illustrate how risks can be managed during the SLO granting process. This scenario describes a hypothetical coal mining project evaluated by virtual risk evaluators under specific hazard categories. Risk evaluation involves the assessment of risk probability and risk severity. Through this scenario this paper presents ways: (i) to establish a baseline ORM process that will be applicable to any coal mining operation environment, and (ii) to provide a theoretical example to demonstrate how the method can be applied to coal mining operations. The resulting RACs can provide critical information to decision makers regarding the rejection, acceptance or re-engineering of the mining business plan.","output":"The importance of the Social License to Operate at the investment and operations stage of coal mining projects: Application using a Decision Support System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed conventional patterns of medical practice across all health disciplines, including oral and maxillofacial surgery.

The purpose of this study is to compare the CT patterns and clinical characteristics in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 218 consecutive patients (136 males; 82 females; mean age 6315 years) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-coV-2. Patients were categorized in two different groups: (a) ICU patients and (b) non-ICU inpatients. We assessed the type and extent of pulmonary opacities on chest CT exams and recorded the information on comorbidities and laboratory values for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 218 patients, 23 (20 males: 3 females; mean age 60 years) required ICU admission, 195 (118 males: 77 females, mean age 64 years) were admitted to a clinical ward. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were predominantly males (60% versus 83% p=0.03), had more comorbidities, a positive CRP (p=0.04) and higher LDH values (p=0.008). ICU patients' chest CT demonstrated higher incidence of consolidation (p=0.03), mixed lesions (p=0.01), bilateral opacities (p<0.01) and overall greater lung involvement by consolidation (p=0.02) and GGO (p=0.001).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein. Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection. Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment. Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice. Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient. Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab. Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.

While concentrated research efforts are underway to develop antibody-based vaccines that would neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccine candidates are currently in Phase III clinical trials or have received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e. neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data, and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2 S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.

Thus, we aimed to analyze the plasma miRNA profile at COVID-19 onset to identify miRNAs as early prognostic biomarkers of severity and survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma miRNome of 96 COVID-19 patients that developed asymptomatic/mild, moderate and severe disease was sequenced together with a group of healthy controls. Plasma immune-related biomarkers were also assessed. COVID-19 patients showed 200 significant differentially expressed (SDE) miRNAs concerning healthy controls, with upregulated putative targets of SARS-CoV-2, and inflammatory miRNAs. Among COVID-19 patients, 75 SDE miRNAs were observed in asymptomatic/mild compared to symptomatic patients, which were involved in platelet aggregation and cytokine pathways, among others. Moreover, 137 SDE miRNAs were identified between severe and moderate patients, where miRNAs targeting the SARS CoV-2 genome were the most strongly disrupted. Finally, we constructed a mortality predictive risk score (miRNA-MRS) with ten miRNAs. Patients with higher values had a higher risk of 90-days mortality (hazard ratio = 4.60; p-value < 0.001). Besides, the discriminant power of miRNA-MRS was significantly higher than the observed for age and gender (AUROC = 0.970 vs. 0.881; p = 0.042).

This medically underserved population is diverse, with complex sexualities and gender identities, and distinct health concerns. SGM persons experience disproportionate risks for, and rates of, anal, breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, lung, and prostate cancers, in addition to cancers affecting transgender persons who have undergone sex-reassignment. SGM individuals are linked by shared experiences of stigmatization as a minority population for which little cancer research has been conducted. SGM cancer patients frequently report reluctance to seek healthcare, have poorer outcomes following diagnosis, engage in elevated risk behaviors (i.e. smoking and alcohol use) even after cancer diagnosis, have difficulty making emotional adjustment to illness, and experience higher rates of psychological distress. They report less satisfaction with cancer care, deficiencies in patient-centeredness and shared decision-making, gaps in care, and social isolation. Minority stress resulting from experiences of anti-SGM sentiment and discrimination affects cancer patients and their informal cancer caregivers. Our paper presents findings from a pilot study to identify gaps and opportunities to improve cancer care for SGM patients and caregivers at the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center. METHODS: Between June 2020 and July 2021, we used a multi-methods research design informed by ecological theory to collect qualitative and quantitative data regarding cancer patient and caregiver quality of life (QoL) and experiences of cancer and survivorship care. We used PROMIS measures distributed via REDCap to assess QoL (i.e., fatigue, pain interference, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, emotional support, social isolation, and companionship), and conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews. We recruited 10 SGM cancer patients and 8 heterosexual, cisgender (H/C) patient matches, and their self-identified informal cancer caregivers (n=36, dyad total n=18). Interviews ranged from 1 to 2 hours, were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis. The study was approved by the University of New Mexico Human Research Protections Office Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: Results of the PROMIS QoL assessments indicated that SGM patients reported greater anxiety [mean (SD) = 54.5 (8.8)] and depression [mean (SD) = 49.3 (4.8)] than H/C patients [mean (SD)=51.6 (7.5) and 45.4 (6.8) respectively], while heterosexual, cisgender (H/C) patients reported higher fatigue [mean (SD) =52.04 (8.18)] and stronger pain intensity than SGM patients [mean (SD)=48.3 (9.1) and 37.8 (9.1) respectively]. SGM patients reported higher levels of social isolation [mean (SD) = 48.3 (7.3) vs. 42.1 (7.4) for H/C patients, whereas H/C patients reported more emotional support (mean (SD) =57.5 (9.3) vs. 53.0 (6.9)] and companionship [mean (SD) = 55.2 (8.6) vs. 51.5 (11.0)]. SGM and H/C differences in caregiver QoL were most notable with regards to higher levels of fatigue [mean (SD) = 47.1 (6.0) for SGM, and 42.4 (11.5) for H/C] and companionship [mean (SD) = 55.3 (6.0) for SGM, and 50.9 (5.5) for H/C]. Qualitative interviews supported our quantitative results. SGM patients and caregivers articulated experiences of anti-SGM stigma and discrimination contributing to minority stress that influenced their initial cancer care encounters. SGM dyads had more trepidation and/or medical mistrust during initial cancer care encounters when compared to H/C patients and caregivers. SGM patients questioned care that was not culturally responsive to SGM preferences, while H/C patients were more apt to identify gaps in communication and perceived lack of clarity regarding cancer care delivery. Although SGM patients experienced high satisfaction with their cancer care once they developed trust with their providers, they discussed desires to have more direct conversations with their oncologists about their sexual orientation and gender identities and sexual health. All patients and providers in the study (SGM and H/C) appreciated their oncology care teams. All patients and caregivers relied on social networks comprised of friends and family, although SGM patients and caregivers had smaller social networks and relied less on biological family, and single SGM individuals experienced challenges accessing cancer care and struggled with social isolation. We discovered too, that all caregivers, regardless of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI), perceived a lack of support and information pertaining to their loved ones treatment, side effects and best way to provide care. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that prior stigmatizing experiences contribute to minority stress and medical mistrust for SGM cancer patients and their informal caregivers across the cancer care experience. Findings point to specific gaps in SGM cancer patient care, including lack of conversation about patient SOGI, inadequate staff and oncology provider SGM specific knowledge and cultural competence/cultural humility training, and insufficient patient supports for those who lack social support during cancer care treatment. Further, this study reveals inadequacies in SGM specific support, and overall support services for informal cancer caregivers. Additional research is required to develop targeted interventions to address minority stress and clinic environment concerns to improve cancer care for SGM patients. Importantly, while there were differences between SGM and H/C experiences of cancer treatment, significant similarities also emerged. Caregiver expressed consensus about the current lack of support and guidance for informal caregivers of cancer patients. Future work should focus on providing caregiver-specific resources in the clinic setting and facilitating support groups for caregivers to network with one another, as well as for tailoring SGM specific caregiver support services. Our findings highlight areas for improving cancer care for the SGM community, as well as a broader population of patients and caregivers.","output":"Improving Sexual and Gender Minority Cancer Care:

past decade. But there is now concern that the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction, with a rise in morbidity and mortality associated with prescription opioid misuse and abuse. Yet despite potential problems, opioids are a mainstay for the treatment of pain and are an important component of a comprehensive pain management strategy. Therefore, the overall goal of pain management is to decrease pain and to improve patient functioning and quality of life, while monitoring for adverse effects or aberrant behaviors. That is, to balance effective chronic pain management with appropriate use of opioids. Toward this end, several abuse deterrent strategies (formulations) have been, and continue to be, developed. Several major ones are reviewed here. These products should be a first step in trying to address diversion and abuse in a manner that does not discriminate against any particular patient and aligns with universal prescribing precautions. They should also comprise only one aspect of an overall opioid risk management plan.","output":"Opioid formulations with sequestered naltrexone: a perspective review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of COVID-19 social distancing recommendations, social media assumed a central - if unofficial - role in ensuring that individuals remained informed and connected throughout the pandemic. Yet while research shows that social media can be an effective platform for connecting individuals socially and fostering social support exchanges, both the platforms and the support exchanged therein have been mired in considerable controversies regarding their use as a tool for positive social engagement. The goal of this study is to qualitatively evaluate longitudinal changes to social media engagement during social distancing recommendations and orders to shelter-in-place. To do this, we collected longitudinal, qualitative survey data from a group of adults over the eight weeks during which most states had issued orders to shelter-in-place. We analyze data for evidence of social connection, stress reduction, and support exchange, and evaluate the impact of online social ties on staying informed and on compliance with CDC recommendations and shelter-in-place orders. Results showed a clear longitudinal evolution of users online social engagement. Early use was characterized by agentic purposeful engagement, information sharing, and community resource mobilization. However, over time these patterns gave way to more passive use characterized by listlessness, contentiousness and misinformation as the pandemic wore on in weeks. As social media comes to occupy an increasingly important role in the exchange of information (and misinformation) this study has important implications for the health of users and the role of social media in future disasters, including how social media impacts both stress and health related behaviors.","output":"Social media as a modern Emergency Broadcast System: A longitudinal qualitative study of social media during COVID-19 and its impacts on social connection and social distancing compliance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) quickly spread worldwide, and the syndrome it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has reached pandemic proportions. Around 30% of patients with COVID-19 experience severe respiratory distress and are admitted to the intensive care unit for comprehensive critical care. Patients with COVID-19 often present an enhanced immune response with a hyperinflammatory state characterized by a cytokine storm, which may reflect changes in the microbiota composition. Moreover, the evolution to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may increase the severity of COVID-19 and related dysbiosis. During critical illness, the multitude of therapies administered, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, body position, invasive mechanical ventilation, and nutritional support, may enhance the inflammatory response and alter the balance of patients' microbiota. This status of dysbiosis may lead to hyper vulnerability in patients and an inappropriate response to critical circumstances. In this context, the aim of our narrative review is to provide an overview of possible interaction between patients' microbiota dysbiosis and clinical status of severe COVID-19 with ARDS, taking into consideration the characteristic hyperinflammatory state of this condition, respiratory distress, and provide an overview on possible nutritional strategies for critically ill patients with COVID-19-ARDS.","output":"The Role of Dysbiosis in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To understand the effect of COVID-19 lockdown measures on severity of illness and mortality in non-COVID-19 acute medical admissions. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: 3 large acute medical receiving units in NHS Lothian, Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Non-COVID-19 acute admissions (n=1682) were examined over the first 31 days after the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown policy in the UK on 23 March 2019. Patients admitted over a matched interval in the previous 5 years were used as a comparator cohort (n=14 954). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demography, biochemical markers of clinical acuity and 7-day hospital inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Non-COVID-19 acute medical admissions reduced by 44.9% across all three sites in comparison with the mean of the preceding 5 years (p<0.001). Patients arriving during this period were more likely to be male, of younger age and to arrive by emergency ambulance transport. Non-COVID-19 admissions during lockdown had a greater incidence of acute kidney injury, lactic acidaemia and an increased risk of hospital death within 7 days (4.2% vs 2.5%), which persisted after adjustment for confounders (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.41, p<0.001).

Analytical analysis of media ethylacetate extracts using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was carried out. Furthermore, the obtained LC-MS data were statistically processed with MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Molecular docking studies were performed for the dereplicated metabolites against COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ). Metabolomic profiling revealed the presence of 18 compounds belonging to different chemical classes. Quinones, polyketides and isocoumarins were the most abundant classes. Multivariate analysis revealed that potato dextrose broth and modified potato dextrose broth are the optimal media for metabolites production. Molecular docking studies declared that the metabolites, Aspergillide B1 and 3a-Hydroxy-3, 5-dihydromonacolin L showed the highest binding energy scores towards COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ) (-9473) and (-9386), respectively, and they interact strongly with the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) amino acid residues of Mpro .

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an online, multidisciplinary radiology curriculum to teach radiology to medical students in Egypt. A multidisciplinary team of radiologists, surgeons, and internists taught a series of 5 case-based radiology sessions on a web conference platform. Topics included common clinical case scenarios for various body systems. Undergraduate medical students across Egypt were enrolled in the course. A pre-testCpost-test design was used to evaluate the efficacy of each session. Upon course completion, students filled out a subjective survey to assess the radiology education series. RESULTS: On average, 1000 students attended each session. For each session, an average of 734 students completed both the pre-test and post-test. There was a statistically significant increase in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores across all 5 sessions (p < 0.001) with an overall average score improvement of 63%. A subjective survey at the end of the course was completed by 1027 students. Over 96% of students found the lecture series to be a worthwhile experience that increased their imaging knowledge and interest in radiology, and that the use of a multidisciplinary approach added educational value. About 66% of students also reported that the session topics were excellent and clinically important. There was a marked increase in reported confidence levels in radiology competencies before and after attendance of the sessions.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the variability and the genotypic diversity of clinical strains circulating in the community. Since most reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays available cannot differentiate HRV from other members of the family Picornaviridae, we also validated an assay specific for HRV detection. The 5' noncoding regions of 87 different HRV serotypes and clinical isolates were sequenced. On the basis of sequence analysis and phylogenetic determination, we first confirmed that all clinical isolates were HRV. We then validated a real-time RT-PCR assay that was able not only to detect all HRV serotypes and all clinical isolates tested but also to accurately discriminate between rhinovirus and other viruses from the family Picornaviridae. This assay was negative with isolates of coxsackievirus (types A and B), echovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and poliovirus, as well as nonpicornaviruses. Among a series of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, 4% (7 of 161) were positive by culture, whereas 13% (21 of 161) were positive by RT-PCR.

Nevertheless, the extent to which Myd88 regulates type I interferon (IFN) versus proinflammatory factors and T cell function, as well as the anatomical site of action, varies extensively with the pathogen. CNS infection by neurotropic coronavirus with replication confined to the brain and spinal cord induces protective IFN-/ via Myd88-independent activation of melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). However, a contribution of Myd88-dependent signals to CNS pathogenesis has not been assessed. Infected Myd88(-/-) mice failed to control virus, exhibited enhanced clinical disease coincident with increased demyelination, and succumbed to infection within 3 weeks. The induction of IFN-/, as well as of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was impaired early during infection. However, defects in both IFN-/ and select proinflammatory factors were rapidly overcome prior to T cell recruitment. Myd88 deficiency also specifically blunted myeloid and CD4 T cell recruitment into the CNS without affecting CD8 T cells. Moreover, CD4 T cells but not CD8 T cells were impaired in IFN- production. Ineffective virus control indeed correlated most prominently with reduced antiviral IFN- in the CNS of Myd88(-/-) mice. The results demonstrate a crucial role for Myd88 both in early induction of innate immune responses during coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis and in specifically promoting protective CD4 T cell activation. In the absence of these responses, functional CD8 T cells are insufficient to control viral spread within the CNS, resulting in severe demyelination. IMPORTANCE During central nervous system (CNS) infections, signaling through the adaptor protein Myd88 promotes both innate and adaptive immune responses. The extent to which Myd88 regulates antiviral type I IFN, proinflammatory factors, adaptive immunity, and pathology is pathogen dependent. These results reveal that Myd88 protects from lethal neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis by accelerating but not enhancing the induction of IFN-/, as well as by promoting peripheral activation and CNS accumulation of virus-specific CD4 T cells secreting IFN-. By controlling both early innate immune responses and CD4 T cell-mediated antiviral IFN-, Myd88 signaling limits the initial viral dissemination and is vital for T cell-mediated control of viral loads. Uncontrolled viral replication in the absence of Myd88 leads to severe demyelination and pathology despite overall reduced inflammatory responses. These data support a vital role of Myd88 signaling in protective antimicrobial functions in the CNS by promoting proinflammatory mediators and T cell-mediated IFN- production.","output":"Myd88 Initiates Early Innate Immune Responses and Promotes CD4 T Cells during Coronavirus Encephalomyelitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapy lecturers faced the challenge of rapidly shifting from face-to-face to online education. This retrospective case-control study aims to compare students satisfaction and performances shown in an online course to a control group of students who underwent the same course delivered face-to-face in the previous five years. METHODS: Between March and April 2020, a class (n = 46) of entry-level physiotherapy students (University of Verona - Italy), trained by an experienced physiotherapist, had 24-hours online lessons. Students exposed to the same course in the previous five academic years (n = 112), delivered with face-to-face conventional lessons, served as a historical control. The course was organized in 3 sequential phases: (1) PowerPoint presentations were uploaded to the University online platform, (2) asynchronous video recorded lectures were provided on the same platform, and (3) between online lectures, the lecturer and students could communicate through an email chat to promote understanding, dispel any doubts and collect requests for supplementary material (e.g., scientific articles, videos, webinars, podcasts). Outcomes were: (1) satisfaction as routinely measured by University with a national instrument and populated in a database; (2) performance as measured with an oral examination. RESULTS: We compared satisfaction with the course, expressed on a 5-point Likert scale, resulting in no differences between online and face-to-face teaching (Kruskal-Wallis (2) = 0.24, df = 1, p = 0.62). We weighted up students results by comparing their mean performances with the mean performances of the same course delivered face-to-face in the previous five years, founding a statistical significance in favour of online teaching (Wilcoxon rank sum test W = 1665, p < 0.001).

Exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. Here, we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood and lung of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that inflammatory transitional and nonclassical monocytes and CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, this study increases the knowledge of specific myeloid subsets involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of therapeutic strategies for fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"COVID-19 severity associates with pulmonary redistribution of CD1c+ DCs and inflammatory transitional and nonclassical monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As large-scale immunization programs against COVID-19 proceed around the world, safety signals will emerge that need rapid evaluation. We report population-based, age- and sex-specific background incidence rates of potential adverse events of special interest (AESI) in eight countries using thirteen databases. METHODS: This multi-national network cohort study included eight electronic medical record and five administrative claims databases from Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, mapped to a common data model. People observed for at least 365 days before 1 January 2017, 2018, or 2019 were included. We based study outcomes on lists published by regulators: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bells palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, and transverse myelitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and database. We pooled rates across databases using random effects meta-analyses. We classified meta-analytic estimates into Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences categories: very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare. FINDINGS: We analysed 126,661,070 people. Rates varied greatly between databases and by age and sex. Some AESI (e.g., myocardial infarction, Guillain-Barre syndrome) increased with age, while others (e.g., anaphylaxis, appendicitis) were more common in young people. As a result, AESI were classified differently according to age. For example, myocardial infarction was very rare in children, rare in women aged 35-54 years, uncommon in men and women aged 55-84 years, and common in those aged 85 years. INTERPRETATION: We report robust baseline rates of prioritised AESI across 13 databases.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for increased thrombogenesis, including antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs). We sought to better understand the relationship between a commonly used marker of thrombosis, D-dimer, and antiphospholipid antibodies in relation to thrombosis in COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective cohort study. Participants were adults admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 between March and December of 2020. Included patients required a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), coagulation studies, and regular assessment of D-dimer levels. Patients who were excluded were pregnant adults, use of oral anticoagulants prior to admission, and absence of a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal NAAT. We tested 52 patients for antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs), including lupus anticoagulant (LA), anti-beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies (B2GP), and anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL). The endpoint for analysis was hospital discharge or development of a confirmed thrombosis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of fifty-two patients (55.7%) with COVID-19 had non-negative APLs. Of these patients, twenty-seven (93.1%) had non-negative aCLs, the majority of which were IgM antibodies. There was a total of 7 thrombotic events in our cohort. The sensitivity of D-dimer alone was 85% and the sensitivity of APLs alone was 71%. In patients with an intermediate D-dimer level (i.e., greater than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) but less than 5 mg/L), the addition of non-negative APLs increased the sensitivity of D-dimer to 100%. In patients with a high D-dimer (i.e., greater than 5), the combined sensitivity of D-dimer and APLs was 60%. Out of the 7 thrombotic events in our cohort, two patients had negative APLs, however both patients had a D-dimer of greater than 5 mg/L. CONCLUSION: The use of APLs can assist in risk-stratifying patients in an intermediate-risk D-dimer group to consider prophylactic anticoagulation if APLs are negative and to consider therapeutic anticoagulation if APLs are non-negative. In the high-risk group (i.e., a D-dimer greater than 5 mg/dL), a therapeutic anticoagulation approach may be more appropriate. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"302.

In phase 4, enterprise production intensity achieved an increase of 7%. (2) The process of the RWP in China is closely related to NO2 TVCD. In the first three phases, significantly decreased emission sources of NO2 reduced the total value of NO2 by varying degrees in most provinces of the country. Correspondingly, in phase 4, the NO2 TVCD in some provinces recovered to the value of the same period in 2019, including typical industrial bases (Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, etc.) and economically developed coastal areas (Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang, etc.). (3) In phase 3, the intracity travel intensity in all cities improved, and the city relative recovery index (RRI) rose across the board. In particular, the western cities were better than the eastern cities. Among them, the RRIs of most cities in southwest China (Sichuan, Yunnan) and northwest China (Gansu) were more than 90%. Notably, the recovery situation exhibited an obvious \\"siege phenomenon,\\" and the recovery of core cities required a longer period. Overall, the sudden COVID-19 epidemic seriously affected the production of Chinese enterprises. However, benefitting from rapid and effective epidemic prevention and control measures, the resumption of work and production has been a success.

This study assessed levels of risk for exposure to COVID\\\\19 among nurses, and determined those at the greatest risk. DESIGN: A cross\\\\sectional design was used to assess risk for exposure to COVID\\\\19 in nurses from five randomly selected governmental hospitals in the United Arab Emirates. Participants completed an online survey (including the World Health Organization survey) to assess their risk for exposure to COVID\\\\19. Descriptive statistics were used to describe classes of risk for exposure, and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with greater risk. FINDINGS: Of the 552 participants, 284 nurses (51.4%) were classified at high risk for COVID\\\\19 exposure as they did not report adherence to infection control and prevention (ICP) guidelines at all times during healthcare interactions and when performing aerosol procedures, or had accidental exposure to biological fluid and respiratory secretions. Compared with adherence to wearing medical masks, gloves, and hand hygiene practices, adherence to wearing face shields or goggles and disposable gowns and decontaminating high\\\\touch surfaces was less frequent. Shifting to work in critical care units, not having adequate critical care experience, and reporting a need for training in ICP practices were factors that contributed to high\\\\risk exposure (p values for Ex (Bs) = 2.60, 2.16, 1.75,  0.05, consecutively). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of nurses were classified at high risk for COVID\\\\19 exposure.

A systematic review was performed to evaluate the evidence supporting different frequencies of routine follow-up. METHODS: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were searched from database inception to July 16, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies (PCS) evaluating different frequencies of routine follow-up. Citations were assessed by pairs of independent reviewers. Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for Cohort Studies. Findings were summarized narratively. RESULTS: The literature search identified 3316 studies, of which 7 (6 RCTs and 1 PCS) were eligible. Study endpoints included; quality of life (QoL; 5 RCTs and 1 PCS), disease free survival (DFS) (1 RCT), overall survival (OS) (1 RCT) and cost-effectiveness (1 RCT). The results showed reduction in follow-up frequency had no adverse effect on: QoL (6 studies, n = 920), DFS (1 trial, n = 472) or OS (1 trial, n = 472), but improved cost-effectiveness (1 trial, n = 472). Four RCTs specifically examined follow-up on-demand versus scheduled follow-up visits and found no statistically significant differences in QoL (n = 544). CONCLUSION: While no evidence-based guidelines suggest that follow-up of EBC patients improves DFS or OS, routinely scheduled in-person assessment is common.

Hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions have declined, raising concern that patients may be avoiding hospitals because of fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Other factors, including strain on health care systems, may also have had an indirect toll. OBJECTIVES: This investigation aimed to evaluate whether population-level deaths due to cardiovascular causes increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The authors conducted an observational cohort study using data from the National Center for Health Statistics to evaluate the rate of deaths due to cardiovascular causes after the onset of the pandemic in the United States, from March 18, 2020, to June 2, 2020, relative to the period immediately preceding the pandemic (January 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020). Changes in deaths were compared with the same periods in the previous year. RESULTS: There were 397,042 cardiovascular deaths from January 1, 2020, to June 2, 2020. Deaths caused by ischemic heart disease increased nationally after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, compared with changes over the same period in 2019 (ratio of the relative change in deaths per 100,000 in 2020 vs. 2019: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.18). An increase was also observed for deaths caused by hypertensive disease (1.17, 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.26), but not for heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, or other diseases of the circulatory system. New York City experienced a large relative increase in deaths caused by ischemic heart disease (2.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.39 to 4.09) and hypertensive diseases (2.64, 95% confidence interval: 1.52 to 4.56) during the pandemic. More modest increases in deaths caused by these conditions occurred in the remainder of New York State, New Jersey, Michigan, and Illinois but not in Massachusetts or Louisiana.

The aim of our study was to analyze if prior clinical characteristics among DM patients affected the risk of in hospital mortality compared with nondiabetic patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Material and Methods: The study was based on a retrospective, observational design and was conducted at two hospitals located in Albacete (Spain). All patients hospitalized with COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic until 7 July 2020 were included. Results: During the study period, 1468 patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19;402 of them had DM prior to hospitalization. DM was associated with higher in hospital mortality (28.6% versus 17.5%) in the univariate analysis. But, in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, presence of hypertension, smoking, presence of COPD, ACEI, ARB, antiplatelet, or anticoagulant therapy, DM was not a significant risk factor for death. Patients with DM2 receiving insulin treatment had a higher risk of in hospital death than nondiabetic patients (OR 1.78 [1.13-2.81], p=0.0126) after age was considered. The age-associated relative risk was 1.06 (1.05-1.07, p<0.001) per year, whereas the relative risk associated with DM2 treated with insulin compared with no DM was 1.57 (1.11-2.23, p=0.0111) suggesting that DM2 treated with insulin entails a risk of in hospital COVID-19 death equivalent to being 9 years older. When previous logistic regression models included other variables related to personal history and prior nondiabetic treatments, the risks described showed no change. Conclusion: This study confirms that pre-admission need for insulin therapy before hospitalization in patients with DM2 are associated with higher in hospital mortality due to COVID-19 in a large sample of DM inpatients with COVID-19.","output":"Identification of Specific Risk Factors for Mortality in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will continue to spread.

However, the scale-up of the vaccine is likely to be hindered by the widespread social media misinformation. We therefore conducted a study to assess the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Zimbabweans. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive online cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire among adults. The questionnaire assessed willingness to be vaccinated; socio-demographic characteristics, individual attitudes and perceptions, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the independent factors associated with vaccine uptake. RESULTS: We analysed data for 1168 participants, age range of 19C89 years with the majority being females (57.5%). Half (49.9%) of the participants reported that they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Majority were uncertain about the effectiveness of the vaccine (76.0%) and its safety (55.0%). About half lacked trust in the governments ability to ensure availability of an effective vaccine and 61.0% mentioned that they would seek advice from a healthcare worker to vaccinate.

The main clinical manifestations of DPN include pain, numbness, paraesthesia, and weakness of the lower limbs which often leads to diabetic foot ulceration, eventually resulting in amputation. Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, moxibustion has a great effect on treating and preventing DPN. However, randomized clinical trials done to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment are still lacking. Hence, this study is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion therapy on diabetic peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: This study will be a pilot, interventional, randomized, 2-armed, parallel, singled-masked, controlled trial. A total of 40 diabetes mellitus patients with peripheral neuropathy will be recruited and assigned randomly into 2 groups (moxibustion group and waiting group) at a 1:1 ratio. This trial consists of an 8-week intervention period and a 4-week follow-up period. During the intervention period, the moxibustion group will take 3 moxibustion sessions per week, whereas no intervention will be done on the waiting group to act as the control group. The outcome will be assessed by an outcome assessor who is unaware of the group assignment. The primary outcome will be pain assessment measured with algometry, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale, visual analogue scale, and neuropathy pain scale. The secondary outcome will be an evaluation of functional performance capacity with 6 minutes walking test, evaluation of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, and serum HbA1c and albumin levels.

Although a number of models have been developed in academic research labs, only a few models have been commercialized. Models from academic groups offer a broader range of phenotypes while the commercial models are more focused on the oral and gingival mucosa. The commercialized models are manufactured under highly controlled conditions and meet the requirements of quality standards, which leads to high levels of reproducibility. These in vitro models have been used to evaluate the irritancy of oral care products such as toothpastes, mouthwashes, and mucoadhesives. The effects of cigarette smoke on oral cavity tissues have been studied and compared to those of e-cigarettes. Oral tissue models have facilitated investigation of the mechanisms of oral mucositis and oral candidiasis and have been used to examine transbuccal drug delivery rates and the absorption of nanoparticles. Infection studies have investigated the effects of HIV-1 along with the effects of commensal and pathogenic bacteria. More recently, a differentiated oral tissue model has been shown to express the ACE2 receptor, which is known to be important for the receptor-mediated entry of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus into human cells and tissues. Hence, oral mucosal models may find application in determining whether viral infection of the oral mucosa is possible and whether such infection has implications vis-a-vis the current COVID-19 pandemic. As is apparent, these models are used in a broad variety of applications and often offer advantages versus animal models in terms of reproducibility, avoiding species extrapolation, and the ethical concerns related to human and animal experimentation.

The aim of the current study is to provide an overview of preintervention models for functional outcome after endovascular treatment and to validate these models with data from daily clinical practice. METHODS: We systematically searched within Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, to include prediction models. Models identified from the search were validated in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) registry, which includes all patients treated with endovascular treatment within 6.5 hours after stroke onset in the Netherlands between March 2014 and November 2017. Predictive performance was evaluated according to discrimination (area under the curve) and calibration (slope and intercept of the calibration curve). Good functional outcome was defined as a score of 0C2 or 0C3 on the modified Rankin Scale depending on the model. RESULTS: After screening 3468 publications, 19 models were included in this validation. Variables included in the models mainly addressed clinical and imaging characteristics at baseline. In the validation cohort of 3156 patients, discriminative performance ranged from 0.61 (SPAN-100 [Stroke Prognostication Using Age and NIH Stroke Scale]) to 0.80 (MR PREDICTS). Best-calibrated models were THRIVE (The Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events; intercept ?0.06 [95% CI, ?0.14 to 0.02]; slope 0.84 [95% CI, 0.75C0.95]), THRIVE-c (intercept 0.08 [95% CI, ?0.02 to 0.17]; slope 0.71 [95% CI, 0.65C0.77]), Stroke Checkerboard score (intercept ?0.05 [95% CI, ?0.13 to 0.03]; slope 0.97 [95% CI, 0.88C1.08]), and MR PREDICTS (intercept 0.43 [95% CI, 0.33C0.52]; slope 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85C1.01]). CONCLUSIONS: The THRIVE-c score and MR PREDICTS both showed a good combination of discrimination and calibration and were, therefore, superior in predicting functional outcome for patients with ischemic stroke after endovascular treatment within 6.5 hours. Since models used different predictors and several models had relatively good predictive performance, the decision on which model to use in practice may also depend on simplicity of the model, data availability, and the comparability of the population and setting.","output":"Outcome Prediction Models for Endovascular Treatment of Ischemic Stroke: Systematic Review and External Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammatory changes caused by viruses, bacteria, exposure to toxins, commonly used drugs and even surgical intervention have the potential of causing abnormal epithelial permeability, which is manifest as infiltrative processes on computed tomography (CT), including the widespread infiltrates seen in COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We utilized a previously published mouse model of ARDS, intranasal delivery of LPS, to induce the alveolar-capillary barrier permeability seen in lung disease. We intravenously injected mice with Cy7 or 68-Gallium ((68)Ga) labeled mouse albumin and imaged using optical imaging (OI)/CT and PET. We observed significantly increased lung levels of Cy7-albumin on 3D OI/CT, which matched the abnormal appearance on microCT. This uptake correlated with fluorescence seen on sectioned lungs. To examine the translational potential of these findings, we radiolabeled albumin with (68)Ga. We found that in mice with LPS-induced lung injury, (68)Ga-albumin PET correlated with our optical imaging findings and demonstrated abnormal activity in the lung fields, indicative of abnormal epithelial permeability. These findings indicate (68)Ga-albumin can be utilized as a sensitive translational radiotracer for quantifying the abnormal epithelial permeability that is seen in various lung pathologies, including COVID-19 induced pneumonia and ARDS. The ability to use Cy7-albumin 3D OI/CT imaging as a preclinical translational surrogate for (68)Ga-albumin offers an accessible high throughput means to rapidly screen potential therapeutics against lung diseases that clinically manifest with endothelial permeability.","output":"Multimodality molecular imaging of the alveolar-capillary barrier in lung disease using albumin based optical and PET tracers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This special issue of The American Journal of Community Psychology originated from the Society for Community Research and Action Criminal Justice interest group, with a goal of exploring the work of community psychologists intersecting with criminal justice research, practice, and policy and shaped by our shared values-equity, collaboration, creative maladjustment, social justice, and social science in the service of social justice.

We examined the magnitude and consistency of the sex differences in age-specific case-fatality rates (CFRs) in seven countries. METHODS: Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the national official agencies from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, Canada and Mexico. Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the seven countries, for all age-groups. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were conducted to evaluate the age and country contribution to differences. RESULTS: The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 1.71, 1.88, 2.11, 2.11, 1.84, 1.78 and 1.49, for ages 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+ respectively. In meta-regression, age group and country were associated with the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The sex differences in the age-specific CFRs are intriguing. Sex differences in the incidence and mortality have been found in many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the consistently greater case-fatality rates in males at all ages suggests that sex-related factors impact on the natural history of the disease. This could provide important clues as to the mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in some patients.","output":"Sex differences in the case-fatality rates for COVID-19-A comparison of the age-related differences and consistency over seven countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has highlighted the need for universal palliative care access.

Estrogen-based hormone therapy is an integral component of treatment; however, to date the ideal hormone formulation for optimizing bone health has not been established. OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of estrogen-based oral contraceptives (OCP) versus hormone therapy (HT) on bone mineral density (BMD) in women with POI. EVIDENCE REVIEW A systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted from conception until December 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that met inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias for RCTs. The study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews and adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. FINDINGS Our search yielded 1,227 studies; 3 RCTs and 2 observational cohort studies met inclusion criteria and were included in our study. The largest subpopulation was Turner Syndrome (n = 625), followed by idiopathic POI (n = 146). Of the four studies that assessed changes in BMD, two studies reported a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD with HT compared with OCP (+0.050 g/cm2, P < 0.025; +0.019 g/cm2, P < 0.01), one study found similar improvement in lumbar spine BMD across treatments (HT -0.003 g/cm2, P = 0.824), and one study did not directly compare treatments. Effects on bone turnover markers were inconsistent across three studies that evaluated this outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This is the first systematic review to include studies that directly compared OCP and HT on bone outcomes in POI. While two studies reported increased lumbar spine BMD with HT, this result was not consistently found across studies. There were important differences in POI etiology, treatment regimens and formulations, and risk of bias was high in many of the studies. These results indicate future, larger-scale trials are needed to further understand the optimal hormone therapy for bone density in POI.","output":"Comparing estrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormone therapy on bone mineral density in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The primary aim of this current theoretical paper is to propose a research framework on the influence of Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) on SMEs performance in Ghana with the role of Social Capital (SC) and Government Support Policies (GSPs).

However, mechanisms of unconventional secretion have been described that bypass the secretory pathway for the extracellular delivery of cytoplasmic molecules. Components of the autophagy pathway, an intracellular recycling process, have been shown to play a role in the unconventional secretion of cytoplasmic signaling proteins. Poliovirus is a lytic virus, although a few examples of apparently nonlytic spread have been documented. Real demonstration of nonlytic spread for poliovirus or any other cytoplasmic constituent thought to exit cells via unconventional secretion requires demonstration that a small amount of cell lysis in the cellular population is not responsible for the release of cytosolic material. Here, we use quantitative time-lapse microscopy to show the spread of infectious cytoplasmic material between cells in the absence of lysis. siRNA-mediated depletion of autophagy protein LC3 reduced nonlytic intercellular viral transfer. Conversely, pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway caused more rapid viral spread in tissue culture and greater pathogenicity in mice. Thus, the unconventional secretion of infectious material in the absence of cell lysis is enabled by components of the autophagy pathway. It is likely that other nonenveloped viruses also use this pathway for nonlytic intercellular spread to affect pathogenesis in infected hosts.","output":"Nonlytic viral spread enhanced by autophagy components."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to investigate the effect of the Bodypump exercise on women's' emotions and life satisfaction during the coronavirus epidemic.

We investigate sex hormone levels and their association with outcomes in COVID-19 patients, stratified by sex and age. Methods: This observational, retrospective, cohort study included 138 patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19, hospitalized in Italy between February 1 and May 30, 2020. The association between sex hormones (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone) and outcomes (ARDS, severe COVID-19, in-hospital mortality) was explored in 120 patients aged 50 years and over. STROBE checklist was followed. Findings: The median age was 735 years [IQR 61, 82];558% were male. In older males, testosterone was lower if ARDS and severe COVID-19 were reported than if not (36 vs. 53 nmol/L, p =00378 and 37 vs. 85 nmol/L, p =00011, respectively). Deceased males had lower testosterone (24 vs. 48 nmol/L, p =00536) and higher estradiol than survivors (40 vs. 24 pg/mL, p = 00006). Testosterone was negatively associated with ARDS (OR 0849 [95% CI 0734, 0982]), severe COVID-19 (OR 0691 [95% CI 0546, 0874]), and in-hospital mortality (OR 0742 [95% CI 0566, 0972]), regardless of potential confounders, though confirmed only in the regression model on males. Higher estradiol was associated with a higher probability of death (OR 1051 [95% CI 1018, 1.084]), confirmed in both sex models.

As cellular mechanisms of taste learning, long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is well studied. However, little is known about long-term changes of synaptic efficacy at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex. Here, we examined the synaptic mechanisms of long-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses in layer V pyramidal neurons of the mouse insular cortex. In response to a prolonged high-frequency stimulation (HFS), GABAergic synapses displayed endocannabinod (eCB)-mediated long-term depression (LTDGABA). When cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) were blocked by a CB1R antagonist, the same stimuli caused LTP at GABAergic synapses (LTPGABA) which was mediated by production of nitric oxide (NO) via activation of NMDA receptors. Intriguingly, NO signaling was necessary for the induction of LTDGABA. In the presence of leptin which blocks CB1 signaling, the prolonged HFS caused LTPGABA which was mediated by NO signaling. These results indicate that long-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex can be modulated by combined effects of eCB and NO signaling. These forms of GABAergic synaptic plasticity in the insular cortex may be crucial synaptic mechanisms in taste learning.","output":"CB1 cannabinoid receptor-mediated plasticity of GABAergic synapses in the mouse insular cortex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS Three autopsy cases were studied retrospectively. Routine HE stain was used to study all the cases. Part of the lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello's stain, viral inclusion body stain, reticulin and PAS stains, immunohistochemistry, thin sections with staining, light microscopy and transmission electronic microscope investigation. RESULTS The earliest symptom of all 3 cases was hyperpyrexia and followed by progressive dyspnea and appearance of lung field shadows in X rays findings. Pulmonary lesions included: bilateral and extensive consolidation, localized hemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative alveolitis and bronchitis, alveolar proliferation and desquamation, accumulation of protein exudates, mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells as well as hyaline membrane formation in alveoli and viral inclusion bodies were seen in the alveolus epithelial cells. The exudated organization tended to become glomeruloid organizing pneumonitis in a few avaoli. Lesions of the immune organs included: large patchy necrosis in the spleens and localized necrosis in the lymph nodes were seen. Bone marrow became restrained. There were lesions of systemic small vasculitis including edema of the perivascular tissue and vascular wall of the small veins with localized fibrinoid necrosis distributing in the heart, lungs, kidneys, adrenal glands and the striated muscles accompanying with mononuclear cells and lymphocytes infiltration. Thrombosis was seen in part of the small veins. In addition, there were also the systemic poisonous changes including: degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in lungs, liver, kidneys, heart and adrenals. Electronic microscopy demonstrated clusters of virus particles seen in the lung tissue. CONCLUSION SARS is a systemic disease. Lungs, immune system and systemic small vessels are the main target organs attacked by the virus.

Here, we evaluated the influence of aging metrics PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, we sought to model adaptive metabolic and inflammatory responses to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using individual PhenoAge components. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge components. RESULTS: We included 1068 subjects of whom 222 presented critical illness and 218 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO2 and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel>0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p<0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features.

These biomarkers are independent prognostic factors for cancer. Here, the most significant biomarker combination of these values was searched and studied in real-life advanced cancer patients of a single center. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed the association of the aforementioned biomarkers and their combination and OS of 75 consecutive cancer patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic diseases. Validated cut-off determination was used. Results: CRP, albumin, and PLR showed marked association with OS. Cut-off values for significant shorter OS were 30.65 mg/L (p < 0.001), 44.35 g/L (p < 0.001), and 168.20 (p < 0.001), respectively. Based on assessed biomarker cut-offs, four patient groups were created to determine whether biomarker values were out of range (ORV) compared to cut-off: 1) No ORV biomarkers (n = 24; OS = 26.07 months); 2) one ORV biomarker (n = 21; OS = 13.50 months); 3) two ORV biomarkers (n = 20; OS = 7.97 months), and 4) three ORV biomarkers (n = 10; OS = 3.91 months). Significant differences in OS were detected between the groups: For 1. vs. 2. hazard ratio (HR) = 3.0 (95% CI: 1.5-6.2), p = 0.003; for 1. vs. 3. HR = 4.1 (95% CI: 2.0-8.3), p < 0.001; and for 1. vs. 4. HR = 10.2 (95% CI: 4.2-24.6), p < 0.001. Conclusion: Based on our analysis, we can confirm that the complex monitoring of CRP, albumin, and PLR would provide a good estimation of OS.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective observational cohort study of 410 consecutive pregnant women with preexisting diabetes categorized according to aspirin prophylaxis strategy, with the prevalence of preeclampsia as primary outcome. In total, 207 women were included after implementation of prophylactic aspirin for all pregnant women with preexisting diabetes in February 2018 (all-cohort). The 203 women included before this date, where aspirin prophylaxis was risk based and only prescribed to selected women (selected-cohort), were studied for comparison. RESULTS Aspirin was prescribed at 10 gestational weeks for 88% (all-cohort) compared with 25% (selected-cohort). HbA1c, parity, chronic hypertension, home blood pressure, microalbuminuria/diabetic nephropathy, and smoking were similar in the two cohorts in early pregnancy. In the all-cohort, fewer women had type 2 diabetes (32% vs. 42%, respectively; P = 0.04) and BMI tended to be lower (P = 0.05). The prevalence of preeclampsia was similar (12% vs. 11%, P = 0.69) in the two cohorts, and this was also the case with stratification for diabetes type. Prevalence of preterm delivery <37 weeks (23% vs. 27%, P = 0.30), preterm preeclampsia (7% vs. 7%, P = 0.96), and infants large (40% vs. 32%, P = 0.07) and small (7% vs. 6%, P = 0.88) for gestational age was similar in the two cohorts.

In this semiarid environment, rainfall varies annually and dramatically influences cover by both native and exotic annual plants; degu population density affects the composition and cover of exotic and native annual plants. In low-rainfall years, cover of both native and exotic herbs is extremely low. Higher levels of precipitation result in proportional increases in cover of all annual plants (exotic and native species), leading in turn to increases in degu population densities, at which point they impact native herbs in proportion to their greater cover, indirectly favoring the expansion of exotic plants.

While many of our patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) wonder whether it is safe to get the vaccine, vaccine hesitancy is rising among the general population. We assessed the willingness to get vaccination and its probable predictors among patients with RD compared to healthcare workers and a sample from the general population. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey in a cross-sectional design in 3 groups of participants just before the mass vaccination program in Istanbul, Turkey. The questionnaire sought socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 related risk factors, willingness to get vaccination, and concerns and thoughts about vaccine. COVID-19 anxiety scale (CAS) was also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied in total 732 patients with RD (Group 1), 763 individuals representing general population (Group 2) and 320 hospital workers (Group 3). Dysfunctional anxiety related to COVID-19 was found in 4.9%, 3.8% and 4.1%, in Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Of the patients with RD, 29.2% were willing to be vaccinated, 19.0% were unwilling and 51.8% were undecided. These were somewhat similar among the general population (yes: 34.6%, no: 23.3% and unsure: 42.1%), with significantly less undecided individuals (p < 0.001).

In this direction, we propose the fabrication of nano-enabled protective gears, masks, gloves, sheets, filtration units, nano-emulsified disinfectants, paints, and detection systems to facilitate improved quarantine or antiviral spaces. Functional protective gears can even tackle the aerosol distribution of infectious strains transmitted through respiratory fluids and pollutants within droplets, aerosols, air, and particulates.","output":"Antibacterial and antiviral high-performance nano-systems to mitigate new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ImportanceMaintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients have a high mortality risk after COVID-19 and an altered humoral response to vaccines, but vaccine clinical efficacy remains unknown in this population. ObjectiveTo estimate the association between vaccination and COVID-19 hospitalization rate in MHD patients DesignUsing Bayesian multivariable spatiotemporal models, we estimated the expected number of SARS-CoV-2 severe infections (infections with hospital admission) in MHD patients from simultaneous cases in the general population. SettingFrench population-based retrospective analysis in MHD and non-dialysis patients. ParticipantsModels were fitted from 3620 hospitalizations of MHD patients and 457,160 hospitalizations in the general population. ExposureSevere SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population and vaccine exposure. Main Outcome and MeasureWeekly incidence of severe infections in MHD patients. ResultsDuring the first epidemic wave, incidence of severe infections in MHD patients was approximately proportional to incidence in the general population. However, our model overestimated incidence during the second wave, suggesting an effect of prevention measures during the 2nd wave. A second model (based on data up to the end of the 2nd wave) estimated that the risk in MHD patients decreased between waves 1 and 2, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.76). Moreover, while this model correctly estimated the reported MHD cases up to the end of the 2nd wave, predictions overestimated the expected number of cases from the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Using vaccination coverages as additional predictors permitted to correctly fit the weekly reported number of cases, with IRR in MHD patients of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.58) for vaccine exposure in MHD patients and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.61) per 10% increase in vaccination coverage in the same-age general population. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest that both individual and herd immunity due to vaccination may yield a protective effect against severe forms of COVID-19 in MHD patients. QuestionWhether vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 limits hospitalization rates in hemodialysis patients is still unknown. FindingsBy modeling the dynamics of 3620 hospital admissions for SARS-CoV-2 infections among hemodialysis patients, as a proportion of 457,160 cases reported in the French general population from March 2020 to April 2021, we identified vaccination coverage in both hemodialysis patients and the general population as independently associated with protection of hemodialysis patients against severe infection.

This research lays the foundation for the appropriate use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer, reduced costs of ecological restoration, and phytoremediation of environmental pollution by using this intercropping system. The main greenhouse pot experiment was conducted using 1.92 mg kg-1 Cd-contaminated soil. NH4 +-N fertilizer and NO3 --N fertilizer treatments were performed along with no nitrogen fertilizer treatment as the control. The results indicate that intercropping could decrease the Cd uptake of maize compared with maize monocropping, but the biomass of maize would decrease under the intercropping mode. The application of N fertilizer to the maize-S. nigrum intercropping system could increase the total biomass of maize and S. nigrum. Compared with the NO3 --N fertilizer treatment, the Cd content of stem, leaf and grain tissues of S. nigrum significantly increased by 9.43%, 22.2%, and 8.33%, respectively, under the NH4 +-N fertilizer treatment. The bioconcentration and translocation factors of S. nigrum significantly increased by 11.1% and 15.3%. Moreover, the Cd content of stem, leaf, and grain tissues of maize decreased by 26.5%, 21.2%, and 21.4%, respectively. The bioconcentration and translocation factors of maize significantly decreased by 38.8% and 46.7%. The application of N fertilizers promoted the accumulation of Cd in maize roots, while Cd content decreased in maize shoots. Compared with NO3 --N fertilizer, NH4 +-N fertilizer can improve Cd accumulation in various S. nigrum tissues under intercropping, which could reduce Cd accumulation in maize under intercropping. Therefore, the application of NH4 +-N fertilizer is recommended for satisfactory bioremediation when using the Cd-hyperaccumulator S. nigrum and for supporting the safe production of maize in Cd-contaminated soil, thus enabling the goal of simultaneous agricultural production and remediation.","output":"Effect of different forms of N fertilizers on the hyperaccumulator Solanum nigrum L. and maize in intercropping mode under Cd stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) levels are frequently elevated in elderly patients presenting to the emergency department for non-cardiac events. However, most studies on the role of elevated hs-cTn in elderly populations have investigated the prognostic value of hs-cTn in patients with a specific diagnosis or have assessed the relationship between hs-cTn and comorbidities. AIM: To investigate the in-hospital prognosis of consecutive elderly patients admitted to the Internal Medicine Department with acute non-cardiac events and increased hs-cTnI levels. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we selected patients who were aged  65 years and admitted to the Internal Medicine Department of our hospital between January 2019 and December 2019 for non-cardiac reasons. Eligible patients were those who had hs-cTnI concentrations  100 ng/L. We investigated the independent predictors of in-hospital mortality by multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-six patients (59% female) were selected with an age range from 65 to 100 (mean  SD: 85.4  7.61) years. The median hs-cTnI value was 284.2 ng/L. For 72 (49%) patients the diagnosis of hospitalization was an infectious disease. The overall in-hospital mortality was 32% (47 patients). Individuals who died did not have higher hs-cTnI levels compared with those who were discharged alive (median: 314.8 vs 282.5 ng/L; P = 0.565). There was no difference in mortality in patients with infectious vs non-infectious disease (29% vs 35%). Multivariable analysis showed that age (OR 1.062 per 1 year increase, 95%CI: 1.000-1.127; P = 0.048) and creatinine levels (OR 2.065 per 1 mg/dL increase, 95%CI: 1.383-3.085; P < 0.001) were the only independent predictors of death.

SARS pathology is propagated both by direct cytotoxic effects of the virus and aberrant activation of the innate immune response.

We show that ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77. Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription factor EB (TFEB). ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells, which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate. In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation. Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures. ORF8b triggers cell death consistent with pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. While in those cells lacking NLRP3 accumulating ORF8b cytosolic aggregates cause ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase-independent cell death.","output":"SARS-Coronavirus Open Reading Frame-8b triggers intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for approximately 30 proteins.

Notwithstanding, the relationship between health systems and the magnitude of COVID-19 in African countries have not received research attention. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the pervasiveness of the pandemic across African countries and their Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 54 countries in five regions viz Western (16); Eastern (18); Middle (8); Northern (7); and Southern (5) Africa. The outcome variables in this study were the total confirmed COVID-19 cases (per million); total recoveries (per million); and the total deaths (per million). The data were subjected to Spearman's rank-order (Spearman's rho) correlation to determine the monotonic relationship between each of the predictor variables and the outcome variables. The predictor variables that showed a monotonic relationship with the outcome were used to predict respective outcome variables using multiple regressions. The statistical analysis was conducted at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Our results indicate that total number of COVID-19 cases (per million) has strong correlations (rs >0.5) with the median age; aged 65 older; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; number of hospital beds per thousand; Human Development Index (HDI); recoveries (per million); and the overall risk environment of a country. All these factors including the country's commitments to improving national capacity were related to the total number of deaths (per million). Also, strong correlations existed between the total recoveries (per million) and the total number of positive cases; total deaths (per million); median age; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; the number of hospital beds (per thousand); and HDI. The fitted regression models showed strong predictive powers (R-squared>99%) of the variances in the total number of COVID-19 cases (per million); total number of deaths (per million); and the total recoveries (per million). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that patient-level characteristics such as ageing population (i.e., 65+), poverty, underlying co-morbidities-cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension), and diabetes through unhealthy behaviours like smoking as well as hospital care (i.e., beds per thousand) can help explain COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality rates in Africa.

SETTING: Two acute hospitals (Scarborough and York) are combined into a single dataset and analysed collectively. PARTICIPANTS: Adult (18 years) non-elective admissions discharged between 11 March 2020 and 13 June 2020 with an index or on-admission NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions.

METHODS: The sample consisted of 1325 Finnish adults who filled out an online survey marketed on Facebook. Structural regression analysis was used to investigate whether: 1) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM predict peoples response to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM are related to peoples willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Individuals with more conspiracy beliefs and a lower trust in information sources were less likely to have a positive response to the NPIs. Individuals with less trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were more unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Distrust in information sources was the strongest and most consistent predictor in all models. Our analyses also revealed that some of the people who respond negatively to the NPIs also have a lower likelihood to take the vaccine. This association was partly related to a lower trust in information sources. CONCLUSIONS: Distrusting the establishment to provide accurate information, believing in conspiracy theories, and endorsing treatments and substances that are not part of conventional medicine, are all associated with a more negative response to the official guidelines during COVID-19. How people respond to the guidelines, however, is more strongly and consistently related to the degree of trust they feel in the information sources, than to their tendency to hold conspiracy beliefs or endorse CAM.

METHODS: A literature search for research on the gut microbiome and cancer research from 2001 to 2020 was conducted using the Scopus database on 20 March 2021. VOSviewer software (version 1.6.16) was used to perform the visualization analysis. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2020, a total of 2061 publications were retrieved. Annual publication output grew from 10 in 2001 to 486 in 2020. The USA had the largest number of publications, making the largest contribution to the field (n = 566, 27.46%). Before 2016, most studies focused on the effect of probiotics on cancer. The latest trends showed that microbiota composition and gene expression and host-microbiome interaction in cancer immunotherapy would be more concerned more widely in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Research on microbiota composition and gene expression and host-microbiome interaction in cancer immunotherapy will continue to be the hotspot. Therefore, this study provides the trend and characteristics of the literature on the gut microbiota and cancer literature, which provided a useful bibliometric analysis for researchers to conduct further research.","output":"Global research trends on the links between the gut microbiome and cancer: a visualization analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chalcone isomerase (CHI) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants.

The aim of this post-mortem study was to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the knee synovial fluid, synovial tissue, and bone tissue of COVID-19 patients in order to discover whether the joint is a possible route of transmission during orthopaedic surgical procedures, and clarify the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 as a directly arthritogenic virus. METHODS: Post-mortem synovial fluid, synovial tissue and bone tissue samples were collected from the knees of five patients who died of COVID-19 in our hospital between September and October 2020, and analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a commercial real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) panel. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to test post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs of all of the patients. RESULTS: No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in any of the knee samples, despite the positivity of the throat swab. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in knee synovial fluid, synovial membrane or bone. This makes it unlikely that these are potential sources of contagion, and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is not directly arthritogenic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in the knee joint: a cadaver study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 disease (coronavirus disease 2019) is a novel disease causing a world pandemic.

In the systems in which the interaction proceeds along the potential gradient (positive work), the re-sultant potential energy is found based on the principle of adding reciprocals of corresponding values of subsystems. This is the corpuscular process, in which entropy can serve as the theoreti-cal concept. In the systems in which the interactions proceed against the potential gradient (nega-tive work) the algebraic addition of their masses, as well as the corresponding energies of subsys-tems is performed. This is the wave process, in which negentropy can serve as the theoretical con-cept. The resonance stationary state of the systems is fulfilled under the condition of equality of degrees of their corpuscular and wave interactions. The entropy products in stationary state are completely compensated by the negentropy flow. Mathematically and graphically (by nomo-grams) the stationary state in microsystems is found by the following equation containing the tangent of the geodesic angel. The geodesic angle numerically defines the ratio of two legs of the right triangle whose values characterize energy dependencies through axial and circumferential stresses in the system with corpuscular-wave processes.

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effect of reading leaflets during the observation period after vaccination on knowledge of COVID-19 disease and vaccines in Chinese small town residents and to provide suggestions for public health education. METHODS: Residents were recruited during the observation period after getting vaccinated against COVID-19 in Xidian and were randomly divided into an education group and a control group. The education group was asked to complete the questionnaire after reading a leaflet, whereas the control group directly completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised two sections on COVID-19 knowledge and vaccine knowledge, and the scores were used to assess the resident's knowledge. RESULTS: A total of 142 participants in the education group and 154 participants in the control group were enrolled. The rates of correct knowledge in the education group and the control group were 90.7 and 83.1%, respectively. The scores of the two sections and the aggregate knowledge score of the education group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.001). The rates of correct responses to questions on clinical manifestations and transmission routes of COVID-19 and indications and contraindications of vaccines significantly increased after reading the leaflets (P < 0.05). Knowledge of different groups of genders, ages, marital statuses, education levels and occupations all improved (P < 0.05), and the 18C29-year-old and never-married group revealed a higher growth rate of correct responses. CONCLUSION: Chinese small town residents have a median level of knowledge regarding COVID-19 disease and vaccines. Reading leaflets during the observation period after vaccination effectively improved their knowledge.

These operations have become increasingly complex involving multiple revisions, with limited healthy native tissue availability. Grafts are frequently needed when a patient's own tissue is expected to have poor wound-healing properties. To reduce the morbidity associated with autologous grafts and complications associated with synthetic grafts, acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) can be used as substitutes in genitourinary surgery as they demonstrate decreased immunogenicity and retaine structural integrity. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to describe the importance and potential uses of ADMs by reviewing the literature and highlighting key examples of our institution's expanded application of ADM grafts in genitourinary reconstruction. METHODS: We performed a literature review for the use of ADMs in genitourinary surgery including the search terms acellular dermal matrix, alloderm, extracellular matrix, penis, penile reconstruction, intrapenile prosthesis, phalloplasty, neophallus, urethroplasty, artificial urinary sphincters, Peyronie's disease, and urology. We highlight 5 representative genitourinary reconstructive cases performed at this institution where ADMs contributed to surgical success. Genitourinary reconstructive surgeries that have used ADMs in the literature included neophallus construction for gender affirmation, phalloplasty for trauma, penile augmentation, and plaque excision and grafting for Peyronie's disease. RESULTS: Biomechanical studies across different graft types are limited in genitourinary applications. Initial studies using ADMs indicate benefits of limited inflammatory response, finite elasticity, and substantial tensile strength, acceptably mimicking properties of the native tissue. CONCLUSION: Our experience and the current literature suggest that human ADM is a valuable option for tunica albuginea replacement, but its use to support free grafts should be cautioned secondary to graft take.

Furthermore, there is increasing interest on the effects of antidiabetic agents on cognitive decline. There are many studies showing that antidiabetic agents might have beneficial effects on the brain, mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In addition, experimental studies on patients with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease have shown beneficial effects on synaptic plasticity, metabolism of amyloid-, and microtubule-associated protein tau.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 21 hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 11 690 adults (18 years) admitted to hospital: 5728 with covid-19 (cases) and 5962 without covid-19 (controls). Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organizations clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.","output":"Clinical severity of, and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against, covid-19 from omicron, delta, and alpha SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States: prospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of social media for public institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic is a necessity.

The highly attenuated Orf virus strain D1701 was used to generate a recombinant virus (D1701-VrVp40) expressing nucleoprotein p40 of Borna disease virus, which represents a major antigen for the induction of a Borna disease virus-specific humoral and cellular immune response. Infection with Borna disease virus leads to distinct neurological symptoms mediated by the invasion of activated specific CD8+ T cells into the infected brain. Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells. In the present study we show for the first time that intramuscular application of the D1701-VrVp40 recombinant protected rats against Borna disease, and importantly, virus clearance from the infected brain was demonstrated in immunized animals. Even 4 and 8 months after the last immunization, all immunized animals were still protected against the disease. Initial characterization of the immune cells attracted to the infected brain areas suggested that D1701-VrVp40 mediated induction of B cells and antibody-producing plasma cells as well as T cells. These findings suggest the induction of various defense mechanisms against Borna disease virus. First studies on the role of antiviral cytokines indicated that D1701-VrVp40 immunization did not lead to an enhanced early response of gamma or alpha interferon or tumor necrosis factor alpha. Collectively, this study describes the potential of the Orf virus vector system in mediating long-lasting, protective antiviral immunity and eliminating this persistent virus infection without provoking massive neuronal damage.","output":"Prevention of virus persistence and protection against immunopathology after Borna disease virus infection of the brain by a novel Orf virus recombinant."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Drastic restrictions were imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially relating to the practical training part of the undergraduate human and dental medical training. During emergency mode teaching in the summer semester of 2020, a pilot project on practical classroom teaching under COVID-19 conditions was undertaken the Skills Lab Dresden, the Interprofessional Medical Training Centre (MITZ). Students were able to continue learning basic communication and manual skills. This project report presents the adaptations needed for this teaching concept and discusses their feasibility as well as selected evaluation results of the trial run. Description of the project: In normal teaching, students rotate to complete training sessions in small groups. Teaching is provided in a peer-teaching format. An Inverted Classroom Model was implemented as a teaching concept during emergency operation with preparation through digital learning and classroom teaching. Organisational and teaching adjustments were carried out for the concept and to comply with containment regulations. The concept was evaluated by the students using a standardised online questionnaire. Results: 1012 students completed their training during emergency operation at the university. The containment regulations meant that there were a higher number of training sessions and a higher workload. Only one of the alternative dates provided had to be used for COVID-19-related reasons. Infection chains could be tracked. The majority of students found the communication of information via Moodle to be sufficient and did not experience any technical problems. An analysis of the students' evaluation revealed a high level of overall satisfaction with the adapted teaching concept. Conclusion: The MITZ will once again use the concept in a modified form should there be renewed or continued emergency operation. The Inverted Classroom Model will also be established as an integral part of regular teaching. The findings may be of interest to other Skills Labs to develop concepts for emergency operation teaching to efficiently utilise site-specific resources.","output":"Practical teaching in undergraduate human and dental medical training during the COVID-19 crisis.

Here, we explore the early perceived effects of COVID-19 on dermatology residents through an electronic sample survey and identify possible areas for targeted improvement in lieu of a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: On April 3, 2020, a survey of link with 25 questions was sent to dermatology program coordinators to be disseminated among dermatology residents in the United States. The survey was closed on April 13, 2020. All of the questions were optional and no personal identifiers were collected. RESULTS: A total of 140 dermatology residents from 50 different residency programs across 26 states responded to the survey. The majority of respondents (85%) reported negative effects of COVID-19 on their overall wellness. Despite the majority of residents (92%) speculating that COVID-19 will have negative long-term effects on the US economy, only 33% agreed or strongly agreed that it will affect their job prospects. Teledermatology was widely implemented following the declaration of a national emergency (96% of represented residencies compared with only 30% before the pandemic), with heavy resident involvement. The majority of residents (99%) reported having virtual didactics and that they found them to be beneficial. Most residents were uncomfortable with the prospect of being reassigned to a nondermatology specialty during the pandemic. In addition, 22% of residents believed that their leadership were not transparent and prompt in addressing changes relating to COVID-19.

Specifically, 32 compounds isolated from 14 cooking seasonings were examined as inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is required for viral multiplication. Using a drug discovery approach to identify possible antiviral leads, in silico molecular docking studies were performed. Docking calculations revealed a high potency of salvianolic acid A and curcumin as Mpro inhibitors with binding energies of -9.7 and -9.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Binding mode analysis demonstrated the ability of salvianolic acid A and curcumin to form nine and six hydrogen bonds, respectively with amino acids proximal to Mpro's active site. Stabilities and binding affinities of the two identified natural spices were calculated over 40 ns molecular dynamics simulations and compared to an antiviral protease inhibitor (lopinavir). Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area energy calculations revealed greater salvianolic acid A affinity for the enzyme over curcumin and lopinavir with energies of -44.8, -34.2 and -34.8 kcal/mol, respectively.

Litigants have taken a microscope to defendant opioid companies, whose misconduct ignited and exacerbated the opioid crisis. As the litigation continues, one could imagine numerous ways its resolution could contribute to the end of a mutli-decade overdose crisis and prevent future ones. Options include holding defendant companies accountable, releasing previously secret information for research on root causes of the epidemic, and injunctive relief prohibiting future misconduct. Unfortunately, to date, the litigation has not been so capacious. Rather, the participantsjudge includedhave been preoccupied with rapid monetary settlement. Though understandable, attempts to obtain rapid monetary relief take a narrow view of public health. That is, we will help the most readily identifiable victims, with less regard for structural factors that led to the crisis in the first place. This avoidance of structural change is at odds with public health and fails to meet this moment, defined by the most urgent public health crisis in modern history, the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>To explain why the litigation participants have pursued rapid monetary settlement, this paper uses the lens of agency. As will be shown, the opioid litigation is an agent of public health. That is, given the litigations tight connections with public health, it must represent the broad health of the populace. The paper then identifies numerous incentive problems that create misalignment with public health. Viewed in this light, the pursuit of rapid monetary settlement becomes more understandablethough not justifiable. This paper offers solutions for curing these agency problems and ensuring that public health is properly represented in future public health litigation.<br><br>If there is any time to be capacious as to the scope of public health, that time is now. While corporate misconduct plays a significant role in the spread of COVID-19, it is even more relevant to the opioid crisis, a public health emergency initiated and exacerbated by defendants in the litigation. Therefore, relief must consider not only how to help opioid victims, but to release as much information as possible about root causes and to discourage the misconduct that helped precipitate the epidemic. In other words, the court can and must take a deeper look at broader relief that benefits more people on a longer time scale. Expanding the scope of public health in the opioid litigation could yield more robust public health benefits for current and future generations. It could also create lasting precedent by expressing the norm that sales revenue and economic growth must not come at the expense of human life.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does short term exposure to ambient air pollution influence COVID-19 related mortality? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Using time series analyses we tested the association between daily changes in air pollution measured by stationary monitors in and around Santiago, Chile and deaths from laboratory confirmed or suspected COVID-19 between March 16 and August 31, 2020. Results were adjusted for temporal trends, temperature and humidity, and stratified by age and sex. RESULTS: There were 10,069 COVID-19 related deaths of which 7659 were laboratory confirmed. Using distributed lags, the cumulative relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of mortality for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in CO, NO2 and PM2.5 were 1.061 (1.033-1.089), 1.067 (1.023-1.103) and 1.058 (1.034-1.082), respectively There were no significant differences in RR by sex.. In those at least 85 years old, an IQR increase in NO2 was associated with a 12.7% (95% CI 4.2-22.2) increase in daily mortality.

Despite receiving appropriate lung protective ventilation and medical treatment, some of these patients develop refractory hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome . Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been recognized as a lifesaving therapy for patients with ARDS secondary to COVID19. There are few centers in the United States equipped with the necessary staff and the experience to take care of such critically ill patients. Some patients are too ill to be transferred with conventional mechanical ventilation, and they require interhospital transport while on ECMO. Case Report We have developed a highly specialized ECMO Deployment Team dedicated to the cannulation and transport of COVID19 patients while on venous-venous (VV) ECMO or venous-arterial (VA) ECMO. We use routine bedside ECMO cannulation via bilateral femoral vessels configuration at the outside hospital. The patient is stabilized and transported by air or ground to one of our affiliated hospitals.Here we present a series of five patients who were cannulated by our team at an outside institution and transported while on ECMO support to one of our three system hospitals. Patient ages ranged between 49-64 years old. Four patients required VV ECMO for severe hypoxemia secondary to COVID19 ARDS. One patient required VA ECMO due to viral myocarditis secondary to COVID19. Time on ECMO ranged from 9-33 days. Three of the five patients recovered successfully and were discharged home, rehab or LTAC. One patient is still currently on ECMO and one patient is deceased. There were no reported or documented transmission of COVID19 to the members of the ECMO deployment team. Summary The potential for survival of the critically ill due to COVID19 often demands a higher level of care. However, stable transport to an appropriate institution presents a limiting factor. Our method of a dedicated ECMO Deployment Team appears to provide favorable outcome for these patients.","output":"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Dependent COVID19 Hospital Transfers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several studies show that youth unemployment is associated with worse mental health later in life. However, existing studies report results for only one model, or a few models, and use regression adjustment to support causal claims. We use two novel methods to address these gaps in the literature. METHODS: We use data from Next Steps, a cohort study of English schoolchildren who entered the labour market in the aftermath of the 2008C2009 global financial crisis, and measure mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) at age 25. We use specification curve analysis and a negative control outcome design (a form of placebo test) to test whether associations between youth unemployment and later GHQ-12 scores are sensitive to model specification or are likely to be confounded by unobserved factors. RESULTS: We find that the association between unemployment and later GHQ-12 is qualitatively similar across 99.96% of the 120 000 models we run. Statistically significant associations with two placebo outcomes, height and patience, are not present when regression adjustments are made.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 national lockdown (March 9, 2020) on the quality of care provided to patients with hip fracture (HF) in Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna, 2 large regions of northern Italy severely hit by the pandemic. MethodsWe calculated the percentage of HF patients undergoing surgery within 2 days of hospital admission. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed on weekly data from December 11, 2019 to June 9, 2020 ({approx}6 months), interrupting the series in the 2nd week of March. The same data observed the year before were included as a control time series with no \\"intervention\\" (lockdown) in the middle of the observation period.

Racial and ethnic minority women in the Southern United States are disproportionately impacted. Reproductive-age women with HIV are prone to poor HIV outcomes but remain underrepresented in HIV research. We will answer contemporary questions related to the health outcomes in this population by enrolling a prospective cohort of reproductive-age women with and without HIV in the Southern United States. OBJECTIVE: The Study of Treatment and Reproductive Outcomes (STAR) will enroll and retain 2000 reproductive-age women with and without HIV. The STAR will leverage the infrastructure of the US-based Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Womens Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study, comprising the WIHS (a cohort of women with and at risk for HIV, which began in 1993), and the MACS (a cohort of gay and bisexual men with and at risk for HIV, which began in 1984). Although the advancing age of the participants enrolled in the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study provides an opportunity to address the questions related to HIV and aging, the research questions pertinent to the reproductive years must also be addressed. The STAR will conduct high-priority scientific research in key areas with the overall aim of addressing the unique needs of reproductive-age women with HIV. METHODS: The STAR is a prospective, observational cohort study that will be conducted at 6 sites in the United StatesAtlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Miami, Florida; and Washington, District of Columbia. Visits will occur semiannually for 2 years, with additional visits for up to 5 years. At each visit, the participating women will complete a structured interview for collecting key demographic, psychosocial, and clinical variables, and undergo biospecimen collection for laboratory testing and repositing (blood, urine, hair, vaginal, anal, and oral specimens). Pregnant women and infants will undergo additional study assessments. The initial scientific focus of the STAR is to understand the roles of key social determinants of health, depression, reproductive health, and oral health on HIV and pregnancy outcomes across the reproductive life span. RESULTS: Enrollment in the STAR commenced in February 2021 and is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Through in-depth, longitudinal data and biospecimen collection, the newly initiated STAR cohort will create a platform to answer scientific questions regarding reproductive-age women with and without HIV. STAR will be uniquely positioned to enable investigators to conduct high-impact research relevant to this population. Building on the legacy of the MACS and WIHS cohorts, the STAR is designed to foster multidisciplinary collaborations to galvanize scientific discoveries to improve the health of reproductive-age women with HIV and ameliorate the effects of the HIV epidemic in this population in the United States.","output":"Study of Treatment and Reproductive Outcomes Among Reproductive-Age Women With HIV Infection in the Southern United States: Protocol for a Longitudinal Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the Red Deer algorithm (RDA), a recent population-based meta-heuristic algorithm, is thoroughly reviewed.

To address this issue, one possibility is to exploit the high efficiency of dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen-presenting cells for T cell priming. DCs functional plasticity allows shaping the outcome of immune responses to achieve the required type of immunity. Therefore, the choice of adjuvants to guide and sustain DCs maturation, the design of multifaceted vehicles, and the choice of surface molecules to specifically target DCs represent the key issues currently explored in both preclinical and clinical settings.

Viet Nam's extensive health care system reaches the village level, but still HIV-infected mothers and children have received inadequate health care services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. We report here the health workers' perceptions on factors that lead to their failure to give good quality prevention of mother-to-child transmission services. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 53 health workers and unstructured observations in nine health facilities in Hanoi were conducted. Selection of respondents was based on their function, position and experience in the development or implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission policies/programmes. RESULTS: Factors that lead to health workers' failure to give good quality services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission include their own fear of HIV infection; lack of knowledge on HIV and counselling skills; or high workloads and lack of staff; unavailability of HIV testing at commune level; shortage of antiretroviral drugs; and lack of operational guidelines. A negative attitude during counselling and provision of care, treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected, as well as distrust towards almost all HIV-infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours. Additionally, the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars, including a vertical programme for HIV/AIDS, is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care. CONCLUSION: Many hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for HIV-positive pregnant women The study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers, providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation.

This prospective, multi-center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets designed to manage non-specific gastrointestinal disorders in 28 cats with a history of chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea. The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of vomiting (n = 25), with a smaller number having a history of concurrent diarrhea (n = 2) or diarrhea alone (n = 3).

Cats were randomized to one of two veterinary therapeutic diets for 4 weeks. Feeding of both therapeutic diets resulted in a numeric reduction in the number of vomiting episodes over the 4-week period, but no significant differences were seen between dietary interventions. When looking within dietary groups, significant differences were seen in cats fed Diet A with reductions of 69.1, 73.3, and 63.2% (p values of 0.008, 0.003, and 0.029) in weeks 2, 3, and 4, respectively, when compared to week 0.

Near perfect complementarity between a target RNA and the Cas13-associated guide RNA is required for activation of Cas13 ribonuclease activity. Nonetheless, the specificity of Cas13 effectors in eukaryotic cells has been debated as the Cas13 nuclease domains can be exposed on the enzyme surface, providing the potential for promiscuous cleavage of nearby RNAs (so-called collateral damage). Here, using co-transfection assays in Drosophila and human cells, we found that the off-target effects of RxCas13d, a commonly used Cas13 effector, can be as strong as the level of on-target RNA knockdown. The extent of off-target effects is positively correlated with target RNA expression levels, and collateral damage can be observed even after reducing RxCas13d/guide RNA levels. The PspCas13b effector showed improved specificity and, unlike RxCas13d, can be used to deplete a Drosophila circular RNA without affecting the expression of the associated linear RNA. PspCas13b nonetheless still can have off-target effects and we notably found that the extent of off-target effects for Cas13 effectors differs depending on the cell type and target RNA examined.

The resulting hybrid, serologically A-like/Tn (T-nouvelle) structure potentially acts as a hostCpathogen functional molecular bridge. In humans, this intermediate structure will hypothetically be replaced by ABO(H) blood group-specific, mucin-type structures, in the case of infection hybrid epitopes, implicating the phenotypically glycosidic accommodation of plasma proteins. The virus may, by mimicking the synthetic pathways of the ABO(H) blood groups, bind to the cell surfaces of the blood group O(H) by formation of a hybrid H-type antigen as the potential precursor of hybrid non-O blood groups, which does not affect the highly anti-glycan aggressive anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin activities, exerted by the germline-encoded nonimmune immunoglobulin M (IgM). In the non-O blood groups, which have developed from the H-type antigen, these IgM activities are downregulated by phenotypic glycosylation, while adaptive immunoglobulins might arise in response to the hybrid A and B blood group structures, suggesting the exertion of autoreactivity. The non-O blood groups thus become a preferred target for the virus, whereas blood group O(H) individuals, lacking the A/B phenotype-determining enzymes and binding the virus alone by hybrid H-type antigen formation, have the least molecular contact with the virus and maintain the critical anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin activities, exerted by the ancestral IgM, which is considered the humoral spearhead of innate immunity.","output":"Why blood group A individuals are at risk whereas blood group O individuals are protected from SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection: A hypothesis regarding how the virus invades the human body via ABO(H) blood group-determining carbohydrates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context : Nurses are regularly confronted with suicidal people.

Understanding public attitudes toward protest policing is important for police legitimacy and policy. One theory is that citizens are willing to trade civil liberties, such as the right to assemble, for security, and thus disruptive or dangerous protest tactics should increase support for police control by elevating public fear. Another theory is that citizens view protests through the lens of group position, and thus, they should be more supportive of repression when protest goals conflict with preexisting racial beliefs and threaten racial interests. To test these theories, we embedded an experiment in a nationwide survey fielded in 2020 after George Floyd's killing sparked the broadest protests in U.S. history. We randomized protest tactics (e.g., weapon carrying) and goals, as well as other contextual characteristics (e.g., protest size). We found that the public generally opposed repressive protest policing. Certain protest tactics, however, increased support for repression by elevating fear. Protest goals (e.g., pro-Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrants) also impacted support for repression, but the effect depended on respondents racial beliefs. ? 2021 American Society of Criminology","output":"Public fear of protesters and support for protest policing: An experimental test of two theoretical models*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phosphoproteomics routinely quantifies changes in the levels of thousands of phosphorylation sites, but functional analysis of such data remains a major challenge.

A recent large-scale study systematically identified in vitro substrates for most human protein kinases. Here, we reprocessed and filtered these data to generate an in vitro Kinase-to-Phosphosite database (iKiP-DB). We show that iKiP-DB can accurately predict changes in kinase activity in published phosphoproteomic datasets for both well-studied and poorly characterized kinases. We apply iKiP-DB to a newly generated phosphoproteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung epithelial cells and provide evidence for coronavirus-induced changes in host cell kinase activity.

We examined the extent to which themes pertained to certain identities over others. Notably, BIPOC, large-bodied, queer participants more commonly spoke to body vulnerability than White, small/medium-bodied, straight participants. BIPOC and large-bodied participants also particularly spoke to feeling relief from discrimination as social distancing and mask wearing reduced their public visibility.

If RSV-LRTI were causal, we would expect RSV-LRTI prevention to reduce the incidence of chronic wheezing illnesses in addition to reducing acute disease. We aimed to evaluate the strength of evidence for a causal effect of RSV-LRTI on subsequent chronic wheezing illness to inform public health expectations for RSV vaccines. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the association between RSV-LRTI and subsequent wheezing illness (exposure studies) and studies evaluating the association between RSV immunoprophylaxis and subsequent wheezing illness (immunoprophylaxis studies). Exposure studies were included if the exposure group members had an LRTI with laboratory-confirmed RSV and if the exposure ascertainment period began before 2 years of age and ended before 5 years of age. We required a wash-out period of more than 30 days between the index RSV-LRTI and the outcome measurement to allow for resolution of the acute illness. Comparisons between RSV-LRTI and non-RSV-LRTI were not included. Immunoprophylaxis studies were included if they measured the association with subsequent wheezing illness relative to a control group, either in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) or an observational design. For the immunoprophylaxis drugs in question, we required evidence of efficacy in targeting RSV-LRTI from at least one RCT to ensure biological plausibility. All variations of wheezing illness were combined into a single outcome that refers broadly to asthma or any other respiratory illness with wheezing symptoms. Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from inception up to Aug 28, 2018. We evaluated whether data from exposure studies could provide evidence against the most viable non-causal theory that RSV-LRTI is a marker of respiratory illness susceptibility rather than a causal factor. Additionally, we tested whether RSV immunoprophylaxis reduces the odds of subsequent wheezing illnesses. We used a random-effects modelling framework and, to accommodate studies providing multiple correlated estimates, robust variance estimation meta-regressions. Meta-regression coefficients (b) quantify differences between exposure and comparator groups on the loge odds ratio (loge OR) scale. FINDINGS: From 14a??235 records we identified 57 eligible articles that described 42 studies and provided 153 effect estimates. 35 studies estimated the direct effect of RSV-LRTI on wheezing illnesses (exposure studies) and eight evaluated the effect of RSV immunoprophylaxis (immunoprophylaxis studies). Exposure studies that adjusted for genetic influences yielded a smaller mean adjusted OR estimate (aOR+ 245, 95% CI 123-488) compared with those that did not (417, 236-737), a significant difference (b 053, 95% CI 004-102). Infants who were not protected with RSV immunoprophylaxis tended to have higher odds of subsequent wheezing illness, as we would expect if RSV-LRTI were causal, but the effect was not significant (OR+ 121, 95% CI 073-199). There was generally a high threat of confounding bias in the observational studies. Additionally, in both the observational studies and immunoprophylaxis RCTs, there was high risk of bias due to missing outcome data. INTERPRETATION: Our findings, limited to exposure and immunoprophylaxis studies, do not support basing policy decisions on an assumption that prevention of RSV-LRTI will reduce recurrent chronic wheezing illnesses.

Objective To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. Design, Setting, and Participants The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. Exposures Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. Results Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of <200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3%) died, including 125 (28.9%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-33.8%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1% (95% CI, 35.5%-38.7%) in the non-tocilizumab-treated patients (risk difference, 9.6%; 95% CI, 3.1%-16.0%). Conclusions and Relevance Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab.

METHODS: A systematic search for all observational studies and trials involving adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 that had any data related to D-dimer on admission was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, and MedRxiv databases. We performed random-effects inverse-variance weighting analysis using mean difference (MD) of D-dimer values for outcomes such as disease severity, mortality, and need for ICU care. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies (4,328 patients) were included in this meta-analysis, which revealed a higher mean of D-dimer levels on admission in severe patients than in nonsevere patients (MD = 0.95, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.28], P < .05; I2 = 90%).

We studied for exogenous miRNAs from Bos taurus that are potentially contain miRNAs from milk and that could act postprandially as regulators of human gene expression. The interaction of 17,508 human genes with 1025 bta-miRNAs, including 245 raw milk miRNAs was studied. The milk bta-miR-151-5p, bta-miR-151-3p, bta-miRNA-320 each have 11 BSs (binding sites), and bta-miRNA-345-5p, bta-miRNA-614, bta-miRNA-1296b and bta-miRNA-149 has 12, 14, 15 and 26 BSs, respectively. The bta-miR-574-5p from cows milk had 209 human genes in mRNAs from one to 25 repeating BSs. We found 15 bta-miRNAs that have 100% complementarity to the mRNA of 13 human target genes.

But the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines adhered to a conventional hypertension definition as BP  140/90 mmHg. We aimed to compare the trajectories of cognitive decline between participants with BP < 130/80 mmHg in all BP measurement waves and others with all BP < 140/90 mmHg. METHODS: This pooled analysis involved middle-aged and older participants from three nationally representative ageing cohorts, including the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the China Health Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Participants were divided into the Normal (BP < 130/80 mmHg on all occasions throughout the study), the Borderline (BP < 140/90 mmHg on all occasions throughout the study but not in the Normal group), and the High (the rest of participants) BP groups. Global cognitive Z score was calculated from tests on memory, executive function, and orientation. RESULTS: A total of 17,590 participants (HRS 6964, median follow-ups 12 years; ELSA 5334, median follow-ups 16 years; CHARLS 5292, median follow-ups 7 years) were included. No significant difference in global cognitive decline rate was detected between the Normal and the borderline groups (men, pooled ? = - 0.006 standard deviation [SD]/year; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 0.020 to 0.008; P = 0.377; women, pooled ? = 0.006 SD/year; 95% CI - 0.005 to 0.018; P = 0.269).

CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in the Borderline group did not experience significantly faster cognitive decline compared with those in the Normal group.

Tai-Chi exercise can equally improve cardiorespiratory fitness, resting health rate, blood pressure and lean mass as a moderate-intensity running exercise. Running exercises appears to have further benefits in reducing the blood lipid level. The results from this study can provide insights into various types of exercises on cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers in the middle-aged population. ABSTRACT: This study examined the effectiveness of Tai-Chi and running exercises on cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers in sedentary middle-aged adults under 24 weeks of supervised training. Methods Thirty-six healthy middle-aged adults (55.6  5.3 yr) were randomly assigned into Tai-Chi, running and control groups. During a 24-week training period, the Tai-Chi and running groups were asked to perform exercises for 60 min/day and 5 days/week, which were supervised by Tai-Chi and running instructors throughout. Resting heart rate, lean mass, blood pressure and blood lipids were measured, and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2max), V(max) and Peak heart rate) was assessed at the baseline and the 12- and 24-week interventions. Results Compared to the no-exercise control group, both the Tai-Chi and running groups significantly decreased resting heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and cardiorespiratory fitness and increased lean mass across the training session (p < 0.05). Compared to the Tai-Chi group, the running group showed greater improvement in VO(2max) and V(max) (p < 0.05) and reduced triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.05). Conclusion Both Tai-Chi and running exercise showed beneficial effects on cardiorespiratory fitness and enhanced health-related outcomes in middle-aged adults. Although Tai-Chi exercises were less effective in VO(2max) than running, Tai-Chi may be considered as a plausible alternative to running exercises that can be achieved in the indoor-based setting.","output":"Effects of Tai-Chi and Running Exercises on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Biomarkers in Sedentary Middle-Aged Males: A 24-Week Supervised Training Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, in China, in 2019, a new type of disease has arisen caused by a new strain of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, considered extremely worrying due to its high infectivity power and the easy ability to spread geographically. For patients in general, the clinical features resulting from respiratory syndromes can trigger an asymptomatic condition. However, 25 % of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 can progress to severity. Pregnant women are an unknown field in this complex process, and although they have symptoms similar to non-pregnant women, some points should be considered, such as complications during pregnancy and postpartum. Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the consequences of pregnancy and fetal development, caused by infections by the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Among the aforementioned infections, MERS-CoV seems to be the most dangerous for newborns, inducing high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and multiple organ failure in mother. This also causes a higher occurrence of emergency cesarean deliveries and premature births, in addition, some deaths of mothers and fetuses were recorded. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to have less severe symptoms. Furthermore, although a study found the ACE2 receptor, used by SARS-CoV-2, widely distributed in specific cell types of the maternal-fetal interface, there is no evidence of vertical transmission for any of the coronaviruses. Thus, the limited reported obstetric cases alert to the need for advanced life support for pregnant women infected with coronaviruses and to the need for further investigation for application in clinical practice.","output":"SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy and fetal development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: : Cardiac arrhythmia, which is an abnormal heart rhythm, is a common clinical problem in cardiology. Detection of arrhythmia on an extended duration electrocardiogram (ECG) is done based on initial algorithmic software screening, with final visual validation by cardiologists. It is a time consuming and subjective process. Therefore, fully automated computer-assisted detection systems with a high degree of accuracy has an essential role in this task. In this study, we proposed an effective deep neural network (DNN) model to detect different rhythm classes from a new ECG database. METHODS: : Our DNN model was designed for high performance on all ECG leads. The proposed model, which included both representation learning and sequence learning tasks, showed promising results on all 12-lead inputs. Convolutional layers and sub-sampling layers were used in the representation learning phase. The sequence learning part involved a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit after representation of learning layers. RESULTS: : We performed two different class scenarios, including reduced rhythms (seven rhythm types) and merged rhythms (four rhythm types) according to the records from the database. Our trained DNN model achieved 92.24% and 96.13% accuracies for the reduced and merged rhythm classes, respectively. CONCLUSION: : Recently, deep learning algorithms have been found to be useful because of their high performance. The main challenge is the scarcity of appropriate training and testing resources because model performance is dependent on the quality and quantity of case samples. In this study, we used a new public arrhythmia database comprising more than 10,000 records. We constructed an efficient deep neural network (DNN) model for automated detection of arrhythmia using these records.","output":"Accurate Deep Neural Network Model to Detect Cardiac Arrhythmia on More Than 10,000 Individual Subject ECG Records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This second International Alliance for Biological Standardization COVID-19 webinar brought together a broad range of international stakeholders, including academia, regulators, funders and industry, with a considerable participation from low- and middle-income countries, to discuss the use of controlled human infection models to accelerate development and market authorization assessment of a vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","output":"SARS-CoV-2 controlled human infection models: Ethics, challenge agent production and regulatory issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims & Objectives: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2), originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province of China In India, first confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was reported on January 30, 2020 and since then the virus has spread across the country More than 7 9 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 1 19 lakh deaths have been reported in India The pathobiology of the disease is poorly known, and significant efforts have been made to understand the disease process worldwide Clinical autopsies are known to have a vital role in developing an understanding of the disease process The aim of the present study was to evaluate bone marrow findings of COVID-19 by minimally invasive autopsies Patients/Materials & Methods: This prospective study was conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur After obtaining approval from Institute's ethics committee and consent from next of kins, minimally invasive autopsies were conducted within an hour after the death Procedures were done with all biosafety measures The tissue specimens were kept in neutral buffered formalin for 48 h and then processed with standard biosafety measures Electronic medical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients' clinical details and results of laboratory investigations were noted Results: In this prospective study, bone marrow biopsy procedures were done in 37 COVID-19 minimally invasive autopsies Mean age of these cases was 61 8 years (Range, 28-85 years) and male: female ratio was 2 36 Comorbidities were observed in 25(67 5%) of all cases Histopathological analysis revealed hypercellular, normocellular and hypocellular marrow in 5, 25 and 5 cases respectively (two biopsies were inadequate) There was marked interstitial prominence of histiocytes in 24(68 5%) cases Out of these, evidence of haemophagocytosis (Figure 1) was observed in 14(40%) cases, marked increase of haemosiderin laden macrophages in 20(57 1%) cases There was prominence of plasma cells in 28 (80%) cases Discussion & Conclusion: Incorporation of minimally invasive autopsies provides an effective method to study the pathological findings in COVID-19 deaths in resource constrained settings Histopathological findings in bone marrow suggest indirect insult to bone marrow, presumably related to circulatory and/or hyperinflammatory response to viral infections","output":"Evaluation of bone marrow findings of COVID-19 by minimally invasive autopsies: A single tertiary care centre experience from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases and human behavior are intertwined. On one side, our movements and interactions are the engines of transmission. On the other, the unfolding of viruses might induce changes to our daily activities. While intuitive, our understanding of such feedback loop is still limited. Before COVID-19 the literature on the subject was mainly theoretical and largely missed validation. The main issue was the lack of empirical data capturing behavioral change induced by diseases. Things have dramatically changed in 2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the key weapon against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and affected virtually any societal process.

METHODS Systematic analysis of all non-ICU patient hospitalizations for COVID-19 completing discharge between March 13 and May 1, 2020, in a large US health care system utilizing off-site central monitoring. Variables of interest were examined in relation to a composite event rate of death, ICU transfer, or increased oxygen requirement to high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS Among 350 patients (age, 64  16 years; 55% male), most (73%) required 3 L/min or less of supplemental oxygen during admission. Telemetry was widely utilized (79%) yet arrhythmias were uncommon (14%) and were predominantly (90%) among patients with abnormal troponin levels or known cardiovascular disease. Ventricular tachycardia was rare (5%), nonsustained, and not associated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin treatment. Adverse events occurred in 62 patients (18%), including 22 deaths (6%), 48 ICU transfers (14%), and 49 patients with increased oxygen requirement (14%) and were independently associated with elevated C-reactive protein (odds ratio, 1.09 per 1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18; P = .04) and lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.006 per 1U/L; 95% CI, 1.001-1.012; P = .03) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION Among non-critically ill patients hospitalized within a nonepicenter health care system, overall survival was 94% with the development of more severe illness or death independently associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase on admission. Clinical decompensation was largely respiratory-related, while serious cardiac arrhythmias were rare, which suggests that telemetry can be prioritized for high-risk patients.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Non-ICU Hospitalization for COVID-19 in a Nonepicenter, Centrally Monitored Healthcare System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we report the description, implementation and application of a kinetic model designed for describing the Covid-19 epidemic spread in Italy and Germany in the period between February and June 2020 coinciding with the beginning of the statistical regime of the epidemic spread and the application of restrictive government measures aimed at its containment.

These failures are manifested in an inability to reproduce efficacy findings from animal models in humans and/or the occurrence of unexpected safety issues, and reflect failures in T1 translation. Similarly, an inability to sequentially demonstrate compound efficacy and safety in Phase IIa, IIb, and III clinical trials represents failures in T2 translation. Accordingly, T1 and T2 translation are colloquially termed 'valleys of death'. Since T2 translation dealt almost exclusively with clinical trials, T3 and T4 translational steps were added, with the former focused on facilitating interactions between laboratory- and population-based research and the latter on 'real world' health outcomes. Factors that potentially lead to T1/T2 compound attrition include: the absence of biomarkers to allow compound effects to be consistently tracked through development; a lack of integration/'de-siloing' of the diverse discipline-based and technical skill sets involved in drug discovery; the industrialization of drug discovery, which via volume-based goals often results in quantity being prioritized over quality; inadequate project governance and strategic oversight; and flawed decision making based on unreliable/irreproducible or incomplete data. A variety of initiatives have addressed this problem, including the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), which has focused on bringing an unbiased academic perspective to translation, to potentially revitalize the process.

Exercise is pivotal to OA management, yet uptake by people with knee OA is inadequate. Limited access to appropriately skilled health professionals, such as physiotherapists, for prescription of an exercise program and support with exercise is a major barrier to optimal care. Internet-enabled video consultations permit widespread reach. However, services offering video consultations with physiotherapists for musculoskeletal conditions are scant in Australia where there is typically no Government or private health insurer funding for such services. The paucity of robust evidence demonstrating video consultations with physiotherapists are clinically effective, safe and cost-effective for knee OA is hampering implementation of, and willingness of healthcare policymakers to pay for, these services. METHODS: This is an assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Australia. We are recruiting 394 people from the community with chronic knee pain consistent with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. Participants are randomly allocated to receive physiotherapy care via i) video-conferencing or; ii) face-to-face consultations. Participants are provided five consultations (30-45 min each) with a physiotherapist over 3 months for prescription of a home-based strengthening exercise program (to be conducted independently at home) and physical activity plan, as well as OA education. Participants in both groups are provided with educational booklets and simple exercise equipment via post. The co-primary outcomes are change in self-reported i) knee pain on walking; and ii) physical function, with a primary end-point of 3 months and a secondary end-point of 9 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in other clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life; therapeutic relationship; global ratings of change; satisfaction with care; self-efficacy; physical activity levels), time and financial costs of attending consultations, healthcare usage and convenience. Non-inferiority will be assessed using the per-protocol dataset. DISCUSSION: Findings will determine if video consultations with physiotherapists are non-inferior to traditional face-to-face consultations for management of people with knee OA.

Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patients blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The spread of the new coronavirus COVID-19, has led to unparalleled global measures such as lockdown and suspension of all retail, recreation and religious activities during the first months of 2020.

However, these conclusions are based on only two research studies from the last decade (Comishen, Bialystok, & Adler, 2019; Kovcs & Mehler, 2009), so to date, there is a lack of evidence regarding their replicability and generalisability.

The present study addressed these two questions by assessing attentional control abilities in seven-month-old bilingual infants in comparison to same-age monolinguals and in relation to their individual bilingual exposure patterns. Findings did not reveal significant differences between monolingual and bilingual infants in the measure of attentional control and no relation between individual performance and degree of bilingual exposure. Bilinguals showed different patterns of allocating attention to the visual rewards in this task compared to monolinguals.

These intrinsically disordered proteins/regions do not possess unique structures and possess functions that complement the functional repertoire of \\"normal\\" ordered proteins and domains, with many protein functional classes being heavily dependent on the intrinsic disorder. Viruses commonly use these highly flexible regions to invade the host organisms and to hijack various host systems. These disordered regions also help viruses in adapting to their hostile habitats and to manage their economic usage of genetic material. In this article, we focus on the structural peculiarities of proteins from human hepatitis C virus (HCV) and use a wide spectrum of bioinformatics techniques to evaluate the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the completed proteomes of several human HCV genotypes, to analyze the peculiarities of disorder distribution within the individual HCV proteins, and to establish potential roles of the structural disorder in functions of ten HCV proteins. We show that the intrinsic disorder or increased flexibility is not only abundant in these proteins, but is also absolutely necessary for their functions, playing a crucial role in the proteolytic processing of the HCV polyprotein, the maturation of the individual HCV proteins, and being related to the posttranslational modifications of these proteins and their interactions with DNA, RNA, and various host proteins.","output":"The intrinsic disorder status of the human hepatitis C virus proteome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the COVID-19 pandemic, societal discourses and social interaction are subject to rapid mediatisation and digitalisation, which accelerate datafication.

METHODS: 11 CL attending surveys and 8 attendings' tele-encounter logs from March-June 2020 were completed and reviewed to assess for patient and provider characteristics associated with barriers to using telepsychiatry. RESULTS: The vast majority of 223 tele-psychiatric encounters were acceptable to providers in terms of technology (82%) and their ability to form a connection with the patient (78%). In multivariable logistic regression models, an unresolvable difficulty utilizing the platform was less common for female patients (OR = 0.239, p = 0.002) and more common for patients who prefer a non-English language (OR = 9.059, p < 0.001); achieving a personal connection that felt right was also less likely for patients who prefer a non-English language (OR = 0.189, p = 0.001).

Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aims at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same labels and similar contents are pulled together. It utilizes multi-similarity loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the optimized embedding space, and provides similar images to the query image. The model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support task, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a new dataset without any further training. These results demonstrate our deep metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Deep Metric Learning-based Image Retrieval System for Chest Radiograph and its Clinical Applications in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 to cause severe acute respiratory symptoms (COVID- 19).

The antiparasitic ivermectin, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has now been tested in numerous clinical trials. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: We assessed the efficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing mortality, in secondary outcomes, and in chemoprophylaxis, among people with, or at high risk of, COVID-19 infection. DATA SOURCES: We searched bibliographic databases up to April 25, 2021. Two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and additionally in trial sequential analyses for mortality. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials involving 3406 participants met review inclusion. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.73; n = 2438; I2 = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian-Laird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff-Tweedie method. Low-certainty evidence found that ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection by an average 86% (95% confidence interval 79%-91%). Secondary outcomes provided less certain evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for \\"need for mechanical ventilation,\\" whereas effect estimates for \\"improvement\\" and \\"deterioration\\" clearly favored ivermectin use. Severe adverse events were rare among treatment trials and evidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty. Evidence on other secondary outcomes was very low certainty. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing to severe disease. The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.","output":"Ivermectin for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemics in China, South Korea, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.

CHIKV can cause significant morbidity and lead to chronic, debilitating arthritis in up to 40% of infected individuals, impacting on livelihoods. Prevention, early identification, and clinical management are key for improving outcomes. This review aims to evaluate the availability of inclusive, evidence-based clinical management guidelines for CHIKV in a global context. Methods: Six databases were searched systematically from inception to 14 th October 2021 and complemented with a grey literature search until 16 th September 2021. We included CMGs providing supportive care and treatment recommendations. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data and assessed quality using the AGREE II tool. Findings are presented in a narrative synthesis. Results: Twenty-eight CMGs were included; most were of low-quality (median score 2 out of 7 (range 1-7)). None were produced specifically in a low-income country and 54% (15/28) were produced more than five years ago. There were variations in the CMGs guidance on the management of different at-risk populations, long-term sequelae, and the prevention of disease transmission in community and hospital settings. In the acute phase, 54% (15/28) recommended hospitalisation for severe cases, however only 39% (11/28) provided clinical management guidance for severe disease. Further, 46% (13/28) advocated for steroids in the chronic phase, yet 18% (5/28) advised against its use. Conclusion: There was a lack of high-quality CMGs that provided supportive care and treatment guidance; this scarcity may impact patient care and outcomes. It is essential that existing guidelines are updated and adapted to provide detailed evidence-based treatment guidelines for different at-risk populations.

Treating neurosurgical patients with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic is challenging in institutions with shared patient areas. The present study was performed to assess the changing patterns of neurosurgical cases, the efficacy of repeated testing before surgery, and the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients. METHODS: Cases of non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients treated at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were reviewed. During the pandemic, all patients underwent a nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test to detect COVID-19 at admission. Patients who needed immediate intervention were surgically treated following a single COVID-19 test, while stable patients who initially tested negative for COVID-19 were subjected to repeated testing at least 5 days after the first test and within 48 hours prior to the planned surgery. The COVID-19 positivity rate was compared with the local period prevalence. The number of patients who tested positive at the second test, following a negative first test, was used to determine the probable number of people who could have become infected during the surgical procedure without second testing. RESULTS: Of the total 1769 non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients included in this study, a mean of 337.2 patients underwent surgery per month before COVID-19, while a mean of 184.2 patients (54.6% of pre-COVID-19 capacity) underwent surgery per month during the pandemic period, when COVID-19 cases were on the rise in India. There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients undergoing surgery for a ruptured aneurysm, stroke, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar tumors, while the number of patients seeking surgery for chronic benign diseases declined. At the first COVID-19 test, 4 patients (0.48%) tested were found to have the disease, a proportion 3.7 times greater than that found in the local community. An additional 5 patients tested positive at the time of the second COVID-19 test, resulting in an overall inpatient period prevalence of 1%, in contrast to a 0.2% national cumulative caseload. It is possible that COVID-19 was prevented in approximately 67.4 people every month by using double testing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has changed the pattern of neurosurgical procedures, with acute cases dominating the practice. Despite the fact that the pandemic has not yet reached its peak in India, COVID-19 has been detected 3.7 times more often in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients than in the local community, even with single testing. Double testing displays an incremental value by disclosing COVID-19 overall in 1 in 100 inpatients and thus averting its spread through neurosurgical services.","output":"COVID-19: changing patterns among neurosurgical patients from North India, efficacy of repeat testing, and inpatient prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and their agonists as primary components that link antiviral innate and adaptive immunity has motivated growing research on STING agonist-mediated immunotherapy and vaccine development.

The source of this heterogeneity is thought to affect epidemiological dynamics but studies tend not to control for the overall heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases caused by an infection. To explore the role of individual variation in infection duration and transmission rate in parasite emergence and spread, while controlling for this potential bias, we simulate stochastic outbreaks with and without parasite evolution. As expected, heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases decreases the probability of outbreak emergence. Furthermore, for epidemics that do emerge, assuming more realistic infection duration distributions leads to faster outbreaks and higher epidemic peaks. When parasites require adaptive mutations to cause large epidemics, the impact of heterogeneity depends on the underlying evolutionary model. If emergence relies on within-host evolution, decreasing the infection duration variance decreases the probability of emergence. These results underline the importance of accounting for realistic distributions of transmission rates to anticipate the effect of individual heterogeneity on epidemiological dynamics.","output":"The source of individual heterogeneity shapes infectious disease outbreaks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of their limited coding capacity, viruses are not able to encode all proteins that are required for their replication.

We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds >10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds >20% or >10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak.

However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.","output":"Staffing Levels and COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks in U.S. Nursing Homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionDelusion of pregnancy has been described as a false and fixed belief of being pregnant despite factual evidence to the contrary. Pseudocyesis is a condition in which the patient has all signs and symptoms of pregnancy except for the confirmation of the presence of a fetus. There has been described symptoms as abdominal distention, cessation of menses, morning sickness, etc.ObjectivesThe aim of this work was to distinguish between pseudocyesis and pseudopregnancy. This case presents a single 49-year-old woman, who developed the delusion of being pregnant after months of lonely confinement during Covid-19 quarantine.MethodsShe had missed her period for 10 months. She was convinced that she could feel the fetal movements. Her thought content revealed delusion of persecution, reference, and delusion of being pregnant. She did not reveal any hallucinations. Blood tests and brain imaging revealed no abnormalities. The treatment was started with Paliperidone 100mg/month, and clonazepam 2mg/d.ResultsThe patient showed a substantial improvement within 10 weeks of treatment. Pseudocyesis and delusional pregnancy have been rarely described on scientific bibliography. A distinction has been demonstrated based on the consideration of the associated psychotic features that might be present in delusions of pregnancy, which were described in the current case. On the other hand, pseudocyesis clinical presentation is centered on the false signs and symptoms of pregnancy.ConclusionsAntipsychotics played a key role in the delusion of pregnancy.

A national online survey was administered between May and June 2020 that targeted a representative U.S. sample and yielded data from 1276 respondents, including 58% male and 50% racial/ethnic minorities. We used univariate and multivariable linear regression models to examine the associations of sociodemographic, mental health, and behavioral determinants with self-reported changes in lifestyle behaviors. Some study participants reported increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors since the pandemic (i.e., 36% increased healthy eating behaviors, and 33% increased physical activity). However, they also reported increases in addictive lifestyle behaviors including alcohol use (40%), tobacco use (41%), and vaping (46%). With regard to individual-level determinants, individuals who reported adhering to social distancing guidelines were also more likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors (beta = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.21). Conversely, women (beta = -0.37, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.12), and unemployed individuals (beta = -0.33, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.02) were less likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, individuals reporting anxiety were more likely to report increases in addictive behaviors (beta = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.43). Taken together, these findings suggest that women and unemployed individuals may benefit from interventions targeting diet and physical activity, and that individuals reporting anxiety may benefit from interventions targeting smoking and alcohol cessation to address lifestyle changes during the pandemic.","output":"Individual-Level Determinants of Lifestyle Behavioral Changes during COVID-19 Lockdown in the United States: Results of an Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"this paper introduces a method for simultaneous detection of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) and influenza virus by dual fluorescent RT-PCR, providing some references for the current clinical first-line practice against the epidemic.

Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening, and evidence-based interventions (a 'screen-and-treat' approach), but little is known about the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Methods A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared to treatment-as-usual. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was run over a five-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 exposed adults from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services in England. Results The incremental cost per QALY gained was GBP8,297. This would be considered cost-effective 95% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP20,000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with NICE. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this result was robust. Conclusions A screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in adults following major incidents appears cost-effective in England compared to treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes.

At ?1 ribosomal frameshifting sites, several types of pseudoknot have been identified which differ in their organisation and functionality. The pseudoknot found in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is typical of those that possess a long stem 1 of 11-12 bp and a long loop 2 (30-164 nt). A second group of pseudoknots are distinguishable that contain stems of only 5 to 7 bp and shorter loops. The NMR structure of one such pseudoknot, that of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), has revealed that it is kinked at the stem 1-stem 2 junction, and that this kinked conformation is essential for efficient frameshifting. We recently investigated the effect on frameshifting of modulating stem 1 length and stability in IBV-based pseudoknots, and found that a stem 1 with at least 11 bp was needed for efficient frameshifting. Here, we describe the sequence manipulations that are necessary to bypass the requirement for an 11 bp stem 1 and to convert a short non-functional IBV-derived pseudoknot into a highly efficient, kinked frameshifter pseudoknot. Simple insertion of an adenine residue at the stem 1-stem 2 junction (an essential feature of a kinked pseudoknot) was not sufficient to create a functional pseudoknot. An additional change was needed: efficient frameshifting was recovered only when the last nucleotide of loop 2 was changed from a G to an A. The requirement for an A at the end of loop 2 is consistent with a loop-helix contact similar to those described in other RNA tertiary structures. A mutational analysis of both partners of the proposed interaction, the loop 2 terminal adenine residue and two GC pairs near the top of stem 1, revealed that the interaction was essential for efficient frameshifting. The specific requirement for a 3-terminal A residue was lost when loop 2 was increased from 8 to 14 nt, suggesting that the loop-helix contact may be required only in those pseudoknots with a short loop 2.","output":"Evidence for an RNA pseudoknot loop-helix interaction essential for efficient ?1 ribosomal frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was named as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 11, 2020. The rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients is essential to reduce the disease spread. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard test to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection. The rapid antigen test which can detect the presence of viral protein antigens in respiratory tract samples is being investigated as an alternative option, especially in cases where RT-PCR is not available or the test capacity is exceeded, due to its faster results, ease of application, low cost and lack of special equipment and personnel. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the performance of a commercial rapid antigen test using nasopharyngeal samples of COVID-19 patients confirmed with RT-PCR. From the first day of the research, the first 80 consecutively SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and 40 RT-PCR negative respiratory samples sent to the Medical Microbiology Laboratory for routine SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing were included in the study. RT-PCR tests of the samples were performed in routine studies with the BioSpeedy SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit (Bioeksen, Turkey). Rapid antigen tests were performed with the Wesail COVID-19 antigen test kit (Guangdong, China) simultaneously with RT-PCR tests. Amongst the 80 positive RT-PCR samples, 56 were detected by the rapid antigen test. All the samples detected as positive with the rapid antigen tests were also positive with RT-PCR. There was a moderate agreement between the qualitative results of both tests (Kappa= 0.609, p<0.001). According to the PCR test, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of the rapid antigen test were; 70%, 100%, 100%, 62.5%, and 80% (96/120), respectively. The sensitivities of the rapid antigen test were calculated as 92.6% in 54 samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of <17, 88.7% in 62 samples with a Ct value of <20, 77.8% in 72 samples with a Ct value of <22, and 74.7% in 75 samples with a Ct value of <25. According to our study data; the rapid antigen test was found less sensitive than the RT-PCR test. Negative results obtained with rapid antigen testing cannot exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and must be confirmed by RT-PCR. In addition, according to the ROC analysis of rapid antigen test positivity obtained according to RT-PCR Ct values, the clinical performance of the rapid antigen test is good in samples with Ct values <20. The rapid antigen test should be evaluated as a reliable screening test in patients with high viral load. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other study in the literature performed with the Wesail COVID-19 rapid antigen test kit (Guangdong, China) used in our study. The fact that PPV was found to be 100% even at a low prevalence period of the pandemic will enable positive patients to be screened quickly and effectively with rapid antigen tests in the first step during the high prevalence period of the pandemic. In the light of these data and our results, it can be predicted that using the rapid antigen test as a screening test in the first step and confirming only negative patients with RT-PCR will contribute to the effective management of the pandemic process in terms of both time and cost. As a result of the study, the rapid antigen test with low sensitivity but high PPD can be included as a facilitating test in the first step of the diagnostic algorithm in terms of rapid identification of the patients with high viral load, initiation of treatment and providing filiation.","output":"[Evaluation of the Rapid Antigen Detection Kit with the Polymerase Chain Reaction for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Samples]./ Solunum Yolu ?rneklerinde SARS-CoV-2 Tespiti i?in Hizli Antijen Tespit Kitinin Polimeraz Zincir Reaksiyonu ile Birlikte Degerlendirilmesi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The anecdotal report describes two examples of COVID-19-positive healthcare professionals (HCPs) who had worked as nurses during pre-symptomatic period and subsequently presented a mild clinical course of COVID-19.

In the case of thyrotoxicosis, propylthiouracil and thiamazole are available for treatment depending on the stage of gestation. Sheehans syndrome is an infarction of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland during a hemorrhage. Due to the loss of production of vital hormones, this can be fatal. The development of pulmonary edema is just as acute. This is favored by physiological changes during pregnancy. The differentiation between hypertensive and hypotensive pulmonary edema is important for the causal treatment.","output":"Internistische Notf?lle bei der schwangeren Patientin: Peripartale Sepsis, Stoffwechselentgleisungen, endokrinologische Notf?lle und Lungen?dem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic cancer in women, and the incidence of EC has increased by about 1% per year in the U. S over the last 10 years. Although 5-year survival rates for early-stage EC are around 80%, certain subtypes of EC that lose nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) expression are associated with poor survival rates. For example, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative EC typically harbors a worse prognosis compared to ER-positive EC. The molecular basis for the loss of NHR expression in endometrial tumors and its contribution to poor survival is largely unknown. Furthermore, there are no tools to systematically identify tumors that lose NHR mRNA expression relative to normal tissue. The development of such an approach could identify sets of NHR-based biomarkers for classifying patients into subgroups with poor survival outcomes. METHODS: Here, a new computational method, termed receptLoss, was developed for identifying NHR expression loss in endometrial cancer relative to adjacent normal tissue. When applied to gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), receptLoss identified 6 NHRs that were highly expressed in normal tissue and exhibited expression loss in a subset of endometrial tumors. RESULTS: Three of the six identified NHRs - estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors - that are known to lose expression in ECs were correctly identified by receptLoss. Additionally, a novel association was found between thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) expression loss, increased expression of miRNA-146a, and increased rates of 5-year survival in the EC TCGA patient cohort. THRB expression loss occurs independently of estrogen and progesterone expression loss, suggesting the discovery of a distinct, clinically-relevant molecular subgroup. CONCLUSION: ReceptLoss is a novel, open-source software tool to systematically identify NHR expression loss in cancer. The application of receptLoss to endometrial cancer gene expression data identified THRB, a previously undescribed biomarker of survival in endometrial cancer. Applying receptLoss to expression data from additional cancer types could lead to the development of biomarkers of disease progression for patients with any other tumor type. ReceptLoss can be applied to expression data from additional cancer types with the goal of identifying biomarkers of differential survival.","output":"Identification of a novel subgroup of endometrial cancer patients with loss of thyroid hormone receptor beta expression and improved survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cutaneous manifestations, a well-known effect of viral infections, are beginning to be reported in patients with COVID-19 disease.

Children and young people have been particularly affected. Aim: To increase the understanding of home and community-based strategies that contribute to children and young people's capacity to adjust to societal changes, both during and after pandemics. Moreover, to identify ways in which children's actions contribute to the capacity of others to adjust to the changes arising from the pandemic.

This study aims to evaluate burnout status and mood disorder of healthcare workers during this period. An online questionnaire was voluntarily answered by eligible adult employees in a COVID-19 specialized medical center. The major analysis included the burnout status and mood disorder. Factors related to more severe mood disorder were also identified. A total of 2029 participants completed the questionnaire. There were 901 (44.4%) and 923 (45.5%) participants with moderate to severe personal and work-related burnout status, respectively. Nurses working in the emergency room (ER), intensive care unit (ICU)/isolation wards, and general wards, as well as those with patient contact, had significantly higher scores for personal burnout, work-related burnout, and mood disorder. This investigation identified 271 participants (13.35%) with moderate to severe mood disorder linked to higher personal/work-related burnout scores and a more advanced burnout status. Univariate analysis revealed that nurses working in the ER and ICU/isolation wards were associated with moderate to severe mood disorder risk factors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that working in the ER (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.14-6.90) was the only independent risk factor.

We aimed to study the outcomes of patients with cancer who were infected with SARS CoV2, and identify risk factors for adverse outcomes after COVID-19. Methods We included patients with cancer, who were diagnosed with SARS CoV2 between 11th April 2020 and February 2021 at a tertiary referral cancer centre in India. We collected data on age, sex, coexisting medical conditions, type of cancer, intent of cancer management, cancer treatment details, and severity and outcome of COVID-19. The primary outcome was a composite of severe COVID (defined as grade 6 or more on the WHO ordinal scale) or death within 30 days. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for severe COVID or death. Results We obtained data on 1253 patients with cancer and SARS CoV2 infection, of whom 293 (23.6%) had hematological malignancies. The severity of COVID was mild (grade 1 to 3 on WHO ordinal scale) in 1014 (81%) patients, moderate (WHO grade 4 or 5) in 167 (13%) patients and severe (WHO grade 6 or 7) in 72 (6%) patients. The primary outcome was seen in 160 patients (12.8%) and the all-cause 30-day mortality was 10.9% (138 deaths). Advanced age [adjusted OR 1.84 (0.86;3.94)], history of smoking [aOR 1.78 (1.10;2.91)], palliative intent of treatment [aOR 3.57 (2.48 to 5.12)] and presence of more than 2 comorbidities [aOR 1.66 (1.03 to 2.67)] were significant risk factors for severe COVID or death. Advanced age and palliative intent of treatment remained significant risk factors for 30-day mortality. Recent systemic anti-cancer therapy, sex or cancer type did not influence outcomes. Conclusion Most patients with cancer who developed COVID-19 in our setting had mild disease;the elderly and those treated with palliative intent were at higher risk of severe COVID-19 or death. Recent cancer therapy did not impact COVID-19 severity or outcomes suggesting that in most patients with cancer, the management of cancer should continue uninterrupted during the pandemic.","output":"Outcomes of COVID-19 and risk factors in patients with cancer - a cohort study (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To explore nurses' personal, social and professional experiences in COVID-19 emergency departments and intensive care units based on the Reconceptualized Uncertainty in Illness Theory. DESIGN: This study used an interpretive qualitative descriptive design. METHODS: Open-ended interviews were conducted between August and November 2020 with 21 nurses using interview questions based on the Reconceptualized Uncertainty in Illness Theory. Data were analysed using steps informed by hermeneutic phenomenology and reported using Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. FINDINGS: Data were grouped under five categories with 10 themes based on the Reconceptualized Uncertainty in Illness Theory: 'antecedents of uncertainty', 'appraisal of uncertainty', 'coping with uncertainty', 'probabilistic thinking' and 'formation of a new life perspective'. Nurses reported that they experienced uncertainty about being infected and infecting others with COVID-19 as well as caring for COVID-19 patients. Despite the uncertainties related to COVID-19, nurses were determined to focus on caring for COVID-19 patients by prioritizing their professional identity and responsibilities. They described feeling motivated by patients' positive feedback, which also increased their professional satisfaction. They realized that caring was therapeutic not only for their patients, but also for them. They experienced empowerment in the care team through active reuse of their prior knowledge and experience and expanded decision-making roles. They also emphasized that they perceived the COVID-19 pandemic as a unique experience for their individual and professional growth. CONCLUSION: Nurses experienced multiple sources of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. To manage uncertainty, they used strategies including focusing on patient care and satisfaction. Additionally, they made sense of their experience by acknowledging individual and professional growth.

METHODS: Corneal densitometry (CD) values of 102 eyes were divided into three main groups: 33 DMEKs, 19 DSAEKs, and 50 healthy eyes without previous ocular surgery. The CD values were then analyzed and compared between the groups. We measured three main layers in depth and four different concentric zones at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: In the DMEK group, total CD significantly decreased from 38.02  10.21 grayscale units (GSU) to 31.13  9.25 GSU (P < 0.01) between the first and the sixth month postoperative. In the DSAEK group, we found significant changes only between the first and three months after surgery (from 42.62  9.31 GSU to 38.71  10.53 GSU (P < 0.01). Regarding the concentric zones, CD in the DMEK group significantly decreased in the central zone from 33.55  12.07 GSU to 30.63  10.15 GSU (P < 0.01) and significantly increased in the periphery from 30.63  10.15 GSU to 36.72  9.37 GSU, (P < 0.01).

Complete sequences of 47 consensus genomes are available for bat -coronaviruses related to the SARS-CoV-2 human virus. We carried out several types of evolutionary analyses using these data. First, using the publicly available BEAST 2 software, we generated phylogenetic trees and skyline plots. The roots of the trees, both for the entire sequences and subsequences coding for the E and S proteins as well as the 5 and 3 UTR regions, are estimated to be located from several decades to more than a thousand years ago, while the effective population sizes remained largely constant. Motivated by this, we developed a simple estimator of the effective population size in a Moran model with constant population, which, under the model is equal to the expected age of the MRCA measured in generations. Comparisons of these estimates to those produced by BEAST 2 shows qualitative agreement. We also compared the site frequency spectra (SFS) of the bat genomes to those provided by the Moran Tug-of-War model.

In order to effectively target government responses, it is critical to identify the individuals most at risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), developing severe clinical signs, and mortality. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to present the current status of scientific knowledge in these areas and describe the need for unified global approaches, moving forwards, as well as lessons learnt for future pandemics. METHODS: Medline, Embase and Global Health were searched to the end of April 2020, as well as the Web of Science. Search terms were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. Comparative studies of risk factors from any setting, population group and in any language were included. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by two reviewers and extracted in duplicate into a standardised form. Data were extracted on risk factors for COVID-19 disease, severe disease, or death and were narratively and descriptively synthesised. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and thirty-eight papers were identified post-deduplication. Thirty-three met our inclusion criteria, of which 26 were from China. Six assessed the risk of contracting the disease, 20 the risk of having severe disease and ten the risk of dying. Age, gender and co-morbidities were commonly assessed as risk factors. The weight of evidence showed increasing age to be associated with severe disease and mortality, and general comorbidities with mortality. Only seven studies presented multivariable analyses and power was generally limited. A wide range of definitions were used for disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of literature generated in the short time since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 has been considerable. Many studies have sought to document the risk factors for COVID-19 disease, disease severity and mortality; age was the only risk factor based on robust studies and with a consistent body of evidence. Mechanistic studies are required to understand why age is such an important risk factor.

Furthermore, we found that the majority of participants in a subset of our cohort who completed structural and functional neuroimaging (n=15) had smaller olfactory bulbs and sulci in conjunction with anosmia. We also showed that this subset of participants had dysfunction in attention network functional connectivity and ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed-based functional connectivity. These functional imaging dysfunctions have been observed previously in depression and correlated with levels of inflammation. Our results support and extend previous findings in the literature concerning the neuropsychiatric sequelae associated with long COVID. Ongoing data collection and analyses within this cohort will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the longitudinal relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms, neurocognitive performance, brain structure and function, and inflammatory and immune profiles.","output":"Survivors of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Show Neuropsychiatric Sequelae Measured by Surveys, Neurocognitive Testing, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Preliminary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adolescence represents a crucial developmental period in shaping mental health trajectories. In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use during this sensitive developmental stage. METHODS: In this longitudinal, population-based study, surveys were administered to a nationwide sample of 13-18-year-olds in Iceland in October or February in 2016 and 2018, and in October, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). The surveys assessed depressive symptoms with the Symptom Checklist-90, mental wellbeing with the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, and the frequency of cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and alcohol intoxication. Demographic data were collected, which included language spoken at home although not ethnicity data. We used mixed effects models to study the effect of gender, age, and survey year on trends in mental health outcomes. FINDINGS: 59 701 survey responses were included; response rates ranged from 63% to 86%. An increase in depressive symptoms (? 057, 95% CI 053 to 060) and worsened mental wellbeing (? -046, 95% CI -049 to -042) were observed across all age groups during the pandemic compared with same-aged peers before COVID-19. These outcomes were significantly worse in adolescent girls compared with boys (? 416, 95% CI 405 to 428, and ? -113, 95% CI -123 to -103, respectively). Cigarette smoking (OR 261, 95% CI 259 to 266), e-cigarette use (OR 261, 95% CI 259 to 264), and alcohol intoxication (OR 259, 95% CI 256 to 264) declined among 15-18-year-olds during COVID-19, with no similar gender differences. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that COVID-19 has significantly impaired adolescent mental health. However, the decrease observed in substance use during the pandemic might be an unintended benefit of isolation, and might serve as a protective factor against future substance use disorders and dependence. Population-level prevention efforts, especially for girls, are warranted. FUNDING: Icelandic Research Fund.

Although there has been focus on rising rates of childhood wasting in the short term, maternal and child undernutrition rates are also likely to increase as a consequence of COVID-19 and its impacts on poverty, coverage of essential interventions, and access to appropriate nutritious foods. Key sectors at particular risk of collapse or reduced efficiency in the wake of COVID-19 include food systems, incomes, and social protection, health care services for women and children, and services and access to clean water and sanitation. This review highlights key areas of concern for maternal and child nutrition during and in the aftermath of COVID-19 while providing strategic guidance for countries in their efforts to reduce maternal and child undernutrition. Rooted in learnings from the exemplars in Global Health's Stunting Reduction Exemplars project, we provide a set of recommendations that span investments in sectors that have sustained direct and indirect impact on nutrition. These include interventions to strengthen the food-supply chain and reducing food insecurity to assist those at immediate risk of food shortages. Other strategies could include targeted social safety net programs, payment deferrals, or tax breaks as well as suitable cash-support programs for the most vulnerable. Targeting the most marginalized households in rural populations and urban slums could be achieved through deploying community health workers and supporting women and community members. Community-led sanitation programs could be key to ensuring healthy household environments and reducing undernutrition. Additionally, several COVID-19 response measures such as contact tracing and self-isolation could also be exploited for nutrition protection. Global health and improvements in undernutrition will require governments, donors, and development partners to restrategize and reprioritize investments for the COVID-19 era, and will necessitate data-driven decision making, political will and commitment, and international unity.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation strategies: implications for maternal and child health and nutrition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) last for less than 30 days and are the most common acute diseases affecting people worldwide. Exercise has been shown to improve health generally and may be effective in reducing the occurrence, severity and duration of acute respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise for altering the occurrence, severity or duration of acute respiratory infections. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948 to July week 1, 2014), EMBASE (2010 to July 2014), CINAHL (1981 to July 2014), LILACS (1982 to July 2014), SPORTDiscus (1985 to July 2014), PEDro (searched on 11 July 2014), OTseeker (searched on 11 July 2014), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched on 11 July 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of exercise for ARIs in the general population. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials using a standard form. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. One review author entered data and a second review author checked this. There were sufficient differences in the populations trialled and in the nature of the interventions to use the random-effects model (which makes fewer assumptions than the fixed-effect model) in the analysis. MAIN RESULTS We included 11 trials involving 904 adults, published between 1990 and 2014. Eight studies were conducted in the USA, and one each in Canada, Spain and Turkey. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 154 participants aged between 18 and 85 years old. The proportion of female participants varied between 52% and 100%. The duration of follow-up in the studies varied from seven days to 12 months. The exercise type most prescribed for the intervention was aerobic (walking in 70% of the studies, or bicycle riding or treadmill) at least five times a week. Duration was 30 to 45 minutes at moderate intensity. Participants were supervised in 90% of the studies.For four of the primary outcomes the results did not differ significantly and all were low-quality evidence (number of ARI episodes per person per year, rate ratio 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.42); proportion of participants who experienced at least one ARI over the study period, risk ratio 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.01); severity of ARI symptoms, mean difference (MD) -110 (95% CI -324 to 104); and number of symptom days in the follow-up period, MD -2.1 days (95% CI -4.4 to 0.3)). However, one primary outcome, the number of symptom days per episode of illness, was reduced in those participants who exercised (MD -1.1 day, 95% CI -1.7 to -0.5, moderate-quality evidence).We found no significant differences for the secondary outcomes (laboratory parameters (blood lymphocytes, salivary secretory immunoglobulin and neutrophils); quality of life outcomes; cost-effectiveness and exercise-related injuries).There was good adherence to the intervention with no difference between the exercise and non-exercise groups.We rated the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes as low for most outcomes using the GRADE criteria: allocation concealment was not reported and there was a lack of blinding; in addition, there was imprecision (the CI is very wide because of a small number of participants) and inconsistency, which may be due to differences in study design. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We cannot determine whether exercise is effective at altering the occurrence, severity or duration of acute respiratory infections. One analysis of four trials suggests that the number of days of illness per episode of infection might be reduced by exercise. The small size of the studies, risk of bias and heterogeneous populations trialled all contribute to the uncertainty. Larger studies, with less risk of bias from patient selection, blinding of outcomes assessors, reporting of all outcomes measured and with registration of study protocols, are required to settle the question.","output":"Exercise versus no exercise for the occurrence, severity and duration of acute respiratory infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the past 25 years, phage display technology has been an invaluable tool for studies of proteinCprotein interactions.

This review will focus on the unique properties of the filamentous bacteriophage and highlight its diverse applications in current research. Particular emphases are placed on: (i) the advantages of the phage as a vaccine carrier, including its high immunogenicity, relative antigenic simplicity and ability to activate a range of immune responses, (ii) the phages potential as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for infectious and chronic diseases, (iii) the regularity of the virion major coat protein lattice, which enables a variety of bioconjugation and surface chemistry applications, particularly in nanomaterials, and (iv) the phages large population sizes and fast generation times, which make it an excellent model system for directed protein evolution. Despite their ubiquity in the biosphere, metagenomics work is just beginning to explore the ecology of filamentous and non-filamentous phage, and their role in the evolution of bacterial populations.

In this sense, the study intends to evaluate the effects of IC on the employees IP, having as a mediator perceived organisational support (POS). Methodology: To achieve the aforementioned objectives, a cross-sectional quantitative study was prepared, data for which were collected during a period of confinement that took place between 9 February and 15 March 2021. A total of 340 individuals of both sexes participated in the study. Genders were 67.6% female and 32.4% male, with ages ranging from 25 years to over 61 years, from all districts of Portugal and the Islands. Results: The main results obtained showed that IC was positively and significantly correlated with POS and also with IP, and that there was also a total mediation effect of POS in the relationship between IC and IP. Practical implications: These results seem to support the need for organisations to invest in their internal communication practices as a way of stimulating strong and fruitful relationships between workers and the organisation. Internal communication seems to be a relevant indicator for the management of proximity relationships with workers, especially in adverse contexts, like the ones experienced during the pandemic crisis.

The Pandemic Recovery Acceleration Model (PRAM) analytic tool was developed and implemented state wide in Nebraska to allow health officials, public officials, industry leaders and community leaders to capture a real time snapshot of how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting their local community, a region or the state and use this novel lens to aid in making key mitigation and recovery decisions. This is done by using six commonly available metrics that are monitored daily across the state describing the pandemic impact: number of new cases, percent positive tests, deaths, occupied hospital beds, occupied intensive care beds and utilized ventilators, all directly related to confirmed COVID-19 patients. Nebraska is separated into six Health Care Coalitions based on geography, public health and medical care systems. The PRAM aggregates the data for each of these geographic regions based on disease prevalence acceleration and health care resource utilization acceleration, producing real time analysis of the acceleration of change for each metric individually and also combined into a single weighted index, the PRAM Recovery Index. These indices are then shared daily with the state leadership, coalition leaders and public health directors and also tracked over time, aiding in real time regional and statewide decisions of resource allocation and the extent of use of comprehensive non-pharmacologic interventions.","output":"A Novel Approach to Data Driven Pandemic Recovery: The Pandemic Recovery Acceleration Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether convalescent plasma therapy is beneficial to patients with severe acute respiratory infections and gave hints to the management of COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library was conducted for all eligible studies range from inception to February 29, 2020. Studies with control group were included. Treatment group received convalescent plasma therapy, and control group may receive any therapy other than convalescent plasma therapy. Odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for categorical and continuous outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1997 patients from 13 studies were included, and seven studies were prospectively designed. Pooled analysis indicated convalescent plasma treatment significantly reduced the mortality by 51% (OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.67). Subgroup analyses by publication time, study design, and influenza A revealed similar results. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were stable. In addition, convalescent plasma therapy reduced mechanical ventilation requirement (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.59), while it was not associated with less use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.83 to 4.83) and shorter length of hospital stay (MD: -2.20, 95% CI: -4.98 to 0.57days). Pooled estimates showed there was no difference in serious adverse effects between the convalescent plasma treatment and control groups (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.13).

As a potential carrier of the novel coronavirus, the exhaled airflow of infected individuals through coughs is significant in virus transmission. The research of detailed airflow characteristics and velocity distributions is insufficient because most previous studies utilize particle image velocimetry (PIV) with low frequency. This study measured the airflow velocity of human coughs in a chamber using PIV with high frequency (interval: 1/2986 s) to provide a detailed validation database for droplet propagation CFD simulation. Sixty cough cases for ten young healthy nonsmoking volunteers (five males and five females) were analyzed. Ensemble-average operations were conducted to eliminate individual variations. Vertical and horizontal velocity distributions were measured around the mouth area. Overall cough characteristics such as cough duration time (CDT), peak velocity time (PVT), maximum velocities, and cough spread angle were obtained. The CDT of the cough airflow was 520C560 m s, while PVT was 20 m s. The male/female averaged maximum velocities were 15.2/13.1 m/s. The average vertical/horizontal cough spread angle was 15.3/13.3 for males and 15.6/14.2 for females. In addition, the spatial and temporal distributions of ensemble-averaged velocity profiles were obtained in the vertical and horizontal directions.

Currently, four vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved by the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany, and vaccination campaigns have been started nationwide. In this respect, it is of utmost importance to give recommendations on possible immunological interactions and potential risks of immunomodulatory substances (monoclonal antibodies, biologicals) during concurrent vaccination with the approved vaccines. Materials and methods: This position paper provides specific recommendations on the use of immunomodulatory drugs in the context of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations based on current literature. Results: The recommendations are covering the following conditions in which biologicals are indicated and approved: 1) chronic inflammatory skin diseases (atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria), 2) bronchial asthma, and 3) chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Patients with atopic dermatitis or chronic spontaneous urticaria are not at increased risk for allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, vaccination may result in transient eczema exacerbation due to general immune stimulation. Vaccination in patients receiving systemic therapy with biologicals can be performed. Patients with severe asthma and concomitant treatment with biologicals also do not have an increased risk of allergic reaction following COVID-19 vaccination which is recommended in these patients. Patients with CRSwNP are also not known to be at increased risk for allergic vaccine reactions, and continuation or initiation of a treatment with biologicals is also recommended with concurrent COVID-19 vaccination. In general, COVID-19 vaccination should be given within the interval between two applications of the respective biological, that is, with a time-lag of at least 1 week after the previous or at least 1 week before the next biological treatment planned. Conclusion: Biologicals for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, bronchial asthma, and CRSwNP should be continued during the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study aimed to assess the effectiveness of high-dose oral erythromycin as a prokinetic agent in decreasing the incidence of PNAC. Two secondary end points, including the time to achieve full enteral feeding and the duration of parenteral nutrition, were also evaluated. Methods: Infants consecutively admitted to the neonatal unit were randomized to receive erythromycin (12.5 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours for 14 days) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (placebo) if they attained less than half the total daily fluid intake (<75 mL/kg/day) as milk feeds on day 14 of life. Results: Of 182 VLBW infants enrolled, 91 received erythromycin. The incidence of PNAC was significantly lower in erythromycin-treated infants (18/91) compared with placebo infants (37/91; P = .003). Treated infants achieved full enteral nutrition significantly earlier (mean, 10.1; SE, 1.7 days; P < .001), and the duration of parenteral nutrition was also significantly decreased by 10 days (P < .001). Importantly, fewer infants receiving erythromycin had 2 or more episodes of septicemia (n = 4) compared with placebo patients (n = 13, P = .03).

Different number of the mortality rate in various societies have been reported. However, it seems the underlying comorbidities increase the risk of mortality and the severity of presentation. In this study we evaluated the pattern of presentation of COVID-19 among cancerous patients in terms of severity. METHOD: between 20th February to 22nd April of 2020, among 214 hospitalized patients because of COVID-19. 41 patients revealed the cancer as a synchronous comorbidity. These patients based on the severity of COVID-19 infection presentation were divided to mild and severe groups. Then, the demographic characteristics, manifestation and laboratory data between these groups were compared. RESULT: about 19 (46.34%) of 41 cases were categorized as severe forms of COVID-19 with malignancy. The mean age of severe groups was significantly higher (P=0.00). Dyspnea (48.78%), cough (46.34%) and myalgia (24.39%) were the most common clinical features among cancerous patients with COVID-19. diarrhea and nearly cough caused significant effects on severe form of presentation of COVID-19 infection (P=0.05, P=0.06, respectively).

Multiple RT-PCR tests were performed using deep nasal swab samples and the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 genes N, RdRP, and E. RESULTS: Patients median age was of 49 years (range: 24C91) with a male majority (62.7%). We found increasing levels of Ct values in time, with a mean Ct value of 29.13 (n = 61, standard deviation (sd) = 5.55) for the first test and 34.38 (n = 60, sd = 4), 35.52 (n = 20, sd = 2.85), and 36.12 (n = 6, sd = 3.28), for the second, third, and fourth tests, respectively.

This study aims to estimate the risk of disease progression of patients who have been confirmed with COVID-19. Methods: Meta-analysis was performed in existing literatures to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia progression. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to hospitals in Wuhan or Hangzhou were retrospectively enrolled. The risk prediction model and nomogram were developed from Wuhan cohort through logistic regression algorithm, and then validated in Hangzhou and Yinchuan cohorts. Results: A total of 270 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 30, 2019, and Mar 30, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled (Table 1). The development cohort (Wuhan cohort) included 87 (43%) men and 115 (57%) women, and the median age was 53 years old.

There are few studies describing co-morbidities and demographics associated with patients re-admitted within 30-days of discharge. The purpose of this study is to describe this patient population. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to identify patients who were admitted secondary to SARS-CoV-2 and required readmission within 30 days due to complications that might be associated with COVID-19. Adults admitted between 3/15/2020 and 11/15/2020 were included in this study. Baseline demographics including age, gender and race in addition to select comorbidities were identified. RESULTS: 250 patients were identified who were readmitted for various reasons. Readmitted patients had a median age of 55 years, 44% were male, and 41.2% were Black/African American. 62.4% of the population was obese (BMI 30 kg/m(2)) with 21.6% with a BMI  40 kg/m(2). The top three co-morbidities seen included Diabetes Mellitus (DM) (32.2%), Hyperlipidemia (48.3%) and Hypertension (51.7%). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Though this study lacked a comparator group, it is clear that patients readmitted with all cause etiologies were disproportionally Black/African-American and obese, with a high prevalence of DM, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. We recommend close monitoring of patients in these groups to reduce COVID19 readmissions. This is the first step in identifying which patients may be more likely to develop complications and required readmission, the next step is to compare these patients to those that were not readmitted to develop a risk model for readmission.

In response, the question of how individuals from different social and economic strata cope with those changes has arisen, as well as how much they have affected their mental well-being. Choosing strategies that cope with both the pandemic and the well-being of the population has also been a challenge for different governments. While a large number of studies have investigated the mental health of people from different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, few have explored the number and type of changes experienced during lockdown by the general population, alongside their relationships with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To fill this research gap, an observational cross-sectional study on those associations was conducted in the French-speaking part of the Swiss general population. Data were collected from 431 participants during the first four weeks of lockdown due to COVID-19. Multivariate regressions were used to identify the sociodemographic profile of the population that experienced different types and numbers of changes during this period, the association of those changes with the HRQoL-mental and physical-and infection beliefs, and the perception of the governmental measures. We show that the more changes people experienced, the lower their mental HRQoL; however, adherence to governmental measures has helped people to cope with the imposed changes, even though the number of unexpected and unwished changes have strained their mental HRQoL. The low-income population experienced financial difficulties and changes in their food intake more frequently, while dual-citizenship or non-Swiss individuals declared conflictual situations more frequently. Sport practice had a positive association with mental HRQoL; nevertheless, a decrease in sport practice was frequently reported, which correlated with a lower mental HRQoL. Risk perception of COVID-19 increased with lower physical HRQoL score, which supports the efficiency of governmental communication regarding the pandemic. Our results support that government measures should be accompanied by effective and targeted communication about the risk of infection, in order to encourage all strata of the general population to follow such measures and adapt to the changes without unduly affecting their mental health. The usage of such tools might help to reduce the impact of policy-imposed changes on the mental HRQoL of the general population, by inducing voluntary changes in informed and engaged populations.","output":"Sudden Changes and Their Associations with Quality of Life during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study in the French-Speaking Part of Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic character of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) requires strategy changes designed to guarantee the safety of patients and health-care professionals.

The objective of this review is to provide an overview of recently published studies examining ultrasound-guided diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques for the brachial plexus (BP) to favor their preferent use in patients at risk of respiratory function compromise. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last 18 months, study findings on various diaphragm-sparing regional anesthesia techniques have demonstrated comparable block analgesic effectivity with a variable extent of phrenic nerve paralysis. The impact of hemi-diaphragmatic function impairment on clinical outcomes is yet to be established. SUMMARY: Existing diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus regional anesthesia techniques used for shoulder and clavicle surgery may help minimize pulmonary complications by preserving lung function, especially in patients prone to respiratory compromise. Used as an anesthetic technique, they can reduce the risk of exposure of healthcare teams to aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs), albeit posing an increased risk for hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis. Reducing the incidence of phrenic nerve involvement and obtaining opioid-sparing analgesia without jeopardizing efficacy should be prioritized goals of regional anesthesia practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Diaphragm-sparing brachial plexus blocks: a focused review of current evidence and their role during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and caused a pandemic associated with a spectrum of COVID-19 disease ranging from asymptomatic to lethal infection. Serology testing is important for diagnosis of infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting past infection for population-based studies, are priorities. Methods: We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). Results: The LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of the N antigen in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens NSP1, ORF3b, ORF7a and ORF8 which may mediate immune functions other than neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient.","output":"Beyond the Spike: identification of viral targets of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the family Filoviridae, is responsible for causing Ebola virus disease (EVD) (formerly named Ebola hemorrhagic fever). This is a severe, often fatal illness with mortality rates varying from 50 to 90% in humans. Although the virus and associated disease has been recognized since 1976, it was only when the recent outbreak of EBOV in 2014C2016 highlighted the danger and global impact of this virus, necessitating the need for coming up with the effective vaccines and drugs to counter its pandemic threat. Albeit no commercial vaccine is available so far against EBOV, a few vaccine candidates are under evaluation and clinical trials to assess their prophylactic efficacy. These include recombinant viral vector (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector, chimpanzee adenovirus type 3-vector, and modified vaccinia Ankara virus), Ebola virus-like particles, virus-like replicon particles, DNA, and plant-based vaccines. Due to improvement in the field of genomics and proteomics, epitope-targeted vaccines have gained top priority. Correspondingly, several therapies have also been developed, including immunoglobulins against specific viral structures small cell-penetrating antibody fragments that target intracellular EBOV proteins. Small interfering RNAs and oligomer-mediated inhibition have also been verified for EVD treatment. Other treatment options include viral entry inhibitors, transfusion of convalescent blood/serum, neutralizing antibodies, and gene expression inhibitors. Repurposed drugs, which have proven safety profiles, can be adapted after high-throughput screening for efficacy and potency for EVD treatment. Herbal and other natural products are also being explored for EVD treatment. Further studies to better understand the pathogenesis and antigenic structures of the virus can help in developing an effective vaccine and identifying appropriate antiviral targets.

In 2007, the World Health Organization set a goal of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of syphilis, with targets of (i) at least 95% coverage of antenatal care, (ii) 95% testing coverage of pregnant women for HIV and syphilis and (iii) 95% treatment coverage for those pregnant women testing positive for HIV or syphilis.11 Among women giving birth in Aotearoa New Zealand in 2018, 95.5% registered for antenatal care.12 However, a considerable number register later in pregnancy and hence do not receive early antenatal testing or adequate antenatal care, representing missed opportunities for early intervention. Repeat testing during pregnancy has long been recommended in international guidelines for those at high risk of syphilis because serological tests may be falsely negative in early infection or infection may be acquired later in pregnancy.19 In 2018, the New Zealand College of Midwives proactively issued a syphilis advisory statement that highlighted the need to recommend testing or re-testing for syphilis at any gestation for anyone with clinical indicators and to offer re-screening between 28 and 32 weeks for women with risk factors.","output":"Eliminating congenital syphilis from Aotearoa New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of protein 3-D structural comparison methods is essential for understanding protein functions. Some amino acids share structural similarities while others vary considerably. These structures determine the chemical and physical properties of amino acids. Grouping amino acids with similar structures potentially improves the ability to identify structurally conserved regions and increases the global structural similarity between proteins. We systematically studied the effects of amino acid grouping on the numbers of Specific/specific, Common/common, and statistically different keys to achieve a better understanding of protein structure relations. Common keys represent substructures found in all types of proteins and Specific keys represent substructures exclusively belonging to a certain type of proteins in a data set. Our results show that applying amino acid grouping to the Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR)-based method, while computing structural similarity among proteins, improves the accuracy of protein clustering in certain cases. In addition, applying amino acid grouping facilitates the process of identification or discovery of conserved structural motifs. The results from the principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrate that applying amino acid grouping captures slightly more structural variation than when amino acid grouping is not used, indicating that amino acid grouping reduces structure diversity as predicted. The TSR-based method uniquely identifies and discovers binding sites for drugs or interacting proteins. The binding sites of nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that we have defined will aid future antiviral drug design for improving therapeutic outcome. This approach for incorporating the amino acid grouping feature into our structural comparison method is promising and provides a deeper insight into understanding of structural relations of proteins.","output":"Exploring the effectiveness of the TSR-based protein 3-D structural comparison method for protein clustering, and structural motif identification and discovery of protein kinases, hydrolases, and SARS-CoV-2's protein via the application of amino acid grouping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: In this study, we identify knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of the people of the State of Tabasco (Mexico) as they influence transmission and mitigation of COVID-19.

Nursing facilities in Lombardy (Italy) were left with no, or limited, access to testing for 8 weeks after the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: This study includes 246 residents and 286 workers of three different nursing homes in Brescia-Lombardy. Clinical questionnaires and rapid serology tests were devised to integrate the data of the first available RT-PCR screening. Follow-up serology after 60-days was performed on 67 of 86 workers with positive serology or clinically suspicious. Findings: Thirty-seven residents and 18 workers had previous positive RT-PCR. Thorough screening disclosed two additional RT-PCR-positive workers. Serology screening revealed antibodies in 59 residents and 48 workers, including 32/37 residents and all workers previously positive at RT-PCR. Follow up serology disclosed antibodies in two additional workers with recent symptoms at the time of screening. The professionals in close contact with residents had more infections (47/226C20.79% vs. 1/60C1.66%; p = 0.00013 Fisher exact-test).

The creation of bioaerosols is a recognized consequence of certain types of dental treatment and represents a potential mechanism for the spread of infection. Objectives The aims of the present study were to assess the bioaerosols generated by certain dental procedures and to evaluate the efficiency of a commercially available Air Cleaning System (ACS) designed to reduce bioaerosol levels. Methods Bioaerosol sampling was undertaken in the absence of clinical activity (baseline) and also during treatment procedures (cavity preparation using an air rotor, history and oral examination, ultrasonic scaling and tooth extraction under local anaesthesia). For each treatment, bioaerosols were measured for two patient episodes (with and without ACS operation) and between five and nine bioaerosol samples were collected. For baseline measurements, 15 bioaerosol samples were obtained. For bioaerosol sampling, environmental air was drawn on to blood agar plates using a bioaerosol sampling pump placed in a standard position 20 cm from the dental chair. Plates were incubated aerobically at 37C for 48 hours and resulting growth quantified as colony forming units (cfu/m(3)). Distinct colony types were identified using standard methods. Results were analysed statistically using SPSS 12 and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results The ACS resulted in a significant reduction (p = 0.001) in the mean bioaerosols (cfu/m(3)) of all three clinics compared with baseline measurements. The mean level of bioaerosols recorded during the procedures, with or without the ACS activated respectively, was 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 105.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.02) for cavity preparation, 23.9 cfu/m(3) and 62.2 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.04) for history and oral examination; 41.9 cfu/m(3) and 70.9 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for ultrasonic scaling and 9.1 cfu/m(3) and 66.1 cfu/m(3) (p = 0.01) for extraction.

This mixed-methods study explored the impact of LVC de-implementation on the patient-clinician relationship. METHODS: Adult primary care patients from a large Virginia health system volunteered to participate in a survey (n = 232) or interview (n = 24). Participants completed the Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ-9) after reading a vignette about a clinician declining to provide a low-value service: antibiotics for acute sinusitis (LVC-antibiotics); screening EKG (LVC-EKG); screening vitamin D test (LVC-vitamin D); or an alternate vignette about a high-value service, and imagining that their own primary care clinician had acted in the same manner. A different sample of participants was asked to imagine that their own primary care clinician did not order LVC-antibiotics or LVC-EKG and then respond to semi-structured interview questions. Outcomes data included participant demographics, PDRQ-9 scores (higher score = greater relationship integrity), and content analysis of transcribed interviews. Differences in PDRQ-9 scores were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Data were integrated for analysis and interpretation. RESULTS: Although participants generally agreed with the vignette narrative (not providing LVC), many demonstrated difficulty comprehending the broad concept of LVC and potential harms. The topic triggered memories of negative experiences with healthcare (typically poor-quality care, not necessarily LVC). The most common recommendation for reducing LVC was for patients to take greater responsibility for their own health. Most participants believed that their relationship with their clinician would not be negatively impacted by denial of LVC because they trusted their clinicians guidance. Participants emphasized that trusted clinicians are those who listen to them, spend time with them, and offer understandable advice. Some felt that not providing LVC would actually increase their trust in their clinician. Similar PDRQ-9 scores were observed for LVC-antibiotics (38.9), LVC-EKG (37.5), and the alternate vignette (36.4), but LVC-vitamin D was associated with a significantly lower score (31.2) (p < 0.05).

It is argued that anthropogenic alterations in the biosphere will most likely accelerate the rate of multispecies pandemics in the Anthropocene. Using a textual analysis approach of anthropological and historical sources on the example of coronaviruses and live animal markets in China, we trace how the virosphere of wild animals from tropical regions comes into contact with the virosphere of humans and farmed animals in highly industrialized landscapes. We suggest that adopting a multispecies perspective on viruses can allow them to be understood as living processes that interact with other species in a realm called the virosphere. The rate at which novel infectious diseases are transmitted by bacteria and viruses has increased in recent decades. We argue that this is caused by side effects of the Anthropocene, such as deforestation, the surge in population growth and density, and anthropogenic climate change, which give rise to an increased number of unusual encounters between humans, nonhuman companion species, and wild animals. In this way, the virospheres of host organisms, which were formerly partly isolated, are allowed to converge and freely exchange infectious diseases, leading to a more homogenized virosphere. As anthropogenic alterations are set to continue in the future, we suggest that multispecies pandemics will likely increase in the following decades.","output":"Multispecies entanglements in the virosphere: Rethinking the Anthropocene in light of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly replaced the Delta variant as a dominating SARS-CoV-2 variant because of natural selection, which favors the variant with higher infectivity and stronger vaccine breakthrough ability.

Media play a critical role during pandemics by affecting values, opinions, public knowledge about stigmatized groups. When media ignore and stereotypically represent a social group, the social value of the group decreases, and their problems are trivialized. METHOD: I analyzed data provided by Media Monitoring Center which is an independent media company in Turkey. Sample was selected to reveal news representation of Syrian refugees between March 11, 2020 (the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey) and August 20, 2020 (the time of this research). Mostly watched television evening (prime) news, the most widely circulated newspapers, and the most visited online news platforms were analyzed. By using content analysis method, the news stories about Syrian refugees were examined. RESULTS: It has been revealed that Turkish news media overwhelmingly acclaimed for Turkey's polices on Syrian refugees and the criticized the European Union policies towards refugees in the news stories. Even though almost 4 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey, with the largest refugee population in the world, Turkish news media ignored the plight of Syrian refugees. CONCLUSION: Results of the study demonstrate that Syrian refugees were symbolically annihilated by Turkish news media during the COVID-19 pandemic. The concealment of information and symbolic annihilation of disadvantaged groups could potentially cause health disparities and irreparable harm to public health.

RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four medals were impacted by ADRVs but only 26% of these ADRVs were identified at the time of the OG. Most ADRVs impacting medal results (74%) were identified retrospectively, either from events prior to the OG (17%) or via IOC re-tests of samples from 2004, 2008 and 2012 (57%). ADRVs impacting medal results from these re-tests took a mean of 6.8  2.0 years to be announced relative to the end of the OG in which the medal was originally won.

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that portable air cleaning devices can reduce concentrations of asthma triggers in indoor air; however, their benefits for breathing problems have not always been reproducible. The potential exposure benefits of whole house high efficiency in-duct air cleaners for sensitive subpopulations have yet to be evaluated. METHODS: We used an indoor air quality modeling system (CONTAM) developed by NIST to examine peak and time-integrated concentrations of common asthma triggers present in indoor air over a year as a function of natural ventilation, portable air cleaners, and forced air ventilation equipped with conventional and high efficiency filtration systems. Emission rates for asthma triggers were based on experimental studies published in the scientific literature. RESULTS: Forced air systems with high efficiency filtration were found to provide the best control of asthma triggers: 30C55% lower cat allergen levels, 90C99% lower risk of respiratory infection through the inhalation route of exposure, 90C98% lower environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) levels, and 50C75% lower fungal spore levels than the other ventilation/filtration systems considered.

The analysis showed that trust and vulnerability variables in the perception factor, health state, and perceived knowledge in the resource factor had a significant impact on the perceived risk of MERS.","output":"Exploring the Determinants of Perceived Risk of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the previous stage, there were too many patients with Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan Ordinary people, patients, even doctors, had a great sense of desperate On the one hand, almost all doctors participated in the treatment of patients of COVID-19 On the other hand, the government restricted residents to go out, and the sick people were also afraid of being infected with COVID-19 when seeking medical treatment Whether cancer patients seek medical treatment or not has become a contradiction for a long time Our Viewpoint paper is to provide a positive signal to doctors and patients that patients with in the middle or advanced stage of cancer can receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy normally under protective measures","output":"Should patients stop their radiotherapy or chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of self-instructional-video (SIV) and classroom training method (CTM) in learning Focus-Assessment with Sonography-in-Trauma (FAST) among house officers (HO). Method: A randomized controlled study involving house officers working in the university hospital in Malaysia was conducted where participants were randomized into SIV group (intervention) and CTM group (control). Each group had to undergo a 4 h hands-on training. The intervention group has undergone self-training using the video material without any facilitation while the control group received lecture and hands-on training with facilitators. Participants' performance was assessed using a validated Objective Structured Clinical Examination checklist for landmark identification and interpretation of images generated. Learning preference and confidence level were also assessed. Result: A total of 33 HO were enrolled in this study. Marks obtained in image acquisition by the intervention and control were 25.3 (SD = 5.3) and 25.6 (SD = 2.3) p > 0.05, respectively. While in image interpretation, the mean score for the intervention and control group was 10.3 (SD 1.7) and 9.8 (SD = 1.7) p > 0.05, respectively. Overall performance assessment, showed the intervention group obtained 35.6 (SD = 5.9) compared to control 35.3 (SD = 3.4), p > 0.05. Based on pre-specified determinant these scores difference falls within the 10% of non-inferiority margin. The absolute difference between both groups was 0.3 (CI = ?3.75 to 3.21, p = 0.871), which proves non-inferiority but not superiority. In terms of learning preference and confidence to perform FAST, most of the participants preferred the control group approach. Conclusion: The SIV method is as effective as the CTM for learning FAST among the house officers and served as an alternative to classroom teaching. However, this technique needs improvement in promoting their confidence and preference. Perhaps incorporating a feedback session after going through the SIV would improve the confidence.","output":"The Effectiveness of Self-Instructional Video vs. Classroom Teaching Method on Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma Among House Officers in University Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic brought with itself significant mental health challenges owing not only to the morbidity and mortality from the infection but also to mitigation strategies of social distancing and self-isolation. Indeed, in the absence of adequate pharmaceutical aids, quarantine and social distancing measures are taken to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, living in the world of social media, the average usage of social media could be expected to show a sharp rise as measures of social distancing and quarantine are adopted to contain the pandemic. In this context, social media could be thought of as an additional preventative resource aiding the containment of the pandemic by being a key network for communication during a crisis.Because social media usage cannot be brought down to null considering the fact that it does have some positive aspects to it in terms of disposition of useful information, we could alternatively modify the reporting to be more responsible.In conclusion, we could hypothesize that social media might surge responses for some adverse mental health conditions, increasing fear, anxiety, and panic responses, even spreading suicidal ideation and therefore impacting incidence of suicide in some way. Moreover, social media should be carefully handled, particularly during the pandemic, as social media engagement spiked.

All confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst the returnees were displayed by the spatial distribution pattern of the extent of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Characteristics that differed significantly amongst these returnees compared to the original infected cohorts in Gansu were mean age, occupation and sex. Differences observed between infected patients and non-patients amongst returnees were age, sex, race, occupation, the use of facemasks, and residential situation in Iran. The clinical features that were significantly related to infection were chill, shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea. Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated that infected returnees had resided within Iranian provinces that had experienced high levels of COVID-19. The spatial distribution of the original homes of these returnees before departure for Iran demonstrated that returnees will largely return to northwest China, to regions that have only experienced low levels of infection within China.

One of the approaches often employed towards preventing the entry and proliferation of viruses is computer-aided inhibition studies to identify potent compounds that can inhibit activity of viral targets in the host through binding at the active site. In this study, we developed a pharmacophore model of reportedly potent drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2). The model was used to screen the ZINC database for commercially available compounds having similar features with the experimentally tested drugs. The top 3000 compounds retrieved were docked into the active sites of a homology-modelled TMPRSS2. Docking scores of the top binders were validated and the top-ranked compounds were subjected to ADME, Lipinski's and medicinal Chemistry property predictions for druglikeness analyses. Two lead compounds, ZINC64606047 and ZINC05296775, were identified having binding affinities higher than those of the reference inhibitors, favorable interactions with TMPRSS2 active site residues and good ADME and medicinal chemistry properties. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess the stability and dynamics of the interactions of these compounds with TMPRSS2.

METHODS Sixty-nine hepatic metastatic lesions in 54 patients were treated by percutaneous RFA. Efficacy was evaluated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month after ablation, then at 3-month intervals for the first year and biannually thereafter. RESULTS The results of the log-rank test showed that tumor size of <3 cm (p = 0.024) and the absence of tumor contiguous with large vessels (p = 0.002) significantly correlated with local control for hepatic metastases.

We prospectively followed patients for 30 and 90 days to identify predictors for readmission. RESULTS: The readmission rate within 30 days was 38%, and 56% within 90 days. Previous exacerbations, higher COPD Assessment Test score at discharge, frailty, reduced PIFR and increased length of stay were significantly associated with 30-day readmission.

We classified patients into three skeletal Classes (Class I, II, and III) based on the ANB angle. Olfactory disorder history was collected from the guardians. Maxillofacial measurements, nasal airflow assessments, and olfactory tests were performed using cephalometric analysis, rhinomanometry, and T&T olfactometer, respectively.

METHODS We prospectively evaluated video EEG, plethysmography, capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), and ECG for 49 patients (49 seizures) enrolled in a multicenter study of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Postictal and interictal venous blood samples were collected after a clinical seizure for measurement of serum 5-HT levels. Seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy 2017 seizure classification. We analyzed seizures with and without ICA (n = 49) and generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) with and without PCCA (n = 27). RESULTS Postictal serum 5-HT levels were increased over interictal levels for seizures without ICA (p = 0.01), compared to seizures with ICA (p = 0.21). In patients with GCS without PCCA, serum 5-HT levels were increased postictally compared to interictal levels (p < 0.001), but not in patients with seizures with PCCA (p = 0.22). Postictal minus interictal 5-HT levels also differed between the 2 groups with and without PCCA (p = 0.03).

We conducted semi-structured individual interviews with HCPs, including nurses, pharmacists and physicians who work directly with patients with COPD. Interviews were also conducted with a diverse sample of patients with COPD. Interview topics included demographics, mHealth usage, the potential use of medical devices and recommendations for features that would enhance an mHealth intervention for COPD management. RESULTS A total of 40 people, including nurses, physicians and pharmacists, participated. The main recommendations for the proposed mHealth intervention were categorised into two categories: patient interface and HCP interface. The prevalent features suggested for the patient interface include educating patients, collecting baseline data, collecting subjective data, collecting objective data via compatible medical devices, providing a digital action plan, allowing patients to track their progress, enabling family members to access the mHealth intervention, tailoring the features based on the patient's unique needs, reminding patients about critical management tasks and rewarding patients for their positive behaviours. The most common features of the HCP interface include allowing HCPs to track their patients' progress, allowing HCPs to communicate with their patients, educating HCPs and rewarding HCPs. CONCLUSION This study identifies important potential features so that the most effective, efficient and feasible mHealth intervention can be developed to improve the management of COPD.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","output":"Features of a mobile health intervention to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes the impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Belt and Road Initiative which is part of the Peaceful Rise policy implemented by the Chinese State by conducting literature studies using the perspective of neoliberalism as the basis for analysis.

As soon as the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified and its genome sequence determined, a laboratory diagnosis based on nucleic acid amplification technologies was quickly established and has played essential roles in the confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. Serological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is becoming available for complementary diagnosis, identification of convalescent plasma, and epidemiologic studies. Additional laboratory biochemical tests, including monitoring the change in blood cells, blood gas, coagulation, liver function, cardiac markers, and inflammatory responses such as cytokine levels in plasma, are also critical in combating COVID-19. Nevertheless, with overwhelming numbers of patients and potentially large numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical laboratories encounter enormous challenges in diagnostic approaches that can rapidly and accurately identify infected persons. Strategies that can effectively detect disease progression in order to stratify patients for appropriate care, and that can thereby prevent exacerbation of the disease, are urgently needed.

METHODS: We developed a single-channel (DCNN[2D SCI]), a multi-channel (DCNN[2D MCI]), and a 3-dimensional (DCNN[2D+t]) deep convolution neural network, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based on 17,280 still-frame images and 540 videos from 2-dimensional echocardiograms in 10 years (1 January 2008 to 1 January 2018) retrospective cohort in University of Iowa (UI) and eight other medical centers. Echocardiograms from 450 UI patients were randomly divided into training and testing sets for internal training, testing, and model construction. Echocardiograms of 90 patients from the other medical centers were used for external validation to evaluate the model generalizability. A total of 49 board-certified human readers performed human-side classification on the same echocardiography dataset to compare the diagnostic performance and help data visualization. FINDINGS: The DCNN (2D SCI), DCNN (2D MCI), DCNN(2D+t), and RNN models established based on UI dataset for TTS versus STEMI prediction showed mean diagnostic accuracy 73%, 75%, 80%, and 75% respectively, and mean diagnostic accuracy of 74%, 74%, 77%, and 73%, respectively, on the external validation. DCNN(2D+t) (area under the curve [AUC] 0787 vs. 0699, P = 0015) and RNN models (AUC 0774 vs. 0699, P = 0033) outperformed human readers in differentiating TTS and STEMI by reducing human erroneous judgement calls on TTS.

The binding free energy di?erence, key residues at the interface, important atomic interactions and contact surface areas have been compared with the molecular complex of SARS-CoV and hACE2. Relatively larger contact surface area, more non-bonded interactions as well as greater binding free energy provide the evidence for favorable binding of SARS-CoV-2 with hACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV.","output":"Binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with human ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Australia received its first case of coronavirus on 25 January 2020. Since then the demands of COVID-19 has presented unparalleled levels of strain on the public healthcare systems in the country. In this time of crisis, pharmacists and community pharmacy staff have modified work strategies according to the rapidly changing environment. With a delayed dissemination of resources and guidelines, pharmacist and pharmacies are practicing innovative infection control methods across Australia to protect their staff, patients and the community. This article seeks to explore the current activities undertaken by pharmacists in various community pharmacy settings across Australia in relation to the safety of the workplace environments for staff and patients. Information collected can help inform future decisions in pandemic preparation for pharmacies in response to similar health crisis now and in the future. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey study was conducted in Australia during the COVID-19 outbreak from 1st to 30th April 2020. The questionnaire addressed community pharmacists awareness and response to infection and sanitation control. Results: A total of 137 pharmacists took part in the survey, with almost half (45.26%) belonging to the age group of 25 to 34 years. Community pharmacy formed the bulk (89.05%) of the respondents primary place of practice. There was a good uptake of safety measures by pharmacists and their pharmacies to protect staff and patients. However the task of reassigning high health risk staff was not heavily practiced (34.31%). Regular cleaning took place in the pharmacy, but the use of gloves while cleaning was not practiced in 48.18% of respondents. In addition, only 46.72% of respondents reported observing script baskets being cleaned and disinfected. About one-third (37.96%) of pharmacists were aware of the two-step cleaning and disinfecting process, but only 18.98% of pharmacists reported observing or performing this sanitation procedure. More than half of surveyed pharmacists reported having difficulty keeping up with infection control changes and pharmacy practice guidelines during the pandemic. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the majority of pharmacists are not fully aware of the infection control measures needed in a community pharmacy setting. The influx of coronavirus updates has made it difficult for pharmacists to implement accurate procedures on some aspects of workplace hygiene, which may have led to some gaps in infection control measures. Pharmacists must aim to uphold their public health ambassador role and aim to keep up-to-date with professional guidance to provide the necessary infection control measures to ensure staff, patient and public health safety.","output":"Community Pharmacy Response to Infection Control during COVID-19.

Two interconnected stages of disease are generally recognised; an initial viral stage and a subsequent immune response phase with the clinical characteristics of hyperinflammation associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, many immune modulators and immunosuppressive drugs, which are widely used in rheumatological practice, have been proposed as treatments for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is currently known about the efficacy and safety of antirheumatic therapies for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce COVID-19 related mortality, interleukin-6 inhibitors to reduce risk of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support, and baricitinib to reduce time to recovery in hospitalised patients requiring oxygen support. Further studies are needed to identify whether there is any role for glucocorticoids in patients with less severe COVID-19. Although evidence on the use of other antirheumatic drugs has suggested some benefits, results from adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed. The heterogeneity in dosing and the absence of uniform inclusion criteria and defined stage of disease studied in many clinical trials have affected the conclusions and comparability of trial results. However, after the success of dexamethasone in proving the anti-inflammatory hypothesis, the next 12 months will undoubtedly bring further clarity about the clinical utility and optimal dose and timing of other anti-rheumatic drugs in the management of COVID-19.","output":"The role of antirheumatics in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Achieving mucosal healing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is related to a higher incidence of sustained clinical remission and it translates to lower rates of hospitalisation and surgery.

The analysis on the use of faecal calprotectin in monitoring mucosal healing in colonic Crohn's disease is based on 16 publications (17 studies). The data set for diagnostic values of faecal calprotectin in ulcerative colitis is composed of 35 original publications (total 49 studies). The DOR for the use of faecal calprotectin in Crohn's disease is estimated to be 11.20 and the area under the sROCis 0.829. In cases of ulcerative colitis, the DOR is 14.48, while the AUC sROC is 0.858. Heterogeneity of the studies was moderatetosubstantial. Collected data show overall good sensitivity and specificity of the faecal calprotectin test, as well as a good DOR.

But is diabetes per se a risk factor that increases the probability of getting the virus? This paper will discuss this point. There are not many research data on antidiabetic drugs in this context. The potential influence of glucose-lowering agents on the severity of COVID-19 has not been described yet. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a cell surface protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and it is also a soluble molecule found in serum/plasma fluids. DPP-4 is involved in infection of cells by some viruses. This paper reviews data about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and others diabetes drugs on COVID-19 patients. As such, no available evidence has yet suggested that glucose-lowering drugs - including those targeting DPP4-related pathways - produce any significant harm or benefit in the context of human infections. However, insulin must remain the first-choice agent in the management of critically ill-hospitalized patients, while it is recommended to suspend other agents in unstable patients.

However, to date no study has evaluated whether the changes in the distribution of pulmonary gas and blood volume are associated with the severity of gas-exchange impairment and the type of respiratory support (non-invasive versus invasive) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Northern Italy during the first pandemic wave. Pulmonary gas and blood distribution was assessed using a technique for quantitative analysis of dual-energy computed tomography. Lung aeration loss (reflected by percentage of normally aerated lung tissue) and the extent of gas:blood volume mismatch (percentage of non-aerated, perfused lung tissue-shunt; aerated, non-perfused dead space; and non-aerated/non-perfused regions) were evaluated in critically ill COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity as reflected by the need for non-invasive or invasive respiratory support. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients admitted to the intensive care unit between February 29th and May 30th, 2020 were included. Patients requiring invasive versus non-invasive mechanical ventilation had both a lower percentage of normally aerated lung tissue (median [interquartile range] 33% [24-49%] vs. 63% [44-68%], p < 0.001); and a larger extent of gas:blood volume mismatch (43% [30-49%] vs. 25% [14-28%], p = 0.001), due to higher shunt (23% [15-32%] vs. 5% [2-16%], p = 0.001) and non-aerated/non perfused regions (5% [3-10%] vs. 1% [0-2%], p = 0.001). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio correlated positively with normally aerated tissue (&#961; = 0.730, p < 0.001) and negatively with the extent of gas-blood volume mismatch (&#961; = - 0.633, p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of reaction characteristics, allergic comorbidities, and demographics, in predicting FA in individuals experiencing food-related adverse reactions. METHODS: Adult and school-age participants in the standardised EuroPrevall population surveys, with self-reported FA, were included. Penalised multivariable regression was used to assess the association of patient history determinants with 'probable' FA, defined as a food-specific case history supported by relevant IgE sensitisation. RESULTS: In adults (N=844), reproducibility of reaction (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.29-1.41]), oral allergy symptoms (OAS) (4.46 [4.19-4.75]), allergic rhinitis (AR) comorbidity (2.82 [2.68-2.95]), asthma comorbidity (1.38 [1.30-1.46]), and male sex (1.50 [1.41-1.59]), were positively associated with probable FA. Gastrointestinal symptoms (0.88 [0.85-0.91]) made probable FA less likely. The AUC of a model combining all selected predictors was 0.85 after cross-validation. In children (N=670), OAS (2.26 [2.09-2.44]) and AR comorbidity (1.47 [CI 1.39-1.55]) contributed most to prediction of probable FA, with a combined cross-validation-based AUC of 0.73. When focusing on plant foods, the dominant source of FA in adults, the paediatric model also included gastrointestinal symptoms (inverse association), and the AUC increased to 0.81.

Current evidence suggests that vertical transmission from mother to baby, antenatally or intrapartum, does occur, but is uncommon. According to the published reports of infants born to COVID-19-affected mothers, as well as the anecdotal experience of current practices worldwide, it appears that investigations regarding the potential of SARS-COV-2 vertical transmission in pregnancy have so far been based, to a large extent, on PCR testing of neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Given that the transplacental route of intrauterine transmission for SARS-COV-2 is less likely to immediately involve the upper respiratory tract of the newborn, contrary to what happens after birth, it would be advisable to include appropriate biological samples, such as cord blood, placenta, amniotic fluid and neonatal blood, along with the pharyngeal samples, in order to contribute significantly to such investigations. It is important to point out that negative PCR tests of neonatal pharyngeal samples do not exclude the possibility of intrauterine viral transmission, while positive pharyngeal swabs are more likely to reflect intrapartum or postpartum contaminants, rather than antenatal intrauterine transmission, in the absence of other criteria.

OBJECTIVES: Due to the occurrence of incorrect ETT positioning in emergency departments, the present study aimed to compare the diagnostic sensitivity of ultrasound using suprasternal and subxiphoid methods for confirming the correct placement of ETT compared to capnography. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted by examining patients requiring intubation. Ultrasound was performed by two independent emergency medical assistants using two suprasternal and subxiphoid methods to confirm correct ETT placement; the results were then interpreted. To observe the tube passage through the vocal cords, capnography and lung auscultation were applied as the gold standards, and the results of two ultrasound methods were compared. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, who were intubated in the emergency department, participated in this study. The positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity of supernatural ultrasound were 96.72%, 80%, 98.33%, and 66.67%, respectively. Also, positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity of subxiphoid ultrasound were 97.95%, 29.41%, 80%, and 83.33%, respectively.

We therefore examined prescription drug and health-care use after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using the Danish prescription, patient, and health insurance registries. All individuals with a positive or negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark between Feb 27 and May 31, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest were delayed acute complications, chronic disease, hospital visits due to persisting symptoms, and prescription drug use. We used data from non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2-positive and matched SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals from 2 weeks to 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 test to obtain propensity score-weighted risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for initiation of 14 drug groups and 27 hospital diagnoses indicative of potential post-acute effects. We also calculated prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall health-care use. This study is registered in the EU Electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EUPAS37658). FINDINGS: 10 498 eligible individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark from Feb 27 to May 31, 2020, of whom 8983 (856%) were alive and not admitted to hospital 2 weeks after their positive test. The matched SARS-CoV-2-negative reference population not admitted to hospital consisted of 80 894 individuals. Compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were not at an increased risk of initiating new drugs (RD <01%) except bronchodilating agents, specifically short-acting 2-agonists (117 [17%] of 6935 positive individuals vs 743 [13%] of 57 206 negative individuals; RD +04% [95% CI 01C07]; RR 132 [109C160]) and triptans (33 [04%] of 8292 vs 198 [03%] of 72 828; RD +01% [00C03]; RR 155 [107C225]). There was an increased risk of receiving hospital diagnoses of dyspnoea (103 [12%] of 8676 vs 499 [07%] of 76 728; RD +06% [04C08]; RR 200 [162C248]) and venous thromboembolism (20 [02%] of 8785 vs 110 [01%] of 78 872; RD +01% [00C02]; RR 177 [109C286]) for SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with negative individuals, but no increased risk of other diagnoses. Prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall general practitioner visits (118 [95% CI 115C122]) and outpatient hospital visits (110 [105C116]), but not hospital admission, showed increases among SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. INTERPRETATION: The absolute risk of severe post-acute complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission is low. However, increases in visits to general practitioners and outpatient hospital visits could indicate COVID-19 sequelae.

Therefore, the report and findings associated with its evolution can be of great contribution in the management of this unknown disease. Case Presentation: Here we present a series of four patients with severe pneumomediastinum requiring intensive care unit. These patients developed pneumomediastinum before or during orotracheal intubation (OTI) or without OTI. The four patients were three men and one woman with a mean age of 60.5 years (48-74 y). No patients had a known history of lung disease or traumatic events, except for one patient who had a history of smoking but who was without parenchymal disease. All intubations were performed without complications. No cases of pneumomediastinum occurred after tracheostomy, and none of the patients had tomographic or bronchoscopic evidence of tracheal injury. Although the pneumomediastinum observed in our cases was apparently not related to a violation of the aerodigestive track, this complication was associated with a worse prognosis. Conclusion: Pneumomediastinum is a rare complication of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the most likely etiopathogenesis is severe pulmonary involvement, which may or may not be associated with invasive ventilatory support.

Previous studies have explored several risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but there is still a lack of association with ABO blood type. This study aimed to find out the relationship between the ABO blood group and COVID-19 outcomes in Bangladesh. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary-level COVID-dedicated hospital in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, between April 2020 and November 2020. Records from 771 critically ill patients were extracted who were confirmed for COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and blood grouping records were available in the health records. RESULTS: The blood groups were 37.35%, 17.38%, 26.46%, and 18.81% for A, B, AB, and O type, respectively. Clinical symptoms were significantly more common in patients with blood type A (p < 0.05). Patients with blood type A had higher WBC counts and peak serum ferritin levels and both were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Patients with blood type A had a greater need for supplemental oxygen, and they were more likely to die in comparison to the patients with other blood types (p < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, our primary outcome death was significantly associated with blood type A (AOR: 3.49, 95% CI: 1.57C7.73) while adjusting for age, male gender, and non-communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: Based on this study results, it can be concluded that the COVID-19 patients with blood type A have a higher chance of death and other complications. The authors recommend blood grouping before treating the COVID-19 patients, and healthcare workers should prioritize treating the patients based on that result.","output":"ABO Blood Group and Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU): A Retrospective Study in a Tertiary-Level Hospital in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Displacement of impression copings and/or implant replicas during impression making and dimensional changes that occur during clinical and laboratory phases of making multiunit implant prostheses may affect the accuracy and fit of the prostheses. PURPOSE The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate and compare 3 different impression techniques for osseointegrated dental implant transfer procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three impression transfer approaches were evaluated and compared: closed-tray impression technique (CTT), impression with plastic snap-fit impression copings; open-tray impression technique (OTT), impression with independent square copings; and OTT joining the impression copings with a photo-polymerized resin (PPT). A reference acrylic resin model with 4 implants was fabricated. Polyvinyl siloxane with a stock tray was used to make 45 impressions (n=15 for each impression technique), and 45 die definitive stone casts. A computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) titanium framework was fabricated on the reference model. Three blinded operators evaluated the fit of the CAD-CAM titanium framework on each model to find clinically acceptable fit. The Kappa test was used for the agreement between the examiners (=.05). RESULTS Agreement was found among the 3 examiners on 44 of 45 specimens (Kappa value= 0.939; P<.001). In the CTT group, 14 casts were found to be acceptable. In the OTT group, nearly half of the specimens produced unacceptable fitting casts, whereas in the PPT group, 13 casts were found acceptable.

To avoid a selection bias, common in archival voting data, we exogenously manipulate shareholders power to affect the outcome. Our findings suggest that, when it comes to corporate decisions involving conflicts of interest, voting power nudges shareholders to oppose management and to choose the right alternative, that is, vote against a proposal which prima facie does not serve the companys best interest. This effect obtained even when the dissenting vote contravened the choices of all other voters. Furthermore, the drive to do the right thing was established as significant, above and beyond the size of the economic stake. We also demonstrate that strategic voting among institutional investors is contingent on voting power: when in a position to affect the outcome of a vote, institutional investors tend to eschew strategic considerations and display fewer consistent patterns in their voting, compared to situations in which their ability to make a difference is limited. In anticipation of a bad proposal to be put to vote at the general shareholder meeting, institutional investors prefer to negotiate terms with management beforehand, and vote against it only after such negotiations fail. Our results shed new light on the behind the scenes processes in shareholder voting and underscore the importance of institutional investor agency to corporate governance, accountability, and minority shareholder representation.

To examine this, the top 10 Instagram posts (in English) were collected every day for 10 days (April 21-30th, 2020) for each of the hashtags #hoax, #governmentlies, and #plandemic. The #hoax was selected first as it is commonly used in conspiracy theory posts, and #governmentlies because it was the most commonly cotagged with #hoax. For comparison, we selected #plandemic as the most popular cotagged hashtag that was clearly COVID-19-related. This resulted in 300 Instagram posts available for our analysis. We conducted a content analysis by coding the themes contained in the posts, both for the images and the text caption shared by the Instagram users (including hashtags). The broad theme of general mistrust was the most common, including the idea that the government and/or media has fabricated or hidden information pertaining to COVID-19. Conspiracy theories were the second-most frequent theme among posts. Overall, COVID-19 was frequently presented in association with authority-questioning beliefs.

We investigated COVID-19 30-day mortality and new-onset comorbidity compared to individuals with negative COVID-19 test results and individuals tested for influenza A/B. Methods and findings: This population-based cohort study utilized electronic health records covering roughly half (n = 2,647,229) of Denmark's population, with nationwide linkage of microbiology test results and death records. All individuals 18 years tested for COVID-19 and individuals tested for influenza A/B were followed from 11/2017 to 06/2020. Main outcome was 30-day mortality after a test for either COVID-19 or influenza. Secondary outcomes were major comorbidity diagnoses 30-days after the test for either COVID-19 or influenza A/B. In total, 224,639 individuals were tested for COVID-19. To enhance comparability, we stratified the population for in- and outpatient status at the time of testing. Among inpatients positive for COVID-19, 356 of 1,657 (21%) died within 30 days, which was a 3.0 to 3.1-fold increased 30-day mortality rate, when compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative inpatients (all p < 0.001). For outpatients, 128 of 6,263 (2%) COVID-19-positive patients died within 30 days, which was a 5.5 to 6.9-fold increased mortality rate compared to individuals tested negative for COVID-19 or individuals tested positive or negative for influenza, respectively (all p < 0.001). Compared to hospitalized patients with influenza A/B, new-onset ischemic stroke, diabetes and nephropathy occurred more frequently in inpatients with COVID-19 (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: In this population-based study comparing COVID-19 positive with COVID-19 negative individuals and individuals tested for influenza, COVID-19 was associated with increased rates of major systemic and vascular comorbidity and substantially higher mortality. Results should be interpreted with caution because of differences in test strategies for COVID-19 and influenza, use of aggregated data, the limited 30-day follow-up and the possibility for changing mortality rates as the pandemic unfolds.

These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and results in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies. Methods: We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions. Results: Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels. Conclusion: Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies.","output":"Social-distancing Fatigue: Evidence from Real-time Crowd-sourced Traffic Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ovomucoid (OVM), known as the major allergen in egg white, has gained increasing concerns in industrialized countries.

A number of other novel therapies (such as nebulized hypertonic saline, heliox, CPAP, montelukast, surfactant, and inhaled furosemide) have been evaluated in clinical trials, and although most of them did not show any beneficial results, some like hypertonic saline, surfactant, CPAP have shown promising results.","output":"Recent advances in management of bronchiolitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Personalizing assessments, predictions, and treatments of individuals is currently a defining trend in psychological research and applied fields, including personalized learning, personalized medicine, and personalized advertisement. For instance, the recent pandemic has reminded parents and educators of how challenging yet crucial it is to get the right learning task to the right student at the right time. Increasingly, psychologists and social scientists are realizing that the between-person methods that we have long relied upon to describe, predict, and treat individuals may fail to live up to these tasks (e.g., Molenaar, 2004). Consequently, there is a risk of a credibility loss, possibly similar to the one seen during the replicability crisis (Ioannides, 2005), because we have only started to understand how many of the conclusions that we tend to draw based on between-person methods are based on a misunderstanding of what these methods can tell us and what they cannot. An imminent methodological revolution will likely lead to a change of even well-established psychological theories (Barbot et al., 2020). Fortunately, methodological solutions for personalized descriptions and predictions, such as many within-person analyses, are available and undergo rapid development, although they are not yet embraced in all areas of psychology, and some come with their own limitations. This article first discusses the extent of the theory-method gap, consisting of theories about within-person patterns being studied with between-person methods in psychology, and the potential loss of trust that might follow from this theory-method gap.

Third, this article discusses how within-person methods may help improving the individual descriptions and predictions that are needed in many applied fields that aim for tailored individual solutions, including personalized learning and personalized medicine.","output":"Averting the Next Credibility Crisis in Psychological Science: Within-Person Methods for Personalized Diagnostics and Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aims to evaluate of olfactory and gustatory functions of COVID-19 patients and possible risk factors for olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional study included adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Gazi University Hospital between April 2020 and June 2020. Volunteered patients participated in a survey in which olfactory and gustatory functions and various clinical information were questioned. Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 was also administrated to all patients. RESULTS: A hundred and seventy-one patients participated in this study. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions rates were 10.5% (n: 18) and 10.5% (n: 18), respectively. Patients without any symptom other than smell and taste dysfunctions were clustered as group 1 and patients who are clinically symptomatic were clustered as group 2. Olfactory dysfunction occurred in 8% of group 1 and 17.4% of group 2 (p = 0.072). Gustatory dysfunction rate of smokers was 19.7% and significantly higher than gustatory dysfunction rate of nonsmokers (5.5%) (p = 0.007). Twenty-seven-point-eight percent of the patients with olfactory dysfunction (n = 5) were male and 72.2% (n: 13) were female. Sex did not show significant effect on rate of olfactory dysfunction. Twenty-five patients participated in psychophysical olfactory function test. No participant reported olfactory dysfunction at the time of test. Of the participants, 64% (n: 16) were normosmic and 36% (n: 9) were hyposmic according to Sniffin Stick test. CONCLUSION: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are more common in patients who are clinically symptomatic than those diagnosed during contact tracing. Objective tests may show that frequency of olfactory dysfunction is greater than frequency of self-reported olfactory dysfunction.","output":"Assessment of olfactory and gustatory functions in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic burden and the number of lives lost due to diagnostic errors are higher than ever due to the onset of pandemics and new viruses, Specially in medium and low-economic status nations (including India) are affected heavily in terms of capital and human resources. Due to limited expertise in diagnostic technologies in remote parts of India and many low-economic nations of Africa, autonomous diagnostics can save millions of lives and lower the costs. To accomplish this goal we propose a method that uses modern developments in Deep Learning in semantic segmentation and classification to predict multiple diseases from multiple medical images. To conduct the study we test the model with Dermoscopy images and CT-Scans to predict 8 classes relating to Melanoma cancer, Covid-19 virus and different types of Carcinoma. The setup is tested on largest publicly available ISIC Dermoscopy dataset, 1061 CT-scan images combined for the classification and Segmentation(only for Melanoma). Classification model(M-CAD) is progressively tested by increasing the number of classes and data that it trains on. This pilot study is conducted on a small subset of the complete data, segmentation of Melanoma images obtained an accuracy of 96.6% compared to human expert agreement which is 90.9%. we were able to produce average accuracy of 81.5% and AUC of 0.94 for 6 classes using CT-Scans whereas accuracy and AUC for all the 8 classes is 80.2% and 0.97 respectively.

The viral main protease (M(pro)) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and is therefore an important drug target. Understanding the catalytic mechanism of M(pro), a cysteine protease with a catalytic site comprising the noncanonical Cys145CHis41 dyad, can help in guiding drug design. Here, a 2.0 ? resolution room-temperature X-ray crystal structure is reported of a Michaelis-like complex of M(pro) harboring a single inactivating mutation C145A bound to the octapeptide Ac-SAVLQSGF-CONH(2) corresponding to the nsp4/nsp5 autocleavage site. The peptide substrate is unambiguously defined in subsites S5 to S3 by strong electron density. Superposition of the Michaelis-like complex with the neutron structure of substrate-free M(pro) demonstrates that the catalytic site is inherently pre-organized for catalysis prior to substrate binding. Induced fit to the substrate is driven by P1 Gln binding in the predetermined subsite S1 and rearrangement of subsite S2 to accommodate P2 Leu. The Michaelis-like complex structure is ideal for in silico modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) catalytic mechanism.","output":"Michaelis-like complex of SARS-CoV-2 main protease visualized by room-temperature X-ray crystallography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents and discusses, in the new context of COVID-19, findings from a tabletop exercise on response and resilience in the ongoing opioid crisis in Pennsylvania The exercise was organized by [identifying information removed] and held at the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA), in further collaboration with the Governors Office of Homeland Security, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and with the participation of several additional agencies and institutions It addressed first-responder and whole-community response and resilience to the ongoing opioid crisis More than 50 experts participated in the one-day program that involved state and local agencies, first-responder organizations, as well as academia in a discussion about effectuating comprehensive response to overdose incidents Participant experts represented a wide array of backgrounds, including state and local law enforcement agencies;emergency medical technicians;public health and health care professionals;and scholars from the fields of law, security studies, public policy, and public health, among other relevant areas Participants addressed specific challenges, including resource sharing among responders;capacity-building for long-term recovery;effective integration of non-traditional partners, such as spontaneous volunteers and donors;and public education and outreach to improve prevention The exercise aimed to strengthen the whole-community approach to emergency response [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Homeland Security & Emergency Management is the property of De Gruyter and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Opioid Crisis Response and Resilience: Results and Perspectives from a Multi-Agency Tabletop Exercise at the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia appears to be the most common manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but some extrapulmonary involvement, such as gastrointestinal, cardiac and renal, has been reported.

Dairy cows are often culled at quite young ages due to an inability to cope adequately with metabolic and infectious diseases, resulting in reduced milk production and infertility. Improved longevity is therefore a desirable trait which would benefit both farmers and their cows. This study analysed the transcriptome derived from RNA-seq data of leukocytes obtained from Holstein cows in early lactation with respect to lactation number. RESULTS: Samples were divided into three lactation groups for analysis: i) primiparous (PP, n = 53), ii) multiparous in lactations 2C3 (MP 2C3, n = 121), and iii) MP in lactations 4C7 (MP > 3, n = 55). Leukocyte expression was compared between PP vs MP > 3 cows with MP 2C3 as background using DESeq2 followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Seven modules were significantly correlated (r  0.25) to the trait lactation number. Genes from the modules which were more highly expressed in either the PP or MP > 3 cows were pooled, and the gene lists subjected to David functional annotation cluster analysis. The top three clusters from modules more highly expressed in the PP cows all involved regulation of gene transcription, particularly zinc fingers. Another cluster included genes encoding enzymes in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway. Top clusters up-regulated in MP > 3 cows included the terms Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, C-type lectin, and Immunity. Differentially expressed candidate genes for ageing previously identified in the human blood transcriptome up-regulated in PP cows were mainly associated with T-cell function (CCR7, CD27, IL7R, CAMK4, CD28), mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS27, MRPS9, MRPS31), and DNA replication and repair (WRN). Those up-regulated in MP > 3 cows encoded immune defence proteins (LYZ, CTSZ, SREBF1, GRN, ANXA5, ADARB1). CONCLUSIONS: Genes and pathways associated with lactation number in cows were identified for the first time to date, and we found that many were comparable to those known to be associated with ageing in humans and model organisms. We also detected changes in energy utilization and immune responses in leukocytes from older cows.

At the same time, the impact of the pandemic crisis on the evolution of civil society may differ significantly in the national (tactical) and global (strategic) dimensions. If at the national level there is a likely expansion of the space for public activism (medical volunteering, social assistance, etc.), then globally it is threatened by the de-intensification of international non-governmental cooperation and attempts to revise civil rights and freedoms. Today it is no longer possible to name a single area of public life that has not been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Directly or indirectly, the consequences of the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus are experienced by everyone - government authorities, large and small businesses, citizens of the vast majority of countries. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the future of each of the social actors is largely determined today, depending on the adequacy of the response to the pandemic crisis, the ability to absorb its most painful manifestations, and, possibly, find new opportunities for development in this difficult situation.

We collected SARS-COV-2 sequence data from the end of 2019 to April 2022 to analyze for their evolutionary features during the pandemic. We found that most of the SARS-COV-2 genes are undergoing negative purifying selection, while the spike protein gene (S-gene) is undergoing rapid positive selection. From the original strain to the alpha, delta and omicron variant types, the Ka/Ks of the S-gene increases, while the Ka/Ks within one variant type decreases over time. During the evolution, the codon usage did not evolve towards optimal translation and protein expression. In contrast, only S-gene mutations showed a remarkable trend on accumulating more positive charges. This facilitates the infection via binding human ACE2 for cell entry and binding furin for cleavage. Such a functional evolution emphasizes the survival strategy of SARS-COV-2, and indicated new druggable target to contain the viral infection. The nearly fully positively-charged interaction surfaces indicated that the infectivity of SARS-COV-2 virus may approach a limit.","output":"Functional evolution of SARS-COV-2 Spike protein: adaptation on translation and infection via surface charge of spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population has caused a huge pandemic that is still unfolding in many countries around the world.

Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly.

With the rise of psychophysical and neuroimaging re- search into olfaction, psychometric tools (e.g. questionnaires and scales) are the basis for the quantitative exploration of inter-in- dividual variability regarding olfactory related responses. The current systematic review is to summarize existing olfaction related questionnaires and/or scales. METHODS Peer-reviewed literature on scales and questionnaires related to perception of odors were searched from online databa- ses (PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO). Twenty-one articles that meet the following criteria were included in the review: \\"hu- man species\\", \\"no physical odor stimuli\\" and \\"describing the original development of the tool\\", and \\"with specific focus on olfaction or odor related responses or behaviors\\". The psychometric properties, advantages and possible disadvantages were discussed. RESULTS Existing psychometric measures focus on various aspects of olfactory related responses and behaviors, including af- fective experiences of odor perception, awareness and attitude towards olfaction, olfactory function and the quality of life change due to olfactory dysfunction, and the ability to create vivid mental odor images. While most of them have been tested to have good reliability and validity, some were relatively time-consuming due to the number of questionnaire items. Besides, although many measures have been used in clinical populations, few have provided information on the predictive validity regarding effecti- veness of clinical intervention on changes of certain responses or behaviors. SUMMARY The current review provides an overview of olfactory related questionnaires and scales, highlighting the emotional and affective impact of olfaction and the impact on quality of life due to olfactory dysfunction. With growing interest in olfaction as an important sense, the development and use of psychometrically sound measurements in conjunction with objective assess- ments will advance our understanding of human olfaction and olfactory dysfunction. The review provides a guide for researchers and clinicians alike to select olfactory scales suitable for olfactory research with different experimental purposes and specific samples.","output":"A systematic review of olfactory related questionnaires and scales."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over the last decades various approaches to digitalization of psychotherapy (PT) have been developed. The concept of blended PT, the combination of face to face and online interventions is one such example. While research interest on blended PT has greatly increased in the past years, the implementation of blended PT has lagged behind in German speaking countries. Also, due to the global pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), blended PT and other online approaches seem to be more relevant than ever before. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to give an overview on the various forms of blended PT. Furthermore, the efficacy, the perspectives of patients and therapists as well as the topic of implementation are discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Narrative review of the literature on the topic of blended PT. Important considerations and findings are classified and described based on a comprehensive search. RESULTS: Blended psychotherapy is a concept in need of definition. By taking inspiration from blended learning concepts, we propose that a definition of blended psychotherapy should consider different levels of blends and may also consider the transforming effect on face to face psychotherapy. In transforming blends face to face PT is fundamentally changed. For some forms of blended PT the effectiveness has already been confirmed but for others there is an urgent need for research. Compared to face to face PT and purely online therapy, blended psychotherapy could provide several advantages. CONCLUSION: The interest in blended PT is increasing among patients and therapists. To be able to successfully provide evidence-based blended PT, close cooperation between science, institutions, therapists and relevant stakeholders is needed.","output":"Die Mischung machts eben?

Single crystal structure analyses revealed that the aniline derivatives are isostructural to the copper atom in a square planar coordination, while the benzhydrylamine complex forms a dimer (5f), with a square pyramidal coordination geometry for the metal. Time-kill kinetics and reduced microbial recovery studies revealed excellent bactericidal action against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Particularly, the novel compound 5f significantly reduced microbial recovery compared to ethanol-based sanitisers. In fact, addition of 5f to 70% ethanol remarkably synergized the killing with >6-log reduction in microbial burden. Overall, our novel compounds would increase the disinfection efficacy in hospitals and industries, thereby improving the efficiency and minimizing the risk of infections.","output":"Synthesis, characterization and utility of a series of novel copper(II) complexes as excellent surface disinfectants against nosocomial infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dozens of human cases infected with H7N9 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) have been confirmed in China since March, 2013.

Therefore, the H7N9 outbreak has been assumed severe, and it is likely to become very or extremely severe in the future, highlighting the emergent need of forceful scientific measures to eliminate any infected animal flocks. We also described two possible mild scenarios of the future evolution of the outbreak.","output":"Epidemiological and risk analysis of the H7N9 subtype influenza outbreak in China at its early stage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies project thousands of additional AIDS-related deaths because of COVID-19Crelated disruptions in HIV care. However, the extent to which disruptions in care have materialized since the start of the pandemic is not well understood. METHODS: We use electronic health records to investigate how the pandemic has affected clinic visits, patients' antiretroviral therapy (ART) supply, and viral suppression for a cohort of 14,632 HIV clients from a large HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda. We complement this with an analysis of electronically measured longitudinal ART adherence data from a subcohort of 324 clients. RESULTS: Clinic visits decreased by more than 50% after a national lockdown started. The risk of patients running out of ART on a given day increased from 5% before the lockdown to 25% 3 months later (Relative Risk Ratio of 5.11, 95% confidence interval: 4.99 to 5.24) and remained higher than prelockdown 6 months later at 13% (Relative Risk Ratio of 2.60; 95% confidence interval: 2.52 to 2.70). There was no statistically significant change in electronically measured adherence or viral suppression. CONCLUSION: We document substantial gaps in HIV care after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda. This suggests that measures to improve access should be explored as the pandemic persists. However, ART adherence was unaffected for the subcohort for whom we measured electronic adherence. This suggests that some clients may have stockpiles of ART tablets from previous prescriptions that allowed them to keep taking their medication even when they could not visit the clinic for ART refills.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Use of HIV Care, Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence, and Viral Suppression: An Observational Cohort Study From Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has been identified to be a mutation hot spot, with the P323L mutation being commonly observed in viral genomes isolated from North America.

Methods: : A total of 35 diagnosis confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection disease,from January 26 to February 19, 2020, at central theater Wuhan general hospital of PLA, were included in this cross-sectional case series study. The diagnosis was confirmed by both clinical and laboratory ways. Throat samples from all enrolled patients were collected with sampling swab, and simultaneously ,tear samples were collected w ith sampling swab from 9 patients (No.1-9) and with Schirmer's strip from the remaining patients (No.10-35) (bilateral eyes for all patients). Sample collecting and testing were performed in three separate time points: first from patients No.1-9,second from p atients No.10-29,and third from patients No.30-35. Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chai n-reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed by the same technician(Researcher Zhang), who was blind to the patients profile, within 4 hours after each collection. Results: : Among enrolled patients, 29 (No.1-29) had mild or moderate clinical symptoms and 6 (No.30-35) had severe symptoms. The mean time interval from the sample collection day to diagnosis confirmation day was 9.716.50 days (ranged from 3 to 29 days). None of the patients had conjunctivitis.

It is well established that intrinsically disordered protein domains drive condensate formation via liquid-liquid phase separation; however, the role of globular protein domains on intracellular phase separation remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the overall charge of globular proteins would dictate the formation and concentration of condensates and systematically probed this hypothesis with supercharged proteins and nucleic acids in E. coli. Within this study, we demonstrated that condensates form via electrostatic interactions between engineered proteins and RNA and that these condensates are dynamic and only enrich specific nucleic acid and protein components.

Amino acid metabolic pathways represent with other antimicrobial agent potential targets for therapeutic strategies. iNOS-mediated production of NO from Arg is involved in the innate inflammatory response to pathogens and NO overproduction can induce hyperinflammation. The two Arg-catabolising enzymes Arg1 and IDO1 reduce the hyperinflammation by an immunosuppressive effect via either Arg starvation (for Arg1) or via the immunoregulatory activity of the Arg-derived metabolites Kyn (for IDO1). In response to amino acid abundance mTOR activates the host protein translation and Coronaviruses use this machinery for their own protein synthesis and replication. In contrast GCN2, the sensor of amino acid starvation, activates pathways that restrict inflammation and viral replication. Gln depletion alters the immune response that become more suppressive, by favouring a regulatory T phenotype rather than a Th1 phenotype. Proliferating activated immune cells are highly dependent on Ser, activation and differentiation of T cells need enough Ser and dietary Ser restriction can inhibit their proliferation. Cys is strictly required for T-cell proliferation because they cannot convert Met to Cys. Restricting Met inhibits both viral RNA cap methylation and replication, and the proliferation of infected cells with an increased requirement for Met.

METHODS: We reviewed the COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women published to date and evidence from preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies, and discuss their implications. RESULTS: Pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines resulting in limited data on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. As a result, since December 2020, there has been conflicting advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities on this matter. From the end of 2020 up to now, some consensus guidance has been published with a prevalent precautionary approach on the administration of vaccines in pregnant women, in breastfeeding ones, or for those who are planning a pregnancy (either spontaneously or with assisted technologies). After the first few months of vaccine administration in some countries, more permissiveness seems to prevail, although with inconsistencies. At the moment, the results obtained by preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies suggest that the risks of the maternal COVID-19 outweigh the undocumented and hypothetical risks of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Also, until two viral vector COVID-19 vaccines were associated with very rare thromboembolic events, all guidance had agreed that all approved COVID-19 vaccines could be administered in pregnancy.

METHODS: Eleven GBS cases in four key COVID-19 hotspots are discussed regarding presenting symptoms, response to therapies and cross-reactivity of COVID spike proteins with nerve glycolipids. Emerging cases of COVID-19-triggered autoimmune necrotizing myositis (NAM) and encephalopathies are also reviewed in the context of viral invasion, autoimmunity and ongoing immunotherapies. RESULTS: Collective data indicate that in this pandemic any patient presenting with an acute paralytic disease-like GBS, encephalomyelitis or myositis-even without systemic symptoms, may represent the first manifestation of COVID-19. Anosmia, ageusia, other cranial neuropathies and lymphocytopenia are red flags enhancing early diagnostic suspicion. In Miller-Fisher Syndrome, ganglioside antibodies against GD1b, instead of QG1b, were found; because the COVID-19 spike protein also binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins for cell-entry and anti-GD1b antibodies typically cause ataxic neuropathy, cross-reactivity between COVID-19-bearing gangliosides and peripheral nerve glycolipids was addressed. Elevated Creatine Kinase (>10,000) is reported in 10% of COVID-19-infected patients; two such patients presented with painful muscle weakness responding to IVIg indicating that COVID-19-triggered NAM is an overlooked entity. Cases of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalitis, cranial neuropathies with leptomeningeal enhancement, and tumefactive postgadolinium-enhanced demyelinating lesions are now emerging with the need to explore neuroinvasion and autoimmunity. Concerns for modifications-if any-of chronic immunotherapies with steroids, mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIg, and anti-B-cell agents were addressed; the role of complement in innate immunity to viral responses and anti-complement therapeutics (i.e. eculizumab) were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging data indicate that COVID-19 can trigger not only GBS but other autoimmune neurological diseases necessitating vigilance for early diagnosis and therapy initiation. Although COVID-19 infection, like most other viruses, can potentially worsen patients with pre-existing autoimmunity, there is no evidence that patients with autoimmune neurological diseases stable on common immunotherapies are facing increased risks of infection.","output":"Guillain-Barr syndrome: The first documented COVID-19-triggered autoimmune neurologic disease: More to come with myositis in the offing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detection of multiple viruses is important for global analysis of gene or protein content and expression, opening up new prospects in terms of molecular and physiological systems for pathogenic diagnosis.

Autopsy studies of COVID-19 patients have demonstrated fibrin thrombi in small vessels and capillaries. Increase in proinflammatory cytokines secondary to COVID-19 may play a direct role in creating a prothrombotic state. VTE rates have been described in greater than 20-30% despite prophylactic anticoagulation. There is a paucity of literature describing VTE after hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19. Recommending extended thromboprophylaxis post discharge has been considered in COVID-19 patients at low bleeding risk. We hypothesized that the hypercoagulable state conferred by COVID-19 may last many months following discharge. Methods: We analyzed data from 9 consecutive patients, post diagnosis COVID-19, admitted with acute VTE to two hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System, New York City. Results: COVID-19: 55.5% patients had COVID-19 that did not require hospitalization. No patients developed VTE. The mean age was 63 years, and 33.3% were female. Risk factors for VTE in addition to recent COVID-19 included obesity (44%), prior VTE (22.2%), active malignancy (11.1%), sickle cell disease (11.1%). Patients hospitalized for the index diagnosis COVID-19 had elevated mean D-dimer (75%) and CRP. Two (50%) patients received corticosteroid therapy. Two patients were discharged on therapeutic anticoagulation for a pre-existing condition. VTE Admission: The mean time of the last positive PCR swab COVID-19 test and admission for VTE was 88 days (SE: 32 days). All patients presented with SOB, 33.3% had a cough. Mean D-dimer level was 6.8 ug/mL (SE: 2.8), of which two had levels above the standard reference range of 20 ug/mL. Five (55.5%), and four (44.4%) patients were classified as Intermediaterisk, and low-risk for mortality, respectively as per ESC guidelines. Two (22.3%) had lower extremity DVT. All were treated with systemic anticoagulation, one patient received catheter directed thrombolysis, and none developed major bleeding during hospitalization. Discharge treatment included DOAC (77.7%), Low Molecular Weight Heparin (11.1%), and coumadin (11.1%). All patients survived to discharge, and there were no major bleeding events. Conclusion: VTE can occur after a significant time following acute COVID-19 in patients hospitalized and those treated as outpatients. The hypercoaguable state conferred by COVID-19 may last many months after the acute illness.

The data was then analysed to identify common patterns as well as significant divergences across the three countries, especially in the areas of health policy and technology use. RESULTS: France, Belgium and Canada faced differing epidemiological situations during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the wide variety of policy actions taken appears to be linked to existing governance and healthcare structures. The varying degrees of federalism and regional autonomy across the three countries highlight the different constraints faced by national policy-makers within different governance models. CONCLUSIONS: The actions taken by all three countries appear to have been largely dictated by existing health system capacity, with increasing federalism associated with more fragmented strategies and less coordination across jurisdictions.

The coexistence of two global pandemics, COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been implicated with worse prognosis. The association of diabetes and worse outcome in viral infections stems from the detrimental effect of hyperglycemia to the control of viremia and different components of the host response. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients and establish the association of baseline glycemic status and COVID-19 outcomes among persons with type 2 diabetes. Methodology. A single center, retrospective study among adult persons with type 2 diabetes diagnosed with COVID-19 in Makati Medical Center from March 1 to August 31, 2020. A total of 156 medical records (26%) out of 584 confirmed cases were reviewed. Data were collected on diabetes status, comorbid conditions and laboratory findings. Both Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression models were fitted. To assess the factors associated with mortality as a dichotomous endpoint (died/survived), binary logistic regression was performed. On the other hand, a time-to-mortality analysis was performed using Cox regression. For the effect estimate, we refer to hazard ratios in the Cox proportional hazards model and odds ratios in the logistic regression models. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex and two models were additionally adjusted for any presence of comorbidity. Results. A total of 156 COVID-19 patients with diabetes were analyzed. Upon admission, 13% were in diabetic ketosis, 4% were in a state of DKA, and 2% had hypoglycemia. About 5%, 33%, 26%, and 36% of patients had mild, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19, respectively. Between non-survivors and survivors, the latter group were significantly younger in age (p&lt;.003) and had less ICU admissions (p&lt;.001). Although DKA status upon admission seemed to result in increased odds of non-survival (cOR 5.8 [95% CI 1.1-30.7]), no other feature in the glycemic history was significantly associated with mortality outcome after having adjusted for age and sex. Death in this study was limited to patients with severe or critical disease. Conclusion. The risk of mortality is five times greater among patients admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis.

After heat inactivation, an aliquot of swab medium was used for the direct quantitation. Then, we compared the direct method with the quantitation performed on the RNA purified from nasopharyngeal swab by automated extraction. We observed that the direct approach achieved generally equal RNA copies compared to the extracted RNA. The results with the direct quantitation were more accurate on ESwab with a sensitivity of 93.33% [95% CI, 68.05 to 99.83] and specificity of 100.00% for both N1 and N2.

Our data suggest that although BA.1 and BA.2 evade polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses, current vaccine boosting regimens may provide sufficient protection against Omicron-induced disease.","output":"Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 neutralizing activity elicited by a comprehensive panel of human vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In addition to providing life-giving nutrients and other substances to the breastfed infant, human milk can also represent a vehicle of pathogen transfer. As such, when an infectious disease outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic occursparticularly when it is associated with a novel pathogenthe question will naturally arise as to whether the pathogen can be transmitted through breastfeeding. Until high-quality data are generated to answer this question, abandonment of breastfeeding due to uncertainty can result. The COVID-19 pandemic, which was in full swing at the time this document was written, is an excellent example of this scenario. During these times of uncertainty, it is critical for investigators conducting research to assess the possible transmission of pathogens through milk, whether by transfer through the mammary gland or contamination from respiratory droplets, skin, breast pumps, and milk containers, and/or close contact between mother and infant. To promote the most rigorous science, it is critical to outline optimal methods for milk collection, handling, storage, and analysis in these situations, and investigators should openly share their methods in published materials. Otherwise, the risks of inconsistent test results from preanalytical and analytical variation, false positives, and false negatives are unacceptably high and the ability to provide public health guidance poor.

Against a neo-liberal model of care that individuates and isolates, Belcourt and Robertson offer theories of the self as historical and multiple. Following a brief close reading of their work, I argue that the overlapping crises of the present require a politics of decision. Precisely because caring for oneself as a protective gesture against social contagion does not scale up in the ways that the uneven distribution of life chances bears down on subjugated communities, Belcourt and Robertson suggest we must decide when to abandon the narrative enclosures of the self-as-isolation and embrace the radical exposures of collectivity.

As an effective therapeutic strategy is not introduced yet and the rapid genetic variations in the virus, there is an emerging necessity to design, evaluate and apply effective new vaccines. An acceptable vaccine must elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, must have the least side effects and the storage and transport systems should be available and affordable for all countries. These vaccines can be classified into different types: inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and RNA) and recombinant vector-based vaccines (replicating and non-replicating viral vector). According to the latest update of the WHO report on April 2nd, 2021, at least 85 vaccine candidates were being studied in clinical trial phases and 184 candidate vaccines were being evaluated in pre-clinical stages. In addition, studies have shown that other vaccines, including the Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine and the Plant-derived vaccine, may play a role in controlling pandemic COVID-19. Herein, we reviewed the different types of COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trial phases along with advantages, disadvantages or adverse reactions, if any.","output":"An update review of globally reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in preclinical and clinical stages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although emerging data demonstrated mortality of young COVID-19 patients, no data have reported the risk factors of mortality for these young patients, and whether obesity is a risk for young COVID-19 patients remains unknown. We conducted a retrospective study including 13 young patients who died of COVID-19 and 40 matched survivors. Logistic regression was employed to characterize the risk factors of mortality in young obese COVID-19 patients. Most of the young deceased COVID-19 patients were mild cases at the time of admission, but the disease progressed rapidly featured by a higher severity of patchy shadows (100.00% vs 48.70%; P = .006), pleural thickening (61.50% vs 12.80%; P = .012), and mild pericardial effusion (76.90% vs 0.00%; P < .001). Most importantly, the deceased patients manifested higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.354; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.075-1.704; P = .010), inflammation-related index C-reactive protein (OR = 1.014; 95% CI = 1.003-1.025; P = .014), cardiac injury biomarker hs-cTnI (OR = 1.420; 95% CI = 1.112-1.814; P = .005), and increased coagulation activity biomarker D-dimer (OR = 418.7; P = .047), as compared with that of survivors.

Perioperative local anesthetics are effective analgesics in the immediate 1- to 2-day postoperative period, but acute pain often lasts longer. The goal of this work was to develop a local anesthetic formulation adhering to an intraoperative implanted device that reduces pain for at least 3 days after surgery. METHODS Six groups, each with 8 rats, were studied. In a control group (group I), one 1.2-cm-long incision of the skin was followed by blunt dissection to separate the skin away from the underlying tissues and closing with 2 sutures. In 3 of the treatment groups, the same surgical procedure was used, with the subcutaneous space formed by the blunt dissection lined with a 1-cm square patch of hernia mesh coated with poly lactide co-glycolic acid microspheres containing approximately 17 mg of bupivacaine (group II), no drug (placebo; group III), or bupivacaine free-base powder (group IV). Uncoated mesh implants (group V) served as a secondary control. A standard bupivacaine solution (0.4 mL, 0.5%; 2-mg dose) was infiltrated subcutaneously 30 minutes before the surgery and served as a standard control (group VI). Mechanosensitivity of the skin was tested by the local subcutaneous muscle responses to cutaneous tactile stimulation by von Frey hairs with forces of 4 g (for allodynia) and 15 g (for hyperalgesia) preoperatively and for 7 postoperative days. RESULTS Control rats (group I) showed mechanohypersensitivity, indicative of postoperative allodynia and hyperalgesia, for all 7 postoperative days. Mechanohyperalgesia in rats that received mesh coated with bupivacaine-releasing microspheres (group II) was reduced during this period to 13% of control postoperative values (P < 0.001); mesh coated with bupivacaine base (group IV) reduced it by 50% (P = 0.034). The placebo mesh (group III) and uncoated mesh (group V) caused no significant reduction of mechanohypersensitivity, and bupivacaine solution infiltrated before the incision (group VI) reduced hypersensitivity for only approximately 2 hours, an overall insignificant effect. CONCLUSIONS Bupivacaine slowly released for 72 hours from microspheres adsorbed to the hernia mesh significantly suppresses evoked postoperative hypersensitivity for at least 1 week and is more effective than a suspension of these microspheres or preoperative single-shot infiltration of bupivacaine.","output":"Prolonged amelioration of experimental postoperative pain by bupivacaine released from microsphere-coated hernia mesh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the present study is to shed light on the attitudes of Turkish EFL teachers towards online instruction (OI), the impact of training on their attitudes, the obstacles they encounter, and the strategies to deliver OI more successfully throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.

A total of 12 patients hospitalized with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were treated with a high dose of ulinastatin alongside standard care. Changes in clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and chest images were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 10 patients with severe Covid-19 and two patients with moderate Covid-19 received ulinastatin treatment. The average age of the patients was 68.011.9 years (age range, 48-87 years). In total, nine of the 12 patients (75.0%) had one or more comorbidities. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (8/12, 66.7%), cough (5/12, 41.7%) and dyspnea (5/12, 41.7%). The percentage of lymphocytes was decreased in 41.7% of patients (5/12) and 58.3% of patients (7/12) had elevated hypersensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (mean, 49.7077.70 mg/l).

The population density of worms determines whether a colony will form in a thresholded fashion, and a simple two-compartment ordinary differential equation model correctly predicts the threshold. Furthermore, small, round colonies sometimes fuse to form larger, round colonies, and a phenomenon akin to Ostwald ripening - a coarsening process seen in many systems that undergo phase separation - also occurs.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 9,475 PHW in five provinces across China between February 18 and March 1, 2020. The subsample data of those who reported probable mental health problems were analyzed for this report (n = 3,417). Logistic and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of predisposing, enabling, need, and COVID-19 contextual factors with mental health help-seeking. Results: Only 12.7% of PHW reported professional mental help-seeking during the COVID-19 outbreak. PHW who were older, had more days of overnight work, received psychological training, perceived a higher level of support from the society, had depression and anxiety were more likely to report mental help-seeking (OR(m) range: 1.02C1.73, all p < 0.05) while those worked in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were less likely to seek help (OR(m) = 0.57, p < 0.01). The belief that mental health issues were not the priority (64.4%), lack of time (56.4%), and shortage of psychologists (32.7%) were the most frequently endorsed reasons for not seeking help. Conclusions: The application of BMHSU confirmed associations between some factors and PHW's mental health help-seeking.

METHODS: Between December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020, 23 hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms. Descriptive analysis and correlation of patients' clinical and CT characteristics were performed. Laboratory results from time of first admission and CT absorption (defined as reduction in lesion area, decrease in density, and absorption of some solid components) were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. RESULTS: Fifteen (65.2%) patients were asymptomatic with patchy ground-glass opacity in a single lung lobe. Eight (34.8%) patients were symptomatic with multiple patchy ground-glass shadows, consolidation, and fibrous stripes. Differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate between first admission and CT absorption were significant (P<0.001). Median absorption time was shorter in the asymptomatic group compared with the symptomatic group (5 vs 10 days; P<0.001).

However, it is unknown whether the changes in heart rate variability precede neurological deterioration in such patients. We explored the changes in heart rate variability measured by electrocardiography in patients who had neurological deterioration following severe acute brain injury and examined the relationship between heart rate variability and electroencephalography parameters. Methods Retrospective analysis of 25 patients who manifested neurological deterioration after severe acute brain injury and underwent simultaneous electroencephalography plus electrocardiography monitoring. Results Eighteen electroencephalography channels and one simultaneously recorded electrocardiography channel were segmented into epochs of 120-second duration and processed to compute 10 heart rate variability parameters and three quantitative electroencephalography parameters. Raw electroencephalography of the epochs was also assessed by standardized visual interpretation and categorized based on their background abnormalities and ictal-interictal continuum patterns. The heart rate variability and electroencephalography parameters showed consistent changes in the 2-day period before neurological deterioration commenced. Remarkably, the suppression ratio and background abnormality of the electroencephalography parameters had significant reverse correlations with all heart rate variability parameters. Conclusion We observed a significantly progressive decline in heart rate variability from the day before the neurological deterioration events in patients with severe acute brain injury were first observed.","output":"Continuous heart rate variability and electroencephalography monitoring in severe acute brain injury: a preliminary study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Establishing the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children at admission is challenging. Most of the admitted children with CAP receive antibiotics. We aimed to build and validate a diagnostic tool combining clinical, analytical and radiographic features to differentiate viral from bacterial CAP, and among bacterial CAP, typical from atypical bacteria. METHODS Design-observational, multi-center, prospective cohort study was conducted in 2 phases. Settings: 24 secondary and tertiary hospitals in Spain. Patients-A total of 495 consecutive hospitalized children between 1 month and 16 years of age with CAP were enrolled. Interventions-A score with 2 sequential steps was built (training set, 70% patients, and validation set 30%). Step 1 differentiates between viral and bacterial CAP and step 2 between typical and atypical bacterial CAP. Optimal cutoff points were selected to maximize specificity setting a high sensitivity (80%). Weights of each variable were calculated with a multivariable logistic regression. Main outcome measures-Viral or bacterial etiology. RESULTS In total, 262 (53%) children (median age: 2 years, 52.3% male) had an etiologic diagnosis. In step 1, bacterial CAPs were classified with a sensitivity = 97%, a specificity = 48%, and a ROC's area under the curve = 0.81. If a patient with CAP was classified as bacterial, he/she was assessed with step 2. Typical bacteria were classified with a sensitivity = 100%, a specificity = 64% and area under the curve = 0.90. We implemented the score into a mobile app named Pneumonia Etiology Predictor, freely available at usual app stores, that provides the probability of each etiology.

The analysis of variable regions of African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome led to more genotypic and serotypic information about circulating strains. The present study aimed at investigating the genetic diversity of ASFV strains in symptomatic pigs in South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples collected from 391 ASF symptomatic domestic pigs in 6 of 8 districts in South Kivu were screened for the presence of ASFV, using a VP73 gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the universal primer set PPA1-PPA2. To genotype the strains, we sequenced and compared the nucleotide sequences of PPA-positive samples at three loci: the C-terminus of B646L gene encoding the p72 protein, the E183L gene encoding the p54 protein, and the central hypervariable region (CVR) of the B602L gene encoding the J9L protein. In addition, to serotype and discriminate between closely related strains, the EP402L (CD2v) gene and the intergenic region between the I73R and I329L genes were analyzed. RESULTS: ASFV was confirmed in 26 of 391 pigs tested. However, only 19 and 15 PPA-positive samples, respectively, were successfully sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed for p72 (B646L) and p54 (E183L). All the ASFV studied were of genotype X. The CVR tetrameric repeat clustered the ASFV strains in two subgroups: the Uvira subgroup (10 TRS repeats, AAAABNAABA) and another subgroup from all other strains (8 TRS repeats, AABNAABA). The phylogenetic analysis of the EP402L gene clustered all the strains into CD2v serogroup 7. Analyzing the intergenic region between I73R and I329L genes revealed that the strains were identical but contained a deletion of a 33-nucleotide internal repeat sequence compared to ASFV strain Kenya 1950. CONCLUSION: ASFV genotype X and serogroup 7 was identified in the ASF disease outbreaks in South Kivu province of DRC in 2018C2019. This represents the first report of ASFV genotype X in DRC. CVR tetrameric repeat sequences clustered the ASFV strains studied in two subgroups.

RESULTS Thirty-one relevant studies were found in the field including 81 patients with an age range from 0.6 to 90 years and a body mass index range from 18 to 36.7 kg/m2. Splenomegaly (44.6%), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (31%), and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (6.8%) were the most common indications for the procedure. Concerning the applied port system, multiple single ports (5 to 12 mm) were used in 54.4% of patients, the SILS port (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) was used in 26.6%, the TriPort (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) was used in 7.6%, glove ports were used in 6.3%, and the GelPort (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, California) was used in 5.1%. The median operative time was 125 minutes (range, 45-420 minutes), and the median quantity of blood loss was 50 mL (range, 10-450 mL). No conversion to open surgery and no transfusion were needed. The length of hospital stay was between 1 and 9 days. Low rates of complications and no patient deaths were found. The existing evidence on cosmesis is limited.

This happened within the context of pharmacists seeking more opportunities to increase their clinical responsibilities and play a larger role in primary care. Objective(s): To analyse the policymaking context and pharmacy responses to COVID-19 that enable or constrain the expansion of pharmacists scope of practice. Methods This study is a policy analysis of documentary data detailing changes in pharmacy policy in Australia, drawing on a policy space analysis framework to identify opportunities and constraints to policy reform. Data were collected from news for health professionals; federal/jurisdictional legislation and media releases; and guidelines and directives from government health departments and agencies. Changes to pharmacy practice were identified and classified according to type. For each change, potential opportunities and constraints for expanding pharmacists scope of practice were identified. Results Four categories of changes were identified: medicines limits/restrictions; alternatives to paper prescriptions; public health measures; and community pharmacist-delivered services. Opportunities from the pandemic response that could expand scope of practice include the potential permanence of temporary measures that increase pharmacists' responsibilities; remuneration to legitimise services; political acknowledgement of medicines safety and access as a priority; and government need to quickly address crises. Constraints include the potential permanence of temporary measures that restrict pharmacists practice; negative perceptions of pharmacists from other clinicians; intra-professional disagreements regarding pharmacy-based services; and lack of pharmacist representation in institutional structures.

Common approaches such as pooling datasets and applying standard statistical learning methods can result in poor out-of-study prediction performance when datasets are heterogeneous. Theoretical and applied work has shown $\\\\textit{multi-study ensembling}$ to be a viable alternative that leverages the variability across datasets in a manner that promotes model generalizability. Multi-study ensembling uses a two-stage $\\\\textit{stacking}$ strategy which fits study-specific models and estimates ensemble weights separately. This approach ignores, however, the ensemble properties at the model-fitting stage, potentially resulting in a loss of efficiency. We therefore propose $\\\\textit{optimal ensemble construction}$, an $\\\\textit{all-in-one}$ approach to multi-study stacking whereby we jointly estimate ensemble weights as well as parameters associated with each study-specific model.

We propose an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm to optimize the proposed loss function. We compare our approach to standard methods by applying it to a multi-country COVID-19 dataset for baseline mortality prediction. We show that when little data is available for a country before the onset of the pandemic, leveraging data from other countries can substantially improve prediction accuracy.

Traditionally, in-person hands-on courses have been the most common means for surgeons to gain exposure to new techniques and procedures. The COVID19 pandemic caused a cessation in these courses and left surgeons with limited opportunities to continue their professional development. Thus, SAGES elected to create an innovative hands-on course that could be completed at home in order to provide surgeons with opportunities to learn new procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: This course was initially planned to be taught as an in-person hands-on course utilizing the Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer(ADOPT) method 1. We identified a virtual telementoring platform, Proximie Ltd(London, UK), and a company that could create a model of an abdominal wall in order to perform a Transversus Abdominis Release, KindHeart&#8482;(Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The course consisted of pre-course lectures and videos to be reviewed by participants, a pre-course call to set learning goals, the hands-on telementoring session from home, and monthly webinars for a year. RESULTS: The ADOPT hands-on hernia course at home was successfully completed on October 23rd of 2020. All participants and faculty were successfully able to set up their model and utilize the telementoring platform, but 15% required assistance.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with psychological distress among medical students during the period of enforced home quarantine from March through May 2020. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: One Japanese medical school. PARTICIPANTS: 571 medical students. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-administered electronic questionnaires including the K-6 scale for psychological distress, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) for self-esteem and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) for self-efficacy were distributed. To assess the determinant factor for psychological distress, variables such as sex, grade in school, living conditions, and RSES and GSES scores were evaluated in regression analysis. RESULTS: 163 respondents (28.5%) scored &#8805;5 on the K-6 scale, indicating a significant degree of psychological distress. Logistic regression revealed that a higher score on RSES (p<0.001) and GSES (p<0.01) was an independent factor associated with lower levels of psychological distress. Multiple regression analysis focusing on students with a K-6 score &#8805;5 revealed that higher scores on RSES correlated with lower levels of psychological distress. By contrast, those with higher GSES scores also scored higher for indicators of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that self-efficacy and self-esteem were both influential factors for predicting psychological distress during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical schools should provide support for mental health and educational initiatives directed at enhancing self-esteem and self-efficacy, with a focus on improving personal resilience. In emergency situations, such as that faced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, initial programmes might target students with higher levels of self-efficacy. By contrast, under routine situations, these efforts should be directed towards students with lower self-esteem as primary means to prevent depression.","output":"Factors associated with the mental health status of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Centrioles duplicate in interphase only once per cell cycle. Newly formed centrioles remain associated with their mother centrioles. The two centrioles disengage at the end of mitosis, which licenses centriole duplication in the next cell cycle. Therefore, timely centriole disengagement is critical for the proper centriole duplication cycle. However, the mechanisms underlying centriole engagement during interphase are poorly understood. Here, we show that Cep57 and Cep57L1 cooperatively maintain centriole engagement during interphase. Codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 induces precocious centriole disengagement in interphase without compromising cell cycle progression. The disengaged daughter centrioles convert into centrosomes during interphase in a Plk1-dependent manner. Furthermore, the centrioles reduplicate and the centriole number increases, which results in chromosome segregation errors. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the maintenance of centriole engagement by Cep57 and Cep57L1 during interphase is crucial for the tight control of centriole copy number and thus for proper chromosome segregation.","output":"Cep57 and Cep57L1 maintain centriole engagement in interphase to ensure centriole duplication cycle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An estimated 10% of COVID-19 survivors continue to experience symptoms several weeks to months after the appearance of initial symptoms, a condition termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of protein homeostasis system; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.","output":"Hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be responsible for acute lung injury in influenza virus infections: A need for early immune-modulators for severe cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background There may be a risk of COVID-19 transmission to rescuers delivering treatment for cardiac arrest. The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations. Methods We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: 1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; 2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and 3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organisation COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020. Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question. We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome. Results We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials. We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection. Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery. Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes. Conclusion It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers.

To conserve PPE, reduce the spread of the virus, and keep student learners safe, leaders of medical schools across the country made the difficult decision to suspend in-person clinical experiences. As medical students were sent home and hospital systems ramped up their response to the virus, many essential health care workers (HCWs) faced an immediate challenge. As \\"non-essential\\" services such as schools and daycare centers abruptly closed, HCWs serving on the frontlines in inpatient settings needed a way to both fight the pandemic and care for their children. APPROACH: Medical students at Oregon Health & Science University were able to rapidly organize to provide childcare for essential HCWs. For roughly eight weeks following the state of emergency (March 13 through May 15, 2020) students used Twitter and emerging technology to match families in need of childcare with a trainee volunteer. OUTCOMES: By May 15th, the service had successfully fulfilled 181 of the 202 requests for childcare (90%) over the course of 8 weeks. Of the 181 completed childcare requests, 172 (95%) were fulfilled by an individual (1:1 volunteer-to-household pairing), and 9 (5%) were fulfilled by two or more volunteers. NEXT STEPS: The trainees who provided childcare will apply the skills learned (e.g., clear communication, grassroots organizing, triaging, leveraging new technology) to patient care. Broader applications for this system include organizing volunteers to conduct contract tracing or to provide public health information in languages other than English. Future research includes examining the effect of the service on the productivity, morale, and mental health of both those who provided and received childcare.","output":"Rapid Mobilization of Medical Students to Provide Health Care Workers with Emergency Childcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Utilizing the successful experiences of countries and local regions can be useful in the management and control of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), so the research team aims to determine and extract the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the health system in the risk management of COVID-19 using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analytical approach.

Online media are a critical factor of influence on the formation of attitudes in many areas of modern society, which is why their proper use plays an important role in strengthening vaccine confidence and which may further contribute to improvement of public health. On the other side, having in mind the fact that communication is an integral part of marketing, it is clear that social marketing has an extremely important role regarding the analyzed topic, especially because of the fact that social marketing activities tend to change or maintain people's behavior for the benefit of individuals and society as a whole. For the purpose of this research, a conceptual model was developed. Quantitative research was conducted online in the first quarter of 2020 using the survey method. Statistical analysis was applied to data collected from 1593 parents in the analyzed countries. The relevance of the hypotheses was tested using standard statistical tests, ANOVA test, eta coefficient, and logistic regression. The research showed that all analyzed variables from the model have a significant impact on the parents' attitudes toward the vaccination of children and that they correlate with the degree of trust in vaccines. The results also approved that online media have a significant influence on the formation of parents' attitudes toward the vaccination of children (obtained values of eta coefficient ?2 = 0.216, ?2 = 0.18, ?2 = 0.167, ?2 = 0.090, reliability Cronbach's Alpha 0.892), which confirms the importance of the use of social marketing in order to direct communication properly and to strengthen the level of trust in vaccines. Additionally, the results of logistic regression showed that the following groups of parents are particularly vulnerable to the influence of online media on attitudes toward vaccines: women, parents of younger age (\\"millennials\\"), and parents who are in common law marriage, as well as parents who have more children. In addition, the results showed that there is no statistically significant difference in the attitudes of parents in the observed countries (?2 = 0.000, F = 0.85). Based on the results of the research, the authors suggest that decision makers should pay more attention to modern forms of online communication and social marketing in order to use their potential for improvement of public health, as well as avoid the harmful impact that certain forms of communication may have on the formation of attitudes and loss of confidence in vaccines.

DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis to determine short and long term clinical and financial benefits. A decision tree was constructed to determine short-term \\"in-hospital\\" costs, based on outcome data derived from a previous study. For a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis, we created a simulation model to estimate life expectancy (quality-adjusted) and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of major noncardiac surgical patients. Cost and outcome comparisons were made between postoperative goal-directed therapy and best standard therapy and described as cost/hospital survivor and cost/patient for the short-term analysis and as incremental cost/quality-adjusted life year for the long-term model. One-way, multiway, and probabilistic analyses were performed to address uncertainties in the model input values, and results were presented graphically in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. SETTING Simulation of a tertiary care department in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS A hypothetical cohort of high risk surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS Patients undergoing high-risk surgery were stratified to receive goal-directed therapy or standard best practice to improve tissue oxygenation in the postoperative setting. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In our short-term model, goal-directed therapy decreased costs by 2,631.77/patient and by 2,134.86/hospital survivor. The most sensitive variables were relative risk of complication and length of stay. When assuming the worst-case scenario (prolonged ICU and in-hospital stay, highest complication costs, and maximum cost for monitoring), goal-directed therapy still achieved cost savings (471.70). Our findings also predict that goal-directed therapy not only prolongs quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.83 yr or 9.8 mo) but also leads to incremental cost savings over a lifetime projection of 1,285.77, resulting in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of - 1,542.16/quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION The implementation of goal-directed therapy is both clinical and cost-effective. Additional implementation expenditures can be offset by savings due to reduced costs accrued from a reduction in complication rates and hospital length of stay.

Presently, clinically US FDA approved drugs in PD includes Levodopa, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, (Entacapone and Tolcapone), Dopamine agonists (Bromocriptine, Ropinirole, Pramipexole, and Rotigotine), Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors (Selegiline and Rasagiline), Amantadine and Antimuscarinic drugs. The drugs have established mechanism of action on PD patients with known pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties along with dose and adverse effects. Conclusion and relevance of this review focus on the drugs that can be tried for the PD patients with SAR CoV-2 infection, in particular, Amantadine approved by all developed countries a common drug possessing both antiviral properties by downregulation of CTSL, lysosomal pathway disturbance and change in pH necessary to uncoat the viral proteins and antiParkinson properties. The significant prognostic adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2 on PD and the present-day treatment options, clinical presentation and various mechanism is warrant need of the hour.","output":"Targeting COVID-19 in Parkinson's patients: Drugs repurposed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major viral pathogen of commercial poultry, affecting chickens of all ages and causing major economic losses in poultry industry worldwide. Frequent points of mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene region, result in the emergence of new IBVs variants circulating in the form of several serotypes/genotypes that can be partially or poorly neutralized by current vaccines. IBV is well studied worldwide, nevertheless in African countries epidemiological and scientific data are poor and not updated. This review aims to give a current overview of IBV situation, to establish evolutionary relationship between the African variants and to list some of the potential measures to control IBV in Africa. Three S1 gene hypervariable regions were studied and compared to the reference genotypes/serotypes that found emerging in African regions. This comparison was based on phylogenetic trees, nucleotide and amino-acid sequence analysis. It clearly appears that IBV variants reported in Africa, display a low genetic relationship between them and with the majority of the reference strains emerging in neighboring countries, except the case of variants from Libya and Egypt that show a high relatedness. Also the Massachusetts serotypes were the most prevalent co-circulating with both serotypes, Italy02 type in Morocco and Qx-like genotype in South part of the African continent. In order to control the IBV variants in African regions, an efficient vaccination strategy program should be implemented.","output":"Current situation, genetic relationship and control measures of infectious bronchitis virus variants circulating in African regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use European football performance data to select teams to form the proposed European football Super League, using only unsupervised techniques.

However, there are limited opportunities to use these image-based diagnostic indices in clinical practice. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the utility of a visually-based classification of pulmonary findingsfrom computed tomography (CT) images among COVID-19 patients that we developed, with the following three patterns defined: peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse findings of pneumonia. We also evaluated the prognostic value of this classification to predict the severity of COVID-19. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between January and September 2020, who presented with suspicious findings on CT lung images (n=69). We compared the association between the three predefined patterns (peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse) and admission to the intensive care unit, tracheal intubation, and death. The following demographic and clinical variables were compared between the three groups: sex, age, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, partial pressure of oxygen, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, Krebs von den Lungen-6 antigen, D-dimer, platelet count, steroid administration, heparin administration, favipiravir administration, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score, and sequential organ failure assessment score. Results: Patients with a diffuse pattern were intubated more frequently and for a longer duration than patients with a peripheral or multifocal pattern. The following clinical variables were significantly different between the diffuse pattern and peripheral and multifocal groups: body temperature, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, Krebs von den Lungen-6 antigen, D-dimer, and steroid and Avigan administration. Conclusions: Our simple visual assessment of CT images can predict a systemic cytokine storm, a resulting decrease in respiratory function, and the need for supplemental respiratory ventilationamong patientswith COVID-19.","output":"Visual Classification of Three Computed Tomography Lung Patterns to Predict Prognosis of COVID-19: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several digital contact tracing smartphone applications have been developed worldwide in the effort to combat COVID-19 that warn users of potential exposure to infectious patients and generate big data that helps in early identification of hotspots, complementing the manual tracing operations.

Respiratory materials (saliva, sputum and food tray swabs) were non-invasively collected from the four cheetahs. Although we were unable to isolate the virus, the NP gene of influenza A virus was detected in three of the cheetahs but not in the fourth cheetah that had nearly recovered. From a food tray swab which tested weakly positive by a commercial influenza detection kit, we were able to obtain the whole-genome sequence of the influenza A virus. Analysis of the genome, A/cheetah/Kanagawa/2/2019(H1N1), revealed that the virus was closely related to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated from humans in Japan in the 2018-2019 winter. Production of haemagglutinin inhibition (HI) antibodies (64-128 HI) against an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in plasma samples confirmed infection of all four cheetahs. The animals continued to produce antibodies for at least 314 days after disease onset. These findings strongly suggest that reverse zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus occurred from human to cheetah and subsequently from cheetah to cheetah in the zoo.

The consequences vary in most cases and these anomalies lead to severe coronary hypo-perfusion and ventricular dysfunction. The common variants of this cardiac malformation are an anomalous origin of a left coronary artery from a pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) and anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from a pulmonary artery (ARCAPA). Another rare variant is left main coronary artery atresia that resembles ALCAPA in its mode of presentation. This article presents a single surgeon experience of managing this complex subset of the coronary anomaly from April 2006 to July 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 105 patients, who underwent surgery for AOCAPA from April 2006 to July 2019, have been included in the study. The patients have been analysed by follow-up echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) at our hospital by paediatric cardiologists. Out of 105 patients of AOCAPA, 98 (93.3%) patients underwent ALCAPA repair, of which 59 (60.2%) were males and 39 (39.7%) were females. Four out of five patients, who had an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right pulmonary artery (ALCARPA), had an intramural aortic course. Three patients (3%) had left main coronary artery atresia and four patients (4%) had ARCAPA. It may be mentioned that seven infants (7.14%) and one adult patient (1%) underwent concomitant mitral valve repair. All the patients with ALCAPA, left main coronary artery atresia and ARCAPA, and 1 of the patients with ALCARPA, underwent coronary relocation. In four out of five patients with ALCARPA, unroofing of intra-aortic intramural course was performed. RESULTS: Out of 105 patients of AOCAPA, 9 (8.5%) patients had in-hospital mortality. Five infants (5.0%) with ALCAPA and one patient (1%) with ALCARPA died in the post-operative period due to severe left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation (MR) and sepsis. One adult patient (1%) with ALCAPA, who underwent coronary relocation using in situ trap door technique and mitral valve (MV) repair, died due to massive intracranial bleeding. Two patients out of three (66.6%) with left main coronary atresia died in intensive care unit (ICU) after 3rd and 4th postoperative day, due to low cardiac output, severe ventricular dysfunction and severe MR. Patients were followed up for a median 5.9 years. Seven patients were lost to follow-up, including the sole survivor of left main coronary atresia, after a median follow-up of 4 years after surgery. Three patients underwent mitral valve replacement for progressive residual MR. There has been no late mortality. CONCLUSION: AOCAPA is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly, which usually presents in infancy with left ventricular dysfunction and mitral valve regurgitation. Early diagnosis and surgical re-establishment of the dual coronary system has given gratifying results, with improvement in left ventricular function in survivors. Mitral valve intervention for MR was required, in both early and late phases.","output":"Surgical management of anomalous origin of coronary artery from pulmonary artery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurologists increasingly care for people with significant frailty in both clinic and ward settings.

In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of two mass-gathering outdoor events, held during a peak of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, on COVID-19 incidence. Methods This was a retrospective, population-based control-matched analysis. The study population included attendees to two outdoor music festivals held in Catalonia (North-East Spain). The primary objective was to compare the incidence of COVID-19 within the 3-to-10 days following the event between attendees and a population-based control group. Findings The analysis included 18,275 and 27,347 attendees to the first and second festivals, respectively, and their corresponding controls. The post-festival 7-day cumulative COVID-19 incidence among attendees and controls was 4.14% (95% CI 3.86-4.44) vs. 1.69% (1.51-1.88) for the first festival (RR 2.46;2.16-2.80), and 2.42% (2.35-2.61) and 1.10% (0.99-1.2) for the second festival (RR 2.19;1.92-2.51). COVID-19 incidence among immunized individuals was also two-fold higher in attendees than in controls. Previous COVID-19 infection, vaccination, and adequate mask-wearing were significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection after the events.

Persons with negative swab for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline who developed infection during the study were included in the analysis. ExposureLaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcomes and measuresThe observed SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding characteristics were summarized and shedding trajectories were examined using a piece-wise linear mixed-effects modeling. Whole viral genome sequencing was performed on samples with cycle threshold (Ct)<34. ResultsNinety-seven persons (57% women, median age 37-years) developed incident infections during 14-days of follow-up. Two-hundred fifteen sequenced samples were assigned to 15 lineages that belonged to the G614 variant. Forty-two (43%), 18(19%), and 31(32%) participants had viral shedding for 1 day, 2-6 days, and []7 days, with median peak viral load Ct of 38.5, 36.7, and 18.3, respectively. Six (6%) participants had 1-6 days of observed viral shedding with censored duration. The peak average viral load was observed on day 3 of viral shedding. The average Ct value was lower, indicating higher viral load, in persons reporting COVID-19 symptoms than asymptomatic. Using the statistical model, the median time from shedding onset to peak viral load was 1.4 days followed by a median of 9.7 days before clearance.

In the next series of experiments, mice with LIFP received daily intragastrically either melatonin (1 mg/kg body weight in 200 l of distilled water) or 200 l of water as a placebo. The comparison group consisted of intact animals that received placebo under standard lighting conditions. Immunohistochemical analysis (using an indirect avidin-biotin peroxidase method) revealed the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the proapoptotic protein Bad in sinusoid liver cells (a heterogeneous population consisting of the endotheliocytes, Kupffer cells, Ito cells, and Pit cells) and in individual hepatocytes. The Bad expression area in the liver of LIFP mice increased 4 times against a background of the unchanged Bcl-2 expression area. Changes in the brightness (a parameter inversely proportional to the marker concentration) of Bad and Bcl-2 areas did not reach significance. Our results indicate a weakening of the antiapoptotic protection of liver cells of LIFP animals, which creates conditions for activation of the mitochondrial branch of apoptosis. Melatonin treatment of LIFP mice resulted in a 3.3-fold increase in Bcl-2 expression area and a 2.7 % decrease in Bcl-2 region brightness compared with the experimental untreated group.

Therefore, we updated a previous systematic review to determine the efficacy and safety of NMBAs in ARDS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE (October 2012 to July 2019), the Cochrane (Central) database, and clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN Register, and WHO ICTRP) for RCTs comparing the effects of NMBA as a continuous infusion versus placebo or no NMBA infusion (but allowing intermittent NMBA boluses) on patient-important outcomes for adults with ARDS. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodologic quality of the primary studies and abstracted data. RESULTS: Seven RCTs, including four new RCTs, met eligibility criteria for this review. These trials enrolled 1598 patients with moderate to severe ARDS at centers in the USA, France, and China. All trials assessed short-term continuous infusions of cisatracurium or vecuronium. The pooled estimate for mortality outcomes showed significant statistical heterogeneity, which was only explained by a subgroup analysis by depth of sedation in the control arm. A continuous NMBA infusion did not improve mortality when compared to a light sedation strategy with no NMBA infusion (relative risk [RR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.86C1.15; moderate certainty; P = 0.93). On the other hand, continuous NMBA infusion reduced mortality when compared to deep sedation with as needed NMBA boluses (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57C0.89; low certainty; P = 0.003). Continuous NMBA infusion reduced the rate of barotrauma (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.35C0.85, moderate certainty; P = 0.008) across eligible trials, but the effect on ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU-acquired weakness was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistency in study methods and findings precluded the pooling of all trials for mortality. In a pre-planned sensitivity analysis, the impact of NMBA infusion on mortality depends on the strategy used in the control arm, showing reduced mortality when compared to deep sedation, but no effect on mortality when compared to lighter sedation. In both situations, a continuous NMBA infusion may reduce the risk of barotrauma, but the effects on other patient-important outcomes remain unclear. Future research, including an individual patient data meta-analysis, could help clarify some of the observed findings in this updated systematic review.","output":"Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To classify higher-risk influenza patients within 10 s, we developed an infectious disease and fever screening radar system.

In the specified period, 12 patients were scheduled for surgery. Since papillary carcinoma was the preoperative diagnosis in all cases, radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) therapy was also planned 3-4 weeks following surgery after withdrawing thyroxine and achieving a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level > 30 mU/L. Thyroxine withdrawal is the routine method applied for RIA in Jordan as it is less costly compared to the rapid method of exogenous stimulation using recombinant TSH. All surgical procedures were performed without delay since all patients were asymptomatic per flu-like illness and came from a region of low COVID-19 prevalence. These included total thyroidectomy (n = 11), bilateral therapeutic central compartment neck dissection (n = 7), lateral compartment neck dissection (n = 5). However, the RIA treatment plan was altered considerably according to the period in which they were operated. 6 out of the 7 patients operated in March changed to the stimulated method of RIA at a considerable additional extra cost.

A huge number of new patients, a fast internal reorganization process and many other changes were suddenly established. These circumstances revealed the need to increase stocks of drugs, both for basic treatment as well as for specific SARS-CoV-2 infection management. At the same time, other problems (shortages, new and complex purchasing procedures, etc.) surfaced, so they could risk safety along the pharmacotherapeutic process. The main objective was to develop and implement all the necessary measures within the logistics circuit in order to ensure the availability of medicines for patients, as safely and effectively as possible, during the Coronavirus crisis. Firstly, two pharmacists were appointed to coordinate the whole process, and a preliminary analysis of the following aspects was carried out an estimation of needs to make an initial drug provisioning, a storage feasibility study and a global analysis of the logistics process to detect critical points. Three different circuits for medicines supply were established as some drugs were operated by Agencia Espa?ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) or Servicio Madrile?o de Salud (SERMAS), and others were under no restrictions. For stocks control, inventory was frequently reviewed and monitoring of prescription trends was implemented. For all new medicinal products, compliance with security standards was reviewed and relabeling was carried out if necessary. Criteria were defined for the storage of overstocks and it was placed an isolated area for quarantined drugs. Shortages inevitably occurred but their effects were partly mitigated by AEMPS and SERMAS. After all, we consider that the implemented procedure for logistics management may be reproducible, and the key points we have identified are the following: to enhance our quality management system, to develop an Action Plan for Healthcare Emergencies and to ensure the adequate training for all pharmacy staff. Furthermore, we also should address other aspects: to establish storage optimization strategies, to focus on a more advanced logistics management model, as well as to take advantage of the extraordinary multidisciplinary network, which has been consolidated during this COVID pandemic.","output":"El servicio de farmacia frente a la logstica de adquisicin de medicamentos./ Hospital Pharmacy Service: Facing the logistics of medicines procurement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of the study was to create and to validate the Polish version of the original English version of the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) developed by Preis and colleagues (2020a; 2020b) We additionally investigated the association of maternal obstetrical and pandemic related factors with the PREPS in order to test its sensitivity.

RESULTS The results of the present research indicate satisfactory psychometric properties of the Polish version of the PREPS. Our findings confirm the factor structure found by the authors of the original English version of the PREPS.

Pandemic-related pregnancy stress is significantly associated with fear of childbirth and with non-pandemic pregnancy-specific stress, which bolsters its convergent validity. Higher levels of pandemic-related pregnancy stress are experienced by primiparas, those in their second or third trimester, women who received infertility treatment, and those with a high-risk pregnancy.

Despite between-study discrepancies, an overall consensus has emerged whereby blood group O appears associated with a lower risk of COVID-19, while non-O blood types appear detrimental. Two major hypotheses may explain these findings: First, natural anti-A and anti-B antibodies could be partially protective against SARS-CoV-2 virions carrying blood group antigens originating from non-O individuals. Second, O individuals are less prone to thrombosis and vascular dysfunction than non-O individuals and therefore could be at a lesser risk in case of severe lung dysfunction. Here, we review the literature on the topic in light of these hypotheses. We find that between-study variation may be explained by differences in study settings and that both mechanisms are likely at play. Moreover, as frequencies of ABO phenotypes are highly variable between populations or geographical areas, the ABO coefficient of variation, rather than the frequency of each individual phenotype is expected to determine impact of the ABO system on virus transmission. Accordingly, the ABO coefficient of variation correlates with COVID-19 prevalence. Overall, despite modest apparent risk differences between ABO subtypes, the ABO blood group system might play a major role in the COVID-19 pandemic when considered at the population level.","output":"ABO Blood Types and COVID-19: Spurious, Anecdotal, or Truly Important Relationships?

A quick-to-be-identified cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has prior use experiences in patients in order to resolve the current pandemic situation before it could become worsening. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is hereby applied to identify the marketed drugs with potential for treating COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An AI platform was established to identify potential old drugs with anti-coronavirus activities by using two different learning databases; one consisted of the compounds reported or proven active against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, and the other one containing the known 3C-like protease inhibitors. All AI predicted drugs were then tested for activities against a feline coronavirus in in vitro cell-based assay. These assay results were feedbacks to the AI system for relearning and thus to generate a modified AI model to search for old drugs again. RESULTS: After a few runs of AI learning and prediction processes, the AI system identified 80 marketed drugs with potential. Among them, 8 drugs (bedaquiline, brequinar, celecoxib, clofazimine, conivaptan, gemcitabine, tolcapone, and vismodegib) showed in vitro activities against the proliferation of a feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in Fcwf-4 cells. In addition, 5 other drugs (boceprevir, chloroquine, homoharringtonine, tilorone, and salinomycin) were also found active during the exercises of AI approaches. CONCLUSION: Having taken advantages of AI, we identified old drugs with activities against FIP coronavirus.

We hypothesized that high-risk therapies would predispose pts with cancer and COVID-19 to higher risk of VTE complications. Methods: CCC19 is the largest international registry (NCT04354701) recording outcomes of pts with cancer and COVID-19. The registry was queried for hospitalized pts who developed VTE and received systemic cancer treatment in the year prior to COVID-19. Incidence of VTE was analyzed as the primary endpoint;30-day any cause mortality & need for ICU admission at baseline were secondary endpoints in pts with and without VTE respectively. Pts were stratified by treatment type and time from last treatment dose: &lt;2 wk, 2-4 wk, 1-3 months (mos), 3-12 mos. Results: As of February 9th 2021, 4217 hospitalized pts with complications data were present in the registry. 1867 (44%) pts had received systemic anti-cancer therapy within the year prior to COVID-19 and were analyzed. There were a total of 186 (10%) VTE events. Of these, VTE incidence was 141 (10.5%) in pts with solid tumors and 57 (9%) in pts with hematologic malignancies. Overall 30-day mortality was 20% and 22% in pts with and without VTE respectively, while direct admission to ICU at presentation was seen in 17% and 10% of pts with and without VTE, respectively.

Plasma equilibrium analysis of RAAS APs identified significant increases in the median concentrations of beneficial APs, such as angiotensin 1\\\\7, in dogs with CHF (486.7 pg/mL; IQR, 214.2\\\\1168) as compared to those with preclinical disease (41.0 pg/mL; IQR, 27.4\\\\45.1; P < .0001) or control (11.4 pg/mL; IQR, 7.1\\\\25.3; P = .01). Incubation of plasma samples from dogs with CHF with rhACE2 increased beneficial APs, such as angiotensin 1\\\\9 (preincubation, 10.3 pg/mL; IQR, 4.4\\\\37.2; postincubation, 2431 pg/mL; IQR, 1355\\\\3037; P = .02), while simultaneously decreasing maladaptive APs, such as angiotensin II (preincubation, 53.4 pg/mL; IQR, 28.6\\\\226.4; postincubation, 2.4 pg/mL; IQR, 0.50\\\\5.8; P = .02).

National surveys assessing vaccination willingness and reports of vaccination administration by race/ethnicity indicate at least two areas that warrant attention: elevated vaccine hesitancy among African American and Latino adults, and the need to ensure equitable access to vaccination. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is not uniform within racial/ethnic minority populations; yet, given the disproportionate impact, understandable distrust, and widespread misinformation, there is an imperative to overcome challenges associated with vaccination willingness and uptake, as well as implementation and access. This Perspective discusses the complexity of drivers for each of these areas, which include individual, community, and structural factors. It also highlights two initiatives at the National Institutes of Health. One is focused on addressing misinformation and distrust through academic-community partnerships, and the other on community-engaged behavioral interventions to address the population-specific reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, support informed decision-making, and promote equitable access among populations with health disparities. For the foreseeable future, proactive and persistent efforts around COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including vaccination, will remain of paramount importance for health equity.","output":"No Populations Left Behind: Vaccine Hesitancy and Equitable Diffusion of Effective COVID-19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain structural features of healthy individuals are associated with olfactory functions. However, due to the pathophysiological differences, congenital and acquired anosmia may exhibit different structural characteristics. A systematic review was undertaken to compare brain structural features between patients with congenital and acquired anosmia. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus electronic databases to identify eligible reports on anosmia and structural changes and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Reports were extracted for information on demographics, psychophysical evaluation, and structural changes. Then, the report was systematically reviewed based on various aetiologies of anosmia in relation to (1) olfactory bulb, (2) olfactory sulcus, (3) grey matter (GM), and white matter (WM) changes. Twenty-eight published studies were identified. All studies reported consistent findings with strong associations between olfactory bulb volume and olfactory function across etiologies. However, the association of olfactory function with olfactory sulcus depth was inconsistent. The present study observed morphological variations in GM and WM volume in congenital and acquired anosmia. In acquired anosmia, reduced olfactory function is associated with reduced volumes and thickness involving the gyrus rectus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. These findings contrast to those observed in congenital anosmia, where a reduced olfactory function is associated with a larger volume and higher thickness in parts of the olfactory network, including the piriform cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. The present review proposes that the structural characteristics in congenital and acquired anosmia are altered differently. The mechanisms behind these changes are likely to be multifactorial and involve the interaction with the environment.

HYPOTHESIS The use of a single tibial tunnel arthroscopic technique without bone plugs will reduce symptoms (pain) and improve knee function at a minimum 3-year follow-up. STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS Thirty-two meniscal transplantations (16 medial, 16 lateral; 23 men, 9 women) were prospectively evaluated at a minimum of 36 months (mean, 40.4  6.90 months; range, 36-66 months) after surgery. The average age at the time of surgery was 35.6  10.3 years (range, 15-55 years). The transplantation was performed using an arthroscopic bone plug-free technique with a single tibial tunnel plus \\"all-inside\\" meniscal sutures. The anterior meniscal horn was sutured to the capsule. Follow-up included a visual analog scale (VAS) score for knee pain and subjective and objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, Tegner, and SF-36 scores. All patients underwent radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the involved knee before the surgery and at the final follow-up. The MRI outcomes were evaluated with the modified Yulish score. RESULTS Regarding clinical evaluation, there was a significant improvement in scores at follow-up compared with preoperatively: the VAS score decreased from 70.6  21.7 to 25.2  22.7 (P < .0001), the SF-36 physical component score increased from 37.31  7.2 to 49.69  8.3 (P < .0001), the SF-36 mental component score increased from 49.69  10.8 to 53.53  7.5 (P = .0032), the Tegner activity score increased from 3 (range, 3-5) to 5 (range, 3-6) (P < .0121), the Lysholm score increased from 59.78  18.25 to 84.84  14.4 (P < .0001), the subjective IKDC score increased from 47.44  20.60 to 77.20  15.57 (P < .0001), and the objective IKDC score changed from 1 A, 21 B, 6 C, and 4 D to 22 A, 9 B, and 1 C (P < .0001). No significant difference was found in this study between patients who received medial allografts and patients who received lateral allografts. There was no significant difference between outcomes of patients with isolated and combined procedures. The MRI findings showed 69% extruded allografts (8 medial and 14 lateral). In detail, we found 50% of the medial allografts and 87% of the lateral allografts extruded. No significant difference in clinical outcomes and modified Yulish score was found between patients with extruded allografts and with in situ allografts. The MRI results also showed a significant decrease of the modified Yulish score from baseline to 3-year minimum follow-up (P < .0001 for femur and P < .0001 for tibia). Only one patient underwent arthroscopic selective meniscectomy because of a medial posterior horn retear of the graft. One patient developed lack of flexion and underwent an arthroscopic arthrolysis. These 2 patients did not draw benefit from allografting and therefore were considered failures. In all remaining cases (94%), meniscal allograft transplantation was able to reduce symptoms (pain measured by VAS) and improve knee function (as measured by IKDC and Lysholm scores). CONCLUSION This study found that a single tibial tunnel arthroscopic technique without bone plugs for meniscal allograft transplantation significantly reduced pain and improved knee function in 94% of patients at a minimum 3-year follow-up.","output":"Meniscal allograft transplantation without bone plugs: a 3-year minimum follow-up study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While it is recognized that drought affects mental health, few population-based longitudinal studies quantify this relationship. In this study, we investigate the effects of drought on mental health in a rural population, and how these effects change with continued exposure to drought conditions. Using a panel dataset consisting of 6,519 observations from the Australian Rural Mental Health Study, we found a non-linear (inverted U-shape) relationship between drought exposure and mental health. Specifically, people experienced an increase of psychological distress for the first 2.5C3 years of drought, after which time this distress dissipates. These effects were maintained after controlling for demographic, social, and environmental factors. We also found that while psychological distress decreases in the later stages of drought, this does not necessarily mean people have good mental health because, for example, factors such as life satisfaction decreased as drought persisted. This is important as it highlights the need for sustained support to mitigate the long-term effects of drought on mental health that persist after the drought has apparently finished.","output":"New Insights Into the Relationship Between Drought and Mental Health Emerging From the Australian Rural Mental Health Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess if the adjusted odds of low composite cognitive Bayley-III scores changed after implementing a single-institution quality improvement (QI) project designed to decrease discharge Z-scores for weight, body mass index (BMI), and weight-for-length, but not length or fronto-occipital circumference (FOC) in infants 23C28 weeks gestational age (GA).

Successful inhibition of the TMPRSS2 can be one of the crucial strategies to stop the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, a set of bioactive molecules from Morus alba Linn. were screened against the TMPRSS2 through two widely used molecular docking engines such as Autodock vina and Glide.

Based on acceptable pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-likeness, finally, five molecules were found to be important for the TMPRSS2 inhibition. A number of bonding interactions in terms of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions were observed between the proposed molecules and ligand-interacting amino acids of the TMPRSS2. The dynamic behavior and stability of best-docked complex between TRMPRSS2 and proposed molecules were assessed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Several parameters from MD simulation have suggested the stability between the protein and ligands. Binding free energy of each molecule calculated through MM-GBSA approach from the MD simulation trajectory suggested strong affection toward the TMPRSS2.

Severe disease is more often found among elderly people, whereas most young children and adolescents show mild symptoms or even remain asymptomatic, so that infection might be undiagnosed. Therefore, only limited epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and young adults are available. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children from the city of Tbingen, Germany, and to measure the incidence of new cases over 12 months. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be measured in saliva as a surrogate for a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children will be sampled at their preschools, primary schools, and secondary schools at three time points: July 2020, October to December 2020, and April to July 2021. An adult cohort will be sampled at the same time points (ie, adult comparator group). The saliva-based SARS-CoV-2Cantibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay will be validated using blood and saliva samples from adults with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infections (ie, adult validation group). RESULTS: The first study participant was enrolled in July 2020, and recruitment and enrollment continued until July 2021. We have recruited and enrolled 1850 children, 560 adults for the comparator group, and 83 adults for the validation group. We have collected samples from the children and the adults for the comparator group at the three time points. We followed up with participants in the adult validation group every 2 months and, as of the writing of this paper, we were at time point 7. We will conduct data analysis after the data collection period. CONCLUSIONS: Infection rates in children are commonly underreported due to a lack of polymerase chain reaction testing.

The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of different dietary interventions (eg, ketogenic and Mediterranean diets) on cognitive function in patients with AD in a systematic review and pairwise and network meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials or clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers will independently conduct searches of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data will be extracted from selected studies and risk of bias will be assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and evidence quality will be assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.

The practice of assisted reproduction during this pandemic presents unique challenges in addition to the risks identified in general clinical care. The established good tissue practices employed in laboratories are not designed to protect gametes and embryos from an airborne virus, particularly one that may be shed by an asymptomatic staff member. Armed with theoretical risks but lacking direct evidence, assisted-reproduction teams must examine every aspect of their practice, identify areas at a risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and develop a mitigation plan. Several professional fertility societies have created guidelines for the best practices in patient care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As we learn more about SARS-CoV-2, updates have been issued to help adapt infection-control and -prevention protocols.

Ferret badgers are extensively traded in China, although the trends, drivers and health implications of ferret badger trade in other parts of Asia remain poorly known. Here, we focus on the pet trade of a little known endemic small carnivore species, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis in Indonesia, over a 10 yr period (2011?2020). The Javan ferret badger is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with an unknown population trend. We aimed to gain insight into the magnitude of this trade, its purposes, price trends, distribution records, health risks and shifts to online platforms. We documented 44 ferret badgers in 11 wildlife markets in Java and Bali and 100 ferret badgers for sale on online platforms. We observed a shift in trade from traditional animal markets only, to trade in these markets as well as online. Asking prices, corrected for inflation, declined significantly from ~USD 37 in 2012 to ~USD 22 in 2020, and were related to the purchasing power in cities where trade occurred. Wide-spread sale of the species highlights that enforcement continues to be overly passive as any trade in the species is illegal. We recommend that the Javan ferret badger be afforded full national pro-tection and prioritised in monitoring efforts to establish its true conservation status. Additionally, concerted efforts are needed to determine if online trade poses a risk to conservation and human health. ? The authors 2021. Open Access under Creative Commons by Attribution Licence.

Based on the structure of the complex of the protein S receptor-binding domain (RBD) and ACE2, the design of chimeric molecules consisting of two 22C23-mer peptides linked to each other by disulfide bonds was carried out. The chimeric molecule X1 was a disulfide dimer, in which terminal cysteine residues in the precursor molecules h1 and h2 were connected by the S-S bond. In the chimeric molecule X2, the disulfide bond was located in the middle of each precursor peptide molecule. The precursors h1 and h2 mimic amino acid sequences of 1- and 2-helices of the ACE2 extracellular peptidase domain, respectively, keeping intact most of the amino acid residues involved in the interaction with RBD. The aim of the work was to evaluate the binding efficiency of chimeric molecules and their constituent peptides with RBD (particularly in dependence of the middle and terminal methods of fixing the initial peptides h1 and h2). The proposed polypeptides and chimeric molecules were synthesized by chemical methods, purified to 95C97% purity, and characterized by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Binding of these peptides to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was evaluated by microthermophoresis with recombinant domains corresponding in sequence to the original Chinese (GenBank ID NC_045512.2) and the British (B. 1.1.7, GISAID EPI_ISL_683466) variants. The original RBD of the Chinese variant bound to three synthesized peptides: linear h2 and both chimeric variants. Chimeric peptides were also bound to the RBD of the British variant.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 key informants at two time points to understand organizational readiness, facilitators, and barriers to change. We identified strategies important to successful implementation, particularly in the context of change fatigue. PURPOSE: Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) is effective for secondary fracture prevention. Two hospital sites implemented FLS for hip fracture patients, 50 + years, in Alberta, Canada. We assessed organizational readiness, facilitators, and barriers to change to better understand the context in which the FLS was implemented to inform its potential spread provincially. METHODS: We recruited individuals involved in FLS implementation at provincial and site levels to participate in telephone interviews at baseline and 16 months post-implementation. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic content analysis. In addition, site-level participants were invited to complete the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change tool at baseline. RESULTS: We conducted 33 semi-structured interviews (20 at baseline; 13 at post-implementation) with 21 key informants. Participants included managers (24%), FLS physicians/clinical nurses (19%), operational/leadership roles (19%), physicians/surgeons (14%), pharmacists (10%), nurse practitioners (10%), and social work (5%). Seventeen site-level participants completed the ORIC tool at baseline; all participants scored high (71%) or neutral (29%). We found that the use of several strategies, including demonstrating value, providing resources, and selecting appropriate sites, were important to implementation, particularly in the context of change fatigue. Participants perceived the FLS as acceptable and there was evidence of facilitated learning rather than simply monitoring implementation as intended. CONCLUSIONS: An effective change management approach neutralized change fatigue. This approach, if maintained, bodes well for the potential spread of the FLS provincially if proven effective and cost effective. Change readiness assessment tools could be used strategically to inform the spread of the FLS to early adopter sites.

Animals were randomized to receive slow (90 min) or fast (45 min) assisted rewarming with CPB to a target temperature of 35C. After a total of 90 min of reperfusion in both groups, brain samples were collected and analysed immunohistochemically and with immunofluorescence. In 10 rats, magnetic resonance imaging was performed after 2 and after 24 h to investigate cerebral perfusion and cerebral oedema. RESULTS: Interleukin 6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumour necrosis factor &#945; in the hippocampus are significantly less expressed in the slow rewarming group, and microglia cells are significantly less activated in the slow rewarming group. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis demonstrated better cerebral perfusion and less water content in brains that underwent slow rewarming at 2 and 24 h.

Recently developed pharmacological agents were developed with an appreciation of AD as a heterogeneous condition. New advances include topical, oral, and injectable therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action. In addition, advances in clinical practice, including the application of digital tools, can promote a personalized medicine approach. For example, teledermatology for chronic conditions such as AD have been embraced by clinicians and patients; communicating symptoms via photographs can augment patient symptom trackers and aid trigger identification. Digital tools can also be used to increase medication adherence and improve patient/caregiver engagement. Integrating the above is a personalized medicine approach. Advanced therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action, integrated with digital tools, and trends toward patient-centered medicine can assist this chronic, heterogeneous condition via precision medicine and better treat treatment-resistant AD.","output":"Treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis: novel therapeutics, digital tools, and precision medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Self-quarantine and social distancing are one of the numerous impacts of COVID-19 pandemic that leads individuals to spend much more time at home which in turn interestingly contributes to the increased number of gaming disorder cases.

More recently, a multi-organ involvement has been highlighted, with different pathways of injury. A hemoglobinopathy, hypoxia and cell iron overload might have a possible additional role. Scientific literature has pointed out two potential pathophysiological mechanisms: i) severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV- 2) interaction with hemoglobin molecule, through CD147, CD26 and other receptors located on erythrocyte and/or blood cell precursors; ii) hepcidin-mimetic action of a viral spike protein, inducing ferroportin blockage. In this translational medicinebased narrative review, the following pathologic metabolic pathways, deriving from hemoglobin denaturation and iron metabolism dysregulation, are highlighted: i) decrease of functioning hemoglobin quote; ii) iron overload in cell/tissue (hyperferritinemia); iii) release of free toxic circulating heme; iv) hypoxemia and systemic hypoxia; v) reduction of nitric oxide; vi) coagulation activation; vii) ferroptosis with oxidative stress and lipoperoxidation; viii) mitochondrial degeneration and apoptosis. A few clinical syndromes may follow, such as pulmonary edema based on arterial vasoconstriction and altered alveolo-capillary barrier, sideroblastic-like anemia, endotheliitis, vasospastic acrosyndrome, and arterio- venous thromboembolism. We speculated that in COVID-19, beyond the classical pulmonary immune-inflammation view, the occurrence of an oxygen-deprived blood disease, with iron metabolism dysregulation, should be taken in consideration. A more comprehensive diagnostic/therapeutic approach to COVID-19 is proposed, including potential adjuvant interventions aimed at improving hemoglobin dysfunction, iron over-deposit and generalized hypoxic state.","output":"COVID-19: hemoglobin, iron, and hypoxia beyond inflammation.

We identified multiple SARS-CoV-2 peptides that were reactive with serum antibodies and T cells from convalescent COVID-19. In addition, age and gender associated differences in the reactivity to S and N protein peptides were identified. Moreover, several SARS-CoV-2 peptides tested negatively correlated with disease severity and lung damage. Cross-reactivity to eCoV peptides was analyzed and found to be lower in COVID-19 compared to controls. In this study, we demonstrate the changing pattern of immunogenic peptide reactivity in COVID-19 serum based on age, gender and previous exposure to eCoVs.

We show that intramuscular priming of mice with an alum and BcfA-adjuvanted Spike subunit vaccine, followed by a BcfA-adjuvanted mucosal booster, generated Th17 polarized tissue resident CD4+ T cells, and mucosal and serum antibodies. The serum antibodies efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 and its Delta variant, suggesting cross-protection against a recent variant of concern (VOC). Immunization with this heterologous vaccine prevented weight loss following challenge with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 and reduced viral replication in the nose and lungs. Histopathology showed a strong leukocyte and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell infiltrate without epithelial damage in mice immunized with BcfA-containing vaccines. In contrast, viral load was not reduced in the upper respiratory tract of IL-17 knockout mice immunized with the same formulation, suggesting that the Th17 polarized T cell responses are critical for protection. We show that vaccines adjuvanted with alum and BcfA, delivered through a heterologous prime-pull regimen, protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection without causing enhanced respiratory disease. SIGNIFICANCE There remains a need for SARS CoV-2 booster vaccines that generate mucosal immunity and prevent transmission. We show that systemic priming followed by a mucosal booster with a BcfA-adjuvanted subunit vaccine generates neutralizing antibodies and Th17 polarized systemic and tissue-resident immune responses that provide sterilizing immunity against wildtype SARS CoV-2, and a variant of concern. Importantly, in contrast to alum alone, the addition of BcfA prevents respiratory pathology. These results suggest that a BcfA-adjuvanted mucosal booster may elicit mucosal immunity in individuals previously immunized systemically with approved vaccines.

Design: This was not a study or clinical trial, but rather a retrospective interim audit (Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals Registration No. 10075) of a local clinical care pathway for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related illness. The Information (Caldicott) Guardian permitted these data to be shared beyond the confines of our institution. Setting: A large tertiary academic NHS Foundation Trust in the North East of England, UK, providing care to COVID-19 patients. Participants: One hundred thirty-four hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19 infection. Main outcome measures: Adherence to local investigation and treatment protocol; prevalence of VDD, and relationship of baseline serum 25(OH)D with markers of COVID-19 severity and inpatient fatality versus recovery. Results: 55.8% of eligible patients received Colecalciferol replacement, albeit not always loaded as rapidly as our protocol suggested, and no cases of new hypercalcaemia occurred following treatment. Patients admitted to ITU were younger than those managed on medical wards (61.1 years +/- 11.8 vs. 76.4 years +/- 14.9, p<0.001), with greater prevalence of hypertension, and higher baseline respiratory rate, National Early Warning Score-2 and C-reactive protein level. While mean serum 25(OH)D levels were comparable [i.e. ITU: 33.5 nmol/L +/- 16.8 vs. Non-ITU: 48.1 nmol/L +/- 38.2, mean difference for Ln-transformed-25(OH)D: 0.14, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (-0.15, 0.41), p=0.3], only 19% of ITU patients had 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol/L vs. 39.1% of non-ITU patients (p=0.02). However, we found no association with fatality, potentially due to small sample size, limitations of no-trial data and, potentially, the prompt diagnosis and treatment of VDD. Conclusions: Subject to the inherent limitations of observational (non-trial) audit data, analysed retrospectively, we found that patients requiring ITU admission were more frequently vitamin D deficient than those managed on medical wards, despite being significantly younger. Larger prospective studies and/or clinical trials are needed to elucidate the role of vitamin D as a preventive and/or therapeutic strategy for mitigating the effects of COVID-19 infection in patients with VDD.","output":"Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are associated with greater disease severity: results of a local audit of practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research into work ability is increasing in the aging workforce literature.

Improvement in care requires complex interventions involving multiple components and stakeholders, customised to specific care contexts. This study aims to comprehensively understand the healthcare experiences of children with IMDs and their families across Canada. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-stage explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used. Stage 1: quantitative data on healthcare networks and encounter experiences will be collected from 100 parent/guardians through a care map, 2 baseline questionnaires and 17 weekly diaries over 5C7 months. Care networks will be analysed using social network analysis. Relationships between demographic or clinical variables and ratings of healthcare experiences across a range of family centred care dimensions will be analysed using generalised linear regression. Other quantitative data related to family experiences and healthcare experiences will be summarised descriptively. Ongoing analysis of quantitative data and purposive, maximum variation sampling will inform sample selection for stage 2: a subset of stage 1 participants will participate in one-on-one videoconference interviews to elaborate on the quantitative data regarding care networks and healthcare experiences. Interview data will be analysed thematically. Qualitative and quantitative data will be merged during analysis to arrive at an enhanced understanding of care experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be combined and presented narratively using a weaving approach (jointly on a theme-by-theme basis) and visually in a side-by-side joint display.

The challenges of immigration of new infections into regions and asymptomatic infections remain. Standard deterministic compartmental models are inappropriate for sub- or peri-critical epidemics (reproductive number close to or less than one), so individual-based models are often used by simulating transmission from an infected person to others. However, to be realistic, these models require a large number of parameters, each with its own set of uncertainties and lack of analytic tractability. Here, we apply stochastic age-structured Leslie theory with a long history in ecological research to provide some new insights to epidemic dynamics fuelled by external imports. We model the dynamics of an epidemic when R (0) is below one, representing COVID-19 transmission following the successful application of intervention measures, and the transmission dynamics expected when infections migrate into a region. The model framework allows more rapid prediction of the shape and size of an epidemic to improve scaling of the response. During an epidemic when the numbers of infected individuals are rapidly changing, this will help clarify the situation of the pandemic and guide faster and more effective intervention.","output":"The ecological dynamics of the coronavirus epidemics during transmission from outside sources when R (0) is successfully managed below one"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid identification of COVID-19 cases, which is crucial to outbreak containment efforts, is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic symptoms and in settings with limited capacity for specialized nucleic acid-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7-98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening center and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from 26 January to 16 February 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively.

The following data were recorded: mechanism of injury, the pattern of fracture, presence of other associated injuries, the time before performing the surgery, surgical approach, position on operating table, time of surgery, intraoperative bleeding, hospitalization time, intraoperative and postoperative complications. Follow-ups were performed at 1, 3, 6, 12 months, then annually. The clinical-functional outcome was assessed with the Merle dAubigne Postel score (MAP) modified by Matta; while the radiological outcome with the Matta Radiological Scoring System (MRSS). A Chi-square test was utilized to examine associations between parametric variables. RESULTS: We included 34 patients, mean age 62.1, with an average follow-up of 20.7 months. The most frequent traumatic mechanism was road trauma. There were 15 isolated anterior columns and 19 associated patterns. There were 5 cases of associated visceral injuries, and 10 cases of other associated skeletal fractures. All patients were in the supine position. The surgical approach used was the AIP in all cases, with the addition of the first window of the ilioinguinal approach in 16 cases and of the Kocher-Langenbeck approach in 2 cases.

Family Talk is one of the better known interventions designed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, its evidence base is small, with few robust independent randomised controlled trials, and no associated process or cost evaluations. The PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies and children) research programme involves a mixed method evaluation of Family Talk which is being delivered in mental health settings in Ireland to improve child and family psychosocial functioning in families with parental mental illness. METHODS: The study comprises a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with nested economic and process evaluations, to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness and implementation mechanisms of Family Talk compared to usual services. The study is being conducted in 15 adult and child mental health settings in Ireland. Families with a parent with mental illness, and children aged 5C18 years (n = 144 families) will be randomised to either the 7-session Family Talk programme (n = 96) or to standard care (n = 48) using a 2:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes are child psychosocial functioning and family functioning. Secondary outcomes are as follows: understanding and experience of parental mental illness, parental mental health, child and parental resilience, partner wellbeing and service utilisation. Blind assessments will take place at pre-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the prevalence and burden of intergenerational mental illness, it is imperative that prevention through evidence-based interventions becomes a public health priority.

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its biology is still poorly understood. Currently, there are no vaccines and drugs/or agents that can reduce severity of this new disease. Recent data suggest that patients with age-related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and dementia are highly susceptible to severe respiratory illness due to coronavirus infection. Recent research also revealed that aged individuals with elevated baseline inflammation cause defects in T and B cells, leading to decreased body's immune response to viral infection. In the current article, we discuss the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on age-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease. Our article also highlights the interaction between coronavirus and immune cells, and how COVID-19 alters mitochondrial activities in host cells. Based on new and compelling evidence, we propose that mitochondrial fission is inhibited while fusion is promoted, causing mitochondrial elongation and providing a receptive intracellular environment for viral replication in infected cells. Further research is still needed to understand the cross talk between viral replication in mitochondria and disease progression in patients with COVID-19.","output":"The COVID-19 Effect on the Immune System and Mitochondrial Dynamics in Diabetes, Obesity, and Dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There was an outbreak of pneumonia in the month of December 2019 in Wuhan, China that spread with a rapid rate throughout the country and shook the world by spreading across the globe causing many deaths due This disease is confirmed by means of molecular method as a novel coronavirus and was named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in its initial stage;however, on February 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) renamed this disease COVID-19, which means corona virus disease COVID-19 has impacted nearly the entire world, affecting more than 100 countries including India The Coronavirus Study Group consisting of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed this virus, which was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) This nomenclature is based on taxonomy, phylogeny, and established practice As on March 2020, WHO has confirmed 692,575 number of cases of COVID-19 with 33,099 deaths, which are distributed across the globe: Western Pacific region with 103,775 confirmed cases with 3,649 deaths;European region with 392,757 number of confirmed cases with 23,962 deaths;South East Asia region with 4,084 confirmed cases with 158 deaths;Eastern Mediterranean region with 46,392 confirmed cases with 2,813 number of deaths;America region with 142,081 confirmed cases with 2,457 deaths;African region with 3,486 confirmed cases with 60 deaths This paper focuses on these areas and regions and tries to find establish the relationship between numbers of deaths and number of cases with respect to the temperature This paper takes the study of specific areas around the world and also the case study of India to study the effect of temperature on the rise of and death due to COVID-19 virus ? 2020 IGI Global All rights reserved","output":"Impact analysis of temperature data on the increase in the count of infected cases of COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of obesity in the United States is increasing, with extreme morbid obesity of body mass index greater than 40 increasing twice as fast as obesity in general.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics data have been identified for patients with COVID-19, but mortality-related risk factors and a comprehensive clinical course of disease in a developing country have not been specifically defined. This retrospective, single-center cohort study involved all successive inpatients having a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with deceased or discharged clinical outcomes from 1 January to 10 May 2021. Data were extracted from electronic medical records on demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings as well as complications faced and treatment provided during follow-up, involving serial samples for viral RNA identification, and compared between the dead and survivors. To investigate the risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality, we employed the multivariate logistic regression model. In this study, 2048 patients were involved, 1458 of whom were discharged, and 590 died in hospital. More than half of patients were identified as male with old age being the potential risk factor of mortality. Exactly 94.8% of all patients presented with fever at the time of admission. Several comorbidities were present in the study population, with the most frequent comorbidity being cardiovascular diseases (1177 of 2048) and hypertension (975 of 2048) followed by cerebrovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Mortality rates for infected patients were observed as higher in severe patients (46.3%) compared with non-severe cases (26.1%) during a follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis showed a significant association of in-hospital mortality of patients with older age, presence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases as underlying comorbidities, increased level of cardiac troponin I and d-dimer concentration on admission, as well as septicemia and ARDS as a complication during illness. To minimize the risk of death in COVID19 patients, as well as the risk of severe complications, urgent public health measures should be properly planned and implemented on those vulnerable populations.

This study also aimed to discuss the possible pathogenesis of headache in COVID-19. Methods: Available articles from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched as of September 2 nd, 2020. Data on characteristics of the study, headache and COVID-19 were extracted following the PRISMA guidelines. Biases were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The cumulative prevalence of headache was calculated for the general population (i.e. adults and children). The pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) was calculated using the Z test to assess the association between headache and the presence of COVID-19 cases. Results: We included 104,751 COVID-19 cases from 78 eligible studies to calculate the global prevalence of headache in COVID-19 and 17 studies were included to calculate the association of headache and COVID-19. The cumulative prevalence of headache in COVID-19 was 25.2% (26,464 out of 104,751 cases). Headache was found to be more prevalent, approximately by two-fold, in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients (other respiratory viral infections), OR: 1.73;95% CI: 1.94, 2.5 with p=0.04. Conclusion: Headache is common among COVID-19 patients and seems to be more common in COVID-19 patients compared to those with the non-COVID-19 viral infection. No definitive mechanisms on how headache emerges in COVID-19 patients but several possible hypotheses have been proposed. However, extensive studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms.

MethodsA panel of serum samples from Boca Biolistics was utilized to assess antibodies following vaccination, consisting of samples drawn prior to vaccination, after the first dose, or at least 14 days after the second dose of Moderna mRNA-1273 or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines. Agreement between the two methods was measured and stratified by test evaluator and assay lot. ResultsAgreement between the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test (IgG) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay qualitative measurements at the different assessment points for both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 ranged between 97.06% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.67, 99.93) to 100% (95% CI 82.35, 100). Agreement of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test (IgG) with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay was not highly influenced by either lot or evaluator. There was a medium-to-strong correlation between the semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test (IgG) result and quantitative Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay in samples taken after both doses of the vaccines, with higher intensity bands being associated with higher total anti-S antibody titer (mRNA-1273, p=0.0019; BNT162b2, p<0.0001). ConclusionSemi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test (IgG) and quantitative Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay correlated well, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test (IgG) is helpful in understanding the immune response post-vaccination. The current data support the use of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test (IgG) in the vaccinated population. ImportanceSerologic assays are an essential tool for quality control of vaccines and to determine the response to vaccination. Although a correlate of immunity has not yet been established for COVID-19 vaccines, antibody titers after natural infection and vaccination have been associated with protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rapid point-of-care assays can potentially be of use in this context with advantages over centralized testing, such as speed and ease of use. The point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test (IgG) compared favorably to the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay with agreement rates above 97.06%, after one or two doses of Moderna mRNA-1273 or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2.

We assume that the resource is dynamically allocated following a certain score, up to the limit of resource availability. We adapt a greedy approach to the metapopulation framework, obtaining new scores that minimize approximations of two different objective functions, for two control measures: vaccination and treatment. Through intensive simulations, we compare the greedy scores with several heuristics. Although topology-based scores can limit the spread of the disease, information on herd health status seems crucial to eradicating the disease. In particular, greedy scores are among the most effective in reducing disease prevalence, even though they do not always perform the best.

World Health Organization (WHO) announced the official name of this disease 'COVID-19'. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate pain in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients who were followed in the ward of an infectious diseases department because of possible or confirmed COVID-19 between May and September of 2020 were included in the study. The Turkish version of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was applied. Demographic features, frequency, location, the intensity of pain, and response to analgesics were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 178 participants were included in the study. Ninety-one (51.1%) of patients had pain complaints and the mean pain score (MPS) was 2.282.81 over 10. Fifty-nine (56.0%) of participants with pain required analgesic therapy and 41 (80.3%) of them showed 50% pain relief with simple analgesics. Twelve of the remaining 18 who did not get enough pain relief with simple analgesic were taking their analgesics pro re nata (PRN) rather than around the clock (ATC). Pain frequency and intensity and mean hospitalization duration (MHD) were similar between confirmed and possible cases. CONCLUSION: Regarding the results, we conclude that pain is not one of the challenging symptoms and easily manageable in patients with a mild-moderate intensity of COVID-19. Our results were not enough to make a correlation between pain and the clinical course of the disease. Further studies are required for the evaluation of pain including patients in intensive care units.","output":"Evaluation of pain in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic forced many changes to the urology residency match process, including limits on in-person sub-internships and interviews. As a result, social media (SoMe) was poised to play an increased role as a mechanism for virtual interaction and information sharing. In this study we sought to better understand how SoMe was utilized by both urology residency applicants (RA) and program directors (PD), attitudes toward SoMe use, and whether SoMe use had actual benefits or harms in the match process. METHODS: Following IRB approval, surveys were sent to RA and PD via email and posted on the Google Spreadsheet Urology Match 2021. The survey collected demographic information as well as SoMe activity, attitudes regarding the utility of SoMe in the match, and match outcomes including interview offer rate (IOR, number of interview offers received / number of programs applied) and rank list position of the matched program. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 27. RESULTS: Of 528 registered RAs for the 2021 match and 142 PDs, 108 (21%) and 64 (45%) completed the survey, respectively. SoMe was used by 99% of RAs, but only 75% used it in the match. 78% of PDs use SoMe regularly. Both RAs and PDs indicated they feel pressure to use SoMe for professional purposes, 70% vs 50% respectively. Twitter was the most popular platform, used by 93% of RAs and 74% of PDs using SoMe. 37% of RAs and 58% of PDs felt that SoMe activity provided benefit to the applicant or program in the match process, respectively. Most RAs (59%) felt that SoMe helped them gain better insight into urology programs while only 27% of PDs believed SoMe provided them better insight into RAs. A significant correlation was found between RA perceived insight into programs and their frequency of both viewing and posting on SoMe (p = 0.00012, p = 0.004). Neither relationship was observed for PD. No significant relationship was found between SoMe viewing frequency, posting frequency or tweetorial use and the match outcomes of IOR and rank list position of matched program. Although only 5% of PD reported incorporating SoMe as part of their assessment of RA, 14% said an applicant's activity on SoMe helped their chances of matching to their program while 11% said an applicant's activity hurt their chances. CONCLUSIONS: SoMe, particularly Twitter, was widely used in the 2021 match by both RAs and PDs. A majority of RAs and PDs believed that SoMe use aided them in some way in the match process. Although PDs reported that RA activity influenced match outcomes in some cases, in the overall sample we did not find a relationship between the volume or type of RA SoMe activity with match outcomes.","output":"Does social media play a role in the urology match?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Atopic sensitization to the house dust mite (HDM) is associated with altered antibody responses to the nasopharyngeal colonizing bacterium Haemophilus influenzae and children admitted to the emergency department for asthma exacerbation have reduced IgG responses to HDM allergens.

Some of these genetic changes have caused amino acid mutations, including deletions, which may have potential impact on critical SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Considerable efforts have been made to categorize the amino acid mutations of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein along with certain mutations in other regions within the S protein as specific variants in an attempt to study the relationship between these mutations and the biological behavior of the virus. However, the currently used whole genome sequencing surveillance technologies can test only a small fraction of the positive specimens with high viral loads and often generate uncertainties in nucleic acid sequencing that needs additional verification for precision determination of mutations. This article introduces a generic protocol to routinely sequence a 437-bp nested RT-PCR cDNA amplicon of the ACE2 RBD and a 490-bp nested RT-PCR cDNA amplicon of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S gene for detection of the amino acid mutations needed for accurate determination of all variants of concern and variants of interest according to the definitions published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has been used with success in several viral infections before, it has become a treatment of choice. Medical literature is reviewed for the randomized controlled studies using convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. AREAS COVERED More than one type of neutralizing antibody against a specific microorganism may be found in both CP and hyperimmune globulins. To give a standard titer of a specific neutralizing antibody to a patient, a reliable antibody titration assay should be developed. It is challenging to test the efficacy of the CP and HIG therapies with double-blind studies. There is a difficulty in the standardization of the CP and HIG study groups, as patients use various additional therapies. Different amounts and titer of CP and HIG and different titer of CP are used in patients. This review discusses the current knowledge on the CP and HIG therapies used in patients suffering from COVID-19 disease. EXPERT OPINION The mechanisms of the cellular and humoral antiviral immune response to COVID-19 seem to have diverse characteristics. The antibody produced after COVID-19 disease and vaccination is short-lived. Thus, CP should be an alternative especially in patients with lymphopenia and primary/secondary antibody deficiency.

Cultural humility is a critical skill to utilize when engaging in cross-cultural conversations. We designed a simulation for pediatric residents to counsel on safe sleep and enhance skills in self-perceived cultural humility and preparedness when caring for diverse patient populations. Methods: We created a simulation for the second year and senior pediatric residents at a large academic institution focused on a co-sleeping parent and infant from the Burmese community. The Multidimensional Cultural Humility Scale (MCHS) was administered prior to and after the simulation. We also included additional questions regarding changes in knowledge and preparation in engaging in co-sleeping conversations across cultures. Results: Fifty-seven residents participated. Overall, the mean score of the MCHS significantly increased after the simulation, indicating an increase in self-perceived cultural humility. All participants felt more prepared to have conversations about co-sleeping and to engage in difficult conversations with diverse patient populations, and all learned valuable skills to improve care for future patients. Comments regarding the scenario noted an appreciation for learning more about the Burmese population and understanding new approaches to safe sleep counseling. Discussion: After this simulated scenario, residents reported increased self-perceived cultural humility, preparedness in counseling on co-sleeping, and skills to engage in difficult conversations with diverse patient populations.

RESULTS Fear of COVID-19 was significantly lower among patients (41% vs 57.6%; p = 0.007), as was fear of cancer (61.5% vs 85.6%; p < 0.001) and other diseases. The perceived risk of getting COVID-19 was lower among patients (25.2% vs 52.7%; p < 0.001), as was the belief of having been exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (18.1% vs 40.8%; p < 0.001). The physical component of QoL was better among the population (54.5 vs 43.8; p < 0.001); the reverse was true for patients' psychological well-being (44.6 vs 39.6; p < 0.001). The qualitative data supported such results, showing a reduced psychological effect on the patients with cancer compared to the controls. Various reasons explain this result, including the awareness of being treated for cancer and nevertheless protected against getting infected in a cancer center of public health reorganized to continue treating patients by protecting them and personnel from the risk of infection.

In normal TG, scattered satellite cells were TNF-alpha+ and in the DRE, TNF-alpha+ and/or low numbers of IL-6+ cells were detected. On day 3 after infection, foci of TG neurons with viral antigens were surrounded by large numbers of TNF-alpha+ and/or IL-6+ cells and low numbers of IFN-gamma+ cells.

In the TG, the most striking changes occurred with TNF-alpha, with respect to its source (satellite cells, Schwann cells and infiltrating cells) and the extent and long duration of its production. TNF-alpha was the predominant cytokine throughout acute and latent infection and even by day 30, numbers of satellite cells expressing this cytokine were three times higher than those in normal ganglia. Moreover, in the DRE, TNF-alpha was the only cytokine detected during virus clearance and again, its production continued, along with that of IL-6, on days 20 to 30, in both infiltrating cells and astrocytes.

METHODS: We present the first 2 years of data collected from a 5-year, prospective, cohort study of swine-exposed and -unexposed participants at 6 swine farms in China. We conducted serological and virological surveillance to examine evidence for swine influenza A virus infection in humans. RESULTS: Of the 658 participants (521 swine-exposed and 137 swine-unexposed), 207 (31.5%) seroconverted against at least 1 swine influenza virus subtype (swine H1N1 or H3N2). Swine-exposed participants microneutralization titers, especially those enrolled at confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), were higher against the swine H1N1 virus than were other participants at 12 and 24 months. Despite elevated titers, among the 187 study subjects for whom we had complete follow-up, participants working at swine CAFOs had significantly greater odds of seroconverting against both the swine H1N1 (odds ratio [OR] 19.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.55C358.65) and swine H3N2 (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.16C8.01) viruses, compared to unexposed and non-CAFO swine workers with less intense swine exposure. CONCLUSIONS: While some of the observed increased risk against swine viruses may have been explained by exposure to human influenza strains, study data suggest that even with elevated preexisting antibodies, swine-exposed workers were at high risk of infection with enzootic swine influenza A viruses.","output":"High Risk of Influenza Virus Infection Among Swine Workers: Examining a Dynamic Cohort in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has exposed the National Health Service (NHS) to the greatest challenge in its existence, highlighting the need for nimble, reactive and inclusive leadership.

Interfering with the interaction of viral antigens with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor is a promising strategy by blocking the infection of the coronaviruses into human cells. We have implemented a novel protein engineering technology to produce a super-potent tetravalent form of ACE2, coupled to the human immunoglobulin ?31 Fc region, using a self-assembling, tetramerization domain from p53 protein. This high molecular weight Quad protein (ACE2-Fc-TD) retains binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding spike protein and can form a complex with the spike protein plus anti-viral antibodies. The ACE2-Fc-TD acts as a powerful decoy protein that out-performs soluble monomeric and dimeric ACE2 proteins and blocks both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with greatly enhanced efficacy. The ACE2 tetrameric protein complex promise to be important for development as decoy therapeutic proteins against COVID-19. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 decoy is unlikely to be affected by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that are beginning to appear in variant forms. In addition, ACE2 multimeric proteins will be available as therapeutic proteins should new coronaviruses appear in the future because these are likely to interact with ACE2 receptor.","output":"A super-potent tetramerized ACE2 protein displays enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to detect fungal keratitis using in vivo confocal microscopy images, but its clinical value remains unclarified. A major limitation of its clinical utility is the lack of explainability and interpretability. Methods: An explainable AI (XAI) system based on Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Guided Grad-CAM was established. In this randomized controlled trial, nine ophthalmologists (three expert ophthalmologists, three competent ophthalmologists, and three novice ophthalmologists) read images in each of the conditions: unassisted, AI-assisted, or XAI-assisted. In unassisted condition, only the original IVCM images were shown to the readers. AI assistance comprised a histogram of model prediction probability. For XAI assistance, explanatory maps were additionally shown. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated against an adjudicated reference standard. Moreover, the time spent was measured. Results: Both forms of algorithmic assistance increased the accuracy and sensitivity of competent and novice ophthalmologists significantly without reducing specificity. The improvement was more pronounced in XAI-assisted condition than that in AI-assisted condition. Time spent with XAI assistance was not significantly different from that without assistance. Conclusion: AI has shown great promise in improving the accuracy of ophthalmologists. The inexperienced readers are more likely to benefit from the XAI system. With better interpretability and explainability, XAI-assistance can boost ophthalmologist performance beyond what is achievable by the reader alone or with black-box AI assistance.","output":"The Clinical Value of Explainable Deep Learning for Diagnosing Fungal Keratitis Using in vivo Confocal Microscopy Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to high-risk exposure of surgical residents to coronavirus, surgical residency programs have changed their training methods and working hours drastically. The purpose of this study is to find out the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on surgical residency programs and on the lives of surgical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 112 surgical residents of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, with a mean age of 30.5 years from all the departments of surgery using a self-made, validated 40-point questionnaire comprising three sections. The last section also included modified Maslach Burnout inventory. RESULTS: Of all the residents, 97 (86.6%) stated that their surgical hands-on duration is adversely affected by the pandemic. As for clinical exposure, 92 (82.1%) trainees responded that their clinical exposure is affected too. Among all the subjects, 69 (61%) were concerned about transmitting it to their family members and 43 (38.4%) affirmed on being afraid of dying because of their direct exposure. On the brighter side, the average number of working hours per week for surgical residents were reduced from 81.10  6.21 to 49.16  6.25 (p < 0.001) due to the outbreak. Modified Maslach Burnout inventory score was 8.33  2.34 after the outbreak, showing statistically significant reduction in burnout among the surgical residents (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The changes in the surgical residency programs amidst the pandemic has reduced the working hours, hands-on and clinical exposure of the surgical residents. Moreover, the situation has provided an opportunity to explore efficient methods of learning that can lead to lesser burnout. However, psychological burdens of surgical residents like fear of acquiring the infection should be appropriately addressed.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on surgical residency programs in Pakistan; A residents' perspective.

Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the current state of the road infrastructure, as we did in this research. The methodology consisted of field visits where information was gathered on the distribution of space so that ideal routes for pedestrian tourists could be ensured. We surveyed the state of the sidewalks, their physical condition, minimum widths, heights, their accessibility, and the presence of obstacles that block movement from one point to another. We also assessed the characteristics of the roads, safe crossings and signs, the current management of parking in illegal areas, and the system of public transport routes. The results describe the current problems, which are, firstly, the issue of poor pedestrian and cyclist mobility due to the lack of space available on public roads as a result of poorly parked cars and the placement of bollards.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From December 2008 to August 2009, a total of 26 patients consented for single incision laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were collected. RESULTS Our technique was successful in 19 out of 26 (73.1%) patients, while seven patients required the placement of additional trocars. None of the patients needed conversion to an open approach. Mean OR time was 45.9 min. The mean length of stay was 1.1 day. Only one patient had developed postoperative umbilical wound infection.

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.","output":"CT Scanning in Suspected Stroke or Head Trauma: Is it Worth to go the Extra Mile and Include the Chest to Screen for COVID-19 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uncertain rates of asymptomatic infections have raised concerns about potentially high rates of thus far undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections.

A review of the published literature reveals a strong focus on the stressors that originate within the practicum environment, rather than the students life outside the university and practice setting. This article reports on an Australian study, completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, of the university experiences of undergraduate women nurse students with family responsibilities. The findings reveal the importance of factors outside the university on the women students practicum experience and their ability to engage and achieve. METHODS: The study was qualitative, guided by Gadamers hermeneutic philosophy. Twenty-nine women students with family responsibilities (partners and children) were interviewed at two stages of their degree journey. Over 50 h of data were thematically analysed. FINDINGS: The themes family pressure and practicum poverty describe the impact of domestic work, family finances and practicum organisation on student stress, wellbeing, achievement, thoughts of attrition, and family tension. These findings are particularly pertinent to Australia and other developed nations where the nurse student demographic continues to age. An interpretation of these findings against the recent impact of COVID-19 on nurse education and womens life choices reveals the likelihood that these difficulties have intensified for women students with family responsibilities since the pandemic began. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Many developed nations, including Australia, are increasingly reliant on older women nurse students to maintain the future graduate nursing workforce. This change in nurse student demographic to the mature-age student requires a revision of the organisation of the nursing practicum. Recommendations to nurse education to improve practicum accessibility for women students who have family responsibilities include the application of a flexible and collaborative approach to practicum organisation and communication. Wider recommendations to Government include a revision of the way the nursing student is financially supported during the practicum.

No relationship was seen between either redeployment status and needs (P = 0.087C0.893) or difficulties (P = 0.092C0.864) nor training location and needs (P = 0.376C0.935) or difficulties (P = 0.110C0.921). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high rate of redeployment among fellows; however, this was not associated with their reported needs and difficulties.

It is urgent to develop new products to treat NSCLS. Gracillin, extracted from Reineckia carnea, Dioscorea villosa, and other medicinal plants, has anti-tumor potential with toxic effect on a variety of tumor cells such as NSCLC. However, the anti-NSCLC mechanism of gracillin is not completely clear. In this study, A549 cells and athymic nude mice were used as models to evaluate the anti-NSCLC effects of gracillin. The antiproliferative activity of gracillin on A549 cells was conducted by CCK-8, and obvious autophagy was observed in gracillin-treated A549 through transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the expressions of Beclin-1, LC3-II, and WIPI1 were upregulated, while the expression of p62 was downregulated in gracillin-treated A549. The further mechanism study found that the mTOR signaling pathway was significantly inhibited by gracillin. Accordingly, the PI3K/Akt pathway positively regulating mTOR was inhibited, and AMPK negatively regulating mTOR was activated. Meanwhile, LC3-II transformation was found to be significantly reduced after WIPI1 was silenced in A549 cells but increased after gracillin treatment. It also proves that WIPI is involved in the process of gracillin regulating A549 autophagy. At last, the anti-tumor growth activity of gracillin in vivo was validated in A549-bearing athymic nude mice. In conclusion, gracillin has anti-NSCLC activity by inducing autophagy. The mechanism maybe that gracillin inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway. Gracillin has the potential to be a candidate product for the treatment of NSCLC in the future.","output":"Gracillin Shows Potential Efficacy Against Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Through Inhibiting the mTOR Pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel picornavirus from commercial broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) has been identified and genetically characterized. The viral genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of >9243 nt excluding the poly(A) tail and as such represents one of the largest picornavirus genomes reported to date. The virus genome is GC-rich with a G+C content of 54.5 %. The genomic organization is similar to other picornaviruses: 5' UTR-L-VP0-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D-3' UTR. The partially characterized 5' UTR of >373 nt appears to possess a type II internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), which is also found in members of the genera Aphthovirus and Cardiovirus. This IRES exhibits significant sequence similarity to turkey 'gallivirus A'. The 3' UTR of 278 nt contains the conserved 48 nt 'barbell-like' structure identified in 'passerivirus', 'gallivirus', Avihepatovirus and some Kobuvirus genus members. A predicted large open reading frame (ORF) of 8592 nt encodes a potential polyprotein precursor of 2864 amino acids. In addition, the virus contains a predicted large L protein of 462 amino acids. Pairwise sequence comparisons, along with phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest percentage identity to 'Passerivirus A' (formerly called turdivirus 1), forming a monophyletic group across the P1, P2 and P3 regions, with <40, <40 and <50 % amino acid identity respectively. Reduced identity was observed against 'gallivirus A' and members of the Kobuvirus genus. Quantitative PCR analysis estimated a range of 410(5) to 510(8) viral genome copies g(-1) in 22 (73 %) of 30 PCR-positive faeces. Based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis, we propose that this virus is the first member of a potential novel genus within the family Picornaviridae.

We analyzed more than 300,000 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the region of the nucleocapsid protein associated with nuclear localization signals (NLS) are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals four distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS-associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March to July, during a period of stasis in terms of interregional diversity. Finally, beginning in July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.","output":"Ongoing global and regional adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The population is constantly exposed to pathogenic infectious agents.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been instrumental in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. However, as we ease restrictions, widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccines is essential to prevent its resurgence. In this work, we addressed the adequacy and deficiency of vaccine uptake within California and the possibility and severity of resurgence of COVID-19 as restrictions are lifted given the current vaccination rates. We implemented a real-time Bayesian data assimilation approach to provide projections of incident cases and deaths in California following the reopening of its economy on June 15, 2021. We implemented scenarios that vary vaccine uptake prior to reopening, and transmission rates and effective population sizes following the reopening. For comparison purposes, we adopted a baseline scenario using the current vaccination rates, which projects a total 11,429 cases and 429 deaths in a 15-day period after reopening. We used posterior estimates based on CA historical data to provide realistic model parameters after reopening. When the transmission rate is increased after reopening, we projected an increase in cases by 21.8% and deaths by 4.4% above the baseline after reopening. When the effective population is increased after reopening, we observed an increase in cases by 51.8% and deaths by 12.3% above baseline. A 30% reduction in vaccine uptake alone has the potential to increase cases and deaths by 35% and 21.6%, respectively. Conversely, increasing vaccine uptake by 30% could decrease cases and deaths by 26.1% and 17.9%, respectively. As California unfolds its plan to reopen its economy on June 15, 2021, it is critical that social distancing and public behavior changes continue to be promoted, particularly in communities with low vaccine uptake. The Centers of Disease Control's (CDC) recommendation to ease mask-wearing for fully vaccinated individuals despite major inequities in vaccine uptake in counties across the state highlights some of the logistical challenges that society faces as we enthusiastically phase out of this pandemic.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination on California's Return to Normalcy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to examine the association between coronaphobia and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine in the society.

RESULTS: The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 in our center was 11.0% (66/602), of which 18 patients died. According to different prognosis, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were divided into the survival and death group. A higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was found in the death group compared with the survival group. Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer (p < .05). More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer were independent risk factors for death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.439; p = .044; OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.026 to 1.875; p = .034, OR, 4.974; 95% CI, 3.315 to 6.263; p = .007, respectively).

Those high costs are amplified when the recommended screening approach is used, which requires separate testing of specimens from three anatomic sites (rectal, pharyngeal and urogenital). While individual molecular testing is standard of care (SOC), pooled testing may offer a cost-saving alternative. METHODS Using the Xpert? CT/NG assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) we tested urine, rectal and pharyngeal swabs for CT and NG in a high-risk cohort of participants assigned male at birth who reported sex with other persons who were assigned male at birth. Remnant specimens (0.34 mL from each anatomic site) were combined to perform a single 'pooled' test. We calculated positive and negative percent agreement between the pooled testing results with SOC Xpert CT/NG test results as the reference. RESULTS We conducted 644 pooled tests. Of those, 598 (92.3%) gave CT and NG results. The CT positive and negative percent agreement were 90.1% (95% CI: 80.7%, 95.9%) and 99.2% (98.1%, 99.8%), respectively.

In contrast, BCG stimulates long-term tumor-specific immunity that primarily depends on CD4 T cells. We demonstrate that BCG therapy results in enhanced effector function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, mainly through enhanced production of IFN-?3. Accordingly, BCG-induced tumor elimination and tumor-specific immune memory require tumor cell expression of the IFN-?3 receptor, but not MHC class II.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, distribution of which may indicate the risk of different human organs vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies investigating the distribution of ACE2 mRNA in human tissues only involved a limited size of the samples and a lack of determination for ACE2 protein. Given the heterogeneity among humans, the datasets covering more tissues with a larger size of samples should be analyzed. Indeed, ACE2 is a membrane and secreted protein, while the expression of ACE2 in blood and common blood cells remains unknown. Herein, the proteomic data in HIPED and the antibody-based immunochemistry result in HPA were collected to analyze the distribution of ACE2 protein in human tissues. The bulk RNA-seq profiles from three separate public datasets including HPA tissue Atlas, GTEx, and FANTOM5 CAGE were also obtained to determine the expression of ACE2 in human tissues. Moreover, the abundance of ACE2 in human blood and blood cells was determined by analyzing the data in the PeptideAtlas and the HPA Blood Atlas. We found that the mRNA expression cannot reflect the abundance of ACE2 factor due to the strong differences between mRNA and protein quantities of ACE2 within and across tissues. Our results suggested that ACE2 protein is mainly expressed in the small intestine, kidney, gallbladder, and testis, while the abundance of which in brain-associated tissues and blood common cells is low. HIPED revealed enrichment of ACE2 protein in the placenta and ovary despite a low mRNA level. Further, human secretome shows that the average concentration of ACE2 protein in the plasma of males is higher than those in females. Our research will be beneficial for understanding the transmission routes and sex-based differences in susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"A comprehensive investigation of the mRNA and protein level of ACE2, the putative receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in human tissues and blood cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper develops a new ensemble-based approach to point and interval forecasting, and focus on total electricity supply.

As the data includes the COVID-19 pandemic that affected countries in different ways, with some visible changes in electricity demand, the likely impact of unusual observations on this proposal is also examined. A comparative, multi-step-ahead forecasting with out-of-sample evaluation is conducted using several forecasting accuracy metrics and detailed robustness checks. The results endorse the strength and resilience of the proposed approach in delivering not only accurate point forecasts, but also reliable prediction intervals under different economic settings.

Although past evidence suggests some ways to minimize it, there are no easily applicable interventions that have been found to work in the increasingly polarized climate. This project examines whether irrelevant factors, or incidental happiness more specifically, have the power to reduce affective polarization (i.e., misattribution of affect or carryover effect). On the flip side, happiness can minimize systematic processing, thus enhancing beliefs in conspiracy theories and impeding individual ability to recognize deep fakes. Three preregistered survey experiments in the US, Poland, and the Netherlands (total N = 3611) induced happiness in three distinct ways. Happiness had no effects on affective polarization toward political outgroups and hostility toward various divisive social groups, and also on endorsement of conspiracy theories and beliefs that a deep fake was real. Two additional studies in the US and Poland (total N = 2220), also induced anger and anxiety, confirming that all these incidental emotions had null effects. These findings, which emerged uniformly in three different countries, among different partisan and ideological groups, and for those for whom the inductions were differently effective, underscore the stability of outgroup attitudes in contemporary America and other countries.

Of the specimens, 1107 (21.7%) were obtained from outpatients and 3995 (78.3%) from hospitalized patients. Of the patients, 2851 (55.9%) were male and 2251 (44.1%) were female, while 1233 (24.2%) were adults and 3869 (75.8%) were children (age range: 1 day - 93 years; median: 3 years). Respiratory samples were investigated for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A and B (INF-A, INF-B), adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV types 1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). All specimens were tested by both direct immunofluorescence antibody (DFA) and shell vial cell culture (SVCC) methods. In DFA assay the samples were initially screened by fluorescent-labeled polyclonal antibodies, and the positive ones were typed by using monoclonal antibodies (Light Diagnostics, Merck Millipore, USA). In SVCC, HEp-2, MDCK, A-549 and Vero cell lines were used for the isolation of viruses. In addition to these methods, real-time multiplex PCR methods (RealAccurate?, Respiratory RT PCR, PathoFinder, Netherlands and Seeplex?

However, a subset of aneurysms will fail to occlude following treatment and the factors that influence the efficacy of flow diversion remain uncertain. As smaller diameter PEDs inherently have greater metal density than larger devices, we elected to investigate whether PED diameter influences treatment efficacy when using a single device. We also evaluated other factors that may influence treatment outcomes with PED. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated all patients treated for an intracranial saccular aneurysm at our institution with a single PED at least 12 months prior to the time of data collection. Patients treated with multiple devices, adjunctive coiling, traumatic and fusiform target aneurysms, as well as patients with inadequate imaging follow-up (<12 months) were excluded. RESULTS 158 aneurysms in 124 patients (128 treatments) met the inclusion criteria for our study. 123 aneurysms (80%) were occluded over an average follow-up of 26.6 months.

Discovering an effective treatment for this disease, particularly in severe cases, has become the subject of intense scientific investigation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This study was conducted as a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. Fifty-nine patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatments were randomly assigned into two groups. One group received IVIg (human)four vials daily for 3 days (in addition to initial treatment), while the other group received a placebo. Patients demographic, clinical, and select laboratory test results, as well as the occurrence of in-hospital mortality, were recorded. RESULTS: Among total study subjects, 30 patients received IVIg and 29 patients received a placebo. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory tests were not statistically different (P > 0.05) between the two groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the IVIg group compared to the control group (6 [20.0%] vs. 14 [48.3%], respectively; P = 0.022). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that administration of IVIg did indeed have a significant impact on mortality rate (aOR = 0.003 [95% CI: 0.001C0.815]; P = 0.042).

However, very few studies have studied the accumulation of PAHs in corals. Information on dietary uptake contribution to PAHs accumulation in corals is especially limited. Here, we used Cavity-Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) to investigate the uptake rates and accumulation of a13C-labeled PAH, phenanthrene, in Acropora millepora corals over 14 days. Our experiment involved three treatments representing exposure levels of increasing food-chain length. In Level W, corals were exposed to 13C-phenanthrene directly dissolved in seawater. In Level 1 representing herbivory, Dunaliella salina microalgal culture pre-exposed to 13C-phenanthrene for 48 h was added to the coral treatments. In Level 2 representing predation, corals were provided a diet of copepod (Parvocalanus crassirostris) nauplii fed on D. salina pre-exposed to 13C-phenanthrene. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were calculated as appropriate for all organisms, and biomagnification factors (BMF) were calculated for A. millepora. We found that while phenanthrene uptake rates were not significantly different for the treatments, the accumulated concentration in corals was significantly higher in Level W (33.5  2.83 mg kg-1) than in Level 1 (27.55  2.77 mg kg-1) and Level 2 (29.36  3.84 mg kg-1). Coral log BAF values increased with food-chain length; Level 2 log BAF (6.45) was higher than Level W log BCF (4.18) and Level 1 log BAF (4.5). Coral BMF was also higher for Level 2 than for Level 1. Exposure to dissolved or diet-bound phenanthrene had no significant effect on the coral symbionts' photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) as monitored by pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) fluorometry, indicating the PAH can be accumulated without toxic effects to their Photosystem II.

ISSUE: Protocol changes were designed to reduce transmission of COVID-19 while allowing for continuity of care, but those changes also demonstrated that many policies surrounding opioid use disorder care in the USA cause unnecessary burdens to patients. In this commentary, we describe how current policies create and maintain fatal barriers to methadone treatment for people in rural communities who have opioid use disorder, and highlight how COVID-19 adaptations and more flexible methadone models in other countries can better allow for effective and accessible care. Reasons and ways to address these issues to create lasting solutions for rural communities are discussed. LESSONS LEARNED: We focus on three lessons: (1) methadone dispensing and take-home schedules during COVID-19, (2) telehealth services during COVID-19, and (3) international models in use prior to COVID-19. We then outline recommendations for each lesson to improve access to methadone treatment long term for rural communities in the USA. There is an urgent need to implement recommendations that maintain flexible approaches and address methadone treatment barriers in the rural USA. To achieve lasting health policy change and combat stigma about addiction and methadone treatment, there is a need for advocacy efforts that give voice to rural residents impacted by inequitable access to methadone treatment and rural-tailored educational initiatives that promote the evidence base for methadone.

The aim of this study was to understand whether the adaptations made to clinical trials by UK Clinical Trials Units (CTUs) during the pandemic have the potential to improve the efficiency of trials post-pandemic. METHODS: This was a mixed methods study, initially involving an online survey administered to all registered UK CTUs to identify studies that had made adaptations due to the pandemic. Representatives from selected studies were qualitatively interviewed to explore the adaptations made and their potential to improve the efficiency of future trials. A literature review was undertaken to locate published evidence concerning the investigated adaptations. The findings from the interviews were reviewed by a group of CTU and patient representatives within a workshop, where discussions focused on the potential of the adaptations to improve the efficiency of future trials. RESULTS: Forty studies were identified by the survey. Fourteen studies were selected and fifteen CTU staff were interviewed about the adaptations. The workshop included 15 CTU and 3 patient representatives. Adaptations were not seen as leading to direct efficiency savings for CTUs. However, three adaptations may have the potential to directly improve efficiencies for trial sites and participants beyond the pandemic: a split remote-first eligibility assessment, recruitment outside the NHS via a charity, and remote consent. There was a lack of published evidence to support the former two adaptations, however, remote consent is widely supported in the literature. Other identified adaptations may benefit by improving flexibility for the participant. Barriers to using these adaptations include the impact on scientific validity, limitations in the role of the CTU, and participants access to technology. CONCLUSIONS: Three adaptations (a split remote-first eligibility assessment, recruitment outside the NHS via a charity, and remote consent) have the potential to improve clinical trials but only one (remote consent) is supported by evidence. These adaptations could be tested in future co-ordinated studies within a trial (SWAT).

Community outbreaks were caused by novel introductions rather than a resurgence of circulating strains. Thus, local outbreak prevention requires strong border control and community surveillance, especially during periods of less stringent social restriction. Non-adherence to prolonged preventative measures may explain sustained local transmission observed during wave four in late 2020 and early 2021.

Twenty-four Cynomolgus macaques (CyM), were primed with replication-incompetent SIV DNA provirus and divided into three groups for the following booster vaccinations, all administered in the oral cavity: Group 1 with recombinant SIV gp140 and E. coli heat-labile toxin adjuvant dmLT, Group 2 with recombinant SIV-Oral Poliovirus (SIV-OPV), and Group 3 with recombinant SIV-MVA. Cell-mediated responses were measured using blood, lymph node, rectal and vaginal mononuclear cells. Significant levels of systemic and mucosal T-cell responses against Gag and Env were observed in all groups. Some SIV-specific plasma IgG, rectal and salivary IgA antibodies were generated, mainly in animals that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA, but no vaginal IgA was detected. Susceptibility to infection after SIVmac251 challenge was similar in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals, but acute infection viremia levels were lower in the group that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA. Non-vaccinated CyM macaques maintained central memory and total CD4+ T cell levels in the normal range during the 5 months of post-infection follow-up as did the vaccinated animals, precluding evaluation of vaccine impact on disease progression.

A simulated OSCE can aid examination preparation, but the COVID-19 pandemic prevented in-person simulation training. Therefore, we adapted our in-person simulated OSCE (SOSCE) as a Zoom-based telesimulation OSCE (ZOSCE), permitting examinees to participate remotely. Comparing this process with historical in-person SOSCE cohorts, we hypothesized that this telesimulation-based format would still be well received by the trainees as a substitute when it was not possible to provide in-person practice and formative assessment. Subsequently, the ABA proposed a virtual-format OSCE. Methods We conducted our 7-station ZOSCE according to the ABA content outline for all graduating third-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-3) in 2020. From a main meeting room, the facilitator paired each CA-3 with a faculty proctor, assigned them to their own breakout room for each station, and rotated standardized patients in. The faculty proctor observed the CA-3's performance in real time using an assessment tool with objectives graded on a 0-2 scale. At the conclusion of the ZOSCE, proctors reviewed the assessment tool with the CA-3 and provided personalized global feedback. Assessment tool scores were used to calculate performance data for the study group that were compared with a SOSCE historical cohort from 2017 and 2018. All parties completed a Likert-style evaluation specific to the ZOSCE. Results A total of 22 CA-3 residents participated. Mean performance scores ranged from 82.2%-94.9% (minimum = 38%, maximum = 100%). Compared with the historical SOSCE cohort, ZOSCE scores for 5 of 7 stations were not different, but scores in communication with professionals (P = .007) and ultrasound (P < .001) stations were lower. Overall, CA-3 participants rated the learning experience positively and felt it was a reasonable substitution for in-person simulation, with responses similar to those of a historical in-person SOSCE cohort. Conclusions A telesimulation-based practice ZOSCE for formative examination preparation for the ABA OSCE resulted in similar institutional scoring for most stations compared with in-person SOSCE, but some stations may be better practiced in person or require modifications. The virtual format may permit flexible scheduling during nonclinical times or for learners in remote locations. These findings have implications for future formative exercises and the formal summative examination process.","output":"Resident Preparation for the American Board of Anesthesiology Objective Standardized Clinical Examination: A Comparison of Virtual Telesimulation With In-person Simulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, researchers have looked to electronic health record (EHR) data as a way to study possible risk factors and outcomes. To ensure the validity and accuracy of research using these data, investigators need to be confident that the phenotypes they construct are reliable and accurate, reflecting the healthcare settings from which they are ascertained. We developed a COVID-19 registry at a single academic medical center and used data from March 1 to June 5, 2020 to assess differences in population-level characteristics in pandemic and non-pandemic years respectively. Median EHR length, previously shown to impact phenotype performance in type 2 diabetes, was significantly shorter in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group relative to a 2019 influenza tested group (median 3.1 years vs 8.7; Wilcoxon rank sum P = 1.3e-52). Using three phenotyping methods of increasing complexity (billing codes alone and domain-specific algorithms provided by an EHR vendor and clinical experts), common medical comorbidities were abstracted from COVID-19 EHRs, defined by the presence of a positive laboratory test (positive predictive value 100%, recall 93%). After combining performance data across phenotyping methods, we observed significantly lower false negative rates for those records billed for a comprehensive care visit (p = 4e-11) and those with complete demographics data recorded (p = 7e-5).

Interaktion. Organisation (GIO) displays central results of two empirical studies as well as resulting recommendations for action. The subject of those studies was the self-determination of work and working hoursin the sense of work (time) sovereign acting, which has been conducted on behalf of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Projektmanagement e.V (German Association of project management e. V.) in the years 2015 and 2020. Background of the article is the fact, that the continuous digital transformation increasingly changes the dynamic of knowledge-based work, as well as project work. Therefore, work sovereign acting becomes increasingly important and creates new demands from knowledge-based workers. The results of the studies shown in this article illuminate important aspects of the current design of work (time) sovereignty and in conclusion recommend steps for the creation of motivational work measures. The results of the studies show that sovereignty of work is widespread among employees in knowledge-intensive projects. Measured by potential characteristics of work sovereign activities (self-determination, less hierarchy, independence of time and place), many employees work largely or completely work-sovereign. In self-assessment it is an even larger proportion that classifies labour activity as sovereign in work. This tendency was evident in the first study (2015) and is confirmed in the current study (2020). The pandemic situation has influenced the degree of work sovereignty: employees currently work more independently of time and place and are more self-determined than before the pandemic. Structural changes on the organisational side, such as a reduction or flattening of hierarchies, are not associated with these changes. Results regarding employees show that social integration, the experience of competence and autonomy are central basic needs of self-determined action, which have a significant positive influence on their motivation and are related to self-perceived sovereignty of work. This is therefore an opportunity for organisations to significantly influence the level of action and thus the motivation of employees through measures at the structural level. Sovereign handling with their own work and working time is seen as meaningful as well as a recognition and expression of trust. As a result, the individual responsibility of the employees grows, which promises greater scope for actions. The structural change tends to be seen as positive by employees (2015 & 2020).","output":"Selbstbestimmung und Motivation bei der Projektarbeit C Eine empirische Analyse zum souver?nen Arbeitshandeln"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the availability of nutrition-related information and features on leading online grocery store Web sites.

This review is written based on the literature search using several databases, previous studies, scientific reports, our current knowledge about the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and our personal analyses on the potential of the antiviral peptides for the treatment of COVID-19.Areas covered: In this review, we begin with a brief description of SARS-CoV2 followed by a comprehensive description of antiviral peptides (AVPs) including natural and synthetic AMPs or AVPs and peptidomimetics. Subsequently, the structural features, mechanisms of action, limitations, and therapeutic applications of these peptides are explained.Expert opinion: Regarding the lack and the limitations of drugs against COVID-19, AMPs, AVPs, and other peptide-like compounds such as peptidomimetics have captured the attention of researchers due to their potential antiviral activities. Some of these compounds comprise unique properties and have demonstrated the potential to fight SARS-CoV2, particularly melittin, lactoferrin, enfuvirtide, and rupintrivir that have the potential to enter animal and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Antimicrobial peptides and other peptide-like therapeutics as promising candidates to combat SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To study the effect of interferon-2 auto-antibodies (IFN-2 Abs) on clinical and virological outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of IFN-2 Abs transfer during convalescent plasma treatment. METHODS: Sera from healthy controls, cases of COVID-19, and other respiratory illness were tested for IFN-2 Abs by ELISA and a pseudo virusCbased neutralization assay. The effects of disease severity, sex, and age on the risk of having neutralizing IFN-2 Abs were determined. Longitudinal analyses were performed to determine association between IFN-2 Abs and survival and viral load and whether serum IFN-2 Abs appeared after convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS: IFN-2 neutralizing sera were found only in COVID-19 patients, with proportions increasing with disease severity and age. In the acute stage of COVID-19, all sera from patients with ELISA-detected IFN-2 Abs (13/164, 7.9%) neutralized levels of IFN-2 exceeding physiological concentrations found in human plasma and this was associated with delayed viral clearance. Convalescent plasma donors that were anti-IFN-2 ELISA positive (3/118, 2.5%) did not neutralize the same levels of IFN-2. Neutralizing serum IFN-2 Abs were associated with delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-2 Abs were detected by ELISA and neutralization assay in COVID-19 patients, but not in ICU patients with other respiratory illnesses. The presence of neutralizing IFN-2 Abs in critically ill COVID-19 is associated with delayed viral clearance. IFN-2 Abs in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors were not neutralizing in the conditions tested.

This study investigated the effect and possible mechanism of duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB) to treat T2DM. METHODS: A T2DM rat model was established using a high-fat, high-sugar diet and a low dose of streptozotocin. DJB surgery and a sham operation (SO) were performed to analyze the effects on glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation changes. Furthermore, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the ileum and the markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the pancreas were examined after the surgery. The insulinoma cells (INS-1) were divided into three groups; group A was cultured with a normal sugar content (11.1 mmol/L), group B was cultured with fluctuating high glucose (11.1 mmol/L alternating with 33.3 mmol/L), and group C was cultured with fluctuating high glucose and exendin-4 (100 nmol/L). The cells were continuously cultured for 7 days in complete culture medium. The viability of the INS-1 cells was then investigated using the MTT method, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and the ERS markers were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The blood glucose, lipids, insulin, and TNF- were significantly elevated in the T2DM model. A gradual recovery was observed in the DJB group. GLP-1 expression in the distal ileum of the DJB group was significantly higher than that in the T2DM control group (DM) and the SO group (p < 0.05), and the markers of ERS expression in the pancreases of the DJB group decreased significantly more than those of groups DM and SO (p < 0.05). Compared with group A, the cell viability in group B was decreased, and the ERS and apoptosis were increased (p < 0.05). However, compared with group B, the cell viability in group C was improved, and the ERS and apoptosis declined (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DJB can be used to treat T2DM in T2DM rats. The mechanism may be that the DJB stimulates the increased expression of GLP-1 on the far side of the ileum, and then, GLP-1 inhibits ERS in the pancreas, reducing the apoptosis of ? cells to create a treatment effect in the T2DM rats.","output":"The Effect and Mechanism of Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass to Treat Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Rat Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: CHA2DS2-VASc score is used in non-valvular AF patients to predict thromboembolic risk. Recent studies have tried to evaluate CHA2DS2-VASc score on admission in COVID-19 patients to predict mortality. Methods: We conducted a literature search on 14 April 2021 to retrieve all published studies, pre-prints and grey literature related to the predictive power of CHA2DS2-VASc score in COVID-19 patients of admission and mortality. Screening of studies and data extraction was done by two authors independently. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for the methodological quality assessment of the included studies. Results: Five studies involving 5,941 patients reported the predictive value of CHA2DS2-VASc score for mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Although local drug delivery to the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries promises improved patency, data are currently limited. We hypothesized that improved percutaneous delivery of an anti-inflammatory compound into the adventitia of the femoropopliteal at the time of endovascular treatment would be safe, feasible, and decrease the inflammatory response. METHODS This was a prospective, investigator-initiated, phase I, first-in-man study testing the safety and feasibility of percutaneous adventitial delivery of dexamethasone. Following successful intervention, an adventitial microinfusion catheter was advanced over a 0.014-inch wire to the treated segment. Its microneedle (0.9 mm long  140-m diameter) was deployed into the adventitia to deliver dexamethasone (4 mg/mL) mixed with contrast agent (80:20 ratio), providing fluoroscopic visualization. The primary safety outcome measure was freedom from vessel dissection, thrombosis, or extravasation while the primary efficacy outcome was duplex-determined binary restenosis defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio >2.5. RESULTS Twenty patients with Rutherford clinical category 2-5 enrolled in this study. The mean age was 66, and 55% had diabetes mellitus. Treated lesion length was 8.9  5.3 cm, and 50% were chronic total occlusions. Eighty percent of treated lesions were in the distal superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. All lesions were treated by balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting (n = 6) for suboptimal result. Three patients were treated with atherectomy as well. A mean of 1.6  1.1 mg (0.5  0.3 mL) of dexamethasone sodium phosphate was injected per centimeter of lesion length. In total, a mean of 12.1  6.1 mg of dexamethasone was injected per patient. The mean number of injections required per lesion was 3.0  1.3 cm, minimum one and maximum six injections. There was 100% technical success of drug delivery and no procedural or drug-related adverse events. The mean Rutherford score decreased from 3.1  .7 (median, 3.0) preoperatively to .5  .7 at 6 months (median, 0.0; P < .00001). Over this same time interval, the index leg ankle-brachial index increased from .68  .15 to .89  .19 (P = .0003). The preoperative C-reactive protein in this study was 6.9  8.5 indicating severe baseline inflammation, which increased to 14.0  23.1 mg/L (103% increase) at 24 hours following the procedure. However, this increase did not reach statistical significance of P = .14. Two patients met the primary efficacy end point of loss of primary patency by reoccluding their treated segment of the index lesion during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Adventitial drug delivery via a microinfusion catheter is a safe and feasible alternative to intimal-based methods for adjunctive treatment in the femoropopliteal segment. The 6-month preliminary results suggest perivascular dexamethasone treatment may improve outcomes following angioplasty to the femoral and popliteal arteries, and support further clinical investigation of this approach.","output":"Safety and feasibility of adjunctive dexamethasone infusion into the adventitia of the femoropopliteal artery following endovascular revascularization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and posed an unprecedented threat to the global economy and human health. Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being administered to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an antiinfluenza drug, arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports indicate that arbidol could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with arbidol is found to be superior to lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir for treating COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, arbidol acts by interfering with viral binding to the host cells. However, the detailed mechanism through which arbidol induces the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the mechanism underlying membrane fusion inhibition by arbidol for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that arbidol binds and stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with the RBD than ACE2. Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between the RBD and ACE2 in the arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that arbidol could generate favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we propose that the binding of arbidol induces structural rigidity in the viral glycoprotein, resulting in a restriction of the conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion and virus entry. Furthermore, key residues of the RBD and ACE2 that interact with arbidol were identified, opening the door for developing therapeutic strategies and higher-efficacy arbidol derivatives or lead drug candidates.","output":"Unraveling the mechanism of arbidol binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2: Insights from atomistic simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Propositional proof systems based on recently-developed redundancy properties admit short refutations for many formulas traditionally considered hard.

Atherosclerosis is responsible for most cases of CVD. The plaque formation and subsequent thrombosis in atherosclerosis constitute an ongoing process that is influenced by numerous risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking, inflammation, and sedentary lifestyle. Among the various risk and protective factors, the role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the most common inborn enzyme disorder across populations, is still debated. For decades, it has been considered a protective factor against the development of CVD. However, in the recent years, growing scientific evidence has suggested that this inherited condition may act as a CVD risk factor. The role of G6PD deficiency in the atherogenic process has been investigated using in vitro or ex vivo cellular models, animal models, and epidemiological studies in human cohorts of variable size and across different ethnic groups, with conflicting results. In this review, the impact of G6PD deficiency on CVD was critically reconsidered, taking into account the most recent acquisitions on molecular and biochemical mechanisms, namely, antioxidative mechanisms, glutathione recycling, and nitric oxide production, as well as their mutual interactions, which may be impaired by the enzyme defect in the context of the pentose phosphate pathway. Overall, current evidence supports the notion that G6PD downregulation may favor the onset and evolution of atheroma in subjects at risk of CVD. Given the relatively high frequency of this enzyme deficiency in several regions of the world, this finding might be of practical importance to tailor surveillance guidelines and facilitate risk stratification.","output":"The Controversial Role of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency on Cardiovascular Disease: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Many antiviral agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, have been used to treat COVID-19, without being broadly accepted. QTc prolongation is a worrisome adverse effect, scarcely studied in pediatrics. Patients and methods Paediatric patients affected from COVID-19 who received antivirals were matched (1:2) with controls not infected nor exposed. Electrocardiograms were prospectively analyzed at baseline, during the first 72 h of treatment and after 72 h. Results Eleven (22.9%) out of 48 patients admitted due to COVID-19 (MarchCJuly 2020) received antiviral therapy. All had underlying diseases: congenital heart disease (4/11;36.4%) and immunosuppression (3/11;27.3%) stand out. 5/11 (45.5%) received treatment at baseline with a potential effect on QTc. There where no differences observed in the baseline QTc between cases and controls: 414.8 ms (49.2) vs 416.5 ms (29.4), (P = .716). Baseline long QT was observed in 2/11 cases and 2/22. Among cases, 10/11 (90.9%) received hydroxychloroquine, mainly associated with azithromycin (8/11;72.7%), 3 received lopinavir/ritonavir and one remdesivir.

At our center, mobilization of cardiologists with intensive care training was needed. Our aim is to describe the patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to a Portuguese ICU, the cardiovascular impact of the disease and the experience of cardiologists working in a COVID-19 ICU. Methods: Data from adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho between 16 March 2020 and 21 April 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Thirty-five patients were admitted. Mean age was 62.66.0 years and 23 (65.7%) were male. Dyslipidaemia was the most common cardiovascular risk factor (65.7%, n=23), followed by hypertension (57.1%, n=20). Mean ICU stay time was 15.910.0 days.

METHODS: Adult patients with rheumatic IMIDs from the Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Amsterdam were invited to participate. All patients were asked to recruit their own sex-matched and age-matched control subject. Clinical data were collected via online questionnaires (at baseline, and after 1C4 and 5C9 months of follow-up). Serum samples were collected twice and analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Subsequently, IgG titres were quantified in samples with a positive test result. FINDINGS: In total, 3080 consecutive patients and 1102 controls with comparable age and sex distribution were included for analyses. Patients were more frequently hospitalised compared with controls when infected with SARS-CoV-2; 7% vs 0.7% (adjusted OR: 7.33, 95% CI: 0.96 to 55.77). Only treatment with B-cell targeting therapy was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation (adjusted OR: 14.62, 95% CI: 2.31 to 92.39). IgG antibody titres were higher in hospitalised compared with non-hospitalised patients, and slowly declined with time in similar patterns for patients in all treatment subgroups and controls. INTERPRETATION: We observed that patients with rheumatic IMIDs, especially those treated with B-cell targeting therapy, were more likely to be hospitalised when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological DMARDs other than B-cell targeting agents is unlikely to have negative effects on the development of long-lasting humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Antibody development and disease severity of COVID-19 in non-immunised patients with rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: data from a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus caused significant outbreaks worldwide last year (2009).

The body temperature and weight of rats in each group were recorded after modeling. After treatment for 6 d, the concentration of T lymphocyte subgroup (CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+) was determined by flow cytometry. The OD value of IFN-/IL-4 was detected by double-antibody sandwich ELISA method, and its concentration was acquired through conversion. Results After modeling, the temperature and weight of rats in each modeling group showed the increasing trend (P<0.01). From the second day of treatment, there was significant difference in the body mass between groups, and the rat weight of the control group was higher than in the modeling group (P<0.05 or 0.01). With the advances of treatment, only the temperature in the medium and high dose Haoqinqingdan decoction groups declined significantly (P<0.05).

However, it is crucial to assess the impact of atmospheric conditions on air quality and air pollutant dispersion in the face of the potential variability of all sources. In this study, the impact of mobility restrictions on the air quality was analyzed for the most populous Brazilian State, S?o Paulo, severely impacted by COVID-19. Ground-based air quality data (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NOx, NO2, NO, and O3) were used from 50 automatic air quality monitoring stations to evaluate the changes in concentrations before (January 01 - March 25) and during the partial quarantine (March 16 - June 30). Rainfall, fires, and daily cell phone mobility data were also used as supplementary information to the analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the air quality data during and before mobility restrictions. In general, the results demonstrated no substantial improvements in air quality for most of the pollutants when comparing before and during restrictions periods. Besides, when the analyzed period of 2020 is compared with the year 2019, there is no significant air quality improvement in the S?o Paulo State. However, special attention should be given to the Metropolitan Area of S?o Paulo (MASP), due to the vast population residing in this area and exposed to air pollution. The region reached an average decrease of 29% in CO, 28% in NOx, 40% in NO, 19% in SO2, 15% in PM2.5, and 8% in PM10 concentrations during the mobility restrictions period compared to the same period in 2019. The only pollutant that showed an increase in concentration was ozone, with a 20% increase compared to 2019 during the mobility restrictions period. Before the mobility restrictions period, the region reached an average decrease of 30% in CO, 39% in NOx, 63% in NO, 12% in SO2, 23% in PM2.5, 18% in PM10, and 16% in O3 concentrations when compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, Cubat?o, a highly industrialized area, showed statistically significant increases above 20% for most monitored pollutants in both periods of 2020 compared to 2019. This study reinforces that the main driving force of pollutant concentration variability is the dynamics of the atmosphere at its various time scales. An abnormal rainy season, with above average rainfall before the restrictions and below average after it, generated a scenario in which the probable significant reductions in emissions did not substantially affect the concentration of pollutants.","output":"How mobility restrictions policy and atmospheric conditions impacted air quality in the State of S?o Paulo during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feedback particle filter (FPF) is a Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to approximate the solution of a stochastic filtering problem. In contrast to conventional particle filters, the Bayesian update step in FPF is implemented via a mean-field type feedback control law. The objective for this paper is to situate the development of FPF and related controlled interacting particle system algorithms within the framework of optimal transportation theory. Starting from the simplest setting of the Bayes' update formula, a coupling viewpoint is introduced to construct particle filters. It is shown that the conventional importance sampling resampling particle filter implements an independent coupling. Design of optimal couplings is introduced first for the simple Gaussian settings and subsequently extended to derive the FPF algorithm. The final half of the paper provides a review of some of the salient aspects of the FPF algorithm including the feedback structure, algorithms for gain function design, and comparison with conventional particle filters.

We sought to demonstrate that T1-map and CMR-FT may identify the presence of subclinical myocardial structural changes in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). METHODS Consecutive MVP patients with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and comparative matched healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled and underwent CMR-FT analysis to calculate 2D global and segmental circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) and T1-map to determine global and segmental native T1 (nT1) values. RESULTS Seventy-three MVP patients (mean age, 57  13 years old; male, 76%; regurgitant volume, 57  21 mL) and 42 matched control subjects (mean age, 56  18 years; male, 74%) were included. MVP patients showed a lower global CS (- 16.3  3.4% vs. - 17.8  1.9%, p = 0.020) and longer global nT1 (1124.9  97.7 ms vs. 1007.4  26.1 ms, p < 0.001) as compared to controls. Moreover, MVP patients showed lower RS and CS in basal (21.6  12.3% vs. 27.6  8.9%, p = 0.008, and - 13.0  6.7% vs. - 14.9  4.1%, p = 0.013) and mid-inferolateral (20.6  10.7% vs. 28.4  8.7%, p < 0.001, and - 12.8  6.3% vs. - 16.5  4.0%, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Similarly, MVP patients showed longer nT1 values in basal (1080  68 ms vs. 1043  43 ms, p < 0.001) and mid-inferolateral (1080  77 ms vs. 1034  37 ms, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Of note, nT1 values were significantly correlated with CS (r, 0.36; p < 0.001) and RS (r, 0.37; p < 0.001) but not with regurgitant volume.

As a sensitive drug to F. Solani, natamycin (NAT) was limited by the poor penetration and low bioavailability in clinical application. The aim of this study was to develop a new type of tri-block polymer nanoparticle-gel complex (Gel@PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT) for delivering NAT and evaluate its physicochemical properties, antifungal activity, safety, penetrability, adhesion, and efficacy in treating fungal keratitis. Methods PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT was prepared and characterized with a nano-particle size analyzer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), cytotoxicity, penetrability of NAT (Natacyn? 5% ophthalmic suspension; Alcon) and PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT with different concentrations were assessed. The eye surface retention time, ocular irritation, and curative effect of the NAT ophthalmic suspension and Gel@PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT on a rabbit fungal keratitis model were evaluated. Results PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT had a particle size of 150 nm, a positive surface charge, and a sustained-release effect. The MIC for F. Solani was 2 g/mL. A cytotoxicity test and ocular irritation test showed that PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT and Gel@PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT had good biocompatibility and no obvious irritation for rabbit corneas. Penetration experiments confirmed that PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT can successfully enter corneal epithelial cells and through the cornea to enter the anterior chamber. Compared with NAT ophthalmic suspension, Gel@PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT had stronger cornea permeation at the same concentration. The therapeutic effect and precorneal retention ability of the NAT ophthalmic suspension and Gel@PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT on the fungal keratitis rabbit model were compared. Gel@PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT achieved a better therapeutic effect at a lower drug concentration, and its eye surface retention time was significantly longer than that of the NAT ophthalmic suspension. Conclusion Gel@PLGA-PEI-PEG@NAT was shown to be a safe and effective nanodrug delivery system for NAT.

The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of the prevention and treatment of peri-implant diseases with this drug-delivery system. Minocycline hydrochloride was added to DDAs with different hole diameters, and then subjected to bacteria-inhibition tests in vitro with three oral bacterial strains, namely, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The implants were placed into the mandible of beagle dogs. DDAs with or without minocycline and normal healing abutments were installed. One week after surgery, the plaques on all the abutments were analyzed by plaque stain. Following this, both abutments and adjacent teeth received oral hygiene to maintain a healing environment. Eleven weeks later, the ligature-induced experimental peri-implantitis model was set up for eight weeks. Periapical radiographs and clinical measurements were performed during the process. We found that inhibition zones were observed surrounding all the tested drug-delivery abutments in all three bacterial strains. One week after implant installation, oral plaque formed on the DDAs with minocycline was significantly less than that on normal abutments and DDAs without drugs. DDA with the minocycline group showed a relatively slower rate of deterioration of the mucosal inflammation and probing depth in the experimental peri-implant lesions. We suggest that this drug-delivery abutment could effectively deliver medications into peri-implant tissues to minimize plaque formation and relieve peri-implant inflammation in the experimental peri-implantitis model.","output":"Roles of a new drug-delivery healing abutment in the prevention and treatment of peri-implant infections: a preliminary study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the rising popularity of standing motorized scooters in major cities in the United States, many hospitals are experiencing a surge of traumatic injuries associated with this new mode of transportation.

There is a need for a review for healthcare providers and policy makers on this topic. RECENT FINDINGS: Since its market introduction of rentable standing motorized scooters in late 2017, there has been an exponential rise in emergency department visits and hospitalization due to scooter-related trauma in urban hospitals. There have been a number of independent hospital-based and national-level studies describing demographics and trends of injury patterns in the last 2 years. SUMMARY: Patients presenting to the hospital with injuries tend to be young male between 20 and 40 years of age, presenting at night. Head and extremity injuries are common, and patients often do not comply with helmets and other protective gears. Intoxication is a major risk factor for injuries requiring hospital admission and surgical interventions. These findings increase awareness for (1) healthcare providers to recognize and triage high-energy injuries, and (2) policy makers to advocate universal helmet use, increase public safety education, and enforce road safety regulations to minimize the impact of these injuries.","output":"Common Injury Patterns from Standing Motorized Scooter Crashes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 infection (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) in Wuhan, China in the latter part of 2019 has, within a relatively short time, led to a global pandemic.

For example, the extent to which social media platforms contribute to enhancing public health awareness and prevention during epidemic disease transmission is currently unknown. Doubtlessly, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents a great challenge at the global level, aggressively affecting large cities and public gatherings and thereby having substantial impacts on many health care systems worldwide as a result of its rapid spread. Each country has its capacity and reacts according to its perception of threat, economy, health care policy, and the health care system structure. Furthermore, we noted a lack of research focusing on the role of social media campaigns in public health awareness and public protection against the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan as a developing country. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of social media platforms on public health protection against the COVID-19 pandemic via public health awareness and public health behavioral changes as mediating factors in Jordan. METHODS: A quantitative approach and several social media platforms were used to collect data via web questionnaires in Jordan, and a total of 2555 social media users were sampled. This study used structural equation modeling to analyze and verify the study variables. RESULTS: The main findings revealed that the use of social media platforms had a significant positive influence on public health protection against COVID-19 as a pandemic. Public health awareness and public health behavioral changes significantly acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of the use of social media interventions on public health protection against COVID-19 while taking public health awareness and behavioral changes into account as mediators should be helpful when developing any health promotion strategy plan. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the use of social media platforms can positively influence awareness of public health behavioral changes and public protection against COVID-19. Public health authorities may use social media platforms as an effective tool to increase public health awareness through dissemination of brief messages to targeted populations. However, more research is needed to validate how social media channels can be used to improve health knowledge and adoption of healthy behaviors in a cross-cultural context.","output":"Influence of Social Media Platforms on Public Health Protection Against the COVID-19 Pandemic via the Mediating Effects of Public Health Awareness and Behavioral Changes: Integrated Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonged periods of social isolation can have detrimental effects on the physiology and behavior of exposed individuals in humans and animal models.

However, there are no prospective investigations of the impact of household air pollution on perinatal morbidity and mortality. Our trial aims to assess the impact of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking to reduce household air pollution exposure on perinatal morbidity and mortality compared to usual cooking practices in Bangladesh. HYPOTHESIS: In a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial of pregnant women cooking with LPG throughout pregnancy, perinatal mortality will be reduced by 35% compared with usual cooking practices in a rural community in Bangladesh. METHODS: A two-arm community-based cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in the Sherpur district, Bangladesh. In the intervention arm, pregnant women receive an LPG cookstove and LPG in cylinders supplied throughout pregnancy until birth. In the control or usual practice arm, pregnant women continue their usual cooking practices, predominately traditional stoves with biomass fuel. Eligible women are pregnant women with a gestational age of 40C120 days, aged between 15 and 49 years, and permanent residents of the study area. The primary outcome is the difference in perinatal mortality between the LPG arm and the usual cooking arm. Secondary outcomes include (i) preterm birth and low birth weight, (ii) personal level exposure to household air pollution, (iii) satisfaction and acceptability of the LPG stove and stove use, and (iv) cost-effectiveness and cost-utility in reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality. We follow up all women and infants to 45 days after the birth. Personal exposure to household air pollution is assessed at three-time points in a sub-sample of the study population using the MicroPEM?. The total required sample size is 4944 pregnant women.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study conducted between June to August of 2020, we invited HCWs through social channels to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire inquired about demographics, factors related to burnout, and used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory scale to indicate burnout. A total of 646 HCWs participated. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of participants was 34.1 (9.5) years. Sixty-one percent were female. The prevalence of burnout among HCWs was 75%. Significant factors associated with burnout were age, job title, years of experience, increased working hours during the pandemic, average hours of sleep per day, exposure to patients with COVID-19, number of times tested for COVID-19, and perception of being pushed to deal with COVID-19 patients.

We performed a systematic review of the literature to summarise the evidence. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid and WEB of Science databases, major organisation websites and reference lists of published studies were searched. The quality of studies was assessed using the STROBE tool (von Elm et al., 1) Individual study data was analyzed using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of association between exposure (co-infection), patient outcome and results summarised using forest plots and tables RESULTS: Nineteen (19) studies from all over the world were identified and included in the review. Most of the studies 73.7% (14/19) recruited children 6 years old. Evidence on the role of co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive. In five out of eight studies, co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to general ward (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 - 4.4, p = 0.005; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1 - 7.7, P = 0.04; OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0 - 5.1, p = <0.001; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.4, p = <0.0001 and OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1 - 5.1, p = 0.34), one found it did not (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.4 - 0.9, p = 0.02) and the other 2 had insignificant results. Similarly on risk of admission to ICU, some studies found that co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to ICU (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4 - 5.9, p = 0.004 and OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 - 5.6, p = <0.0001), whereas others did not (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.75, p = 0.02 and OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2 - 0.6, p = <0.0001). There was no evidence for or against respiratory virus co-infections and risk of bronchiolitis or pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The influence of co-infections on severe viral respiratory disease is still unclear. The observed conflict in outcomes could be because they were conducted in different seasons and covered different years and periods.

The difficulty of obtaining lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples limits the utility of point-of-care syndromic molecular assays. We assessed the performance of the FilmArray Pneumonia plus panel (FilmArray PP) in nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Patients in the study included retrospectively consenting adults who attended the emergency department of Lausanne University Hospital between February 2019 and August 2020 for a community-acquired LRTI, with available NP swab and a high-quality LRT sample. These samples were tested with the FilmArray PP (cutoff of 104 copies/mL). Positive (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of FilmArray PP in NP swab were calculated, using (i) FilmArray PP in LRT sample and (ii) standard microbiological tests as reference standards. To assess the performance of a lower detection cutoff, NP samples were also tested with an in-house PCR (cutoff of 10 copies/mL) for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Overall, 118 patients were included. FilmArray PP in LRT sample and standard microbiology tests detected S. pneumoniae in 19/118 and 12/118, H. influenzae in 44/118 and 19/118, and M. catarrhalis in 14/118 and 0/118, respectively. Using LRT FilmArray PP as reference, PPA and NPA of FilmArray PP on NP were 58% and 100% for S. pneumoniae, 61% and 100% for H. influenzae, and 57% and 99% for M. catarrhalis. Using standard diagnostic tests as reference, PPA and NPA were 58% and 96% for S. pneumoniae, 74% and 87% for H. influenzae, and indefinite and 92% for M. catarrhalis. Using a lower cutoff on NP (102 copies/mL), PPA was 68% for S. pneumoniae and 77% for H. influenzae with LRT FilmArray PP as reference. FilmArray PP in NP swabs has a limited PPA for identifying the most common etiologies of community-acquired LRTI irrespective of the reference standard, preventing its use for withholding antibiotics. The PCR detection cutoff does not explain the low PPA. The excellent NPA suggests the use of NP PCR results for rapidly targeted antimicrobial therapy. IMPORTANCE Timely identification of a pathogen in patients with lower respiratory tract infections is of paramount importance to avoid inappropriate antibiotic prescription. We aimed to evaluate the performance of a rapid syndromic molecular assay in nasopharyngeal swabs for identifying the most common bacterial causes of lower respiratory tract infections in adults (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). Our data show that nasopharyngeal molecular assay has a good concordance with lower respiratory tract sample when positive but not when negative. A positive result is therefore concordant with a lower respiratory tract infection and can be used to target antibiotics. Nevertheless, a negative result does not have a good concordance, so it cannot be used to withhold antibiotics. Our findings illustrate the potential utility of these easily collected samples for the management of patients with lower respiratory tract infections.","output":"Utility of Polymerase Chain Reaction in Nasopharyngeal Swabs for Identifying Respiratory Bacteria Causing Community-Acquired Pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES Using the periodontal diseases classification published in 2018, this study evaluated the level of agreement among predoctoral and postgraduate students of different education levels and specialties in the diagnosis and treatment planning of periodontal conditions. METHODS Second-year (D2) and fourth-year (D4) dental students, postgraduate orthodontic students (OS), and periodontology students (PS) were presented with an anonymous survey of 10 cases, each with five choices of diagnosis and seven therapeutic approaches. The cases included a patient summary, photographs, radiographs, periodontal charting, and ranged from health to periodontitis. Consensus diagnosis, used as a gold standard, was established between two experienced periodontists. Diagnosis and treatment choices for each case were compared across educational groups using Fisher's exact test. The level of agreement among educational groups was assessed using a multirater kappa coefficient. RESULTS The survey was completed in 2020 with a 72.4% overall response rate (57-D2, 45-D4, 17-OS, and 12-PS). The overall level of agreement on diagnosis was fair ( = 0.24, p <.0001) with PS showing the most agreement ( = 0.55, p <.0001). There were tendencies to prioritize stage over grade and extent in assigning diagnoses and to overdiagnose disease severity and underdiagnose localized periodontitis. Nonsurgical periodontal therapies had the highest overall agreement ( = 0.63 for scaling/root planing and  = 0.44 for maintenance, p <.0001). Response distribution per case and per level of education indicated that PS more consistently agreed with the gold standard than any other group. CONCLUSIONS OS, D2, and D4 students demonstrated inferior agreement levels compared to PS, successfully recognized health from disease, suggested appropriate treatment plans, and tended to overdiagnose milder periodontal conditions.","output":"The new periodontal disease classification: Level of agreement on diagnoses and treatment planning at various dental education levels."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction and spread of emerging infectious diseases is increasing in both prevalence and scale. Whether naturally, accidentally or maliciously introduced, the substantial uncertainty surrounding the emergence of novel viruses, specifically where they may come from and how they will spread, demands robust and quantifiably validated outbreak control policies that can be implemented in real time.

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the role partners play in pregnant womens energy balance behaviours, and to identify barriers and facilitators to participating as a couple in a digital intervention to encourage healthy eating and physical activity in pregnancy. METHODS: A qualitative design combined online focus groups and telephone interviews. Three focus groups were held with men (n = 15) and one mini focus group (n = 3) and 12 telephone interviews were conducted with women. Participants were either in the last trimester of pregnancy or had a baby under 18 months old. Most were from more deprived population groups where prevalence of maternal obesity is higher. Data were analysed thematically. Barriers and facilitators to participating as a couple in a digital intervention were mapped to the COM-B model and the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified; partner involvement and support; partner understanding of good energy balance behaviours; couple concordance of energy balance behaviours; partner influence on her energy balance behaviours. Most facilitators to participating in a digital intervention as a couple fell within the Reflective Motivation domain of COM-B. Men were motivated by the desire to be supportive partners and good role models. Women were motivated by their belief that partner involvement would improve their success in achieving goals and enhance couple-bonding. Other facilitators included concordance in dietary behaviours (Physical Opportunity), healthcare practitioner recommendation, perceptions of pregnancy as ours (Social Opportunity) and feeling supported and involved (Automatic Motivation). Barriers were rarely mentioned but included potential for partner conflict, perceptions of pregnancy as hers and economic constraints.

We detected various viral genome replication levels in FMDV-infected cells. Large cells and cells with a high number of inclusions generated more viral RNA copies and viral protein and a higher proportion of infectious cells than other cells. Additionally, we found that the viral titer was 10- to 100-fold higher in cells in G2/M than those in other cell cycle phases and identified a strong correlation between cell size, inclusion, and cell cycle heterogeneity, which all affected the infection and replication of FMDV.

METHODS: A sample of 849 pregnant persons, representing all 50 states and 5 US territories, were recruited via social media advertisements to take a 78-item web-based survey between May and December of 2020. The survey items assessed prenatal breastfeeding self-efficacy using the valid PREP to BF scale, breastfeeding intention, anxiety with giving birth during COVID-19, concern for the baby being exposed at birth, and confusion with pregnancy recommendations during COVID-19. RESULTS: The sample, mean age 28.9 years, had a relatively high mean PREP to BF score (308.52  62.74; range 39C390). Over 95% indicated a plan to incorporate breastmilk into their infant feeding routine either exclusively (68.96%) or in combination (26.5%). Seventy-one % were not confused by safe pregnancy recommendations, while 50.7% were concerned or very concerned their baby would be exposed to COVID-19 at birth, and 63.3% indicated they were anxious or very anxious about giving birth during the pandemic.

For healthcare optimization, patient counseling, and care planning, understanding if COVID-positive patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery are at increased risk for perioperative adverse outcomes is of interest. METHODS: The COVID-19 Research Database contains recent United States aggregated insurance claims. Patients who underwent ankle fracture surgery from April 1st, 2020 to June 15th, 2020 were identified. COVID status was identified by ICD coding. Demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative complications were extracted based on administrative data. COVID-positive versus negative patients were compared with univariate analyses. Propensity-score matching was done on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Multivariate regression was then performed to identify risk factors independently associated with the occurrence of 30-day postoperative adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 9,835 patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery were identified, of which 57 (0.58%) were COVID-positive. COVID-positive ankle fracture patients demonstrated a higher prevalence of comorbidities, including: chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity (p<0.05 for each). After propensity matching and controlling for all preoperative variables, multivariate analysis found that COVID-positive patients were at increased risk of any adverse event (odds ratio [OR] = 3.89, p = 0.002), a serious adverse event (OR = 5.48, p = 0.002), and a minor adverse event (OR = 3.10, p = 0.021).

IgAN patients with positive sIgA deposition in renal tissues were screened by immunofluorescence assay. Patient salivary sIgA (P-sIgA) was collected and purified by jacalin affinity chromatography. Salivary sIgA from healthy volunteers was used as a control (N-sIgA). Expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-B, TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1 were detected in the mesangial area of IgAN patients by immunohistochemistry, the expression levels in patients with positive sIgA deposition were higher than that with negative sIgA deposition. Human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) were cultured in vitro, flow cytometry showed that P-sIgA bound HRMCs significantly better than N-sIgA. HRMCs were cultured in the presence of sIgA (400 g/mL) for 24 h, compared with cells cultured with N-sIgA, HRMCs cultured in vitro with P-sIgA showed enhanced expression of TLR4, increased secretion of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1, and increased expression of MyD88/NF-B. TLR4 shRNA silencing and NF-B inhibition both reduced the ability of HRMCs to synthesize TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1.

We reported the effective use of real-time geospatial analysis to identify barriers and gaps in COVID-19 vaccination in a minority population living in South Texas on the US-Mexico Border, to inform vaccination campaign strategies. We developed 4 rank-based approaches to evaluate the vaccination gap at the census tract level, which considered both population vulnerability and vaccination priority and eligibility. We identified areas with the highest vaccination gaps using different assessment approaches. Real-time geospatial analysis to identify vaccination gaps is critical to rapidly increase vaccination uptake, and to reach herd immunity in the vulnerable and the vaccine hesitant groups. Our results assisted the City of Brownsville Public Health Department in adjusting real-time targeting of vaccination, gathering coverage assessment, and deploying services to areas identified as high vaccination gap.

Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the more prevalent infections. RECENT FINDINGS The acquisition of infections in the tropics, including community-acquired pneumonias, has been described for several centuries. During recent decades some microorganisms have been disclosed as causative of the disease (Legionella pneumophila in 1976 and hantavirus in 1990); other microorganisms are real new pathogens that were not previously demonstrated to have a pathogenic role in humans (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus producing an outbreak in 2003 and H5N1 avian influenza virus producing an increasing number of human cases over the last few years). SUMMARY A number of microorganisms may produce pneumonia in people who live or have traveled to tropical zones. History, including geography and epidemiology, physical exam and complementary workout are precious tools for the diagnosis, therapy and prevention. Exposure to microorganisms in tropical areas may show different patterns. A high index of suspicion, detailed investigation of travel, exposure history of the patient, and a basic understanding of the incubation periods and distribution of the various potential pathogens are imperative for the diagnosis.","output":"Community acquired pneumonia in the tropics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the United States wrestles with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and concurrently confronts long-standing issues of racial injustice, it is more important than ever that criminal justice health becomes an integrated component of medical school curricula.

However, unintended consequences of TCZ therapy include reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), and worsening of hepatitis C virus (HCV). We set out to assimilate existing data for these complications, in order to help inform evidence-based risk assessments for the use of TCZ, and thus to reduce the risk of serious but preventable complications. Methods: We searched the global WHO database of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (VigiBase) and undertook a systematic literature review, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We generated mean cumulative incidence estimates for infection complications. Results: Mean cumulative incidence of HBV and TB were 3.3 and 4.3%, respectively, in patients receiving TCZ. Insufficient data were available to generate estimates for HCV. These estimates derive from heterogeneous studies pre-dating SARS-CoV-2, with differing epidemiology and varied approaches to screening and prophylaxis, so formal meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions: We underline the need for careful individual risk assessment prior to TCZ prescription, and present an algorithm to guide clinical stratification. There is an urgent need for ongoing collation of safety data as TCZ therapy is used in COVID.","output":"Risk of Reactivation of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Tuberculosis (TB) and Complications of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Following Tocilizumab Therapy: A Systematic Review to Inform Risk Assessment in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) present in the environment are a great threat to human well-being and the ecosystem.

Hence, in the current study, selected PhACs, heavy metals (HMs), and physicochemical parameters (PCPs) were measured from the surface waters of the River Cauvery during the pre- and post-monsoon. PhACs such as caffeine, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were detected in most samples, whereas topiramate, ibuprofen, and verapamil were found only in few stations. In contrast, the distribution of ciprofloxacin, atenolol, and isoprenaline was strongly influenced by the seasonal pattern (p < 0.05). PhACs such as loperamide, glafenine, erythromycin, and gemfibrozil were not detected during the study. Distribution of PhACs based on average concentration (ng/L) are, CBZ (205.62) > CAF (114.09) > DCF (28.51) > CIP (25.23) > ATL (18.86) > IPL (13.91) > PPL (11.26) > TCS (10.39) > IBF (7.34) > TPT (3.09) > VPL (1.16).

One way to increase uptake is to take advantage of environments outside of primary care which present easy opportunities for vaccination. This study provides a narrative review of hospital-based strategies in acute care settings aimed at improving influenza vaccination rates for adult inpatients. METHODS A search was conducted using Scopus, Embase and PubMed databases for articles reporting on hospital-based interventions aimed at improving influenza vaccination for adults. Studies published in English were included and descriptively analysed. RESULTS A total of 31 articles were included. Tested interventions included 7 standing order protocols (SOP); 4 reminders; 4 assessment/administration programs; 1 patient education program; 1 organisational-based program; 7 multi-component strategies and 8 studies comparing SOPs with other strategies. One article was included in both SOPs and reminders categories. Studies were published between 1983 and 2017 and conducted in the USA, Canada, or Australia. 18 studies reported statistical significance. Individually, each type of intervention showed success. SOPs were significantly more effective than other individual interventions, but multi-component interventions (which included an SOP) were more effective than SOPs alone. Three articles reported no significant increase in uptake attributed mainly to patient refusals, even with a strategy involving patient education. Only three studies tested provider-level strategies including hospital campaigns, hospital reward programs and interdepartmental competitions, and showed success. CONCLUSIONS Hospital-based interventions are an effective means of improving opportunistic inpatient vaccination. Suggestions for future research include organisational or system-based interventions; qualitative review of barriers and enablers to inpatient vaccination programs; and re-examination of outpatient settings for vaccine delivery. Most studies were not randomised or controlled; therefore, we also recommend additional RCT studies to confirm existing findings on individual strategies.","output":"A review of hospital-based interventions to improve inpatient influenza vaccination uptake for high-risk adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most important acute viral diseases of calves in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) are: 1.

Our aim was to assess the frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in COVID-19. Patients and methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies reporting clinical data about COVID-19 patients, published until 25th March 2020. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 patients complaining of GI symptoms. Secondary endpoints were the pooled prevalence of cases with COVID-19 positive stool samples, and of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We used random-effects model for meta-analysis. Results Thirty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis. Out of 4434 COVID-19 patients, the pooled prevalence of GI manifestations was 11.51% (95% CI : 8.16 to 15.35). The most frequent GI symptom was diarrhea (7.78% of cases ; 95% CI : 5.05 to 11.04), followed by nausea/vomiting (3.57% ; 95% CI : 1.87 to 5.80), poor appetite (2.39% ; 95%CI : 0.55 ; 5.46) and abdominal pain (0.78% ; 95% CI : 0.26 to 1.57).

It can be associated with post COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: To study the possible effects of COVID-19 on the hair growth cycle and the relationship between COVID-19 and acute telogen effluvium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study that had been conducted during the period from September 2020 to March 2021 years. Thirty-nine patients with post COVID-19 hair loss are confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing. Hair pull test was carried out to confirm the diagnosis and severity of telogen effluvium. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were evaluated; their ages ranged from 22 to 67 years with a mean and SD of 41.3  11.6 years with 36 (92.3%) females and 3 (7.69%) males. All patients with a diagnosis of ATE were enrolled in this study and had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; 15 (38.46%) patients reported mild symptoms, 24 (61.53%) patients presented with moderate disease, and no patient required hospitalization. They all experienced excessive hair loss within 2C3 months after infection. Pull tests were strongly positive (> 10C50% with a mean of 35% of pulled hair away from scalp).

Information on stroke care during the pandemic in Belgium is lacking. This study aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on acute stroke care in eight Belgian stroke centers. This Belgian study is part of an international observational and retrospective study in 70 countries and 457 stroke centers. We compared volumes of COVID-19 and stroke hospitalizations, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment rates, acute treatment time intervals and functional outcome at 90 days during the first wave of the pandemic to two control intervals (MarchCMay 2019 and DecemberCFebruary 2020). From March 2020 to May 2020, 860 stroke patients were hospitalized. In the same time period, 2850 COVID-19 patients were admitted, of which 37 (1.3%) were diagnosed with a stroke. Compared to the months prior to the pandemic and the same time epoch one year earlier, stroke hospitalizations were reduced (relative difference 15.9% [p = 0.03] and 14.5% [p = 0.05], respectively). Despite a reduction in absolute volumes, there was no difference in the monthly proportion of thrombolysis or endovascular treatment provided to the overall stroke hospitalizations. Acute treatment time metrics did not change between COVID-19 pandemic and control time epochs. We found no difference in 90-day functional outcomes nor in mortality after stroke between patients admitted during the pandemic versus control periods.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as potential key regulators of senescence. However, the role of lncRNAs in MSC senescence remains largely unknown. RESULTS: We performed transcriptome analysis in senescent human adipose-derived MSCs (hADSCs) and identified that the lncRNA LYPLAL1 antisense RNA1 (LYPLAL1-AS1) was significantly downregulated in senescent hADSCs. LYPLAL1-AS1 expression in peripheral blood was lower in middle-aged healthy donors than in young adult donors, and correlated negatively with age. Knockdown of LYPLAL1-AS1 accelerated hADSC senescence, while LYPLAL1-AS1 overexpression attenuated it. Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) sequencing indicated that LYPLAL1-AS1 bound to the MIRLET7B promoter region and suppressed its transcription activity, as demonstrated by dual-luciferase assay. miR-let-7b, the transcript of MIRLET7B, was upregulated during hADSC senescence and was regulated by LYPLAL1-AS1. Furthermore, miR-let-7b mimics promoted hADSC senescence, while the inhibitors repressed it. Finally, LYPLAL1-AS1 overexpression reversed miR-let-7b-induced hADSC senescence. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that LYPLAL1-AS1 rejuvenates hADSCs through the transcriptional inhibition of MIRLET7B. Our work provides new insights into the mechanism of MSC senescence and indicates lncRNA LYPLAL1-AS1 and miR-let-7b as potential therapeutic targets in aging.

However, there is no clear evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be different across SES in Portugal. This work identifies the COVID-19 worst-affected municipalities at four different time points in Portugal measured by prevalence of cases, and seeks to determine if these worst-affected areas are associated with SES. METHODS: The worst-affected areas were defined using the spatial scan statistic for the cumulative number of cases per municipality. The likelihood of being in a worst-affected area was then modelled using logistic regressions, as a function of area-based SES and health services supply. The analyses were repeated at four different time points of the COVID-19 pandemic: 1st of April, 1st of May, 1st of June, and 1st of July, corresponding to two moments before and during the confinement period and two moments thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty municipalities were identified as worst-affected areas in all four time points, most in the coastal area in the Northern part of the country. The areas of lower unemployment were less likely to be a worst-affected area on the 1st of April [AOR = 0.36 (0.14; 0.91)], on the 1st of May [AOR = 0.03 (0.00; 0.41)], and on the 1st of July [AOR = 0.40 (0.16; 1.05)].

STUDY DESIGN We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing the approach to testing at two academic centers in Northeast Ohio. The study period started with the inception of symptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 at both institutions in March 2020. Women younger than 18 years were excluded. The primary outcome was the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in symptomatic pregnant patients at both institutions. Our coprimary outcome was the additional positivity rate obtained from universal testing at the University Hospitals. The secondary outcome of interest was the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 screen positive mothers with screen positive neonates. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables with chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for proportions. RESULTS During the study period, 144 pregnant women with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were tested at MetroHealth of which 27 resulted as positive for SARS-CoV-2 (18.7% positivity rate). University Hospitals tested 392 pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 of which 67 resulted as positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positivity rate 17.0%). In the universal testing program at University Hospitals, an additional 2,870 tests were performed on asymptomatic pregnant women of which 30 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (1.0% positivity rate).There were no SARS-CoV-2 positive infants in our cohort, and all cases of maternal critical illness occurred in symptomatic patients. CONCLUSION Universal and symptomatic testing approaches demonstrated similar clinical performance within a single geographic region in obstetric patients.

This paper analyzes the nature of news articles reported in English newspapers of Pakistan, India, and the UKaccumulating 12,693 gender-based violence-related news articles. For the qualitative textual analysis, we employ Latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling and propose a Doc2Vec based word-embeddings model to classify gender-based violence-related content, called GBV2Vec. Further, by leveraging GBV2Vec, we also build an online tool that analyzes the sensitivity of Gender-based violence-related content from the textual data. We run a case study on GBV concerning COVID-19 by feeding the data collected through Google News API. Finally, we show different news reporting trends and the nature of the gender-based violence committed during the testing times of COVID-19.

It also stimulated extraordinary scientific achievement by bringing vaccines to the public in less than a year. In this article, we discuss the implications of current vaccination guidance for pregnant and lactating women, if their exclusion from the first wave of vaccine trials was justified, and if a change in the current vaccine development pathway is necessary. Pregnant and lactating women were not included in the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine trials. Therefore, perhaps unsurprisingly, the first vaccine regulatory approvals have been accompanied by inconsistent advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities around the world. Denying vaccination to women who, although pregnant or breastfeeding, are fully capable of autonomous decision making is a throwback to a paternalistic era. Conversely, lack of evidence generated in a timely manner, upon which to make an informed decision, shifts responsibility from research sponsors and regulators and places the burden of decision making upon the woman and her healthcare advisor. The World Health Organization, the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women, and others have highlighted the long-standing disadvantage experienced by women in relation to the development of vaccines and medicines. It is uncertain whether there was sufficient justification for excluding pregnant and lactating women from the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine trials. In future, we recommend that regulators mandate plans that describe the development pathway for new vaccines and medicines that address the needs of women who are pregnant or lactating. These should incorporate, at the outset, a careful consideration of the balance of the risks of exclusion from or inclusion in initial studies, patient and public perspectives, details of \\"developmental and reproductive toxicity\\" studies, and approaches to collect data systematically from participants who are unknowingly pregnant at the time of exposure. This requires careful consideration of any previous knowledge about the mode of action of the vaccine and the likelihood of toxicity or teratogenicity. We also support the view that the default position should be a \\"presumption of inclusion,\\" with exclusion of women who are pregnant or lactating only if justified on specific, not generic, grounds.

We present an approach for the determination of COVID-19 infection based on breath analysis. METHODS: A high sensitivity mass spectrometer was combined with artificial intelligence and used to develop a method for the identification of COVID-19 in human breath within seconds. A set of 1137 positive and negative subjects from different age groups, collected in two periods from two hospitals in the USA, from 26 August, 2020 until 15 September, 2020 and from 11 September, 2020 until 11 November, 2020, was used for the method development. The subjects exhaled in a Tedlar bag, and the exhaled breath samples were subsequently analyzed using a Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). The produced mass spectra were introduced to a series of machine learning models. 70% of the data was used for these sub-models training and 30% was used for testing. FINDINGS: A set of 340 samples, 95 positives and 245 negatives, was used for the testing. The combined models successfully predicted 77 out of the 95 samples as positives and 199 out of the 245 samples as negatives. The overall accuracy of the model was 81.2%. Since over 50% of the total positive samples belonged to the age group of over 55 years old, the performance of the model in this category was also separately evaluated on 339 subjects (170 negative and 169 positive).

Methodologies to document SARS-CoV-2 infection that have been used include immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy. In our review of studies to date, we found that SARS-CoV-2 in the kidneys of patients with COVID-19 was detected in 18 of 94 (19%) by immunohistochemistry, 71 of 144 (49%) by RT-PCR, and 11 of 84 (13%) by in situ hybridization.

The counties are Fairfield, Hartford, and New Haven. Existing research noted that people residing in highly populated urban and low-income areas are disproportionately affected by the pandemic and subject to health, heat, and cold stress-related problems. As a result, the study is motivated to examine outdoor comfort and thermal indices in the counties that account for over 75% of the population in the state. The specific aim of the study is to examine outdoor comfort and thermal indices a year before and during the pandemic to determine if the pandemic significantly affects outdoor occupants and their overall well-being. Due to lesser activities observed during the pandemic than before the pandemic, the research questions include 1) Does the pandemic year provide a more comfortable thermal environment for outdoor occupants than the period before the pandemic? 2) Does the period provide a cleaner environment with no thermal or cold stress to occupants than before the pandemic? The research approaches include the field data recorded in 2019 and 2020. The research also utilized observations and mathematical models. The findings revealed that the mean monthly temperatures varied from -3.2 degrees C to 25.2 degrees C and relative humidity ranged from and 62.6-70.7%. The study revealed cold stress in wintertime, especially in Fairfield. Heat stress is also noted in summertime across the counties. New Haven is more prone to heat stress than other counties because of some factors (such as climate change, lesser land area, higher incidence from solar radiation, etc.). Higher thermal indices are reported in 2020 (during the pandemic) than the indices computed for 2019 (pre-pandemic) which could influence thermal comfort, health, and well-being of people. The indices are strongly influenced by outdoor temperatures and dew-point. A combination of some environmental variables such as temperature and wind speed also have significant effects on the indices. The study recommends that the use of clean energy for running infrastructure systems would help in mitigating the impact of climate change in various locations.

It has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and improves glucose metabolism by potentiating insulin sensitivity and improving -cell function and mass. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is induced by the deposition of amyloid-beta (A) in the hippocampus and the formation of neurotoxic A plaques. The A deposition is associated with increased formation of A from amyloid precursor protein by up-regulation of -secretase and -site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Furthermore, A accumulation is increased by brain insulin resistance. The impairment of insulin/IGF-1 signaling mainly in the hippocampus and brain insulin resistance is connected to signals originating in the liver and gut microbiota, known as the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis. This indicates that the changes in the production of short-chain fatty acids by the gut microbiota and pro-inflammatory cytokines can alter insulin resistance in the liver and brain. Luteolin is detected in the brain tissues after passing through the blood-brain barrier, where it can directly influence neuroinflammation and brain insulin resistance and modulate A deposition. Luteolin (10-70 mg/kg bw for rodents) can modulate the systemic and brain insulin resistance, and it suppresses AD development directly, and it influences A deposition by activation of the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis. In this review, we evaluate the potential of luteolin to mitigate two potential causes of AD, neuroinflammatory processes, and disruption of glucose metabolism in the brain. This review suggests that luteolin intake can enhance brain insulin resistance and neuroinflammation, directly and indirectly, to protect against the development of Alzheimer's-like disease, and the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis is mainly involved in the indirect pathway.

Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and included the years 2011-2018. Data for 2019-2020 were not available because of COVID. A multistage random sampling strategy was employed. Specifically, individual sample weights and randomly selected clusters and strata were used with each statistical model, allowing the results to be generalized to the US adult population. Results: Mean (SE) 10-year weight gain was 4.2  0.2 kg or 6.6  0.2% of initial body weight. A total of 51% of the participants gained 5% or more body weight, 36% gained 10% or more, and 16% gained 20% or more across the 10-years. Age was linearly and inversely associated with 10-year weight gain, expressed in kg (F = 166.4, P < 0.0001) or percent weight gain (F = 246.9, P < 0.0001), after adjusting for sex and race. For each 1-year increase in age, 10-year weight gain decreased by 0.20  0.02 kg and 0.28  0.02 percent. After adjusting for age and race, 10-year weight gain (kg) was significantly greater (F = 73.6, P < 0.0001) in women (5.4  0.3) than in men (2.6  0.2). Weight gain also differed across races, kg (F = 27.7, P < 0.0001) and % (F = 28.5, P < 0.0001). Non-Hispanic Blacks gained more weight and NH Asians gained less weight than the other races. Conclusion: Without question, 10-year weight gain is a serious problem within the US adult population. Younger adults, women, and Non-Hispanic Blacks, particularly Black women, seem to experience the highest levels of 10-year weight gain. Consequently, obesity and weight gain prevention programs focusing on these at-risk individuals should be a public health priority.","output":"10-Year Weight Gain in 13,802 US Adults: The Role of Age, Sex, and Race"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is necessary to assess the cellular, molecular, and pathogenetic characteristics of COVID-19 and attention is required to understand highly effective gene targets and mechanisms. In this study, we suggest understandings into the fundamental pathogenesis of COVID-19 through gene expression analyses using the microarray data set GSE156445 publicly reachable at NIH/NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. The data set consists of MCF7 which is a human breast cancer cell line with estrogen, progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors. The cell lines treated with different quantities of Cissampelos pareira (Cipa). Cipa is a traditional medicinal plant which would possess an antiviral potency in preventing viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: Utilizing Biobase, GEOquery, gplots packages in R studio, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The gene ontology (GO) of pathway enrichments employed by utilizing DAVID and KEGG enrichment analyses were studied. We further constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed, based upon that, a subnetwork module analysis for significant signaling pathways. Results: The study identified 418 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatics tools. The gene ontology of pathway enrichments employed by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of down-regulated and up-regulated DEGs were studied.

ABSTRACT: Aims: Myocardial abnormalities are common during COVID-19 infection and recovery. We examined left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular longitudinal strain in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and assessed the correlation with exercise capacity. Methods and results: One hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients with history of COVID-19 disease who had been referred to rest or stress echocardiography because of symptoms, mainly dyspnea and chest pain, were included in the study. These patients were compared to 106 patients with similar age, symptoms, and risk factor profile with no history of COVID-19 disease. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters, including strain imaging, were assessed. The patients age was 48  12 years. Twenty-two patients had undergone severe disease. There were no differences in the LV ejection fraction and diastolic function between the groups. However, LV and RV global and free wall strain were significantly lower (in absolute numbers) in patients who had recovered form COVID-19 infection (?20.41  2.32 vs ?19.39  3.36, p = 0.001, ?23.69  3.44 vs ?22.09  4.20, p = 0.001 and ?27.24  4.7 vs ?25.43  4.93, p = 0.021, respectively). Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) < ?20% was present in only 37% of post COVID-19 patients. Sixty-four patients performed exercise echocardiography. Patients with GLS < ?20% had higher exercise capacity with higher peak metabolic equivalent and exercise time compared to patients with GLS  ?20% (12.6  2 vs 10  2.5 METss and 8:00  2:08 vs 6:24  2:03 min, p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Conclusion: In patients, who had recovered from COVID-19 infection, both LV and RV strain are significantly lower compared to control patients. The exercise capacity of these patients correlates with LV strain values. Rest and stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms after COVID-19 infection may identify patients that need further follow up to avoid long term complications of the disease.

With rapid sociodemographic changes globally, and the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to revisit the disease burden of RID. Using the approaches of life table and cause-eliminated life table based on data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), the study analyses loss of LE due to RID in 195 countries/territories and its changes during the period 1990C2017. Results indicate that loss of LE due to RID stood at 1.29 years globally in 2017 globally and varied widely by age, gender, and geographic location, with men, elderly people, and populations in middle/low income countries/territories suffering a disproportionately high loss of LE due to RID. Additionally, loss of LE due to RID decreased remarkably by 0.97 years globally during the period 1990C2017 but increased slightly among populations older than 70 years and in many high income countries/territories. Results suggest that RID still pose a severe threat for population and public health, and that amid dramatic sociodemographic changes globally, the disease burden of RID may resurge.

Subsequently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Feb 12, 2020, more than 44,000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed in China and continue to expand. Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China have launched first-level response to major public health emergencies one after another from Jan 23.2020, which means restricting movement of people among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP) cases and to depict the effect of restricting population movement. Methods: : Excel 2010 was used to demonstrate the temporal distribution at the day level and SPSS 23.0 was used to analyze the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed NCP cases. Results: : Since January 23, 2020, Wuhan migration scale index has dropped significantly and since January 26, 2020, Hubei province migration scale index has dropped significantly. New confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Wuhan gradually increased since January 24, 2020, and showed a downward trend from February 6, 2020. New confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Hubei province gradually increased since January 24, 2020, and maintained at a high level from January 24, 2020 to February 4, 2020, then showed a downward trend. Wuhan emigration scale index from January 9 to January 22, January 10 to January 23 and January 11 to January 24 was correlated with the number of new confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Wuhan from January 22 to February 4. Hubei province emigration scale index from January 10 to January 23 and January 11 to January 24 was correlated with the number of new confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Hubei province from January 22 to February 4. Conclusions: : People who left Wuhan from January 9 to January 22 may lead to the outbreak in China except Wuhan and people who left Hubei province from January 10 to January 24 may lead to the outbreak in China except Hubei province.

We estimated basic reproduction number and transition probabilities between health states based on reported cases. Our model demonstrates that both the time of initiating an intervention and its effectiveness had a very large impact on controlling the epidemic, and the current Chinese intense social distancing intervention has reduced the impact substantially but would have been even more effective had it started earlier. The optimal duration of the control measures to avoid resurgence was estimated to be 2 months, although would need to be longer under less effective controls.","output":"Investigating time, strength, and duration of measures in controlling the spread of COVID-19 using a networked meta-population model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We sought to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the clinical exposure of pediatric interns to common pediatric inpatient diagnoses. METHODS We analyzed electronic medical record data to compare intern clinical exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic from June 2020 through February 2021 with the same academic blocks from 2017 to 2020. We attributed patients to each pediatric intern on the basis of notes written during their pediatric hospital medicine rotation to compare intern exposures with common inpatient diagnoses before and during the pandemic. We compared the median number of notes written per intern per block overall, as well as for each common inpatient diagnosis. RESULTS Median counts of notes written per intern per block were significantly reduced in the COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (96 [interquartile range (IQR): 81-119)] vs 129 [IQR: 110-160]; P < .001). Median intern notes per block was lower in the COVID-19 group for all months except February 2021. Although the median number of notes for many common inpatient diagnoses was significantly reduced, they were higher for mental health (4 [IQR: 2-9] vs 2 [IQR: 1-6]; P < .001) and suicidality (4.5 [IQR: 2-8] vs 0 [IQR: 0-2]; P < .001). Median shifts worked per intern per block was also reduced in the COVID-19 group (22 [IQR: 21-23] vs 23 [IQR: 22-24]; P < .001).

Multiple reports have shown subjective loss of taste and smell as an early and hallmark symptom for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in our clinical practice during July 2020 on patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction. All patients were categorized into 3 groups (supertasters, tasters, and nontasters) via taste sensitivity to phenylthiocarbamide, thiourea, and sodium benzoate with taste strip testing. The results of the taste strip tests were correlated with clinical course. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (mean, 51 [range, 24-82] years of age; 44 [44%] women) were assessed. We found that 21 of 100 (21%) were nontasters, 79 of 100 (79%) were tasters, and 0 of 100 (0%) were supertasters (p < 0.001). Twenty-one of 21 (100%) (p < 0.001) of the patients requiring inpatient admission were classified as nontasters. All 79 (100%) (p < 0.001) of the patients who displayed mild to moderate symptoms not requiring admission were classified as tasters. CONCLUSION: Our results show objective data that taste disturbance, specifically global loss of taste, appears to correlate with the clinical course specific to each individual, because 100% of the patients requiring inpatient admission were classified as nontasters.","output":"Does phenotypic expression of bitter taste receptor T2R38 show association with COVID-19 severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019 a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan China, and on 11th March 2020 the World Health Organisation declared it to have developed pandemic status. In early SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral titres of greater than 107/mL in saliva and nasal mucous can be found;minimisation of these titres should help to reduce cross infection. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) disinfectant has better anti-viral activity than other antiseptics and has already been proven to be an extremely effective virucide in vitro against severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Its in vivo virucidal activity is unknown, but it retains its antimicrobial activity against bacteria in vivo intraorally and one application can reduce oral microbial flora for greater than 3 hours. PVP-I disinfectant has been shown to be safe when administered to the nasal cavity and as a mouthwash. We propose a protocolised intra-nasal and oral application of PVP-I for both patients and their attendant healthcare workers (HCWs) during the current COVID-19 pandemic to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to healthcare workers and vice versa. The aim is to reduce the viral load in two of the key areas from where droplets and aerosols containing the virus are expectorated (the lower respiratory tract being the other). The aim of use in HCWs is to destroy virus that has entered the upper aerodigestive tract before it has the opportunity to infect the host. We suggest the protocol is considered for routine use during the care of COVID-19 patients, particularly before any procedure that involves the upper aerodigestive tract, including intubation, nasal and oral procedures, endoscopy and bronchoscopy. We suggest it should be considered when such procedures are carried out in all patients during the pandemic regardless of COVID-19 status, due to the reported significant rates of asymptomatic infection The total iodine exposure proposed is well within previously recorded safe limits in those without contraindications to its use. The intervention is inexpensive, low risk and potentially easy to deploy at scale globally.We acknowledge that the proposal we present extrapolates in vitro finding into the in vivo setting and that assumptions are made that under normal circumstances we would confirm with in vivo data prior to recommendations for use. However, given the strength of in vitro evidence and the low risk, minimal cost and global applicability of the proposed intervention, which amounts to disinfection of the oro/nasal cavities, we feel that there is little to lose and potentially much to gain.","output":"The Use of Povidone Iodine Nasal Spray and Mouthwash During the Current COVID-19 Pandemic May Reduce Cross Infection and Protect Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A critical shortage of respirators, masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) exists across all sectors of society afflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic, placing medical staff and service workers at heightened risk and hampering efforts to reduce transmission rates. Of particular need are the N95 medical face respirators that filter 95% of all airborne particles at and above 0.3 um in diameter, many of which use meltblown microfibers of charged polypropylene (e.g, the 3M 8200). An intensive search is underway to find reliable methods to lengthen the useful life of these normally disposable units. It is currently believed that these masks and respirators cannot be cleaned with 70 to 75% alcohol-water solutions, as past wet/dry experiments show that filtration efficiency can drop by ~40% after the first such treatment. This has been interpreted as the liquids disrupting the surface charge on the fibers and has led to a recent CDC/NIOSH advisory against using alcohol for their decontamination. We have replicated the drop in efficiency after alcohol treatment. However, we find that the efficiency can be recovered by more effective drying, which we achieve with a vacuum chamber. Drying at pressures of < ~6 mBar (0.6 kPa) restores the measured filtering efficiency to within 2% or so of the pre-washing value, which we have sustained for 5 cleaning-drying cycles so far in three models of N95 masks. The mechanism seems to be the removal of water molecules adsorbed on the fiber surfaces, a hypothesis which is supported by two independent observations: (A) the filtering efficiency increases non-linearly with the weight loss during drying, and (B) filtration efficiency shows an abrupt recovery as the vacuum pressure drops from 13 to 6 mBar, the range physically attributable to the removal of adsorbed water. These results are not compatible with the electrostatic discharge hypothesis, and rather suggest that water molecules adsorbed to the fiber surface are reducing the filtration efficiency via surface tension interactions (e.g., wicking between the fibers and coating their surfaces with a film). Such a degradation mechanism has two implications: (A) Respirators decontaminated by a soak in 70% v/v ethanol regain their filtration efficiency once they are fully dry. We employ vacuum chambers in this study, which are inexpensive and commonly available. (B) This mechanism presents the possibility that mask filtration performance may be subject to degradation by other sources of moisture, and that the mask would continue to be compromised even if it appears dry. The mask would need to be vacuum-dried to restore its performance. This study introduces a number of methods which could be developed and validated for use in resource-limited settings. As the pandemic spreads to rural areas and developing nations, these would allow for local efforts to decontaminate, restore, monitor, and test medical masks.","output":"An Efficient Ethanol-Vacuum Method for the Decontamination and Restoration of Polypropylene Microfiber Medical Masks & Respirators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacists' roles and training have evolved to prepare pharmacists to provide clinical patient care services as part of interdisciplinary teams in primary care settings.

Objective: The objective of this review is to summarize the current literature on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their newborns. Evidence Acquisition: The search terms COVID-19 and pregnancy were used in Medline and Clinical Key databases. Only articles written in English with outcome data on both mothers and their newborns were incorporated. Results: Pregnant women generally experience COVID-19 as a mild-moderate illness. However, approximately 5% become critically ill. Women with underlying comorbidities seem more likely to experience severe morbidity. Newborns also generally have a favorable course. Vertical transmission in the intrauterine period is possible but rare. Infection control measures need to be taken to prevent transmission during the peripartum period. There is a paucity of data on infections in the first and second trimesters, but research from those infected in the third trimester indicates a possible link with preterm birth. There is a significant percentage of asymptomatic cases. Racial disparities are also being noted with disproportionate numbers of racial/ethnic minorities being affected. Conclusions: COVID-19 is generally experienced by pregnant women and their newborns as a mild to moderate illness, although a minority become critically ill and mortality does occur. This is more likely among those with underlying comorbidities, as in the general population. Asymptomatic cases heighten the need for increased testing and infection control measures.

This study aims to calculate the PA levels of individuals with and without physical disabilities in Saudi Arabia, their assessment of the environmental (EQoL), and the predictive role of EQoL in PA. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the EQoL domain in standardized WHOQoL Questionnaire were administered on both groups of the population. The study sample comprised 116 individuals with physical disabilities and 243 individuals without any form of disability as a control group. A regression analysis was performed to analyze the predictors of PA in both groups. Findings showed that among the individuals with disabilities, older people were more likely to engage in PA as compared to the younger age group (p < 0.05) and males were significantly less likely to meet the PA criteria. Some of the EQoL features such as safety increased the likelihood of PA up to 2.3 times (p < 0.05) in individuals with physical disabilities. In addition, opportunities for leisure activities were a significant predictor of PA among both groups of individuals with and without physical disabilities (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that upcoming public health interventions should focus on improving various dimensions of EQoL for the promotion of physical activity among individuals with physical disabilities.

Aims: We aimed to assess the nature and extent of the coverage pertaining to mental health and COVID 19 in the print media. Subjects and Methods: In our prospective study, all print items related to the mental health aspects of COVID-19 published in a national daily, The Hindu and a regional daily, The Tribune were included. Results: A low percentage of the total print items related to COVID-19 pertained to the mental health aspects in both newspapers. Most of the print items appeared on the inner pages. Anxiety was the most common mental health problem mentioned, followed by depression and fear for one's own safety. Yoga, meditation, other forms of physical exercise, contacting helplines, and talking to people were the most commonly suggested ways to manage mental health problems. The opinion of a mental health professional was sought in only 13.33% of the print items in The Tribune, whereas the corresponding figure for The Hindu was 65%.

Phase-space techniques and time-delay embedding enable network-based analysis in terms of visibility, recurrence, and cluster transitions leveraging available time-series measurements. Equipped with the knowledge of interactions and communities, the network-theoretic approach enables the analysis, modeling, and control of fluid flows, with a particular emphasis on interactive dynamics. In this article, we provide a brief introduction to network science and an overview of the progress on network-based strategies to study the complex dynamics of fluid flows.

Isolates were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a multivariable regression model was constructed. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Overall, 193 patients were included, and 102 strains were analysed. All isolates had highly antibiotic-resistant profiles and derived from two genotypes. The cumulative incidence of A. baumannii acquisition (colonization or infection) was 36.8%. Patients with A. baumannii had higher mortality and length of stay. Multivariable analysis showed that previous carbapenem use was the only risk factor associated with A. baumannii acquisition (aOR: 4.15, 95% CI: 1.78C9.64). We documented substantial A. baumannii infections and colonization and high levels of clonal transmission.

In this study, we propose a simple Multiple Linear Regression model, optimised to use call data to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach outperforms ARIMA, ETS and a regression model without call data, evaluated by three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other similar future challenges.","output":"Forecasting COVID-19 daily cases using phone call data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we have introduced a new linguistic generalized spherical fuzzy set by combining the idea of generalized spherical fuzzy set and linguistic fuzzy set.

INFORMATION SOURCES: Scopus, Medline/PubMed Central, ProQuest, ISI Web of Knowledge and Embase. RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL: The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: Prevalence of sleep problems was synthesised using STATA software V.14 using a random effects model. To assess moderator analysis, meta-regression was carried out. Funnel plot and Eggers test were used to assess publication bias. Meta-trim was used to correct probable publication bias. The jackknife method was used for sensitivity analysis. INCLUDED STUDIES: A total of seven cross-sectional studies with 2808 participants from four countries were included. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: The pooled estimated prevalence of sleep problems was 56% (95% CI 23% to 88%, I(2)=99.81%, Tau(2)=0.19). Due to the probability of publication bias, the fill-and-trim method was used to correct the estimated pooled measure, which imputed four studies. The corrected results based on this method showed that pooled prevalence of sleep problems was 13% (95% CI 0% to 45%; p<0.001). Based on meta-regression, age was the only significant predictor of prevalence of sleep problems among pregnant women. LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE: All studies were cross-sectional absence of assessment of sleep problems prior to COVID-19, and the outcomes of the pregnancies among those with and without sleep problems in a consistent manner are among the limitation of the current review.

From March 16 to April 9, 2020, thromboprophylaxis was adjusted according to weight (control group, n = 19) and after this date, thromboprophylaxis depended on an algorithm based on thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk factors (protocol group, n = 13). With regard to safety (number of major bleeding events and blood transfusions), the groups were not significantly different. With regard to efficacy, the number of thrombotic events decreased from 37 to 0%, p = 0.025 after implementation of the algorithm. Also, peak fibrinogen dropped from 8.6 (7.2-9.3) to 6.5 (4.6-8.4) g/L, p = 0.041 and D-dimers from 2194 (1464-3763) to 1486 (900-2582) ng/mL, p = 0.0001.

Inspired by such phenomena, we construct a two-layer multiplex network for the coupled spread of a disease and conflicting opinions. We model each process as a contagion. On one layer, we consider the concurrent evolution of two opinions -- pro-physical-distancing and anti-physical-distancing -- that compete with each other and have mutual immunity to each other. The disease evolves on the other layer, and individuals are less likely (respectively, more likely) to become infected when they adopt the pro-physical-distancing (respectively, anti-physical-distancing) opinion. We develop approximations of mean-field type by generalizing monolayer pair approximations to multilayer networks; these approximations agree well with Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of parameters and several network structures. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate the influence of opinion dynamics on the spread of the disease from complex interactions both between the two conflicting opinions and between the opinions and the disease. We find that lengthening the duration that individuals hold an opinion may help suppress disease transmission, and we demonstrate that increasing the cross-layer correlations or intra-layer correlations of node degrees may lead to fewer individuals becoming infected with the disease.","output":"A Multilayer Network Model of the Coevolution of the Spread of a Disease and Competing Opinions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The polypeptide profiles of highly purified coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) proved to be very different from that of human respiratory coronavirus 229E and showed the particles not to be coronaviruses.

The purpose of this study was to determine the learning curve for this procedure using the Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) technique. METHODS Forty-six consecutive patients with paraesophageal hernia were evaluated prospectively after laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair. Upper GI series was performed 3 months postoperatively to look for recurrence. Patients were stratified based on the surgeon's early (first 20 cases) and late experience (>20 cases). The CUSUM method was then used to further analyze the learning curve. RESULTS Nine patients (21%) had anatomic recurrence. There was a trend toward a higher recurrence rate during the first 20 cases, although this did not achieve statistical significance (33% vs. 13%, p = 0.10). However, using a CUSUM analysis to plot the learning curve, we found that the recurrence rate diminishes after 18 cases and reaches an acceptable rate after 26 cases. CONCLUSIONS Surgeon experience is an important predictor of recurrence after laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair. CUSUM analysis revealed there is a significant learning curve to become proficient at this procedure, with approximately 20 cases required before a consistent decrease in hernia recurrence rate is observed.","output":"Defining the learning curve in laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair: a CUSUM analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deaths from COVID-19 continue to rise, and this virus has asymmetric impacts on marginalized communities though specific impacts on sexual and gender minority communities are not well understood.

Data obtained from questionnaires have also been evaluated statistically in SPSS application. According to the findings obtained, while average water footprint before COVID-19 pandemic has been calculated as 4178.42 L/day, average water footprint during COVID-19 pandemic period has been calculated as 4606.18 L/day. It was determined that the percentage of participants whose water footprint increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period at all education levels was higher than other participants. When the water footprint values of the participants with an income level of 7000 TL and above were compared with the water footprint values of other income groups, it was observed that the water footprint values of the participants with an income of 7000 TL and above increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. When the water footprint values of individuals according to age groups are examined, it has been determined that the water footprint values of individuals tend to increase in all age groups (except for the 51C60 age range) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because of statistical evaluations, it was seen that there was a meaningful correlation between change in water footprint values and weekly shower numbers, weekly laundry washing numbers, and monthly kitchen expenses. Despite the increase in water consumption with many daily activities, it can be said that the average water footprint value did not increase much due to the decrease in clothing expenditures of the participants during the pandemic process, the change in car washing frequencies, and the fact that red meat consumption did not increase in general despite the increase in kitchen expenses.","output":"Changes occurring in consumption habits of people during COVID-19 pandemic and the water footprint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Variant histology renal cell carcinoma (vRCC) encompasses rare non-clear cell subtypes that have long been associated with poor prognosis and minimal response to therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor.

RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges and barriers to care, as older adults may have disproportionate worsening of anxiety, depression, and substance use resulting from increased isolation related to physical distancing and shelter-in-place guidelines. SUMMARY: All older adults should be routinely screened for AUD with standardized screening tools. If a patients screening results are positive, a clinician should conduct a brief assessment, which may be supplemented by laboratory tests. Most older adults at risk for alcohol misuse do not need specialized SUD treatment, but most can benefit from Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to prevent substance misuse before it occurs.

DESIGN: A qualitative interview study. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen health and social care professionals working across a range of clinical settings in supporting dying patients during the first wave (March-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Participants reported emotional and practical challenges to providing end of life care during the pandemic, including increases in patient numbers, reduced staffing levels and relying on virtual platforms for sensitive, emotive conversations with relatives. Participants were central to promoting connections between patients and their families at end of life and creating opportunities for a final contact before the death.

Celiacomesenteric trunk (CMT) is a rare anatomical variant where the SMA shares the same origin as the celiac trunk. We present a case of mesenteric ischemia due to CMT occlusion. Case Description/Methods: A 78-year-old female with history of CAD, hypertension, diabetes, CVA, and GERD presented with 5 days of abdominal pain, associated with nausea, vomiting, and nonbloody diarrhea. She was prescribed levofloxacin 7 days prior to presentation after COVID-19 diagnosis. Vital signs were normal. Physical exam revealed epigastric tenderness without rebound or guarding. Labs showed WBC 15.5 x 103/uL, lactic acid 2.6 mmol/L, AST 1275 units/L, ALT 1403 units/L, ALP 105 units/L, total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, and INR 1.7. Acute hepatitis and autoimmune serologies were negative, as were acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol levels. Liver ultrasound with doppler showed patent liver vasculature and chronic parenchymal liver disease. Due to the temporality of levofloxacin prescription, elevated liver enzymes were attributed to drug-induced liver injury. Patient was treated with N-acetylcysteine. Despite initial improvement of liver enzymes, abdominal pain persisted with pain out of proportion to exam. She developed hypotension, and AST and ALT abruptly rose to 3181 units/L and 2701 units/L, respectively, with lactic acid of 13.5 mmol/L. CT abdomen without contrast showed extensive pneumatosis intestinalis with portal venous gas and diffuse colonic wall thickening, consistent with ischemia and necrosis. A CMT with significant atherosclerosis was noted. Given her critical condition, she was transitioned to comfort care and later expired. She was diagnosed with acute mesenteric ischemia due to CMT occlusion from severe atherosclerotic disease and ischemic hepatitis. Discussion: CMT is usually discovered incidentally during imaging, vascular surgery, or anatomic dissection with a prevalence of 0.5-2.7%. In patients with CMT, vessel occlusion can reduce blood supply to both the foregut and midgut, which can lead to life-threatening mesenteric ischemia, as it did in our patient. Our patient's severe atherosclerotic disease likely progressed to CMT occlusion, possibly exacerbated by COVID-19 coagulopathy. Compromised blood flow from the CMT to hepatic artery likely contributed to ischemic hepatitis as well.

In this study, the COVID-19 connection with various weather parameters like temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity is investigated and the future scenario of COVID-19 is predicted based on the Gaussian model (GM). This study is conducted in Delhi, the capital city of India, during the lowest mobility rate due to strict lockdown nationwide for about two months from March 15 to May 17, 2020. Spearman correlation is applied to obtain the interconnection of COVID-19 cases with weather parameters. Based on statistical analysis, this has been observed that the temperature parameter shows a significant positive trend during the period of study. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is fitted with respect to the number of days by using the Gaussian curve and it is estimated on the basis of the model that maximum cases will go up to 123,886 in number. The maximum number of cases will be observed during the range of 166  36 days. It is also estimated by using the width of the fitted GM that it will take minimum of 10 months for the complete recovery from COVID-19.

This gives information on the best synergies of interventions to control epidemic outbreaks while minimising impact on socio-economic needs.

This modality holds promise as an adjunctive therapy in the management of colorectal cancer and could be incorporated into neoadjuvant treatment plans under the auspices of prospective clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a search of primary literature published until January 2021, based on PRISMA guidelines. Primary clinical studies of PDT for the management of colorectal cancer were included. Screening, inclusion, quality assessment, and data collection were performed in duplicate. Analyses were descriptive or thematic. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, most of which were case series. The total number of patients reported to have received PDT for colorectal cancer was 137, almost all of whom received PDT with palliative intent. The most common photosensitizer was hematoporphyin derivative or Photofrin. The light dose used varied from 32 J/cm2 to 500 J/cm2. Complete tumor response (cure) was reported in 40%, with partial response reported in 43.2%. Symptomatic improvement was reported in 51.9% of patients. In total, 32 complications were reported, the most common of which was a skin photosensitivity reaction. CONCLUSIONS: PDT for the management of colorectal cancer has not been well studied, despite promising results in early clinical case series. New, well designed, prospective clinical trials are required to establish and define the role of PDT in the management of colorectal cancer.","output":"Photodynamic Therapy for Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review of Clinical Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Donation behavior plays a crucial role in promoting the development of social and public welfare undertakings. Previous studies have partially explored the influencing factors of donation behavior, but effective methods for boosting individuals donation behavior remain unclear. Based on the resource dependence theory, our present study further explored the promoting effect of self-affirmation on the relationship among cost, self-control, and individuals donation behavior, and provided empirical basis for boosting individuals donation behavior. METHODS: In preliminary experiment, Carlsons real donation paradigm was conducted to examine the effect of cost on individuals donation behavior. In experiment 1, we examined the effects of cost, self-control ability, and self-affirmation on individuals donation behavior. Individuals with high or low self-control ability were assigned to complete the experimental induction of self-affirmation or non-affirmation. Subsequently, all participants completed the donation task under three cost conditions same as preliminary experiment. In experiment 2, we examined the effects of cost, self-control resource, and self-affirmation on individuals donation behavior. Participants were assigned to complete the different Stroop task to induce the state of self-control resource exhaustion or non-exhaustion. Then, they completed the priming of self-affirmation or non-affirmation same as experiment 1. Finally, all participants completed the donation task under three cost conditions same as preliminary experiment. RESULTS: The results of preliminary experiment indicated that participants engaged in more donation behavior under low- and medium-cost conditions compared with high-cost condition. The results of experiment 1 demonstrated that self-affirmation exerted a promoting effect on the donation behavior for individuals with low self-control ability under low-, medium-, and high-cost conditions. The results of experiment 2 demonstrated that self-affirmation promoted the donation behavior of individuals with self-control resource exhaustion under low-, medium-, and high-cost conditions. CONCLUSION: Self-affirmation could promote the donation behavior of individuals with low self-control ability and those with self-control resource exhaustion, whether donations cost was high or low. Self-affirmation plays a crucial role for boosting individuals donation behavior.","output":"Influence of Cost and Self-Control on Individual Donation Behavior: The Promoting Effect of Self-Affirmation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bipartisan consensus on many US domestic and foreign policy priorities has seemingly collapsed in recent decades, and political parties have become qideologically polarized and divided. While some contend that these dynamics are narrowing the space for congressional foreign policy innovation, we argue that factionalism often fosters creativity in the foreign policy process. Specifically, this article explores the role of free agent progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans in foreign policy decision-making. These members at the ideological extremes of their parties are finding common ground in anti-establishment views and concerns about executive excess, and they are aligning to challenge traditional foreign policy positions. This paper conducts a plausibility probe of a model of congressional foreign policy free agency based upon roll call voting on war powers-related decisions in the Obama and Trump administrations. During both presidencies, our findings suggest that the free agency model has predictive value for foreign policy maneuvering and offers a non-traditional way of thinking about contemporary US foreign policy development.","output":"Foreign policy free agents: how lawmakers and coalitions on the political margins help set boundaries for US foreign policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Joint Committee on Intercollegiate Examinations (JCIE- domestic) is responsible for the supervision of standards, policies, regulations and professional conduct of the UK/Ireland Specialty Fellowship Examinations The Joint Surgical Colleges Fellowship Examination (JSCFE- International) is organised by the JSCFE Committee in five specialities, and one of them is General Surgery The syllabus for the examination is extensive and needs rigorous preparation The Specialty Trainees (ST) get supervised structured training and regular assessments, and hence their pass rate is not only comparatively higher, but they are better prepared for the challenge However, trainee surgeons who are outside the UK training programmes find the examination difficult The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted surgical training and education by limiting access to conventional teaching methods and available resources We have been running a teaching and formative assessment platform since May 2017 This teaching resource has helped several trainees in passing the examination and has proven to be a valuable learning resource in the pandemic Materials and Methods: We provided examination support, guidance and supervision by running Skype/ Microsoft Teams sessions and weekend courses We emphasised five critical steps in all our sessions and used our course website- WWW PHOENIXFRCSCOURSE COM for material 1- Using Landing Sentences to start at the MRCS level 2- 0- 60 mph concept - a safe but quick pace to move from the MRCS zone onto the FRCS zone 3- The MISTER-model of simulation and learning 4- Maintaining pace and grace under pressure 5- Interleaving- revising, rehearsing and consolidating difficult topics The sessions included model scenarios, table viva, academic reading, virtual clinics and peer to peer learning (Examiners Drills) The faculty were recent examination graduates and had attended such sessions before their exam success We followed the JCIE marking descriptors for formative assessment and timely feedback Results: The first such course was organised in May 2017 and since then (over 40 months) a total of 100 attendees: 90 candidates (domestic FRCS and International FRCS) and 10 observers went through our sessions and workshops Some 50 virtual sessions and 8 courses (16 days of simulation workshops) have been held so far 66 (15 CCT and 51 non-CCT) candidates took the examination and 54 passed (82%) Sum 23 candidates have either deferred their examination dates or have been delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and are being regularly supported Conclusions: Simulation-based virtual teaching supplemented with weekend inhouse courses has the potential to improve FRCS Section-2 examination preparation and the success rate during COVID-19 pandemic","output":"FRCS General Surgery section-2 examination preparation during COVID-19 pandemic: an innovative and sustainable model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical risk of mother-to-infant transmission of SARS-CoV2 and transmission during rooming in and breast feeding in infants born to mothers with COVID-19. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: A large tertiary maternal and neonatal care centre based in the UAE. PARTICIPANTS: Infants born to mothers diagnosed to have COVID-19 at the time of delivery, born between 1 April and 15 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of transmission of SARS-CoV2 from mother to infant (vertical or horizontal) while rooming in and breast feeding in hospital and post discharge and associated morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period. RESULTS: 73 infants were born to mothers with COVID-19 at the time of delivery. Two infants tested positive for SARS-CoV2 after birthone had respiratory symptoms related to other causes and the other infant remained well. 57 of motherCinfant dyads who were well enough, roomed in while in hospital and all were breast fed. All surviving infants were followed up by telephone at 2 weeks and 4 weeks (or from the patient record review if still on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Majority of the discharged infants were still rooming in with mothers (95% at 2 weeks, 99% at 4 weeks) and still breast fed (99% at 2 weeks, 99% at 4 weeks). None of the infants developed any significant health issues or developed symptoms attributable to SARS-CoV2.

The initiation of chronic obstructive lung disease in CF involves inflammation and exacerbations, leading to mucus obstruction and lung function decline. Even though clinical management of CF lung disease has prolonged survival, exacerbation and age-related lung function decline remain a challenge for controlling the progressive lung disease. The key to the resolution of progressive lung disease is prognosis-based early therapeutic intervention; thus, the development of novel diagnostics and prognostic biomarkers for predicting exacerbation and lung function decline will allow optimal management of the lung disease. Hence, the development of real-time lung function diagnostics such as forced oscillation technique (FOT), impulse oscillometry system (IOS), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and novel prognosis-based intervention strategies for controlling the progression of chronic obstructive lung disease will fulfill a significant unmet need for CF patients. Early detection of CF lung inflammation and exacerbations with the timely resolution will not only prolong survival and reduce mortality but also improve quality of life while reducing significant health care costs due to recurring hospitalizations.","output":"Prognosis-Based Early Intervention Strategies to Resolve Exacerbation and Progressive Lung Function Decline in Cystic Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacted healthcare institutions worldwide. Particularly, orthopedic departments had to adapt their operational models. Purpose: This review aimed to quantify the reduction in surgical and outpatient caseloads, identify other significant trends and ascertain the impact of these trends on orthopedic residency training programs. Methods: Medline and Embase were searched for articles describing case load for surgeries, outpatient clinic attendance, or emergency department (ED) visits. Statistical analysis of quantitative data was performed after a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. Results were pooled with random effects by DerSimonian and Laird model. When insufficient data was available, a systematic approach was used to present the results instead. Results: A total of 23 studies were included in this study. The number of elective surgeries, trauma procedures and outpatient attendance decreased by 80% (2013/17400, 0.20, CI: 0.12 to 0.29), 47% (3887/17561, 0.53, CI: 0.37 to 0.69) and 63% (84174/123967, 0.37, CI: 0.24 to 0.51) respectively. During the pandemic, domestic injuries and polytrauma increased. Residency training was disrupted due to diminished clinical exposure and changing teaching methodologies. Additionally, residents had more duties which contributed to a lower quality of life. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has made an unprecedented impact on orthopedics departments worldwide. The slow return of orthopedic departments to normalcy and the compromised training of residents due to the pandemic points to an uncertain future for healthcare institutions worldwide, wherein the impact of this pandemic may yet still be felt far in the future.","output":"A look at the global impact of SARS CoV-2 on orthopedic services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the severe respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the use of face masks has become ubiquitous worldwide to control the rapid spread of this pandemic. As a result, the world is currently facing a face mask shortage, and some countries have placed limits on the number of masks that can be bought by each person. Although the surgical grade N95 mask provides the highest level of protection currently available, its filtration efficiency for sub-300 nm particles is around 85% due to its wider pore size (a??300 nm). Because the COVID-19 virus shows a diameter of around 65-125 nm, there is a need for developing more efficient masks. To overcome these issues, we demonstrate the development of a flexible, nanoporous membrane to achieve a reusable N95 mask with a replaceable membrane and enhanced filtration efficiency. We first developed a flexible nanoporous Si-based template on a silicon-on-insulator wafer using KOH etching and then used the template as a hard mask during a reactive ion etching process to transfer the patterns onto a flexible and lightweight (<0.12 g) polymeric membrane. Pores with sizes down to 5 nm were achieved with a narrow distribution. Theoretical calculations show that airflow rates above 85 L/min are possible through the mask, which confirms its breathability over a wide range of pore sizes, densities, membrane thicknesses, and pressure drops. Finally, the membrane is intrinsically hydrophobic, which contributes to antifouling and self-cleaning as a result of droplets rolling and sliding on the inclined mask area.","output":"Flexible Nanoporous Template for the Design and Development of Reusable Anti-COVID-19 Hydrophobic Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BodyThe 2020 coronavirus pandemic sparked sudden change in all spheres of life, not least health services. Across Europe clinical research had to adapt. The virus peaked in different places at different times, with Londons first wave in March-May. The National Institute for Health Research paused all face to face research at NHS and social care sites except for nationally prioritised Urgent Public Health (UHP) Covid-19 studies. The first UPH studies focused on acute Covid-19, largely in physical health settings. Research leaders quickly highlighted the need for high quality research data on the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of the general population, as well as the mental health and neuropsychiatric effects of the virus itself, to allow for the development and evaluation of mitigation strategies. The major UK research funders have resourced this. Once the first wave abated, paused research was restarted according to national prioritisation guidance. In Maudsley we worked closely with research teams to develop strategies to make our research programmes as Covid-19 adaptive as possible, maximising remote interaction with research participants, with robust infection prevention procedures if face to face meetings were necessary. Examples of innovative strategies will be shared. In January 2021 with the more transmissible variant of SARS CoV2, face to face research paused again, except where risk was outweighed by patient benefit in continuing.

We evaluated the reliability and consistency of the system in newborns. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 1,046 infants 0 to 90 days old undergoing ultrasound for hydronephrosis 243 were randomly selected for study inclusion. Seven readers (4 radiologists and 3 urologists) at 4 institutions classified complete, de-identified ultrasound studies on a Web based platform. Interobserver and intra-observer agreement was evaluated using the Fleiss kappa statistic. RESULTS Interobserver agreement for Urinary Tract Dilation risk score was moderate among the 7 readers (kappa = 0.421, 95% CI 0.404-0.438). Interobserver agreement using the Society for Fetal Urology scale was worse than with the Urinary Tract Dilation classification (kappa = 0.344, 95% CI 0.330-0.359). All 7 readers assigned the same Urinary Tract Dilation score in 19.3% of cases (47 of 243). In 38.7% of cases (94 of 243) at least 3 readers assigned a Urinary Tract Dilation score different from that assigned by the other readers. In 7% of cases (17 of 243) at least 3 readers assigned a score of P0/P1, while at least 3 readers scored the same cases as P2/P3. At least 3 different Urinary Tract Dilation risk scores were assigned to the same patient in 30.45% of patients (74 of 243).

To investigate when the effects of telework on job stress are beneficial versus dysfunctional, the study draws on telework research and cultural value theory and analyzes the moderating role of employee cultural background (i.e., individualism and power distance), the influence of which on the effects of telework is expected to be transmitted by an employees beliefs about telework effectiveness and isolation. Although prior research analyzed the effects of telework in different occupations and industries, a very important matter has received very little attention C namely, the effects of telework on job stress across employees with different cultural backgrounds. To successfully implement telework arrangements, organizations must know whether employee cultural background influences the effectiveness of telework. The current COVID-19 pandemic and the related implementation of telework arrangements in many countries amplify the importance of understanding the influence of culture on the effects of telework on employee well-being. The hypotheses are tested through a three-wave survey study with 604 teleworkers from different countries. The results indicate that telework only reduces job stress when employees do not believe that telework will lead to social isolation. The study further expands telework research by showing that employees with high power distance scores have negative beliefs about telework, whereas employees with high individualism scores have positive beliefs about the effectiveness of telework.","output":"How does employee cultural background influence the effects of telework on job stress?

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multi-institutional networking session was hosted on Zoom and included medical students, faculty, and residents from across the country. The breakout room feature was used to divide participants into smaller groups. Participants were randomly shuffled into new groups every 10 to 15 minutes. Students completed pre- and post-session surveys. RESULTS: Among the 134 students who registered, 69 students participated in the session, and 53 students completed a post-session survey. Most students reported the session was valuable or very valuable (79%), and it was easy or very easy to network through the virtual format (66%). After the session, 18 (33.9%) students reported their interest in radiation oncology increased, and 34 (64.2%) reported their interest remained the same. Most students believed COVID-19 (55%) and virtual interviews and platforms (55%) negatively or somewhat negatively affected their ability to select a residency program.

Treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan, may mitigate these effects, though induction of ACE2 could increase viral entry, replication, and worsen disease. METHODS: This study represents a placebo-controlled blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of losartan on outpatients with COVID-19 across three hospital systems with numerous community sites in Minnesota, U.S. Participants included symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 not already taking ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, enrolled within 7 days of symptom onset. Patients were randomized to 1:1 losartan (25 mg orally twice daily unless estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR, was reduced, when dosing was reduced to once daily) versus placebo for 10 days, and all patients and outcome assesors were blinded. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization within 15 days. Secondary outcomes included functional status, dyspnea, temperature, and viral load. (clinicatrials.gov, NCT04311177, closed to new participants) FINDINGS: From April to November 2020, 117 participants were randomized 58 to losartan and 59 to placebo, and all were analyzed under intent to treat principles. The primary outcome did not differ significantly between the two arms based on Barnard's test [losartan arm: 3 events (5.2% 95% CI 1.1, 14.4%) versus placebo arm: 1 event (1.7%; 95% CI 0.0, 9.1%)]; proportion difference -3.5% (95% CI -13.2, 4.8%); p = 0.32]. Viral loads were not statistically different between treatment groups at any time point. Adverse events per 10 patient days did not differ signifcantly [0.33 (95% CI 0.22C0.49) for losartan vs. 0.37 (95% CI 0.25C0.55) for placebo]. Due to a lower than expected hospitalization rate and low likelihood of a clinically important treatment effect, the trial was terminated early. INTERPRETATION: In this multicenter blinded RCT for outpatients with mild symptomatic COVID-19 disease, losartan did not reduce hospitalizations, though assessment was limited by low event rate. Importantly, viral load was not statistically affected by treatment.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. Methods From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20C22). Cases were isolated on average 46 days (95% CI 41C50) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 19 days (95% CI 11C27). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 627 [95% CI 149C2633] for household contacts and 706 [143C3491] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 112% (95% CI 91C138), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 74% in children <10 years vs population average of 66%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 04 (95% CI 03C05), with a mean serial interval of 63 days (95% CI 52C76). Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS). D-dimer levels were pooled and compared between severe/non-severe and surviving/non-surviving patient groups. Weighted mean difference (WMD), risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies reported on D-dimer levels in 5750 non-severe and 2063 severe patients and 16 studies reported on D-dimer levels in 2783 surviving and 697 non-surviving cases. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical status (WMD: 0.45 mg/L, 95% CI: 0.34-0.56; p < 0.0001). Non-surviving patients had significantly higher D-dimer levels compared to surviving patients (WMD: 5.32 mg/L, 95% CI: 3.90-6.73; p < 0.0001). D-dimer levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with higher risk of severity (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.25-2.00; p < 0.0001) and mortality (RR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.40-2.37; p < 0.0001).

The one-year scheme provides Psych Stars with a matched mentor, free registration at the RCPsych's International Congress, financial support for psychiatry-related activities, journal subscriptions and access to two online learning platforms. This project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme in supporting Psych Stars to explore their interest in psychiatry and in promoting psychiatry as a career choice, through use of a survey for both Psych Stars and mentors. Method Surveys were sent to all Psych Stars and mentors from the first cohort of the scheme. The mentor and student surveys contained a mixture of ranking, multiple choice, closed-ended and open-ended questions. Questions examined: clarity of the scheme's aims and objectives;benefits of each aspect of the scheme;impact of the scheme on application to Core Training;benefits and barriers to successful mentorship;adequacy of mentor support from the RCPsych and suggestions to improve the scheme. Result Six Psych Stars and nine mentors completed the respective surveys. All Psych Stars stated the scheme was enjoyable. Five Psych Stars were more likely to apply for Core Training because of the scheme. All Psych Stars identified the most beneficial aspect of the scheme being the funded place at the RCPsych International Congress. Other aspects highly ranked included: funding to explore areas of psychiatry of interest and the opportunity to be an ambassador for psychiatry. All Psych Stars found the mentorship useful. Mentors supported Psych Stars by providing career advice, suggesting relevant conferences to attend and assisting Psych Stars make decisions on how to use their allocated funding. Barriers to mentorship that were identified included: geographical separation, limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of time. For mentors, areas for improvement included clearer aims and objectives and more support from the RCPsych. Both mentors and Psych Stars suggested forming a network of Psych Stars and mentors would be useful to share ideas and experiences. Conclusion This evaluation shows that the Psych Star scheme successfully supports Psych Stars to explore their interest in psychiatry, and promotes psychiatry as a career choice. This survey has been helpful in identifying what aspects of the scheme are particularly attractive, and also, importantly, how the Psych Stars scheme can be improved for future cohorts. The survey will be delivered to all future annual cohorts of Psych Stars and mentors.","output":"An evaluation of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Psych Star scheme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A person who gets a new diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, but has symptoms for many months or years.

Sustaining control of VL in terms of proper and prevailing immunity development is a global necessity amid unavailability of a prophylactic vaccine. Screening of experimental proteome of the human disease propagating form of Leishmania donovani (amastigote) can be more pragmatic for in silico mining of novel vaccine candidates. METHODS: By using an immunoinformatic approach, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-specific epitopes from experimentally reported L. donovani proteins having secretory potential and increased abundance in amastigotes were screened. A chimera linked with a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) peptide adjuvant was constructed and evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, binding interaction with TLR4 in simulated physiological condition and the trend of immune response following hypothetical immunization. RESULTS: Selected epitopes from physiologically important L. donovani proteins were found mostly conserved in L. infantum, covering theoretically more than 98% of the global population. The multi-epitope chimeric vaccine was predicted as stable, antigenic and non-allergenic. Structural analysis of vaccine-TLR4 receptor docked complex and its molecular dynamics simulation suggest sufficiently stable binding interface along with prospect of non-canonical receptor activation. Simulation dynamics of immune response following hypothetical immunization indicate active and memory B as well as CD4+ T cell generation potential, and likely chance of a more Th1 polarized response. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological approach and results from this study could facilitate more informed screening and selection of candidate antigenic proteins for entry into vaccine production pipeline in future to control human VL.

Kidney failure remains independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes, underlining the specific adverse influence of kidney disease on cardiovascular risk. Vascular injury develops in asymptomatic patients with kidney failure early in the course of the disease. Defective arterial vasodilation, increased arterial stiffness, increased intima-media thickness, and vascular calcification develop in patients with kidney disease long before clinical evidence of cardiovascular events. Even mildly reduced kidney function is associated with subclinical vascular disease which is a predictor of worse cardiovascular outcome in patients with kidney failure, similarly to the general population and patients with diabetes. Insulin resistance is a typical feature of kidney disease that occurs during the entire span of the disorder, from mild dysfunction to the dialysis phase. Insulin resistance (or its clinical manifestations, the metabolic syndrome or its components) is independently associated with subclinical vascular injury in patients with kidney disease. Additionally, the risk for developing incident kidney disease and for rapid decline of kidney function is higher in patients with insulin resistance. Animal protein consumption increases dietary acid load and intensifies insulin resistance. Consistently, meat intake promotes diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney failure while consumption of plant-based food is protective against the development of vascular disease.

Development of a vaccine has been hindered by the risk of developing enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) upon natural exposure to the virus. Generation of higher quality neutralizing antibodies with stabilized pre-fusion F protein antigens has been proposed as a strategy to prevent ERD. We sought to test whether there was evidence of ERD in na?ve BALB/c mice immunized with an unadjuvanted, stabilized pre-fusion F protein, and challenged with RSV line 19. We further sought to determine the extent to which formulation with a Th2-biased (alum) or a more Th1/Th2-balanced (Advax-SM) adjuvant influenced cellular responses and lung pathology. When exposed to RSV, mice immunized with pre-fusion F protein alone (PreF) exhibited increased airway eosinophilia and mucus accumulation. This was further exacerbated by formulation of PreF with Alum (aluminum hydroxide). Conversely, formulation of PreF with a Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvant, Advax-SM, not only suppressed RSV viral replication, but also inhibited airway eosinophilia and mucus accumulation. This was associated with lower numbers of lung innate lymphocyte cells (ILC2s) and CD4+ T cells producing IL-5+ or IL-13+ and increased IFN+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in addition to RSV F-specific CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that in the absence of preimmunity, stabilized PreF antigens may still be associated with aberrant Th2 responses that induce lung pathology in response to RSV infection, and can be prevented by formulation with more Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvants that enhance CD4+ and CD8+ IFN+ T cell responses. This may support the use of stabilized PreF antigens with Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvants like, Advax-SM, as safer alternatives to alum in RSV vaccine candidates.","output":"Prefusion RSV F Immunization Elicits Th2-Mediated Lung Pathology in Mice When Formulated With a Th2 (but Not a Th1/Th2-Balanced) Adjuvant Despite Complete Viral Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), were not included in the two large trials of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, and therefore, safety and efficacy data are lacking in this population.

Excitatory fastigial neurons project to a large number of downstream targets, and it is unclear if this broad targeting underlies seizure suppression, or if a specific output may be sufficient. To address this question, we used the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, male and female animals, and a dual-virus approach to selectively label and manipulate fastigial outputs. We examined fastigial neurons projecting to the superior colliculus, medullary reticular formation, and central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, and found that these comprise largely non-overlapping populations of neurons which send collaterals to unique sets of additional, somewhat overlapping, thalamic and brainstem regions. We found that neither optogenetic stimulation of superior colliculus nor reticular formation output channels attenuated hippocampal seizures. In contrast, on-demand stimulation of fastigial neurons targeting the central lateral nucleus robustly inhibited seizures. Our results indicate that fastigial control of hippocampal seizures does not require simultaneous modulation of many fastigial output channels. Rather, selective modulation of the fastigial output channel to the central lateral thalamus, specifically, is sufficient for seizure control. More broadly, our data highlight the concept of specific cerebellar output channels, whereby discrete cerebellar nucleus neurons project to specific aggregates of downstream targets, with important consequences for therapeutic interventions.Significance statementThe cerebellum has an emerging relationship with non-motor systems and may represent a powerful target for therapeutic intervention in temporal lobe epilepsy. We find, as previously reported, that fastigial neurons project to numerous brain regions via largely segregated output channels, and that projection targets cannot be predicted simply by somatic locations within the nucleus.

We find that the high-risk regions are mainly distributed along the southern half of Beijing-Hong Kong HSR line, where a large number of infection cases have been confirmed at the early stage. Furthermore, the two components of the infection risk, namely, the probability (proxied by the region's correlation with Wuhan through HSR) and the impact (proxied by the region's population with mobility), can play different roles in the risk ranking for different regions. For public health administrators, these findings may be used for better decision making, including the preparation of emergency plans and supplies, and the allocation of limited resources, before the extensive spread of the epidemic. Moreover, the administrators should adopt different intervention measures for different regions, so as to better mitigate the epidemic spread according to their own risk scenarios with respect to the probability of occurring and, once occurred, the impact.","output":"Assessing regional risk of COVID-19 infection from Wuhan via high-speed rail"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have been described in a conspicuous percentage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis of the number of physicians, OHS units and their activities was performed on the basis of the MZ-35 and MZ-35A statistical forms, which represent obligatory medical reporting. RESULTS: There were 6349 occupational medicine physicians in Poland, who are entitled to conduct prophylactic examinations of employees and provide preventive health care, necessary due to working conditions (less by 248 [3.8%] compared to 2019). At the same time, the number of OHS basic units decreased to 5784 (by 3.2%).

Only 2% of educators are trained to support these vulnerable students. Social robots show promise for language acquisition and may provide valuable support for students, especially as we return to needing smaller classes due to COVID-19. While cultural responsiveness increases gains for ELLs, little is known about the design of culturally responsive child-robot interactions. Method: Therefore, using a participatory design approach, we conducted an exploratory study with 24 Spanish-speaking ELLs at a Pacific Northwest elementary school. As cultural informants, students participated in a 15-min, robot-led, small group story discussion followed by a post-interaction feedback session. We then conducted reflexive critiques with six ELL teachers who reviewed the group interactions to provide further interpretation on design feature possibilities and potential interactions with the robot. Results: Students found the social robot engaging, but many were hesitant to converse with the robot. During post-interaction dialogue students articulated the specific ways in which the social robot appearance and behavior could be modified to help them feel more comfortable. Teachers postulated that the social robot could be designed to engage students in peer-to-peer conversations. Teachers also recognized the ELLs verbosity when discussing their experiences with the robot and suggested such interactions could stimulate responsiveness from students. Conclusion: Cultural responsiveness is a key component to successful education in ELLs. However, integrating appropriate, cultural responsiveness into robot interactions may require participants as cultural informants to ensure the robot behaviors and interactions are situated in that educational community. Utilizing a participatory approach to engage ELLs in design decisions for social robots is a promising way to gather culturally responsive requirements to inform successful child-robot interactions.","output":"Engaging English Language Learners as Cultural Informants in the Design of a Social Robot for Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The role of school closure in mitigating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission has been questioned.

These results suggest that the PEDV2-p103 strain could be a potential oral attenuated vaccine, and its immunogenicity and efficacy should be further assessed through in vivo tests.","output":"Characteristics and Pathogenicity of the Cell-Adapted Attenuated Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus of the Non-S INDEL Cluster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colistin-resistant Escherichia coli are isolated from pigs suffering from post-weaning diarrhea (PWD). This study was designed to develop an experimental model of PWD using mcr-1-carrying shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), for the future evaluation of control measures. Three groups of eight piglets, kept in high biosecurity units, were orally inoculated with mcr-1-positive STEC or ETEC, and one unchallenged group was used as a control. Clinical signs were recorded. Regularly-collected fecal samples and samples obtained from the digestive tract of animals sacrificed one month after inoculation were cultured in selective media and isolates were characterized. Blood samples were used to genotype the polymorphisms of the pigs intestinal receptors for F4 and F18 E. coli adhesins. Diarrhea was more frequent and more fecal samples contained the inoculated strain in the group inoculated with the O149-F4 ETEC strain than with the O141-F18 or O139-F18 STEC strains. However, fewer positive samples were obtained from the two pigs with the F4 resistant genotype. The three inoculated strains could be re-isolated up to the end of the experiment. Excretion peaked on the first week after inoculation with the O149-F4 ETEC strain, and later for the other two. An mcr-1 gene transfer to other commensal isolates was observed only for O139-F18 STEC, while the loss of mcr-1 from the inoculated strain occurred in all groups. The O149-F4 ETEC challenge may be used to evaluate alternative solutions to combat PWD caused by colistin-resistant E. coli in pigs.","output":"Development of a pig infection model with colistin-resistant Escherichia coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid antigen assays (RAD) based on lateral flow immunochromatography (LFIC) technology have emerged as a valuable tool for the control of COVID-19 pandemic.

However, due to limited capacity to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are no reliable estimates of the true burden of infection and death. We, therefore, conducted a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey amongst health care workers (HCW) in Blantyre city to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban Malawi. METHODS: Five hundred otherwise asymptomatic HCWs were recruited from Blantyre City (Malawi) from 22(nd) May 2020 to 19(th) June 2020 and serum samples were collected all participants. A commercial ELISA was used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. We run local negative samples (2018 C 2019) to verify the specificity of the assay. To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies, we adjusted the proportion of positive results based on local specificity of the assay. RESULTS: Eighty-four participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result came from different parts of the city. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 12.3% [CI 9.0C15.7]. Using age-stratified infection fatality estimates reported from elsewhere, we found that at the observed adjusted seroprevalence, the number of predicted deaths was 8 times the number of reported deaths. CONCLUSION: The high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCW and the discrepancy in the predicted versus reported deaths, suggests that there was early exposure but slow progression of COVID-19 epidemic in urban Malawi. This highlights the urgent need for development of locally parameterised mathematical models to more accurately predict the trajectory of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa for better evidence-based policy decisions and public health response planning.","output":"High SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Health Care Workers but relatively low numbers of deaths in urban Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is a syndrome which is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection leading to organ failure. Since it remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, numerous drug candidates have already been tested, and continue to be developed, as potential adjunct therapies. Despite convincing mechanisms of action and robust pre-clinical data, almost all drug candidates in the field of sepsis have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the past two decades. Accordingly, the development of new sepsis drugs has markedly decreased in the past few years. Nevertheless, thanks to a better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and pathways, new promising drug candidates are currently being developed. Instead of a unique sepsis profile as initially suspected, various phenotypes have been characterised. This has resulted in the identification of multiple targets for new drugs together with relevant biomarkers, and a better understanding of the most appropriate time to intervention. Within the entire sepsis drugs portfolio, those targeting the immune response are probably the most promising.

In this interdisciplinary Viewpoint, we describe literature from a variety of domains that highlight how social deprivation in adolescence might have far-reaching consequences. Human studies have shown the importance of peer acceptance and peer influence in adolescence. Animal research has shown that social deprivation and isolation have unique effects on brain and behaviour in adolescence compared with other stages of life. However, the decrease in adolescent face-to-face contact might be less detrimental due to widespread access to digital forms of social interaction through technologies such as social media.

aim of this study was to investigate whether lung ultrasound (LUS) findings within 72 hours of admission were predictive of clinical deterioration in hospitalized patients with confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) METHODS: Patients admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 unit were subject to daily LUS examinations Number of present consolidations and pleural effusions were registered and a Mongodi score was calculated These findings were correlated with initial chest x-ray and clinical deterioration, defined as ICU-admission, ARDS diagnosis, death RESULTS: In total, 29 of 83 patients had LUS performed during admission, 18 within 72 h of admission Of these, four patients died during admission, six were transferred to the ICU and 13 were diagnosed with ARDS Initial Mongodi-score did not differ significantly between patients with and without clinical deterioration (p = 0 95) Agreement between initial LUS and chest x-ray findings were fair with Cohens

a massive adoption of IoT devices across our society. IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work's main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing of these messages.

The awareness of COVID-19 clinical manifestations can improve the early detection of mild cases, possibly reducing further transmission to colleagues and patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in March-May 2020, involving medical school physicians in a teaching hospital in northern Italy, with a working population of 881 medical doctors. Data collection was performed using a structured form investigating clinical and epidemiological information. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two medical doctors contacted the Occupational Health Service reporting acute respiratory symptoms or close contact exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case. Among the confirmed COVID-19 cases, most were male doctors during residency, and 85% presented a mild clinical picture. Fever (70.3%) and cough (51.4%) represented the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19. As revealed by the univariate analysis, the prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity increased with age (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, p = 0.012), working in a COVID-19 ward (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.09-10.21, p = 0.031), presenting alteration or loss of smell/taste (OR = 10.00, 95%CI: 2.80-35.69, p < 0.001) and myalgia (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.00-10.26, p = 0.046), while being a resident (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.80, p = 0.030) was associated with reduced odds of being infected, compared to staff physicians.

We conducted a seroprevalence survey in the Kibera informal settlement, Nairobi, Kenya, to determine the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: : Members of randomly selected households from an existing population-based infectious disease surveillance (PBIDS) provided blood specimens between 27th November and 5th December 2020. The specimens were tested for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Seroprevalence estimates were weighted by age and sex distribution of the PBIDS population and accounted for household clustering. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for individual seropositivity. Results: : Consent was obtained from 523 individuals in 175 households, yielding 511 serum specimens that were tested. The overall weighted seroprevalence was 43.3% (95% CI, 37.4 C 49.5%) and did not vary by sex. Of the sampled households, 122(69.7%) had at least one seropositive individual. The individual seroprevalence increased by age from 7.6% (95% CI, 2.4 C 21.3%) among children (<5 years), 32.7% (95% CI, 22.9 C 44.4%) among children 5 C 9 years, 41.8% (95% CI, 33.0 C 51.1%) for those 10-19 years, and 54.9%(46.2 C 63.3%) for adults (20 years). Relative to those from medium-sized households (3 and 4 individuals), participants from large (5 persons) households had significantly increased odds of being seropositive, aOR, 1.98(95% CI, 1.17 C 1.58), while those from small-sized households (2 individuals) had increased odds but not statistically significant, aOR, 2.31 (95% CI, 0.93 C 5.74).

METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze clinical, laboratory data and treatment of 60 severe cases with COVID-19 infection in Jiangsu Province between January 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020. The improvement and deterioration subgroups were compared to identify predictors of disease progression. RESULTS: A total of 653 infected cases with COVID-19 were reported in Jiangsu Province, of which 60 severe cases were included in this study. Up until April 20, 2020, the mortality of severe patients was 0%. The median age was 57 years. The average body mass index of these patients was 25 kg/m2. White blood cell counts decreased in 45.0% of patients, lymphopenia in 63.3%, thrombocytopenia in 13.3% and procalcitonin levels in 88.3% of the patients were less than 0.5 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and GCs therapy between the improvement and deterioration subgroups. Logistic regression analysis identified higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.08; Pa?=a?0.04), antiviral therapy with aerosol inhalation of interferon (OR: 6.33; 95% CI: 1.18-33.98; Pa?=a?0.03), and the application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.99; 95%CI: 1.17-3.41; Pa?=a?0.01) as predictors of disease progression, whereas higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.57; Pa?=a?0.01) and early prone ventilation were associated with improvement (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01-0.98; Pa?=a?0.04).

The aim of the study was to assess the antibody response following BNT162b2 vaccination in nursing home (NH) residents.Methods: Three hundred and sixty-nine NH residents who received two vaccine doses were tested for antibody vaccine response three weeks after the first dose and six weeks after the second dose. We assessed IgG level against SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD-IgG) and nucleoprotein-IgG (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant and SARS-CoV-2 IgG Alinity assays, Abbott Diagnostics).Results: In NH residents with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, high RBD-IgG levels ( 4,160 AU/mL) were observed after the first dose in 99/129 (76.9%), with no additional antibody gain after the second dose in 74 (74.7%). However, a low RDB-IgG level (<1,050 AU/mL) was observed in 28 (21.7%) residents. The persistence of nucleoprotein-IgG and a longer interval between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the first dose were associated with a higher RDB-IgG response (p<0.0001 and p=0.0013, respectively). In NH residents without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, RBD-IgG below 50 AU/mL after the first dose predicted failure to reach a significant antibody concentration ( 1,050 AU/mL) after the second dose (predictive positive value: 53.5%, sensitivity: 77.6%, specificity: 73.3%). Conclusions: The BNT162b2 vaccine elicits a strong humoral response after the first dose in NH residents with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, about one quarter may need a second injection. NH residents without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had a low RBD-IgG response after the first dose and over 30% may need a third injection.Funding Information: This work was funded by the Montpellier University Hospital, Muse I-SITE Program Grant, University of Montpellier.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare that there are no conflict of interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.Ethics Approval Statement: Subjects provided an informed consent and the study was approved by the Montpellier University Hospital institutional review board (IRB-MTP_2020_06_202000534 and IRB-MTP _2021_04_202000534).","output":"Antibody Response After First and Second BNT162b2 Vaccination to Predict the Need for Subsequent Injections in Nursing Home Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growing concerns about anxiety associated with COVID-19 have led to recommendations for effective self-care, and greater availability of mental health treatment.

The results indicate that there are various deviations between the compared data, and thus the study concludes that Greek media organization publishing strategy is not aligned with the audience consumption needs. The identified discrepancies have to do with the published news articles after 14:00 during weekdays as well as the news articles that are available during weekends.

Not surprisingly, viruses have adapted to encode virulence factors to cope with the IFN response. Intriguingly, we show here that all three types of interferons, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-, efficiently promote infection by a human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, one of the major etiological agents of common cold, through the induction of IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITMs typically exert their antiviral function by inhibiting the entry of a broad spectrum of viruses into their host cells, presumably by trapping and degrading invading virions within the endocytic compartments. In contrast, HCoV-OC43 uses IFN-induced human IFITM2 or IFITM3 as an entry factor to facilitate its infection of host cells. Reverse genetics analyses suggest that the structural motifs critical for the IFITM proteins' enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection are distinct from those required for inhibiting infection by other viruses. We also present evidence showing that IFITM family members work as homo- and hetero-oligomers to modulate virus entry. The observed enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection by IFNs may underlie the propensity of the virus to invade the lower respiratory tract under inflammatory conditions.","output":"Interferon induction of IFITM proteins promotes infection by human coronavirus OC43."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, distancing measures were enforced to reduce virus spread, which likely had an impact on the overall mental health of the population. AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety and insomnia), and associated risk factors, during a physical distancing period imposed in the first wave of COVID-19. METHOD: During the first month of Portugal's state of emergency, an online survey was created and disseminated through social media channels. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were assessed via self-reported questionnaires. Univariate linear regressions were used to identify associations between the collected variables and mental health outcomes. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for clinical outcomes, with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: We analysed data from 1626 participants: a significant proportion showed depression (30.2%), anxiety (53.1%) and insomnia (36.3%) symptoms. Multivariate regression models showed that being male and working from home were protective for all mental health outcomes analysed, whereas the perception of infection, being under psychiatric care and taking medication were risk factors (P < 0.05). Days in isolation and being unemployed were risk factors for depression and insomnia (P < 0.05). Younger age and being a student were risk factors for depression, whereas being a healthcare professional was protective (P < 0.05). Indirect contact with COVID-19 was a risk factor for anxiety (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related distancing measures were associated with high levels of adverse mental health symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes of rapid transition to TM-based care (video visit followed by in-person visits dedicated to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures when needed) at an academic A/I practice during COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data were compared for patients originally scheduled for in-person visits between March 10, 2020, and April 30, 2020, who completed a video visit instead between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and those who did not. Appointment completion, diagnoses, and drug allergy and skin testing completion were compared for visits between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and 1 year prior (March 10, 2019-June 30, 2019). RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent (265 of 382) of patients originally scheduled between March 10, 2020, and April 30, 2020, were able to complete video visits. Patients who completed video visits were more likely to be white (52% vs 33%; P < .001), English-speaking (96% vs 89%; P = .01), and privately insured (70% vs 54%; P = .004). With TM-based care compared with in-person care, there were significant decreases in environmental and food skin testing completion rates (91% and 92% in 2019 vs 60% and 64% in 2020, respectively, P < .001). Drug allergy testing completed after internal referral remained low but comparable (51% in 2019 vs 52% in 2020). Transitioning nonprocedural visits to video allowed allergen immunotherapy and biologic injection visits to resume at a volume similar to pre-COVID. No COVID-19 infections resulted from in-clinic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although transitioning to TM-based care allowed continued A/I care delivery, strategies are needed to achieve higher testing completion rates and ensure video visits do not exacerbate existing health disparities.","output":"Impact of Rapid Transition to Telemedicine-Based Delivery on Allergy/Immunology Care During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration of Competing Interest statements were not included in published version of the following articles that appeared in previous issues of Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health.

However, glycan analysis has always been a challenge. Here, we would like to present new techniques for glycan fingerprinting based on enzymatic fluorescent labeling and gel electrophoresis. The method is illustrated on SARS2 spike (S) glycoproteins. SARS2, a novel coronavirus and the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has had significant social and economic impacts since the end of 2019. To obtain the N-glycan fingerprint of an S protein, glycans released from the protein are first labeled through enzymatic incorporation of fluorophore-conjugated sialic acid or fucose, then separated by SDS-PAGE, and finally visualized with a fluorescent imager. To identify the labeled glycans of a fingerprint, glycan standards and glycan ladders are enzymatically generated and run alongside the samples as references. By comparing the mobility of a labeled glycan to that of a glycan standard, the identity of glycans maybe determined. O-glycans can also be fingerprinted. Due to the lack of an enzyme for broad O-glycan release, O-glycans on the S protein can be labeled with fluorescent sialic acid and digested with trypsin to obtain labeled glycan peptides that are then separated by gel electrophoresis.

intensity (infection rates equivalent to 0 01, 0 1, and 1 case por 100 inhabitants) and time horizons (1, 3, and 6 months) The results reveal a critical situation in the system for meeting this potential demand, with numerous health micro-regions and macro-regions operating beyond their capacity, compromising the care for patients, especially those with more severe symptoms The study presents three relevant messages First, it is necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the Brazilian population, allowing more time for the reorganization of the supply and relieve the pressure on the health system Second, the expansion of the number of available beds will be the key Even if the private sector helps offset the deficit, the combined supply from the two sectors (public and private) would be insufficient in various macro-regions The construction of field hospitals is important, both in places with a history of &quot;hospital deserts&quot;and in those already pressured by demand The third message involves the regionalized organization of health services, whose design may be adequate in situations of routine demand, but which suffer additional challenges during pandemics, especially if patients have to travel long distances to receive care","output":"Pandemia por COVID-19 no Brasil: anlise da demanda e da oferta de leitos hospitalares e equipamentos de

The purpose of this study was to determine the sources of information and investigate the role of various demographic factorsage, gender, educational attainment and perceived economic levelon sources of information. SUBJECT AND METHODS: An online survey (n = 4624) was conducted on Turkish public during the early stages of the COVID-19. RESULTS: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable sources of information. Higher age, educational attainment and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and postgraduates attended informative meetings and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status, respectively, watched more TV and read more newspapers, while people with low socioeconomic status attended informative meetings less.

We estimated tactile feet sole sensibility through graduated monofilament light touch applied at several hotspots of both feet soles, covering the toes, metatarsal heads, midfoot internal and lateral arches, and heel. Intergroup comparisons per foot sole region indicated significantly lower sensibility for the group with morbid obesity under the fifth and third metatarsal heads, midfoot lateral and internal arches and heel. We found a large variation across the sole regions, with the lowest difference between the obese and lean groups observed under the hallux (18%) and the largest difference observed under the lateral arch of the midfoot (76%). Correlation analyses between body weight and sensibility scores revealed a significant positive correlation among participants who were leaner (rs = 0.56, p = 0.05) but not among participants who were obese (rs = -0.06, p = 0.83). Mainly, our results showed that morbid obesity was associated with significantly higher cutaneous sensibility thresholds, with large variability of the sensibility deficit across different regions of both feet soles.

However, previous abdominal surgery is generally regarded as a contraindication to the laparoscopic approach because it causes intraperitoneal adhesions, which are thought to interfere with subsequent laparoscopic procedures inside the abdominal cavity. Few studies have examined the influence of prior surgery on laparoscopic nephrectomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of previous laparotomy on laparoscopic nephrectomy. METHODS The records of 251 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma at our hospital between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 251 laparoscopic nephrectomy patients, 76 patients (30%) had undergone prior abdominal surgery (surgery group), whereas the remaining 175 patients (70%) had not previously had abdominal surgery (control group). There were no significant differences between the control group and the surgery group with regard to pneumoperitoneum time (143 vs 135 min, P = 0.241) or blood loss (39 vs 36 mL, P = 0.763). Next, we divided the patients into two cohorts based on surgeon experience: 98 patients had been treated by an expert (i.e. someone who performs more than 50 laparoscopic procedures per year) and 153 patients had been treated by a non-expert. There was no significant difference in pneumoperitoneum time between the control and surgery groups in each cohort (treated by experts, 108 vs 103 min; treated by non-experts: 162 vs 166 min).

Considering digitalization as a key strategy for managing reputation, which, in turn, can leverage financial and value performance management, the paper investigates whether and how digital activities might affect banks' reputation. Therefore, this paper proposes the relationship between digitalization and reputation as a lever for performance management and for increasing efficiency. Design/methodology/approach The authors use content analysis to generate a digital disclosure index, categorizing activities human, structural and relational. For banks' reputations, the proxies are a measure of corporate reputation and a reputational risk index. Methodologically the study used multiple case studies, considered as particularly suitable to gain an in-depth understanding of the topic in the case of the five banks. A collection of secondary data and semi-structured interviews are included. Findings Overall, the digitalization-reputation link shows that banks' reputation is variously affected, not only by exposure to risk (including reputational risk) but also by strategic issues such as digitalization and the effectiveness of the corresponding communication. Consequently, banks should view digitalization as a key driver to be considered not in a stand-alone perspective, but in a combined approach. Research limitations/implications Continued research should include the Covid-19 implications. Additionally, it would be important to compare a larger number of banks, with different characteristics, also including variables indicating the corporate governance mechanisms. Practical implications The analysis contributes to fostering scholars' and practitioners' management of the digital transformation challenge that is a current key-factor, capable of increasing banks' value.

To date, specific functions have not been assigned to these UTRs. With reporter assays, we demonstrated that the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) 5-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function. However, the 5-UTRs do differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. Most dramatically, the 5-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a -actin 5-UTR. The L 5-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF (pORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 5-UTR. The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a weak Kozak sequence and suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2 was phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To directly address the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the L uAUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10C100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin.

In this paper, we document the experiences and achievements of the research capacity building efforts at MUST. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive evaluation study which involved document review and in-depth interviews. We used Reach and Effectiveness from the RE-AIM framework to guide the document review, and the organizational theory of implementation effectiveness to guide the in-depth interviews. RESULTS: In the MURTI program, we conducted 17 short courses between August 2015 and July 2021, a total of 6597 attendances were recorded. The most attended courses were responsible conduct of research (n = 826), qualitative research methods (n = 744), and data management (n = 613). Thirty-three fellows were recruited and funded to conduct mentored research leading to 48 publications and 14 extramural grant applications were yielded. From the in-depth interviews, the participants appreciated the research training program, the enhanced research skills attained, and the institutional capacity built. They attributed the success of the program to the training approach of using short courses, readiness of the junior faculty to change, and the supportive environment by the mentors and trainers in the program. CONCLUSION: The D43 TW010128 research training grant-built capacity for the junior faculty at MUST, enhanced their research skills, promoted research capacity institutionally and provided career development for the junior faculty. This was possible due to the positive attitude of the junior faculty (organizational readiness) to change and the supportive environment (mentors and trainers) during implementation of the grant. These two factors provided a favorable institutional climate that guaranteed success of the funding goals.","output":"Mbarara University Research Training Initiative: Experiences and Accomplishments of the MEPI Junior D43 TW010128 Award in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucormycosis has been reported increasingly in patients affected by COVID-19, especially in India where the first cases were described.

COVID-19 has been found adherent to PM2.5 and may be involved in the transmission and the exacerbation of COVID-19 infection, possibly due to PM2.5 adverse influence on respiratory immunity. The PM2.5 levels in underground subways have been found up to 90 times higher than the surface levels. Moreover, the commuter congestion in the presence of such high levels of PM2.5 further encouraged COVID-19 human to human transmission. METHOD: The levels of PM2.5 were retrieved from literature assessing particulate matter PM2.5 measured on subway platforms in two groups of cities. These cities were differentiated by the COVID-19 population percentage mortality rate (0.007% vs 0.09% (p<0.0004) the city population, more than a 10-fold difference. Data regarding the number of stations, length of the networks (km) and the annual ridership were also obtained from literature related to underground commuting. RESULTS: The population percentage mortality related to COVID-19 infection correlated significantly for both minimum (p<0.01) and maximum (p<0.00001) levels of PM2.5. The city subways with low COVID-19 mortality had minimum platform PM2.5 levels of 27.4 (SD+/-17.2g/m3) compared to 63.4g/m3 (SD+/-10.8g/m3) in cities with high COVID-19 associated mortality (p<0.01). Subway maximum levels of PM2.5 in cities with low COVID-19 mortality was 53.4g/m3 (SD+/-21.8g/m3) while that of underground networks with high COVID-19 mortality had maximum platform PM2.5 levels of 172.1g/m3 (SD+/-98g/m3) (p<0.001). The cities with higher COVID-19 mortality had longer networks 230km (SD+/-111km) versus 119km (SD+/-99km) ( p<0.03) and more stations 191 (SD+/-109) versus 102 (SD+/-94) (p<0.047). Although the annual ridership in the cities with the high COVID-19 mortality was higher (1034x106 vs 751x106) this did not achieve statistical significance. The maximum PM2.5 correlated with the number of stations (p<0.045) and the length of the networks (p< 0.044). The minimum PM2.5 did not achieve similar significant correlations to subway variables. Ridership significantly correlated with number of stations (p<0.01) and the length of the network (p<0.02). CONCLUSION: Underground networks may have inherent characteristics accelerating spread of COVID-19 infection and consequent mortality. The highly elevated levels of PM2.5 in overcrowded subways with extensive reach may have acted as a co-factor to disseminate the pandemic.

coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a global testing supply shortage. In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert? Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates.

PURPOSE To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a pharmacy clinical decision support tool designed to increase naloxone coprescription among people at risk for opioid overdose in a large healthcare system. SUMMARY The Military Health System Opioid Registry and underlying presentation layer were used to develop a clinical decision support capability to improve naloxone coprescription at the pharmacy point of care. Pharmacy personnel use a patient identification card barcode scanner or manually enter a patient's identification number to quickly visualize information on a patient's risk for opioid overdose and medical history related to pain and, when appropriate, receive a recommendation to coprescribe naloxone. The tool was made available to military treatment facility pharmacy locations. An interactive dashboard was developed to support monitoring, utilization, and impact on naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose. CONCLUSION Initial implementation of the naloxone tool was slow from a lack of end-user awareness. Efforts to increase utilization were, in part, successful owing to a number of enterprise-wide educational initiatives. In early 2020, the naloxone tool was used in 15% of all opioid prescriptions dispensed at a military pharmacy. Data indicate that the frequency of naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose was significantly higher when the naloxone tool was used than when the tool was not used.","output":"Development, implementation, and evaluation of a clinical decision support tool to improve naloxone coprescription within military health system pharmacies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increase in online activity during the COVID 19 pandemic has generated a surge in network traffic capable of expanding the scope of DDoS attacks. Cyber criminals can now afford to launch massive DDoS attacks capable of degrading the performances of conventional machine learning based IDS models. Hence, there is an urgent need for an effective DDoS attack detective model with the capacity to handle large magnitude of DDoS attack traffic. This study proposes a deep learning based DDoS attack detection system using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed model was evaluated on UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD intrusion datasets, whereby twenty-three (23) and twenty (20) attack features were extracted from UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, respectively using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The results from the proposed model show significant improvement when compared with results from some conventional machine learning techniques such as Na?ve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with accuracies of 94.28% and 90.59% on both datasets, respectively.

Regardless of the fact that existing optical character recognition programmes seem to be quick and effective, the majority of them are not able to correctly recognise text embedded in usual panorama images. The methodology described in this paper is to localise textual image regions and pre-process them using the na?ve Bayesian algorithm. A weighted reading technique is used to generate the correct text data from the complicated image regions. Usually, images hold some disturbance as a result of the fact that filtration is proposed during the early pre-processing step. To restore the image's quality, the input image is processed employing gradient and contrast image methods. Following that, the contrast of the source images would be enhanced using an adaptive image map. The stroke width transform, Gabors transform, and weighted na?ve Bayesian classifier methodologies have been used in complicated degraded images to segment, feature extraction, and detect textual and non-textual elements. Finally, to identify categorised textual data, the confluence of deep neural networks and particle swarm optimisation is being used. The text in the image is transformed into an acoustic output after identification. The dataset IIIT5K is used for the development portion, and the performance of the suggested come up is evaluated using parameters such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.","output":"Deep Learning and Particle Swarm Optimisation-Based Techniques for Visually Impaired Humans' Text Recognition and Identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an attempt to stem the spread of coronavirus, China has shut its wildlife markets for good.

Such consequences are well established in the influenza and flavivirus fields. A first step to establish whether pre-existing responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. We compared serum antibody and memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike (S) proteins from pre-pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using a series of binding and functional assays. We found weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we found stronger evidence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells that were activated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the donors showed varying degrees of cross-reactivity with betacoronaviruses, including SARS and endemic coronaviruses. None of the cross-reactive mAbs were neutralizing except for one that targeted the S2 subunit of the S protein.

Regression analyses tested associations with stress and burnout. Findings: Between May 28 and October 1, 2020, 20,947 healthcare workers responded from 42 organizations (median response rate 20%, Interquartile range 7% to 35%). Sixty one percent reported fear of exposure or transmission, 38% reported anxiety/depression, 43% suffered work overload, and 49% had burnout.

The main objective of this study was to determine the incidence of these infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 and bacterial/fungal infections at the Hospital Clnico Universitario of Valladolid, Spain (March 1CMay 31, 2020). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and predictors of mortality by were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 712 COVID-19 patients, 113 (16%) presented bacterial/fungal coinfections or superinfections. Their median age was 73 years (IQR 57?89) and 59% were men. The profiles of ICU patients (44%) included male, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, leukocytosis, elevated inteleukin-6, with interferon -1b and tocilizumab and superinfection (p < 0.05). Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Superinfections were detected in 11% (80/712) patients. Urinary (53) and RI (39) constituted the majority of superinfections Acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant was the main agent of IR and bacteremia. An outbreak of A. baumannii contributed to this result. Three patients were considered to have probable pulmonary aspergillosis. Mortality was higher in UCI patients (50% vs. 29%, p = 0.028). The predictive factors of mortality included being a male with various comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, bacteremia and superinfections from A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of A. baumannii was a determining factor in the increases of the incidence of infection and the morbi-mortality of ICU patients.","output":"Bacterial/fungal infection in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in the Community of Castilla y Len, Spain()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper the risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant of passengers sharing a car cabin with an infected subject for a 30-min journey is estimated through an integrated approach combining a recently developed predictive emission-to-risk approach and a validated CFD numerical model numerically solved using the open-source OpenFOAM software. Different scenarios were investigated to evaluate the effect of the infected subject position within the car cabin, the air flow rate of the HVAC system, the HVAC ventilation mode, and the expiratory activity (breathing vs. speaking). The numerical simulations here performed reveal that the risk of infection is strongly influenced by several key parameter: as an example, under the same ventilation mode and emitting scenario, the risk of infection ranges from zero to roughly 50% as a function of the HVAC flow rate. The results obtained also demonstrate that: (i) simplified zero-dimensional approaches limit proper evaluation of the risk in such confined spaces, conversely, (ii) CFD approaches are needed to investigate the complex fluid-dynamics in similar indoor environments, and, thus, (iii) the risk of infection in indoor environments characterized by fixed seats can be in principle controlled by properly designing the flow patterns of the environment.","output":"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 in a car cabin assessed through 3D CFD simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, the dramatic rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among important human bacterial pathogens is reaching a state of global crisis threatening a return to the pre-antibiotic era.

Several licensed vaccines, targeting both bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi) and viral (influenza virus, rotavirus) human pathogens, have already proven their anti-AMR benefits by reducing unwarranted antibiotic consumption and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and by promoting herd immunity. A number of new investigational vaccines, with a potential to reduce the spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, are also in various stages of clinical development. Nevertheless, vaccines as a tool to combat AMR remain underappreciated and unfortunately underutilized.

As these patients were originally not included in the registration trials, fear related to vaccine side-effects and disease worsening was one of the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Herein we report the safety profile of the prospective, multicenter, national VAX4FRAIL study (NCT04848493) to evaluate vaccines in a large trans-disease cohort of patients with solid or hematological malignancies, neurological and rheumatological diseases. MethodsBetween March 3rd and September 2nd, 2021, 566 patients were evaluable for safety endpoint: 105 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine and 461 the BNT162b2 vaccine. Frail patients were defined per protocol as patients under treatment with hematological malignancies (131), solid tumors (191), immune-rheumatological diseases (86), and neurological diseases (158), including multiple sclerosis and generalized myasthenia. The impact of the vaccination on the health status of patients was assessed through a questionnaire focused on the first week after each vaccine dose. ResultsThe most frequently reported moderate-severe adverse events were pain at the injection site (60.3% after the first dose, 55.4% after the second), fatigue (30.1% - 41.7%), bone pain (27.4% - 27.2%) and headache (11.8% - 18.9%). Risk factors associated with the occurrence of severe symptoms after vaccine administration were identified through a multivariate logistic regression analysis: age was associated with severe fever presentation (younger patients vs. middle-aged vs. older ones), females presented a higher probability of severe pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and bone pain; the mRNA-1237 vaccine was associated with a higher probability of severe pain at the injection site and fever. After the first dose, patients presenting a severe symptom were at a relevant risk of recurrence of the same severe symptom after the second one. Overall, 11 patients (1.9%) after the first dose and 7 (1.2%) after the second one required to postpone or suspend the disease-specific treatment. Finally, 2 fatal events occurred among our 566 patients. These two events were considered unrelated to the vaccine.

However, the underlying mechanism by which Leu alleviates the virus infection has not been fully characterized. In particular, how Leu impacts TGEV replication through mTOR signaling has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we found that TGEV proliferated efficiently in intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cells) as evidenced by the increase in viral contents by flow cytometry, the inhibition of cell proliferation by CCK-8 assay as well as the reduction of PCNA level by western blot. Besides, western blot analysis showed that STAT1 expression was markedly reduced in TGEV-infected cells. The results of ELISA revealed the inhibition of ISGs (ISG56, MxA, and PKR) expressions by TGEV infection. TGEV-induced mTOR and its downstream p70 S6K and 4E-BP1, STAT1 and ISGs downregulation were blocked by an mTOR activator-MHY1485 but not by an mTOR inhibitor-RAPA. Concurrently, mTOR activation by MHY1485 reduced the contents of TGEV and vice versa. Furthermore, Leu reversed the inhibition of STAT1 and ISGs by activating mTOR and its downstream p70 S6K and 4E-BP1 in TEGV-infected cells.

Located within the lifelong learning domain, which facilitates both the resolution of challenges and adjustment to the vagaries of living throughout a lifetime, ALE is indispensable within the framework of the United Nations 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article identifies four factors which are currently responsible for the poor funding of ALE. These factors are: (1) the worlds obsession with the provision of school education; (2) the lack of adequate instruments to work out ALEs returns on investment; (3) the hope that employers will ultimately supply ALE; and (4) the assumption that an expansion of formal schooling will eventually lead to the establishment of literate societies free of inter-generational crises. Since ALE is generally framed as a broad literacy education project, the author undertakes a review of literacy education costing. This leads him to posit that quality literacy education can be supplied at a unit cost ranging between USD 150 and USD 250 annually within any Global Alliance for Literacy (GAL) country.

In the context of the EFFICHRONIC project, we evaluated the efficacy of CDSMP in relieving frailty, as assessed by the self-administered version of Multidimensional Prognostic Index (SELFY-MPI), identifying also potential predictors of better response over 6-month follow-up. METHODS: The SELFY-MPI explores mobility, basal and instrumental activities of daily living (Barthel mobility, ADL, IADL), cognition (Test Your Memory-TYM Test), nutrition (Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form-MNA-SF), comorbidities, medications, and socio-economic conditions (social-familiar evaluation scale-SFES). Participants were stratified in three groups according to the 6-month change of SELFY-MPI: those who improved after CDSMP ( SELFY-MPI < 0), those who remained unchanged ( SELFY-MPI = 0), and those who worsened ( SELFY-MPI > 0). Multivariable logistic regression was modeled to identify predictors of SELFY-MPI improvement. RESULTS: Among 270 participants (mean age = 61.45 years, range = 26C93 years; females = 78.1%) a benefit from CDSMP intervention, in terms of decrease in the SELFY-MPI score, was observed in 32.6% of subjects. SELFY-MPI improvement was found in participants with higher number of comorbidities (1C2 chronic diseases: adjusted odd ratio (aOR)=2.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.01, 5.58; ? 3 chronic diseases: aOR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.25, 8.90 vs no chronic disease), poorer cognitive performance (TYM ? 42: aOR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.12, 5.19 vs TYM > 42) or higher risk of malnutrition (MNA-SF ? 11: aOR = 6.11, 95% CI = 3.15, 11.83 vs MNA-SF > 11).

Understanding the role of airline travel in large-scale influenza spread is especially important given the mounting threat of an influenza pandemic. Several recent simulation studies have concluded that air travel restrictions may not have a significant impact on the course of a pandemic. Here, we assess, with empirical data, the role of airline volume on the yearly inter-regional spread of influenza in the United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We measured rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the United States for nine seasons, from 1996 to 2005 using weekly influenza and pneumonia mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seasonality was characterized by band-pass filtering. We found that domestic airline travel volume in November (mostly surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday) predicts the rate of influenza spread (r (2) = 0.60; p = 0.014). We also found that international airline travel influences the timing of influenza mortality (r (2) = 0.59; p = 0.016). The flight ban in the US after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent depression of the air travel market, provided a natural experiment for the evaluation of flight restrictions; the decrease in air travel was associated with a delayed and prolonged influenza season. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first empirical evidence for the role of airline travel in long-range dissemination of influenza. Our results suggest an important influence of international air travel on the timing of influenza introduction, as well as an influence of domestic air travel on the rate of inter-regional influenza spread in the US.

However, there is limited specific data on how factors such as demographics, socioeconomic resources and the caregiving context may influence caregivers use of digital support services. The aim of this study is to identify associations between informal caregivers characteristics and the use of the internet to access digital support services in two countries: Italy and Sweden. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 663 respondents who have access to the internet participated in a cross-sectional survey by completing the online questionnaire. Respondents were recruited by the Italian National Institute of Health and Science on Ageing and the Swedish Family Care Competence Centre. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of caregivers frequent use of the internet to access digital support services. RESULTS: Educational attainment (OR 3.649, 95% CI 1.424 to 9.350, p=0.007), hours per week spent caring (OR 2.928, 95% CI 1.481 to 5.791, p=0.002), total household income (OR 0.378, 95% CI 0.149 to 0.957, p=0.040), care recipient relationship to the caregiver (OR 2.895, 95% CI 1.037 to 8.083, p=0.042) and gender of care recipient (OR 0.575, 95% CI 0.356 to 0.928, p=0.023) were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the Italian caregivers group.

While controlled clinical trials of psychedelics have signaled benefits for treating substance use disorders, this area has not been well studied in the context of naturalistic psychedelic use. This study sought to investigate the possible relationship between recent naturalistic psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use among people who use drugs (PWUD). METHODS Data (2006-2018) were drawn from three harmonized prospective cohorts of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM) to estimate the independent association between psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use. RESULTS Among 3813 PWUD at baseline, 1093 (29%) reported daily use of illicit opioids and 229 (6%) reported psychedelic use in the past six months.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of these factors on fresh sperm motility in piracanjuba ( Brycon orbignyanus ) and streaked prochilod ( Prochilodus lineatus ). Twenty four media, as a combination of six extenders (BTS? and glucose solutions at 270, 315 and 360 mOsm/kg) with the CPAs DMSO, methanol, methyl glycol (MG) and a control without CPA, were prepared. Immediately after dilution, samples were observed under a light microscope to confirm whether different extender-CPA combinations would suppress the initiation of sperm motility. Motility was then triggered in 92 mOsm/kg NaCl and evaluated immediately after dilution (non-equilibrated samples) and after a 30-min equilibration time at 4C for motility rate and motility quality score (0 = no movement; 5 = rapidly swimming sperm). In both species, motility was initiated in all samples diluted in BTS-270-control, Glu-270-MG, Glu- 270-control and in all combinations containing DMSO. In B. orbignyanus , motility rate (77 to 92%) and motility quality score (3.3 to 4.7) of non-equilitrated samples was not significantly affected by any parameter. After 30 min, however, motility quality score decreased in most of the samples, mainly when diluted in BTS? (3.3 to 4.2).

Still, little is known about the impact of COVID-19-induced microscale damage in the lung on global lung dynamics. This review summarizes the key histological features of SARS-CoV-2 infected alveoli and links the findings to structural tissue changes and surfactant dysfunction affecting tissue mechanical behavior similar to changes seen in other lung injury. Along with typical findings of diffuse alveolar damage affecting the interstitium of the alveolar walls and blood-gas barrier in the alveolar airspace, COVID-19 can cause extensive microangiopathy in alveolar capillaries that further contribute to mechanical changes in the tissues and may differentiate it from previously studied infectious lung injury. Understanding microlevel damage impact on tissue mechanics allows for better understanding of macroscale respiratory dynamics. Knowledge gained from studies into the relationship between microscale and macroscale lung mechanics can allow for optimized treatments to improve patient outcomes in case of COVID-19 and future respiratory-spread pandemics.","output":"Implications of microscale lung damage for COVID-19 pulmonary ventilation dynamics: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The main objective was to evaluate the precision of the Modified Lung Ultrasound (MLUS score) for predicting the need for respiratory support in the first 48 hours in patients with dyspnea due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The secondary objectives were 1) to compare the MLUS and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), as well as the combination of both scores, as predictors of severity according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement; and 2) to compare severity assessed by ultrasound scoring to severity assessed by lung computed tomography (CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS Multicenter prospective observational cohort study conducted from March 30 to April 30, 2020, in 2 university hospitals. Adult patients with dyspnea due to COVID-19 were included. An initial lung ultrasound was performed, and the results of MLUS, NEW2, and lung CT evaluations were recorded. Patients were classified by risk according to the WHO scale at 48 hours, as follows: low risk (score less than 5) or high risk (score of 5 or more). RESULTS A total of 100 patients were included: 35 (35%) were classified as low risk and 65 (65%) as high risk. The correlation between the MLUS and WHO assessments was positive and very high (Spearman rank correlation ?? = 0.832; P .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the MLUS, NEW2 and combined ultrasound scores, in relation to prediction of risk classification were, respectively, 0.96 (0.93-0.99), 0.89 (0.82-0.95) and 0.98 (0.96-1.0).

Despite this general trend, ?-trefoils have emerged as an uncommon counterexample: They are an isolated protein lineage for which few, if any, sequence or structure associations to other lineages have been identified. If ?-trefoils are, in fact, remote islands in sequence-structure space, it implies that the oligomerizing peptide that founded the ?-trefoil lineage itself arose de novo. To better understand ?-trefoil evolution, and to probe the limits of fragment sharing across the protein universe, we identified both '?-trefoil bridging themes' (evolutionarily-related sequence segments) and '?-trefoil-like motifs' (structure motifs with a hallmark feature of the ?-trefoil architecture) in multiple, ostensibly unrelated, protein lineages. The success of the present approach stems, in part, from considering ?-trefoil sequence segments or structure motifs rather than the ?-trefoil architecture as a whole, as has been done previously. The newly uncovered inter-lineage connections presented here suggest a novel hypothesis about the origins of the ?-trefoil fold itself-namely, that it is a derived fold formed by 'budding' from an Immunoglobulin-like ?-sandwich protein. These results demonstrate how the evolution of a folded domain from a peptide need not be a signature of antiquity and underpin an emerging truth: few protein lineages escape nature's sewing table.","output":"Evidence for the emergence of ?-trefoils by 'Peptide Budding' from an IgG-like ?-sandwich"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The confinement of the Spanish population due to the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a change in patterns of electronic device usage, leading to an increase in internet traffic.

Public information created awareness as well as concern in the general population. There has been a reported decrease in the number of patients attending emergency departments (ED) during the pandemic. This is the first study to determine differences in the types of presenting illnesses, severity, and rate of resultant surgical intervention during the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We carried out a retrospective, observational cohort study comparing two groups of patients attending the ED at our tertiary-care academic hospital. A historical comparison cohort was obtained by reviewing the number of patients referred by the ED for abdominal CT between March 15 and April 15, 2020, compared with March 15 and April 15, 2019. CT reports were reviewed; primary pathologies, complications, and subsequent surgical intervention were documented and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In all, 733 patients were included in the 2019 cohort, and 422 patients were included in the 2020 cohort. In 2019, 32.7% had positive CT findings, increasing to 50.5% in 2020. The number of complications increased from 7.9% to 19.7%. The rate requiring surgical intervention increased from 26.3% to 47.6% in 2020. CONCLUSION: To date, there is little published data regarding the presentation and severity of illnesses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This information has important public health implications, highlighting the need to educate patients to continue to present to hospital services during such crises, including if a purported second wave of COVID-19 arises.","output":"Collateral Damage: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Acute Abdominal Emergency Presentations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To give an overview of the current knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on otolaryngology clinical practice.

Kizzy Corbett grew up in a small town in North Carolina. She was drawn toward science at a young age. By the age of 16, she was already recognized for her academic talent and potential as a scientist;the American Chemical Society recruited her to participate in a two-year enrichment program for talented disadvantaged high school students. She went on to get a double degree in Biological Sciences and Sociology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. During this time, she was selected as a Meyerhoff scholar and recognized as an NIH scholar. As an NIH scholar, she spent her summers working with Dr. Barney Graham on Respiratory Syncytia Virus (RSV) at the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) within the NIH. Following this, she pursued her Ph.D. degree with Professor Aravinda de Silva at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where she studied immune responses to dengue virus. Subsequently, she returned to the VRC and focused on mechanisms of viral immunity in order to develop vaccines for influenza and coronavirus. As the COVID-19 pandemic developed in December 2019, she started focusing on the virus responsible for the outbreak, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV-2 virus. When the RNA genome sequence of SARS CoV-2 became available in early January of 2020, she was asked to lead a group of highly talented scientists to develop the preclinical work for a novel vaccine to the SARS CoV-2, mRNA-1273. Because of her extensive expertise in mechanisms of viral immunity, her group was able to develop a successful vaccine. In an unprecedented effort, her group was able to bring the vaccine to phase 1 clinical trials in just 66 days.

However, rigorous methodological expectations and an ever-expanding body of literature present challenges for researchers to produce timely, high-quality SLRs, which remain up to date at the time of HTA submissions, particularly in rapidly evolving therapeutic areas. Concept: Living systematic reviews are an emerging approach for performing regular updates, with pilot projects published by Cochrane, and more recently a collaboration with the World Health Organisation on the COVID-NMA initiative. To our knowledge, these methods have not yet been adapted and applied in a non-Cochrane setting assessing the relative efficacy and safety of multiple interventions and informing NMA preceding HTA submissions. This concept poster will describe key methodological considerations when planning an ongoing SLR approach to support HTA submissions. RECOMMENDATIONS: ? Researchers should prepare a comprehensive, transparent search protocol covering the duration of the ongoing SLR, including consideration of: o Relevant interventions and comparators, including pipeline therapies o Date limits and update frequency o Timing of conference proceedings o Capturing revisions to trial registry data available on Internet sources and publication of results o Record management and plans for clearly reporting methodology and results ? Resource planning should consider any overlaps between searches and potential for increased publications following conferences ? Future requirements should be considered to minimize protocol amendments ? Efficiency and quality may be improved through research team continuity ? NMA should be repeated less frequently, on an as-needed basis, with consideration of the impact on the rate of false-positive results Conclusions: Ongoing SLRs can provide a powerful, efficient tool in preparation for upcoming HTA submissions.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)]/Mas axis is a negative regulator of the classical renin-angiotensin system. In order to investigate the antioxidant effect of Ang (1-7) on pancreatic  cells, INS-1 cells were cultured and oxidative stress was induced by treatment with H(2)O(2). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and glucose-stimulated calcium (GSCa) responses in  cells were determined following treatment with Ang (1-7). It was observed that H(2)O(2) significantly impaired the insulin secreting function, increased the production of ROS, and also decreased the levels of GSCa and MMP. Pre-treatment with Ang (1-7) alleviated these effects and treatment with A779 [antagonist of Ang (1-7)] prevented the effects of Ang (1-7).

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes including mortality and viral shedding period in COVID-19 patients with cancer in Japan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 32 patients with a history of cancer who were referred to our hospital between January 31, 2020 and May 25, 2020. We evaluated the association between clinical outcomes and potential prognostic factors using univariate analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 74.5 (range 24-90) years and 22 patients (69%) were men. A total of 11 patients (34%) died. Our analyses demonstrated that the mortality was significantly associated with lymphocyte count, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein on admission. The median period between illness onset and the first effective negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was 22 days (interquartile range 18-25) in survivors. Of four patients with hematological malignancy who developed COVID-19 within the rest period of chemotherapy, three died and the other patient, who received bendamustine plus rituximab therapy, had the longest duration of viral shedding (56 days). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that the risk factors for mortality previously reported in general COVID-19 patients, including lymphocytopenia, were also effective in cancer patients.

Our previous epidemiological study reported a positive association of urinary levels of pyrethroid metabolites with the risk of primary ovarian insufficiency in women, suggesting that pyrethroid exposure may be a potential risk factor for female ovarian health. In this study, female mice at gestational, lactational or peripubertal stages were exposed to eight most commonly used pyrethroids at the doses of acceptable daily intake (ADI) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Gestational exposure to eight pyrethroids at ADI doses led to a significant decrease in the number of primary follicles in female offspring on postnatal day (PND) 3, and an increase in the number of atretic follicles and granulosa cell apoptosis, as well as lower estrogen and higher follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in adult female offspring. Lactational and peripubertal exposure to pyrethroid mixture had no significant effects on follicular development and ovarian functions. The data of high-throughput microRNA (miRNA) sequencing showed that 23 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the ovaries of female offspring mice on PND 1 after gestational exposure to pyrethroid mixture. The results of qPCR confirmed that miR-152-3p, miR-450b-3p and miR-196a-5p were significantly upregulated in the neonatal ovaries in the exposed group. The bioinformatic analysis indicates that the modification of the expression of ovarian miRNAs by pyrethroid exposure may disrupt the key biological processes (such as mRNA processing) and major signaling pathways (such as PI3K/Akt pathway, adipocytokine pathway and GnRH pathway) governing follicular development and ovarian functions. This study first reported that gestational exposure of female mice to multiple pyrethroids at the recommended human safe doses had irreversible adverse effects on the ovaries in female offspring in adulthood through regulating the expression of miRNAs during early developmental stages.","output":"Exposure to multiple pyrethroid insecticides affects ovarian follicular development via modifying microRNA expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Specific and older age-associated comorbidities increase mortality risk in severe forms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid-April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world's student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. OBJECTIVES: To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, or developing COVID-19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed-methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission-related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health-related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). MAIN RESULTS: We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Studies conducted in real-world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission-related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.","output":"Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radii of Cu+, Ag+, Au+ and Tl+ cations are determined by the additive method from interatomic distances in molecular and/or crystalline halides, oxides, chalcogenides and cyanides with different coordinations of atoms, and then recalculated for the 6-coordination number.

The presence of the pre-existing cardiac disease is associated with an increased likelihood of severe clinical course and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Besides, current evidence indicates that a significant number of patients with COVID-19 also exhibit cardiovascular involvement even in the absence of known cardiac risk factors. Therefore, there is a need to understand the underlying mechanisms and genetic predispositions that explain cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19. Objectives: In silico analysis of publicly available datasets to decipher the molecular basis, potential pathways, and the role of the endothelium in the pathogenesis of cardiac and vascular injuries in COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Consistent significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by endothelium and peripheral immune cells were identified in five microarray transcriptomic profiling datasets in patients with venous thromboembolism VTE, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and/or cardiogenic shock (main cardiovascular injuries related to COVID-19) compared to healthy controls. The identified genes were further examined in the publicly available transcriptomic dataset for cell/tissue specificity in lung tissue, in different ethnicities and in SARS-CoV-2 infected vs. mock-infected lung tissues and cardiomyocytes. Results: We identified 36 DEGs in blood and endothelium known to play key roles in endothelium and vascular biology, regulation of cellular response to stress as well as endothelial cell migration. Some of these genes were upregulated significantly in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung tissues. On the other hand, some genes with cardioprotective functions were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cardiomyocytes.

This paper reviews the evolution of packaging over the last century through a compilation of scientific literature on e-commerce packaging focusing on its environmental side. The primary aims were to identify research gaps in e-commerce packaging and to propose new research lines aimed at reducing its environmental impact. A systematic search of abstracts was conducted to identify articles dealing with sustainability in e-commerce packaging in order to better understand changes in materials and formats, identify problems such as oversizing and allow prospective readers to become acquainted with the latest innovations in materials, sustainability and logistics. Based on existing research, packaging materials and technology evolved rapidly until the 1990s. Later, however, it has become increasingly difficult to further reduce their cost and environmental impact. Also, some packaging products continue to be made from non-renewable materials and thus restrict growth of e-commerce. Further research is needed with a view to producing new packages from renewable sources such as cellulose-containing materials, which are widely available in nature, or from recycled cellulose-based materials such as cartonboard. Improving distribution processes with new, more effective tools could additionally help alleviate the environmental impact of packaging. Similarly, new production processes such as additive manufacturing and 3D printing might help optimize package volume and shape, thereby facilitating more sustainable production through, for example, reduced CO(2) emissions.

The potential of intracellular antibodies for the systematic study of the proteome has been made possible by the development of new experimental strategies that allow the selection of antibodies under conditions of intracellular expression. The Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology (IACT) is an in vivo two-hybrid-based method originally developed for the selection of antibodies readily folded for ectopic expression. IACT has been used for the rapid and effective identification of novel antigenCantibody pairs in intracellular compartments and for the in vivo identification of epitopes recognized by selected intracellular antibodies. IACT opens the way to the use of intracellular antibody technology for large-scale applications in proteomics. In its present format, its use is however somewhat limited by the need of a preselection of the input phage antibody libraries on protein antigens or by the construction of an antibody library from mice immunized against the target protein(s), to provide an enriched input library to compensate for the suboptimal efficiency of transformation of the yeast cells. These enrichment steps require expressing the corresponding proteins, which represents a severe bottleneck for the scaling up of the technology.

DESIGN: This work is based on data collected by the National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) which collates data on all children who die in England. The number of deaths, and their characteristics, from 1st April 2020 until 31st of March 2021 (2020-21), were compared to those from the same period of 2019-20. Relative risk and excess mortality were derived for deaths in 2020-21 vs 2019-20. SETTING: All deaths reported to NCMD in England of children under 18 years of age, between April 2019 and March 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 6490 deaths of children, under the age of 18 years, reported to the NCMD over the study period. RESULTS: Children who died between April 2020 and March 2021 had similar demographics to those who died in 2019-20. Overall, there were 356 (198 to 514) fewer deaths in 2020-21 than in 2019-20 (RR 0.90 (0.85-0.94), p<0.001). Repeating the analysis by category of death, suggested that deaths from infection (RR 0.49 (0.38-0.64)) and from other underlying medical conditions (RR 0.75 (0.68-0.82)) were lower in 2020-21 than 2019-20, and weak evidence (p=0.074) that this was also true of deaths from substance abuse.

Currently, experimental characterization of these properties is the most accurate method, however, this is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. A number of computational methods have been developed in this context but most of the existing PLI prediction heavily depends on 2D protein sequence data. Here, we present a novel parallel graph neural network (GNN) to integrate knowledge representation and reasoning for PLI prediction to perform deep learning guided by expert knowledge and informed by 3D structural data. We develop two distinct GNN architectures, GNNF is the base implementation that employs distinct featurization to enhance domain-awareness, while GNNP is a novel implementation that can predict with no prior knowledge of the intermolecular interactions. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrated that GNN can successfully capture the binary interactions between ligand and proteins 3D structure with 0.979 test accuracy for GNNF and 0.958 for GNNP for predicting activity of a protein-ligand complex. These models are further adapted for regression tasks to predict experimental binding affinities and pIC50 is crucial for drugs potency and efficacy. We achieve a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.66 and 0.65 on experimental affinity and 0.50 and 0.51 on pIC50 with GNNF and GNNP, respectively, outperforming similar 2D sequence-based models. Our method can serve as an interpretable and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tool for predicted activity, potency, and biophysical properties of lead candidates. To this end, we show the utility of GNNP on SARS-Cov-2 protein targets by screening a large compound library and comparing our prediction with the experimentally measured data.","output":"Decoding the Protein-ligand Interactions Using Parallel Graph Neural Networks (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that also has an immunomodulatory effect and is involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. This study aimed to clarify the role of the (2)-adrenoreceptor in the norepinephrine-mediated modulation of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon- (IFN-) production, which play a critical pathogenetic role in MS. CD4(+) T cells obtained from twenty-five relapsing-remitting MS patients and sixteen healthy subjects were cultured ex vivo with norepinephrine and/or (2)-adrenoreceptor antagonist or agonist, followed by a cytokine production analysis using ELISA. Norepinephrine suppressed IL-17 and IFN- production by the anti-CD3/anti-CD28-microbead-stimulated CD4(+) T cells in both groups. Blockade of the (2)-adrenoreceptor with the specific antagonist ICI 118.551 enhanced norepinephrine-mediated IL-17 suppression but decreased its inhibitory effect on IFN- production in MS patients. In contrast, the (2)-adrenoreceptor agonist formoterol did not influence norepinephrines inhibitory effect on cytokine production in both groups. The blockade of the (2)-adrenoreceptor, even in the absence of exogenous norepinephrine, suppressed IL-17 production but did not influence IFN- production in both groups. Conversely, (2)-adrenoreceptor activation by formoterol decreased IFN- production and did not affect IL-17 production in both groups. These data illustrate the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on IL-17 and IFN- production by CD4(+) T cells in MS. The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on IFN- production by CD4(+) T cells in MS could be mediated via (2)-adrenoreceptor activation.","output":"The Dual Role of the (2)-Adrenoreceptor in the Modulation of IL-17 and IFN- Production by T Cells in Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies are versatile proteins that bind to pathogens like viruses and stimulate the adaptive immune system.

In contrast, we propose to co-design the sequence and 3D structure of CDRs as graphs. Our model unravels a sequence autoregressively while iteratively refining its predicted global structure. The inferred structure in turn guides subsequent residue choices. For efficiency, we model the conditional dependence between residues inside and outside of a CDR in a coarse-grained manner.

Lung function was evaluated in 300 males divided into three groups: control (group1), auto mechanics in stand-alone auto repair shops (group 2) and auto mechanics working in the vicinity of spray painting shops (group 3). Each group consisted of 100 subjects. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in the first second expressed as percentage of FVC (FEV1%) were assessed using a Vitalograph spirometer. Percentage oxygen saturation was evaluated using a pulse oximeter. Results showed no significant differences in age, weight and height among various groups. FVC was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p< 0.05 and p<0.001 respectively) compared to control but not between groups 2 and 3. FEV1 was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (P <0.001 each) compared with control but not significantly different between groups 2 and 3.

Patient demographics, cardiovascular comorbidities, and laboratory values were examined. Elevated TN and BNP were defined as &gt;0.02 ng/mL and &gt;150 ng/L, respectively. Primary outcomes included ICU admission and mortality. The presence of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) was analyzed to evaluate for relative effect on clinical outcomes. Chi-square and multinomial regression models were utilized to evaluate the association between biomarkers and clinical outcomes.Results: 290 patients were identified with a median age of 62 and the majority were male (52.4%), Black (71.3%), and had CVD risk factors (72.1%). ICU admission occurred in 88 (30.3%) while death occurred in 74 (25.5%) individuals. Patients with both an elevated TN and CVD were more likely to experience ICU admission or death (OR=2.55, p=0.017) while patients with both elevated TN and elevated BNP had markedly increased odds of ICU admission or death (OR=7.53, p&lt;0.001).

FINDINGS: Among the 222 patients included, 174 (78%) received antibiotic therapy. The univariate analysis showed that patients who received antibiotic therapy were significantly older, frailer and had more severe presentation at admission compared with patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy. Unfavourable outcomes were more common in patients who received antibiotic therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-8.11; P = 0.04].

Some models that account for the deceased, quarantined or social distancing functions were also presented. However, in any local space the real data reveals that the effects of lock-down and traveling are significant in decreasing and increasing the impact of this virus respectively. Here, discrete and continuum models for the dynamics of this virus are suggested. The continuum dynamical model is studied in detail. The present model deals with exposed, infected, recovered and deceased individuals (EIRD), which accounts for the health isolation and travelers (HIT) effects. Up to now no exact solutions of the parametric-dependent, nonlinear dynamical system NLDS were found. In this work, our objective is to find the exact solutions of a NLDS. To this issue, a novel approach is presented where a NLDS is recast to a linear dynamical system LDS. This is done by implementing the unified method (UM), with auxiliary equations, which are taken coupled linear ODE's (LDS). Numerical results of the exact solutions are evaluated, which can be applied to data in a local space (or anywhere) when the initial data for the IRD are known. Here, as an example, initial conditions for the components in the model equation of COVID-19, are taken from the real data in Egypt. The results of susceptible, infected, recovered and deceased people are computed. The comparison between the computed results and the real data shows an agreement up to a relative error 1 0 - 3 . On the other hand it is remarked that locking-down plays a dominant role in decreasing the number of infected people. The equilibrium states are determined and it is found that they are stable. This reveals a relevant result that the COVID 19 can endemic in the case of a disturbance in the number of the exposed people. This result can be interpreted as in what follows. When a disturbance occurs in the exposed number increases, so the number of infected people increases. Or COVID-19 is endemic. This result is, globally, valid. Furthermore, initial states control is analyzed, where region of initial conditions for infected and exposed is determined.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised. There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. Material and methods: Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/ Vina, a computational docking program. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs - favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir - were used as standards for comparison. Results: The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were -6.8, -5.8, -7.9, -7.9, -7.0, -7.7, -6.6, -8.2, -7.4, -7.7, and -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds. Conclusions: These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors.

Though great improvement in the recognition performances have been achieved, when under some specific conditions like faces with occlusions, the performance would suffer a severe drop. Occlusion is one of the most significant reasons for the performance degrade of the existing general face recognition systems. The biggest problem in occluded face recognition (OFR) lies in the lack of the occluded face data. To mitigate this problem, this paper has proposed one new OFR network DOMG-OFR (Dynamic Occlusion Mask Generator based Occluded Face Recognition), which keeps trying to generate the most informative occluded face training samples on feature level dynamically, in this way, the recognition model would always be fed with the most valuable training samples so as to save the labor in preparing the synthetic data while simultaneously improving the training efficiency. Besides, this paper also proposes one new module called Decision Module (DM) in an attempt to combine both the merits of the two mainstream methodologies in OFR which are face image reconstruction based methodologies and the face feature filtering based methodologies. Furthermore, to enable the existing face deocclusion methods that mostly target at near frontal faces to work well on faces under large poses, one head pose aware deocclusion pipeline based on the Condition Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) is proposed.

METHODS The sources of information used by the epidemiological surveillance of the municipality for COVID-19 were identified and the temporal distribution and interval for detection of confirmed cases of the disease were analyzed. RESULTS The city's epidemiological surveillance uses outpatient, hospital, public and private laboratory notifications as data sources. For reporting COVID-19 cases in official information systems, there is also an active search of laboratory results linked to suspected deaths investigated. From January to April 2020, 1,449 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 were reported, the first case being detected in late February 2020. Of the total 1,025 laboratory samples of cases hospitalized after the 8th epidemiological week, 87 (8.5%) of COVID-19 cases were confirmed. The median time between the onset of symptoms and the release of laboratory results was 12 days for the analyzed period. CONCLUSION Epidemiological surveillance uses several data sources to monitor and analyze the transmission of COVID-19. The timeliness of this system to detect cases of the disease is compromised by the delay in the release of laboratory results, which has been a considerable challenge for adequate surveillance.","output":"The importance of surveillance in cases of and mortality from the COVID-19 epidemic in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene-editing techniques are becoming powerful tools for modifying target genes in organisms. Although several methods have been reported that detect mutations at targeted loci induced by the CRISPR/Cas system in different organisms, they are semiquantitative and have difficulty in the detection of mutants in processed food samples containing low initial concentrations of DNA and may not accurately quantify editing frequency, especially at very low frequencies in a complex polyploid plant genome. In this study, we developed a duplexed dPCR-based method for the detection and evaluation of gene-editing frequencies in plants. We described the design, performance, accurate quantification, and comparison with other detection systems. The results show that the dPCR-based method is sensitive to different kinds of gene-editing mutations induced by gene-editing. Moreover, the method is applicable to polyploid plants and processed food samples containing low initial concentrations of DNA. Compared with qPCR and NGS-based methods, the dPCR method has a lower limit of detection (LOD) of the editing frequency and a better relationship with the expected editing frequency in detecting the edited region of gene-edited rice samples. Taken together, the duplexed dPCR assay is accurate and precise, and it will be a powerful tool for the detection and evaluation of gene-editing frequencies in plants in gene-editing technology.","output":"Accurate Detection and Evaluation of the Gene-Editing Frequency in Plants Using Droplet Digital PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To reduce COVID-19 infection rates during the initial stages of the pandemic, the UK Government mandated a strict period of restriction on freedom of movement or lockdown. For young people, closure of schools and higher education institutions and social distancing rules may have been particularly challenging, coming at a critical time in their lives for social and emotional development. This study explored young peoples experiences of the UK Governments initial response to the pandemic and related government messaging. METHODS: This qualitative study combines data from research groups at the University of Southampton, University of Edinburgh and University College London. Thirty-six online focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 150 young people (Southampton: n = 69; FGD = 7; Edinburgh: n = 41; FGD = 5; UCL: n = 40; FGD = 24). Thematic analysis was conducted to explore how young people viewed the governments response and messaging and to develop recommendations for how to best involve young people in addressing similar crises in the future. RESULTS: The abrupt onset of lockdown left young people shocked, confused and feeling ignored by government and media messaging. Despite this, they were motivated to adhere to government advice by the hope that life might soon return to normal. They felt a responsibility to help with the pandemic response, and wanted to be productive with their time, but saw few opportunities to volunteer. CONCLUSIONS: Young people want to be listened to and feel they have a part to play in responding to a national crisis such as the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the likelihood of disenfranchising the next generation, Government and the media should focus on developing messaging that reflects young peoples values and concerns and to provide opportunities for young people to become involved in responses to future crises.","output":"Young peoples experiences of COVID-19 messaging at the start of the UK lockdown: lessons for positive engagement and information sharing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Syncytium formation induced in Vero cells by IBV-Beaudette was optimal at pH 6.7 and absent at pH 7.5.

DESIGN: Nationwide case-control study. SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All Danish children born from 1997 to 2014 and followed for asthma onset and persistent wheezing from age 1 year to 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Onset of asthma and persistent wheezing. RESULTS: A higher incidence of asthma was found in children of parents with asthma (adjusted hazard ratio 2.29 (95% confidence interval 2.22 to 2.35) and mothers who smoked during pregnancy (1.20, 1.18 to 1.22), whereas a lower incidence was found in children of parents with high educational attainment (0.72, 0.69 to 0.75) and high incomes (0.85, 0.81 to 0.89). Exposure to particulate matter &#8804;2.5 m (PM2.5) and &#8804;10 m (PM10) and nitrate was associated with an increased risk of asthma and persistent wheezing, with hazard ratios per 5 g/m3 increase in pollutant concentrations 1.05 (1.03 to 1.07) for PM2.5, 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06) for PM10, and 1.04 (1.03 to 1.04) for nitrogen dioxide. Only the positive association of PM2.5 with asthma and persistent wheezing remained robust across the different models and in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that children exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 are more likely to develop asthma and persistent wheezing than children who are not exposed.

These patients present with acute, sub-acute and chronic wounds which can be difficult to manage. Management of these patients typically requires a multi-disciplinary approach by a plastic surgeon, orthopaedic surgeon and infectious disease control team. Despite the advent of numerous new techniques and technologies, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) remains a cornerstone to the management of complex wounds. We present our experience with NPWT in this study. Methods This is a retrospective study of 380 patients who were treated with NPWT in the last 10 years at a single center. We receive hundreds of infected wounds of limbs each year which are either post-traumatic or post-debridement. Frequency of dressing change, C-reactive protein levels, bacterial cultures, complication rate and cost of apparatus in each case were noted. All patients received systemic antibiotics during the treatment. Results We reviewed hospital data of 520 patients in which debridement was performed. Of the 520 patients derided, 380 patients were treated with NPWT, and included in study. Number of NPWT sessions was decided on the basis of wound status (adequate healthy granulation tissue, clinically improved circulation). A single session of NPWT dressing was applied in 84% (n = 320) patients, 8% (n = 31) patients needed two sessions of NPWT dressing, 6% (n = 24) patients had three sessions of NPWT dressing and only 1% (n = 5) patients did not respond to NPWT dressing. 78% (n = 297) patients had reduced levels of C-reactive protein levels and wound cultures were negative in 54% (n = 208) patients after application of NPWT dressing. Minor complications occurred in 0.7% (n = 3) patients due to occult osteomyelitis. In 0.5% (n = 2) patients, NPWT dressing was discontinued due to persistent leakage near a natural orifice. Sinus formation was seen in 6% (n = 23) patients who were treated with curettage and conventional dressings. The mean pain score on the verbal analogue scale was 3 out of 10. The mean cost of an NPWT dressing apparatus was 90 dollars. Conclusion We conclude from this study that NPWT dressing can be easily applied to any region of the body and it can be customized to the needs of patients from different socio-economic status.","output":"Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT): Our Experience in Pakistan With Locally Made Dressing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A number of studies from different countries have been devoted to studying the psychological state of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic In addition to the severity of the symptoms of the disease itself, the situation of uncertainty can negatively affect the patients' psychological well-being Objective Our research aimed to explore ways for patients with COVID-19 to regulate their emotional state during hospitalization, and how they can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety Design The research involved 127 people hospitalized due to confirmed COV-ID-19: 67 men (52 8%) and 60 women (47 2%), ages 19 to 77 years (M = 43 34, Me = 42, SD = 11 81) We used a set of questionnaires which included the Beck Depression Questionnaire;the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale;the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (22-item);the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire;and the Dembo-Rubinstein self-assessment scales Results Twenty-five and four-tenths percent (25 4%) of the participants had severe symptoms of anxiety, and 24 13% had symptoms of depression Women showed higher symptoms of depression than men ANOVA showed no significant differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies in patients being hospitalized at different intervals, or in patients of different age groups Factor analysis made it possible to distinguish three patterns of emotion regulation: 1) adaptive cognitive change;2) fixation on negative experiences;and 3) deflection of responsibility Significant positive correlations were found between symptoms of depression and anxiety, and coping by fixation on negative experience only Conclusion Although various means of cognitive emotion regulation by patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are currently being presented, these strategies are not associated with significant reductions in their symptoms of depression and anxiety ? 2020 Lomonosov Moscow State University All Rights Reserved","output":"Cognitive Emotion Regulation, Anxiety, and Depression in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The \\"National Report on Medicines use in older adults in Italy.

In order to rapidly share learning to inform future practice, we undertook a thematic review of ED operational experience within England during the pandemic thus far. METHODS: A rapid phenomenological approach using semistructured telephone interviews with ED clinical leads from across England was undertaken between 16 and 22 April 2020. Participants were recruited through purposeful sampling with sample size determined by data saturation. Departments from a wide range of geographic distribution and COVID-19 experience were included. Themes were identified and included if they met one of three criteria: demonstrating a consistency of experience between EDs, demonstrating a conflict of approach between emergency departments or encapsulating a unique solution to a common barrier. RESULTS: Seven clinical leads from type 1 EDs were interviewed. Thematic redundancy was achieved by the sixth interview, and one further interview was performed to confirm. Themes emerged in five categories: departmental reconfiguration, clinical pathways, governance and communication, workforce and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: This paper summarises learning and innovation from a cross-section of EDs during the first UK wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Common themes centred around the importance of flexibility when reacting to an ever-changing clinical challenge, clear leadership and robust methods of communication. Additionally, experience in managing winter pressures helped inform operational decisions, and ED staff demonstrated incredible resilience in demanding working conditions. Subsequent surges of COVID-19 infections may occur within a more challenging context with no guarantee that there will be an associated reduction in A&E attendance or cessation of elective activity.

METHODS: This study is a hybrid Type 2 randomized roll-out effectiveness-implementation trial of CoCM in 11 primary care practices affiliated with an academic medical center. The Collaborative Behavioral Health Program (CBHP) was developed as a means of improving access to effective mental health services for depression. Implementation strategies are provided to all practices. Using a sequential mixed methods approach, we will assess key stakeholders perspectives on barriers and facilitators of implementation and sustainability of CBHP. The speed and quantity of implementation activities completed over a 30-month period for each practice will be assessed. Economic analyses will be conducted to determine the budget impact and cost offset of CBHP in the healthcare system. We hypothesize that CBHP will be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and spillover effects on chronic health conditions. We will also examine differential outcomes among racial/ethnic minority patients. DISCUSSION: This study will elucidate critical drivers of successful CoCM implementation.

Most of those studies rely on parameter calibration using the published number of confirmed cases. Unfortunately, this number is usually incomplete and biased due to the lack of testing capacities, and varying testing protocols. An essential requirement for better monitoring is the evaluation of the number of undiagnosed infected individuals. This number is crucial for the determination of transmission prevention strategies and it provides statistics on the epidemic dynamics. To estimate the number of undiagnosed infected individuals, we studied the relation between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We simulated multiple models currently used to study the COVID-19 pandemic and computed the relation between these two fractions in all those models. Across most models currently used and for most realistic model parameters, the relation between the two fractions is consistently linear and model independent. This relation can be used to estimate the number of undiagnosed infected, with no explicit epidemiological model. We apply this method to measure the number of undiagnosed infected in Israel.

Excluding the initial 16 patients randomized before the first revision of the protocol, 149 and 151 patients in arms A and B, respectively, were included in the primary analysis. The 3-year OS rates were 62.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 54.1-69.6] in Arm A and 60.9% (95% CI 52.7-68.2) in Arm B. The hazard ratio of Arm B against Arm A was 0.916 (95% CI 0.679-1.236).

We evaluated a national, multihospital patient data base to examine recent trends in ruptured aneurysm therapies and to compare peri-procedural outcomes between clipping and coiling treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Premier Perspective data base was used to identify patients hospitalized between 2006-2011 for ruptured aneurysm who underwent clipping or coiling therapy. A propensity score model, representing the probability of receiving clipping, was generated for each patient by use of relevant patient and hospital variables. After Greedy-type matching of the propensity score, the risk of in-hospital mortality and morbidity was compared between clipping and coiling cohorts. RESULTS A total of 5229 patients with ruptured aneurysm (1228 clipping, 4001 coiling) treated at 125 hospitals were identified. Clipping therapy frequency decreased from 27% in 2006 to 21% in 2011. After propensity score adjustment, in-hospital mortality risk was similar between groups (OR = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.73-1.21]; P = .62). However, unfavorable outcomes were more common after clipping compared with coiling, including discharge to long-term care (OR = 1.32 [95% CI, 1.12-1.56]; P = .0006), ischemic complications (OR = 1.51 [95% CI, 1.24-1.83]; P = .0009), neurologic complications (OR = 1.64 [95% CI, 1.18-2.27]; P = .0018), and other surgical complications (OR = 1.55 [95% CI, 1.05-2.33]; P = .0240).

This new medical model has benefited integrative oncology (IO) consultations, where cancer patients are counseled about healthy lifestyle, non-pharmacological approaches for symptom management, and addressing questions around natural products and other integrative modalities. Here we report the feasibility of conducting IO physician consultations via telehealth in 2020 and compare patient characteristics to prior in-person consultations conducted in 2019. METHODS: An integrated EHR-telemedicine platform was used for IO physician consultations. As in the prior in-person visits, patients completed pre-visit patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments about common cancer symptoms [modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, (ESAS)], Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW), and the PROMIS-10 to assess quality of life (QOL). Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and PROs for new telehealth consultation in 2020 were compared to new in-person consultations in 2019 using t-tests, chi-squared tests, and -Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: We provided telehealth IO consultations to 509 new patients from April 21, 2020, to October 21, 2020, versus 842 new patients in-person during the same period in 2019. Most were female (77 % vs 73%); median age (56 vs 58), and the most frequent cancer type was breast (48% vs 39%). More patients were seeking counseling on herbs and supplements (12.9 vs 6.8%) and lifestyle (diet 22.7 vs 16.9% and exercise 5.2 vs 1.8%) in the 2020 cohort than 2019, respectively. The 2020 telehealth cohort had lower symptom management concerns compared to the 2019 in-person cohort (19.5 vs 33.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Delivering IO consultations using telehealth is feasible and meets patients' needs. Compared to patients seen in-person during 2019, patients having telehealth IO consultations in 2020 reported lower symptom burden and more concerns about lifestyle and herbs and supplements. Additional research is warranted to explore the satisfaction and challenges among patients receiving telehealth IO care.","output":"Integrative Oncology Consultations Delivered via Telehealth in 2020 and In-Person in 2019: Paradigm Shift During the COVID-19 World Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome associated with significant morbidity and healthcare costs. Electronic health records (EHRs) are widely used to identify patients with HF and other phenotypes. Despite widespread use of EHRs for phenotype algorithm development, it is unclear if the characteristics of identified populations mirror those of clinically observed patients and reflect the known spectrum of HF phenotypes. Methods: We performed a subanalysis within a larger systematic evidence review to assess the different methods used for HF algorithm development and their application to research and clinical care. We queried PubMed for articles published up to November 2020. Out of 318 studies screened, 25 articles were included for primary analysis and 15 studies using only International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were evaluated for secondary analysis. Results are reported descriptively. Results: HF algorithms were most often developed at academic medical centers and the V.A. One health system was responsible for 8 of 10 HF algorithm studies. HF and congestive HF were the most frequent phenotypes observed and less frequently, specific HF subtypes and acute HF. Diagnoses were the most common data type used to identify HF patients and echocardiography was the second most frequent. The majority of studies used rule-based methods to develop their algorithm. Few studies used regression or machine learning methods to identify HF patients. Validation of algorithms varied considerably: only 52.9% of HF and 44.4% of HF subtype algorithms were validated, but 75% of acute HF algorithms were. Demographics of any study population were reported in 68% of algorithm studies and 53% of ICD-only studies. Fewer than half reported demographics of their HF algorithm-identified population. Of those reporting, most identified majority male (>50%) populations, including both algorithms for HF with preserved ejection fraction. Conclusion: There is significant heterogeneity in phenotyping methodologies used to develop HF algorithms using EHRs. Validation of algorithms is inconsistent but largely relies on manual review of patient records. The concentration of algorithm development at one or two sites may reduce potential generalizability of these algorithms to identify HF patients at non-academic medical centers and in populations from underrepresented regions. Differences between the reported demographics of algorithm-identified HF populations those expected based on HF epidemiology suggest that current algorithms do not reflect the full spectrum of HF patient populations.","output":"Identifying Heart Failure from Electronic Health Records: A Systematic Evidence Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Complications of COVID-19 infection have been greatly investigated.

Data are representative of active members of the labor force of six European nations that contained varying levels of COVID-19 burdens in terms of mortality and lockdown measures. We document a steep occupational prestige level gradient on the probability of facing economic hardship during the lockdowns-looming job loss, income loss, and workload decline-which evidently exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. Analyses indicate a striking positive relationship between instantaneous economic hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown and expressing feelings of depression and health anxiety.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%).

A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19.

We analyzed predictors of elevated distress and impaired physical function using logistic regression models that operationalized driving distance first as a continuous variable and separately as a dichotomous variable (<100 vs. 100+ miles). Of 1136 patients available for analysis from 6 US centers, median driving distance was 82 miles and 44% resided 100+ miles away from their HCT centers. Elevated distress was reported by 32% of patients, impaired physical function by 19%, and both by 12%. Driving distance, whether operationalized as a continuous or dichotomous variable, had no impact on distress or physical function in linear regression modeling (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.00 for both PROs with driving distance as a continuous variable). In contrast, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, lower income, and lack of Internet access independently predicted both elevated distress and impaired physical function. In summary, we found no impact of driving distance on distress and physical function among HCT survivors. Our results have implications for how long-term follow-up care is delivered after HCT, both with regard to the negligible impact of driving distances on PROs and also the risk of a digital divide worsening outcomes among HCT survivors without Internet access.","output":"Driving Distance and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern scientific research for Sustainable Development depends on the availability of large amounts of relevant real-world data.

However, this assay is not always readily available, which limits accurate real-time dose adjustments necessary to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation. DESCRIPTION: A 57 year-old woman with a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and multiple prior deep venous thromboses and pulmonary emboli was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia and intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Argatroban was initiated in place of her home medication warfarin. This patient had a prolonged aPTT value at baseline and overnight dTT assay measurements were limited at our institution. To overcome this challenge, a multidisciplinary team of hematology and pharmacy clinicians created a modified aPTT algorithm. By measuring aPTT and dTT simultaneously from patient plasma samples, a patientspecific aPTT target range was derived and argatroban dosing was titrated accordingly. Subsequent aPTT values in the modified target range corresponded to therapeutic dTT values, indicating therapeutic anticoagulation was successfully achieved and maintained. Patient plasma samples were also evaluated retrospectively using a novel point-of-care (POC) coagulation test to detect and quantify the effect of argatroban. A Clotting Time Score (CTS) was derived for each sample tested. Comparison of CTS and dTT values demonstrated moderate positive correlation between test results. All CTS results accurately reflected if argatroban dosing achieved an appropriate level of anticoagulation. DISCUSSION: Therapeutic anticoagulation with a DTI in a patient with unreliable aPTT measurements is challenging but can be achieved with use of a modified aPTT scale, which in our case study was retrospectively confirmed by corresponding dTT measurements. Early validation of a novel test that could offer a rapid, POC alternative to dTT when dTT measurements are necessary but not readily available is promising. Such a technology could dramatically improve rapid accurate titration of DTIs to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation.","output":"Novel monitoring and dose adjustment of argatroban to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the United States population diversifies, urgent action is required to identify, dismantle, and eradicate persistent health disparities.

The tragic death toll and high rates of morbidity across many countries are an unprecedented setback and a calamity for those affected physically and mentally. The economic and social effects of lockdowns, loss of production and business confidence, and global recession will cast a long shadow over education systems. Despite the 435 million items that Google already indexes under \\"COVID-19 education\\", many things remain unknown. No one has a clear idea of how the current pandemic will unravel over anything but the short term. The challenge is to strengthen the mechanisms to separate evidence from opinion and to balance popularism with speaking truth to power-especially when political systems can find it difficult to distinguish fact from convenient fiction. This paper advances ten propositions that will shape policy dialogue and whatever iteration of the Sustainable Development Goals is needed to ensure they remain fit for purpose. Testing these propositions over the next year will open the door to an evidence-based approach to reconstruction and sustainable development and juxtapose immediate concerns of the present with aspirations for the future. More than ever the need is to see beyond the exigencies of COVID-19 and act to secure the educational gains of the recent past.

The latest initiative in this direction is the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which establishes a blueprint for global coordinated action towards development of national and regional strategies targeting conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity. By supporting the notion of ecological civilization, it emphasises the need for transformative strategies to conserve, monitor and sustainably manage ecosystems by 2030. Arguably the articulation of fit-for-purpose goals and targets is a key precondition for achieving this vision by enhancing cooperation and influencing the development of implementation strategies and regulatory instruments at national and local levels.

Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells. The global spread and explosive growth of the SARS-CoV-2 population (within human hosts) has contributed additional mutational variability into this genome, increasing opportunities for future recombination.","output":"On the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate frailty prevalence, cross-sectional associations, predictive validity, concurrent validity, and cross-cultural adaptations of the FRAIL-NH scale. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Frail residents living in nursing homes. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched from January 2015 to June 2021 for primary studies that used the FRAIL-NH scale, irrespective of study designs and publication language. RESULTS: Overall, 40 studies conducted across 20 countries utilized the FRAIL-NH scale; majority in Australia (n=14), followed by China (n=6), United States (n=3), and Spain (n=3). The scale has been translated and back-translated into Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. Various cut-offs have been used, with 2 and 6 being the most common cut-offs for frail and most frail, respectively. When defined using these cut-offs, frailty prevalence varied from 15.1C79.5% (frail) to 28.5C75.0% (most frail). FRAIL-NH predicted falls (n=2), hospitalization or length of stay (n=4), functional or cognitive decline (n=4), and mortality (n=9) over a median follow-up of 12 months. FRAIL-NH has been compared to 16 other scales, and was correlated with Frieds phenotype (FP), Frailty Index (FI), and FI-Lab. Four studies reported fair-to-moderate agreements between FRAIL-NH and FI, FP, and the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. Ten studies assessed the sensitivity and specificity of different FRAIL-NH cutoffs, with 8 having the highest sensitivity (94.1%) and specificity (82.8%) for classifying residents as frail based on FI, while two studies reported an optimal cut-off of 2 based on FI and FP, respectively. CONCLUSION: In seven years, the FRAIL-NH scale has been applied in 20 countries and adapted into three languages. Despite being applied with a range of cut-offs, FRAIL-NH was associated with higher care needs and demonstrated good agreement with other well-established but more complex scales. FRAIL-NH was predictive of adverse outcomes across different settings, highlighting its value in guiding care for frail residents in nursing homes.

Many countries are currently generating alternatives to promote tourism and allow tourists to return and improve the current situation. In Peru, borders were closed, and therefore the different tourist sites and activities were closed, generating unemployment in the actors involved in the tourism sector, as well as the local communities that underpinned their economy in the activities of this area. Faced with this problem, it is evident that technology and the digitization of tourism activities will allow supporting this sector, so this article proposes a digital transformation model for the reactivation of tourism, taking the Lambayeque region as a case study. We have carried out a systematic investigation of tourism information and applied interviews to specialists in the sector and surveys of the actors involved. The model is based on five dimensions: technology, management, processes, tourism product, and digital tourist. For each dimension, we describe its purpose and the proposals applying solutions and technological tools that allow digital transformation. Our model was validated through an expert judgment, the result of which was acceptable, hoping that its implementation will contribute to the reactivation of tourism. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Digital Transformation Model for the Reactivation of the Tourism Sector in the COVID-19 Environment of the Lambayeque Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a theoretically increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) given their occupational exposure.

In this work, 58 metalloproteins among these human targets have been identified by a structure-based approach. This study reveals that most human metalloproteins interact with the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein, whose antibodies are one of the principal markers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, this work provides sufficient evidence to conclude that Zn2+ plays an important role in the interplay between the novel coronavirus and humans. First, the content of Zn-binding proteins in the involved human metalloproteome is significantly higher than that of the other metal ions.

A high index of suspicion with early diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapy significantly impacts on the morbidity and mortality of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional multicentre survey across 7 tertiary hospitals in 5 geopolitical zones of Nigeria between June 2013 and March 2015. Knowledge, awareness and practice of Nigerian resident doctors about the diagnosis and management of invasive fungal infections were evaluated using a semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire. Assessment was categorized as poor, fair and good. RESULTS: 834(79.7%) of the 1046 participants had some knowledge of IFIs, 338(32.3%) from undergraduate medical training and 191(18.3%) during post-graduate (specialty) residency training. Number of years spent in clinical practice was positively related to knowledge of management of IFIs, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Only 2 (0.002%) out of the 1046 respondents had a good level of awareness of IFIs. Only 4(0.4%) of respondents had seen > 10 cases of IFIs; while 10(1%) had seen between 5-10 cases, 180(17.2%) less than 5 cases and the rest had never seen or managed any cases of IFIs. There were statistically significant differences in knowledge about IFIs among the various cadres of doctors (p < 0.001) as level of knowledge increased with rank/seniority.

Substantial research has been conducted to assess viability of the virus on surfaces of vehicles and equipment, in feed and water, and on production building surfaces, but little is known about the persistence in PEDV-infected carcasses and effective disposal methods thereof. This study was conducted to quantify the persistence of PEDV RNA via quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at various time-temperature combinations and in infected piglet carcasses subjected to composting. Although this method does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, it is a rapid and sensitive test to evaluate materials for evidence of virus genome. RESULTS: In the first study, PEDV was suspended in cell culture media at 1  10(5) TCID50 per sample (1 mL sample size) and subjected to various time and temperature combinations in triplicate including temperatures of 37, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 C and exposure times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days. At all temperatures, viral RNA copies declined over time, with the decline most marked and rapid at 65 and 70 C. Detectable RNA did persist throughout the trial in all but the most extreme condition, where two of three samples incubated at 70 C yielded undetectable viral RNA after 14 days. In the second study, PEDV-infected piglet carcasses were subjected to two cycles of composting lasting 36 and 37 days, respectively, for a total compost time of 73 days. Composting was performed in triplicate windrow sections housed inside biosecure, climate-controlled rooms using insulated bins designed to represent a continuous windrow compost pile. Temperatures reached 35C57 C for 26 days of cycle 1 and 35C45 C for 3 days of cycle 2. Samples consisting of carbon material with or without decomposed tissue as available per sample site collected at ten locations throughout the cross-section of each windrow section following the primary and secondary compost cycles yielded no detectable viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Composting appears to be an effective disposal method for PEDV-infected piglet carcasses under the conditions examined. The combination of time and high temperature of the compost cycle effectively degraded viral RNA in cell culture media that should provide optimum stability. Complex compost material matrices collected from windrow sections yielded undetectable PEDV RNA by qRT-PCR after one 36-day compost cycle despite incomplete decomposition of soft tissue.","output":"Effectiveness of composting as a biosecure disposal method for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected pig carcasses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomics is the foundation of precision medicine, global food security and virus surveillance. Exact-match is one of the most essential operations widely used in almost every step of genomics such as alignment, assembly, annotation, and compression. Modern genomics adopts Ferragina-Manzini Index (FM-Index) augmenting space-efficient Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) with additional data structures to permit ultra-fast exact-match operations. However, FM-Index is notorious for its poor spatial locality and random memory access pattern. Prior works create GPU-, FPGA-, ASIC- and even process-in-memory (PIM)-based accelerators to boost FM-Index search throughput. Though they achieve the state-of-the-art FM-Index search throughput, the same as all prior conventional accelerators, FM-Index PIMs process only one DNA symbol after each DRAM row activation, thereby suffering from poor memory bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator, EXMA, to enhance FM-Index search throughput. We first create a novel EXMA table with a multi-task-learning (MTL)-based index to process multiple DNA symbols with each DRAM row activation. We then build an accelerator to search over an EXMA table. We propose 2-stage scheduling to increase the cache hit rate of our accelerator. We introduce dynamic page policy to improve the row buffer hit rate of DRAM main memory. We also present CHAIN compression to reduce the data structure size of EXMA tables.

The possibility of humans transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to animals and fear of animals transmitting the virus to humans endangers animal wellbeing; use of animals as research models also has welfare implications. As the search for appropriate animal models for SARS-CoV-2 continues, it is important to determine which species are most appropriate, so that the three Rs of animal research (replacement, reduction, and refinement) may be put into practice. The present review suggests that ferrets, golden Syrian hamsters, and some Old World nonhuman primates may be the best animal models for COVID-19-related research, as these species display the greatest similarity in factors underlying viral infection, as well as clinical symptoms upon viral exposure most similar to those seen in humans. ABSTRACT: The accelerated pace of research into Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessitates periodic summaries of current research. The present paper reviews virus susceptibilities in species with frequent human contact, and factors that are best predictors of virus susceptibility. Species reviewed were those in contact with humans through entertainment, pet, or agricultural trades, and for whom reports (either anecdotal or published) exist regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or the resulting disease state COVID-19. Available literature was searched using an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted engine, as well as via common databases, such as Web of Science and Medline. The present review focuses on susceptibility and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and polymorphisms in transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that contribute to species differences. Dogs and pigs appear to have low susceptibility, while ferrets, mink, some hamster species, cats, and nonhuman primates (particularly Old World species) have high susceptibility. Precautions may therefore be warranted in interactions with such species, and more selectivity practiced when choosing appropriate species to serve as models for research.","output":"Animal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the Welfare of Animals during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, and thus has become an emerging health crisis worldwide.

METHODS We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of 30-day outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures at 10 clinical sites in the United States from 2005 through 2007. A composite end point of 30-day major adverse outcomes (including death; venous thromboembolism; percutaneous, endoscopic, or operative reintervention; and failure to be discharged from the hospital) was evaluated among patients undergoing first-time bariatric surgery. RESULTS There were 4776 patients who had a first-time bariatric procedure (mean age, 44.5 years; 21.1% men; 10.9% nonwhite; median body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 46.5). More than half had at least two coexisting conditions. A Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in 3412 patients (with 87.2% of the procedures performed laparoscopically), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was performed in 1198 patients; 166 patients underwent other procedures and were not included in the analysis. The 30-day rate of death among patients who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was 0.3%; a total of 4.3% of patients had at least one major adverse outcome. A history of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired functional status were each independently associated with an increased risk of the composite end point. Extreme values of body-mass index were significantly associated with an increased risk of the composite end point, whereas age, sex, race, ethnic group, and other coexisting conditions were not. CONCLUSIONS The overall risk of death and other adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery was low and varied considerably according to patient characteristics.

METHODS: We reviewed the COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women published to date and evidence from preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies, and discuss their implications. RESULTS: Pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines resulting in limited data on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. As a result, since December 2020, there has been conflicting advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities on this matter. From the end of 2020 up to now, some consensus guidance has been published with a prevalent precautionary approach on the administration of vaccines in pregnant women, in breastfeeding ones, or for those who are planning a pregnancy (either spontaneously or with assisted technologies). After the first few months of vaccine administration in some countries, more permissiveness seems to prevail, although with inconsistencies. At the moment, the results obtained by preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies suggest that the risks of the maternal COVID-19 outweigh the undocumented and hypothetical risks of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Also, until two viral vector COVID-19 vaccines were associated with very rare thromboembolic events, all guidance had agreed that all approved COVID-19 vaccines could be administered in pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Improving health equity for Maori, similar to other colonised Indigenous peoples globally, requires urgent attention. Improving the quality of health practitioners' engagement with Indigenous Maori accessing health services is one area that could support improving Maori health equity. While the Fundamentals of Care framework offers a promising relational approach, it lacks consideration of culture, whanau or family, and spirituality, important for Indigenous health and wellbeing. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative literature review on Maori models of health and wellbeing yielded nine models to inform a Maori-centred relational model of care. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for reporting literature reviews. RESULTS: Four overarching themes were identified that included dimensions of health and wellbeing; whanaungatanga (connectedness); whakawhanaungatanga (building relationships); and socio-political health context (colonisation, urbanisation, racism, and marginalisation). Health and wellbeing for Maori is a holistic and relational concept. Building relationships that include whanau (extended family) is a cultural imperative. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance and relevance of relational approaches to engaging Maori and their whanau accessing health services. It signals the necessary foundations for health practitioners to build trust-based relationships with Maori. Key elements for a Maori-centred model of relational care include whakawhanaungatanga (the process of building relationships) using tikanga (cultural protocols and processes) informed by cultural values of aroha (compassion and empathy), manaakitanga (kindness and hospitality), mauri (binding energy), wairua (importance of spiritual wellbeing). RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Culturally-based models of health and wellbeing provide indicators of important cultural values, concepts and practices and processes. These can then inform the development of a Maori-centred relational model of care to address inequity.","output":"Creating an Indigenous Maori-centred model of relational health: A literature review of Maori models of health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies to evaluate long COVID symptoms and their risk factors are limited. We evaluated the presence of long COVID and its risk factors in patients discharged from a hospital with COVID-19 illness. METHODS: This observational study included 271 COVID-19 patients admitted between February and July 2020 in a hospital in the UK. The primary outcome measure was to assess the duration and severity of long COVID and its predictors at 3, 6 and 9 months. Logistic regression was performed to assess the potential risk factors for long COVID. RESULTS: Out of 89 patients interviewed, 55 (62%) had long COVID for 3 months, 46 (52%) for 6 months and 37 of the 75 patients admitted to the hospital with acute COVID-19 had long COVID for 9 months (49%).

Nursing interventions can improve the mental health and happiness of patients, namely by providing social support and providing acceptance commitment therapy by the health workers. The provision of social support and acceptance commitment therapy aims to produce a meaningful life for patients undergoing treatment. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of social support and acceptance commitment therapy on subjective well-being and mental health of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The research design used is quasi-experimental research with dependent pre-test and post-test samples. The sampling technique used is consecutive sampling to determine the sample according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a total sample of 106 respondents who were divided into 53 respondents for the intervention group and 53 respondents for the control group. The independent variables in this study are social support and acceptance commitment therapy. Meanwhile, the dependent variables in this study are subjective well-being and mental health. The instruments used in this research are The Social Support Questionnaire, Mental Health Inventory, and Satisfaction with Life Scale. Statistical analysis was conducted using t-test with p < 0.5. RESULTS: The results show that in the intervention group, the difference in mean subjective well-being before and after the intervention is 6.88, while the difference in the mean of mental health before and after the intervention is 39.71. Furthermore, in the control group, the difference in mean subjective well-being before and after the intervention is 0.17, while the difference in the mean of mental health before and after the intervention is 0.02. Data analysis shows that social support and acceptance commitment therapy had an effect on subjective well-being and mental health of COVID-19 patients with p = 0.00.

As a specialty that strives for constant innovation, it is important for OMS programs to participate in the emerging concept of incorporating social media into medical and surgical education. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the use of Instagram in OMS residency programs in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of Instagram search data was performed. The Instagram accounts of OMS residency programs were searched, and their metrics were retrieved from June 1 to June 5, 2020. Factors correlated with the total number of followers were identified. The use of Instagram in OMS residency programs was compared with that in other related dental and surgical residency programs. RESULTS: Only 17 (18.7%) of 91 OMS residency programs had an Instagram account. The number of programs with Instagram accounts exhibited linear growth (R(2) = 0.98) since December 2018. The median number of followers was 326 (range, 94C2152) and the median number of posts was 9 (range, 2C40). The number of Instagram followers was positively correlated with the number of accounts followed, number of total posts, and number of educational posts, and it was negatively correlated with the Instagram engagement rate. Instagram presence did not differ among residency programs for orthodontics (18.2%), periodontics (5.5%), and OMS (P = 0.067). However, Instagram presence in OMS residency programs was significantly lower than that in plastic surgery (74.7%; P <0.001) and otolaryngology residency programs (35.0%; P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Instagram use in OMS residency programs is growing but is significantly lower than that in related surgical fields.

Using multiple large-scale nationally representative datasets, we observe household solid fuel usage to adversely impact school attendance, years of schooling and age-appropriate grade progression among children. This inference is robust to alternative ways of measuring educational outcomes, application of other datasets, specifications and estimation techniques. Importantly, the effect is found to be more pronounced for females in comparison to the males highlighting the gendered nature of the impact. On exploring possible pathways, we find that the direct time substitution on account of solid fuel collection and preparation can explain the detrimental educational outcomes that include learning outcomes as well, even though we are unable to reject the health channel.

However, there is no benchmark to compare the occurrence of hospital outbreaks across hospitals. METHODS: We implemented proactive infection control measures with an emphasis on timely education of health care workers and hospitalized patients at Queen Mary Hospital, a teaching hospital. Our benchmarked performance (outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and 1 million patient-days) was compared with those of other regional public hospitals without these additional proactive measures in place between 2010 and 2014. RESULTS: During the study period, Queen Mary Hospital had 1 hospital outbreak resulting in 1.48 and 0.45 outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days, respectively, values significantly lower than the corresponding overall rates in the 7 acute regional hospitals (24.26 and 6.70 outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days, respectively; P < .001) and that of all 42 public hospitals in Hong Kong (41.62 and 8.65 outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days, respectively; P < .001).

COVID-19 specific EMS telephone triage tools have been introduced to help manage demand. There has been no previous evaluation of the accuracy of EMS telephone triage in identifying patients with suspected COVID-19 at risk of serious adverse outcome. We aimed to assess accuracy of EMS telephone triage in identifying patients who need an EMS response and identify factors which affect triage accuracy. Method Patients who made an emergency call to Yorkshire Ambulance Service between 2nd April and 29th June 2020 and were assessed using an AMPDS pandemic pathway for suspected COVID-19 were linked to Office for National Statistics death registration data, hospital and general practice electronic health care data collected by NHS Digital. Accuracy of decision to dispatch an ambulance was assessed in terms of death or need for organ support at 30 days from the first 999 call. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with false negative and false positive triage. Results Of 12, 653 callers included in the study population, 11.1% experienced the primary composite adverse outcome. Using the triage pathway, 16% of callers did not receive an emergency response and they had a lower risk (3.5%) of the primary outcome. Ambulances were dispatched to 4, 230 callers (33.4%) who were not subsequently conveyed to hospital and did not experience the primary outcome (false positive triage). Multivariable modelling found older age and presence of pre-existing respiratory disease were significant predictors of false positive triage. Conclusion EMS telephone triage avoided 16% of calls receiving an emergency ambulance, of whom 3.5% died or needed organ support by 30 days. Telephone triage can therefore reduce the burden of EMS responses but with the cost of a small proportion of patients who do not receive an initial emergency response deteriorating.

Recently, global attention has turned to preliminary reports on the promising anti-COVID-19 effect of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), most especially Famotidine. Therefore, this study was designed to exploit a possible molecular basis for the efficacy of H2RAs against coronavirus. Molecular docking was performed between four H2RAs, Cimetidine, Famotidine, Nizatidine, Ranitidine, and three non-structural proteins viz. NSP3, NSP7/8 complex, and NSP9. Thereafter, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out with the most outstanding ligands to determine the stability. Thereafter, Famotidine and Cimetidine were subjected to gene target prediction analysis using HitPickV2 and eXpression2Kinases server to determine the possible network of genes associated with their anti-COVID activities. Results obtained from molecular docking showed the superiority of Famotidine and Cimetidine compared to other H2RAs with a higher binding affinity to all selected targets. Molecular dynamic simulation and MMPBSA results revealed that Famotidine as well as Cimetidine bind to non-structural proteins more efficiently with high stability over 100 ns. Results obtained suggest that Famotidine and Cimetidine could be a viable option to treat COVID-19 with a mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of viral replication through the inhibition of non-structural proteins. Therefore, Famotidineand Cimetidine qualify for further study as a potential treatment for COVID-19.","output":"Molecular basis for the repurposing of histamine H2-receptor antagonist to treat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Synonymous mutations do not alter the amino acids and therefore are regarded as neutral for a long time. However, they do change the tRNA adaptation index (tAI) of a particular codon (independent of its context), affecting the tRNA availability during translation. They could also change the isoaccepting relationship with its neighboring synonymous codons in particular context, which again affects the local translation process. Evidence of selection pressure on synonymous mutations has emerged. RESULTS: The proposed selection patterns on synonymous mutations are never formally and systematically tested in plant species. We fully take advantage of the SNP data from 1,135 A. thaliana lines, and found that the synonymous mutations that increase tAI or the isoaccepting mutations in isoaccepting codon context tend to have higher derived allele frequencies (DAF) compared to other synonymous mutations of the opposite effects. CONCLUSIONS: Synonymous mutations are not strictly neutral. The synonymous mutations that increase tAI or the isoaccepting mutations in isoaccepting codon context are likely to be positively selected. We propose the concept of context-dependent and -independent selection on synonymous mutations. These concepts broaden our knowledge of the functional consequences of synonymous mutations, and should be appealing to phytologists and evolutionary biologists.","output":"Context-dependent and -independent selection on synonymous mutations revealed by 1,135 genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The eye is highly susceptible to inflammation-mediated tissue damage evoked during bacterial infection. However, mechanisms regulating inflammation to protect the eye remain elusive. Here, we used integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics to show that the immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate and immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) are induced in bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus)-infected mouse eyes, bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and Mller glia. Itaconate levels are also elevated in the vitreous of patients with bacterial endophthalmitis. Irg1 deficiency in mice led to increased ocular pathology. Conversely, intraocular administration of itaconate protects both Irg1(?/?) and wild-type mice from bacterial endophthalmitis by reducing inflammation, bacterial burden, and preserving retinal architecture and visual function. Notably, itaconate exerts synergistic effects with antibiotics. The protective, anti-inflammatory effects of itaconate are mediated via activation of NRF2/HO-1 signaling and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. Collectively, our study demonstrates the Irg1/itaconate axis is a regulator of intraocular inflammation and provides evidence for using itaconate, along with antibiotics, to treat bacterial infections.","output":"Integrative metabolomics and transcriptomics identifies itaconate as an adjunct therapy to treat ocular bacterial infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of within-day sCr variation serum creatinine variation is unknown in the setting of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: A monocentric retrospective analysis was conducted in COVID-19 patients not admitted to the intensive care unit. Three groups were subdivided based on 24 hours serum creatinine variation from admission. In the stable kidney function group, 24-hour serum creatinine variation ranged from +0.05 to C0.05 mg/dL; in the decreased kidney function group, 24-hour serum creatinine variation was >0.05 mg/dL; in the improved kidney function group, 24-hour serum creatinine variation was <C0.05 mg/dL. RESULTS: The study population included 224 patients with a median age of 66.5 years and a predominance of males (72.3%). Within 24 hours of admission, renal function remained stable in 37.1% of the subjects, whereas it displayed improved and deteriorated patterns in 45.5% and 17.4%, respectively. Patients with decreased kidney function were older and had more severe COVID-19 symptoms than patients with stable or improved kidney function. About half of patients with decreased kidney function developed an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalization.

Since cellular dormancy is one strategy for surviving, and since chemokines determine the environmental conditions in which dormancy occurs, we investigated how chemokines affect temozolomide (TMZ)-promoted cellular dormancy entry and exit in GBM cells. TMZ administration over ten days promoted cellular dormancy entry, whereas discontinuing TMZ for a further 15 days resulted in resumption of proliferation. Co-administration of a chemokine cocktail containing CXCL12, CXCL16, and CX3CL1 resulted in both delayed entry and exit from cellular dormancy. A microarray-based transcriptome analysis in LN229 GBM cells revealed that cellular dormancy entry was characterized by an increased expression of CCL2 and SAA2, while THSD4, FSTL3, and VEGFC were upregulated during dormancy exit. Co-stimulation with the chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes. After verifying the appearance of identified genes in human GBM primary cultures and ex vivo samples, we clarified whether each chemokine alone impacts cellular dormancy mechanisms using specific antagonists and selective CRISPR/Cas9 clones. While expression of CCL2 and SAA2 in LN229 cells was altered by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CXCR7 axis, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 contributed to reduced upregulation of THSD4 and, to a weaker extent, of VEGFC. The influence on FSTL3 expression depended on the entire chemokine cocktail.

Quantitative lesions may provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia and further to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. Methods: : 294 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from February, 24, 2020 to June, 1, 2020 from six centers. Multi-task Unet network was used to segment the whole lung and lesions from chest CT images. This deep learning method was pre-trained in 650 CT images (550 in primary dataset and 100 in test dataset) with COVID-19 or community acquired pneumonia and Dice coefficients in test dataset were calculated. 50 CT scans of 50 patients (15 with comorbidity and 35 without comorbidity) were random selected to mark lesions manually. The results will be compared with the automatic segmentation model. Eight quantitative parameters were calculated based on the segmentation results to evaluate the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. Results: Quantitative segmentation model was proved to be effective and accurate with all Dice coefficients more than 0.85 and all accuracies more than 0.95. Of the 294 patients, 52 (17.7%) patients were reported having at least one comorbidity, 14 (4.8%) having more than one comorbidity. Patients with any comorbidity were older ( P <0.001), had longer incubation period ( P <0.001), were more likely to have abnormal laboratory findings ( P <0.05) and be in severity status ( P <0.001). More lesions (including larger volume of lesion, consolidation and ground-glass opacity) were shown in patients with any comorbidity than patients without comorbidity (all P <0.001). More lesions were found on CT images in patients with more comorbidities. The median volumes of lesion, consolidation and ground-glass opacity in diabetes mellitus group were largest among the groups with single comorbidity that had the incidence rate of top three. Conclusions: Multi-task Unet network can make quantitative CT analysis of lesions to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19, further to provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia. More lesions (including GGO and consolidation) were found in CT images of cases with comorbidity.

In chicken DF1 cells, APMV-3 replicated with an efficiency approaching that of APMV-1, while APMV-2 and -5 replicated to lower, intermediate titers and the others were much lower. Mean death time (MDT) assay in chicken eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test in 1-day-old SPF chicks demonstrated that APMV types 2C9 were avirulent. Evaluation of replication in primary neuronal cells in vitro as well as in the brains of 1-day-old chicks showed that, among types 2C9, only APMV-3 was neurotropic, although this virus was not neurovirulent. Following intranasal infection of 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens, replication of APMV types 2C9 was mostly restricted to the respiratory tract, although APMV-3 was neuroinvasive and neurotropic (but not neurovirulent) and also was found in the spleen. Experimental intranasal infection of 3-week-old mallard ducks with the APMVs did not produce any clinical signs (even for APMV-1) and exhibited restricted viral replication of the APMVs (including APMV-1) to the upper respiratory tract regardless of their isolation source, indicating avirulence of APMV types 1C9 in mallard ducks. The link between the presence of a furin cleavage site in the F protein, syncytium formation, systemic spread, and virulence that has been well-established with APMV-1 pathotypes was not evident with the other APMV serotypes.","output":"Replication, Neurotropism, and Pathogenicity of Avian Paramyxovirus Serotypes 1C9 in Chickens and Ducks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) was designated as a COVID Referral Center for one cluster in Metro Manila during the pandemic We reviewed and described how UP-PGH prepared for this endeavor This can serve as reference for similar events in the future Methods We conducted a qualitative cross-sectional study with 20 key informant interviews and 5 focus group discussions involving 32 hospital front liners All proceedings were transcribed and analyzed manually following the conceptual framework Minutes of meetings, memoranda, and other official materials and communications were also reviewed Results The salient points of both internal (operations, structure, staff, supplies, and continuation of regular services) and external aspects (relation with other hospitals, the local government, the national health authority, and the general public) were enumerated and elaborated Both best practices and areas needing improvement were identified Conclusion and Recommendations The UP-PGH tried its best to prepare and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by protecting its hospital personnel and delivering evidence-based and quality care to patients The response was not a perfect one and there were certain aspects for improvement ? 2021 University of the Philippines Manila All rights reserved","output":"The development of the Philippine general hospital as a referral center in the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This working draft of a law & policy paper has been especially written as background reading material for a forthcoming session on public procurement reforms during in-service training of mid-career senior civil servants at LBSNAA, Mussoorie;with the simultaneous aim of submission to the 9th International Public Procurement Conference at Argentina in August 2020the latter now stands postponed to April 2021 on account of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover, acquired resistance inevitably emerges, primarily due to RAF lesions that prevent inhibition of BRAF V600 with current treatments. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies that target other mechanisms of activated BRAF. In this study, we use the Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, which promotes ubiquitination and degradation of neo-substrates, to address the limitations of BRAF inhibitor-based therapies. Using vemurafenib-based PROTACs, we achieve low nanomolar degradation of all classes of BRAF mutants, but spare degradation of WT RAF family members. Our lead PROTAC outperforms vemurafenib in inhibiting cancer cell growth and shows in vivo efficacy in a Class 2 BRAF xenograft model. Mechanistic studies reveal that BRAFWT is spared due to weak ternary complex formation in cells owing to its quiescent inactivated conformation, and activation of BRAFWT sensitizes it to degradation. This study highlights the degree of selectivity achievable with degradation-based approaches by targeting mutant BRAF-driven cancers while sparing BRAFWT, providing an anti-tumor drug modality that expands the therapeutic window.","output":"Mutant-selective degradation by BRAF-targeting PROTACs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Indonesia in March 2020, and the number of infections has grown exponentially. The situation is at its worst, overwhelming intensive care unit (ICU) resources and capacity. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a single-center observational case study of 21 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 20, 2020, to April 31, 2020. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest imaging were obtained consecutively during patient care. We identified 21 patients with confirmed COVID-19 severe infection in our ICU. The mean ( standard deviation) age of the patients was 54  10 years; 95% were men, with shortness of breath (90.6%) the most common symptom. Hypertension was identified as a comorbidity in 28.6% of patients. The most common reason for admission to the ICU was hypoxemic respiratory failure, with 80% (17 patients) requiring mechanical ventilation. Half of the patients (10) died between day 1 and day 18, with septic shock as the primary cause of death. Of the 11 surviving patients, five were discharged home, while six were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital ward. Even then, the median length of ICU stay amongst survivors was 18 days. CONCLUSIONS: To date, there are no known effective antiviral agents or specific therapy to treat COVID-19. As severe systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure seems to be the primary cause of death, supportive care in maintaining oxygenation and hemodynamic stability remain the mainstay goals in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Severe COVID-19 in the intensive care unit: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visceral artery aneurysms are rare but their estimated mortality due to rupture ranges between 25 and 70%.

Little is known about whether Chinese women with breast cancer have been involved in the decision-making process of mastectomy, the level of decisional conflict, their perceptions of mastectomy and the factors that influence them to undergo a mastectomy. This protocol describes a mixed-methods study that aims to provide an in-depth understanding of decision-making about mastectomy among Chinese women with breast cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A three-phase, sequential explanatory mixed-methods design will be adopted. The first phase is a retrospective analysis of medical records to determine the current use of mastectomy. The second phase is a cross-sectional survey to examine womens perceptions of involvement, decisional conflict and the factors influencing them to undergo a mastectomy. The third phase is an individual interview to explore womens decision-making experiences with mastectomy. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test, Fishers exact test, (2) test, analysis of variance, Pearsons correlation and logistic regression. Qualitative data will be analysed by the inductive content analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approvals for this study have been obtained from the human research ethics committees of the University of Newcastle, Australia, Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University, China, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, China.

This trial will evaluate a brief, evidence-based, online, group-based expressive writing intervention to reduce COVID-19-related distress in people living with IBD at the time of pandemic. Methods A parallel double-blind randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Overall, up to 154 adult participants with IBD and mild-moderate distress will be recruited via patient organisations. Participants will be allocated to the expressive writing intervention or an active control group. All participants will complete questionnaires including measures of distress, quality of life, resilience, self-efficacy, social support and disease activity before and after the intervention (1 week) and at 3 months post-intervention. The expressive writing group will participate in the evidenced-based 4-day writing program adapted from Pennebaker and Beall, 1986. The active control group will write about untherapeutic topics provided by researchers. Statistical analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis and will involve linear mixed effects models. Conclusions If successful, this simple intervention may bring personal and societal benefits, particularly because it is low cost, can be easily implemented online, ensuring social distancing, and be made widely available, during future disasters and to help with trauma-related distress in IBD.

Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. CONCLUSION: Participants' intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of Covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of Covid-19 vaccines in cultivating Covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants'.","output":"Using structural equation modeling to predict Indian people's attitudes and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reminders are an important method for encouraging patients to return for follow-up visits, such as for successive doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. However, patients may have preferences for different types of reminders. This study examined which reminder methods parents of pediatric patients found most useful and their thoughts on how the reminders helped them to complete their children's HPV vaccine series. This qualitative study was conducted on a purposively sampled group of parents who participated in a multi-level intervention intended to improve uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine series. Parents who agreed to participate were interviewed by phone using semi-structured interviews about their satisfaction with different program components, including reminders they received. Interviews were conducted between May 26, 2016 and October 18, 2017. Thematic analyses of data were conducted using NVivo software. Among 269 program participants invited to participate in the interviews, 157 agreed (58.4%) and 89 were successfully interviewed (33.1%). Participants thought that reminders were effective at helping them return for follow-up visits to ensure their children received all recommended HPV vaccine doses. Although most parents preferred texts, many also favored other reminder methods by themselves or in combination with texts. Parents suggested that the reminders indicate the purpose of the appointment and for which child. Reminders are an important part of a multi-component intervention that aims to increase completion of the HPV vaccine series. Program enrollees prefer different types of reminders, so offering several options may improve returns for follow-up doses.","output":"Human papillomavirus dose reminder preferences among parents from a diverse clinical sample: a qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdowns almost everywhere in the world as a result of the pandemic have led to an unprecedented shift from physical to digital. In the culture sector, this shift has made a large pool of previously inaccessible content available mostly in the form of archival material from cultural events and performances. Although in the past digital did not automatically mean more inclusive, as restrictions to access of cultural content were posed by copyright legislation, institutional policies or the resistance to the digital turn, with this abundant and almost unlimited offer of online content suddenly the discussion of obstacles in access has come to a halt. Our contribution looks into these developments focusing on high-profile cultural (e.g. national theatres, opera houses and concert halls) and audio-visual (AV) institutions with a public interest (e.g. Public Service Broadcasters and AV archives) in the European Union area. We are looking into policy aspects from an institutional perspective and focus on developments particularly vis-a-vis AV media policy and copyright policy. We argue this momentum is a unique opportunity to remember and reconsider policy objectives for an open, democratic and European AV cultural content. We identify this new reality and the implications it brings forward for the existing policies as well as the challenges and opportunities it holds for the AV culture sector, and identify possible policy directions and measures. We urge for the interpretation of broad and flexible exceptions and limitations to copyright for online access to cultural content while transposing the DSM Directive into national laws, and for a focused and coordinated effort related to the regulation of large online video sharing platforms enabled by the new AVMSD, involving such platforms in the financing, distribution and visibility of European AV content.","output":"From social distancing to digital un-distancing: The COVID-19 pandemic and new challenges for digital policy in the cultural and audiovisual sectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Even though data suggest that palliative care (PC) improves patient quality of life, caregiver burden, cost, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, integration of PC in the ICU is far from being universally accepted. Poor understanding of what PC provides is one of the barriers to the widespread implementation of their services in ICU. Evidence suggests that the availability of specialist PC is lacking in most European countries and provided differently depending on geographical location. The aim of this systematic review is to compare the numbers and types of PC interventions and gauge their impact on stakeholder outcomes and ICU resource utilisation. METHODS We will undertake a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed journal articles; our search will be carried out MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. The search strategy will include variations in the term 'palliative care' and 'intensive care'. All studies with patient populations undergoing palliative care interventions will be selected.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional design. This study used the 2018 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) public-use file to examine RN employment and earnings. METHODS: Our study population included a sample of 15,373 RNs who were employed at least 1000 hours in nursing in the past year and active in patient care. Characteristics such as race/ethnicity, type of RN degree completed, census region, and union status were included. Multiple regression analyses examined the effect of these characteristics on wages. Logistic regression was used to predict RN employment in LTC settings. RESULTS: RNs in LTC experienced lower wages compared with those in non-LTC settings, yet this difference was not associated with racial/ethnic or international educational differences. Among RNs working in LTC, lower wages were associated with part-time work, less experience, lack of union representation, and regional wage differences. CONCLUSION: Because RNs in LTC earn lower wages than RNs in other settings, policies to minimize pay inequities are needed to support the RN workforce caring for frail older adults.","output":"The Association of Race, Ethnicity, and Wages Among Registered Nurses in Long-term Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carrying out large-scale structural transformations of both the entire Russian economy and its individual actors is one of the most important tasks of the current stage of national development.

It is much bigger than a bio-medical concern now with the multitudes of socio-economic, socio-political, socio-cultural, and psycho-social impact, which are likely to outlast the pandemic itself by far and long. The pandemic and the resulting challenges across societies highlighted the existing social injustices in a neoliberal world for historically marginalized populations like homeless persons with mental illness (HPMI). The nationwide lockdown in India to resist the spread of the virus posed a unique challenge to this vulnerable population. The present study thus attempts to understand the experience of HPMI during the COVID-19 induced lockdown through the theoretical framework of social justice vis--vis injustice. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted on seven HPMI rehabilitated in the community through an NGO situated in Kolkata, India. Seven stakeholders have also been interviewed to understand their experience in providing services to the HPMI during the COVID-19 induced lockdown. Analyses of the narratives have been done using initial coding, focused coding and axial coding through the process of constant comparison of constructivist grounded theory (CGT) methodology. Critical insights from the study bring out experiences of HPMI during COVID-19 as a victim of structural violence, highlighting their exclusion and victimization due to the existing marginalized status, living closer to the edge as a consequence of the lockdown, lack of awareness of the gravity of the pandemic situation. The experiences of the stakeholders, on the other hand, pointed out the role of community members and social workers in partially mitigating the challenges. This study indicates that to mitigate the aftermaths, stakeholders, including community members, need to work together for rebuilding and enhancing the strength and resilience of the marginalized populations like HPMI, who are historically victims of social injustice in the neoliberal pandemic era.","output":"Social Injustice in the Neoliberal Pandemic Era for Homeless Persons With Mental Illness: A Qualitative Inquiry From India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

METHODS: The pilot was conducted between May 2019 and March 2020 in northern Israel, an area with high child injury rates. Eligibility included families with preschool children who incurred a home injury. Home-safety was assessed by observation through the Beterem checklist. Parents' views, knowledge, awareness of dangers and report of home injuries were assessed at the start of each visit. RESULTS: 352 of 773 eligible families agreed to be contacted. 135 participated, 98 completed both home visits. Significant improvement in home-safety items was observed 4 months after the first visit (14 [IQR12-16]) vs. (17 [IQR15-19]; p < 0.001), accompanied by an overall increase in home safety (Mean  SD 71.9%  9.5% vs. 87.1%  8.6%; p < 0.001). 64% reported greater awareness of dangers, 60% affirmed home was safer, and 70% valued the equipment. No difference was found in the prevalence of injuries (14 of 98 families prior and 8 after the visit; p = 0.17). Home visitors reported benefiting from the experience of working with disadvantaged families. CONCLUSION: The program, which included recruitment in a hospital emergency setting and use of healthcare students as home visitors, was successfully implemented and accompanied by significant improvement in home safety with a non-significant trend of child injury decrease.","output":"Keeping our children safe: piloting a hospital-based home-visitation program in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: This review instantiates the efficacy and safety of HFNC in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent Findings: Globally, the healthcare system is facing an unprecedented crisis of resources due to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and pneumonia are the most common symptoms associated with it. The incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU patients ranges from 29.1 to 89.9%. Supplemental oxygen therapy is the main stay treatment for managing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a novel non-invasive strategy for better oxygenation and ventilation in critically ill patients. In this grim scenario, a reduction in mechanical ventilation by means of HFNC is of prime interest. Summary: HFNC is considered an aerosol-generating intervention with the risk of viral aerosolization with a concern of potential nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there is no consensus regarding the use of HFNC in novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). HFNC seems to be an effective and safe treatment modality in acute respiratory failure with optimal settings and selection of ideal patients.","output":"High-Flow Nasal Cannula, a Boon or a Bane for COVID-19 Patients?

This study determined the knowledge and perception regarding COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures; as well as predictors of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among Nigerian adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Nigerian adults 18 years using an online survey. A convenience sampling method was utilized to recruit a total of 1022 study participants. The participants were recruited using the authors social media networks. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at a 5% level of statistical significance. RESULTS: Generally, a high proportion of respondents had correct knowledge about COVID-19. However, only approximately half (49.8% and 49.9%) had correct knowledge that obesity was a risk factor for COVID-19 and that antibiotics cannot be used to treat COVID-19. Most (84.1%) did not have a self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. Most (81.0%) have been avoiding crowded places and 61.3% washed their hands frequently.

Hypertension, as the most common comorbidity for patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has resulted in cases with more severe symptoms and higher mortality. The risk factors associated with COVID-19 in patients with hypertension are unknown. Methods. All the available and confirmed patients with COVID-19 from February 3 to March 10, 2020, were enrolled from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China. The demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, radiological assessments, and treatments on admission were extracted and compared. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 in patients with hypertension and the severity of the cohort. Results. A total of 430 available patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study, including 151 eligible patients with COVID-19 and hypertension. After PSM analysis, 141 patients without hypertension and 141 cases with hypertension were well matched. Compared with cases without hypertension, patients with hypertension were more severe (28.4% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, we found that neutrophil count (OR: 1.471;p = 0.001), coronary heart disease (OR: 5.281;p = 0.011), and the level of K+ (OR: 0.273;p &lt; 0.001) were associated with patients with hypertension. In addition, the percentage of pulmonary infection volume was larger in cases with hypertension (4.55 vs. 5.8, p = 0.017) and was a high risk factor for severe COVID-19 in patients with hypertension (OR: 1.084;p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion. On admission, coronary heart disease, neutrophil count, and the level of K+ were associated with COVID-19 patients with hypertension. The percentage of the pulmonary infection volume was significantly larger in COVID-19 patients with hypertension and was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity of the cohort.

The SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that it is no longer the exclusive privilege of countries to report and respond to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories, but that the global community has also assumed this role, aided by the ease and power of electronic communication through the World Wide Web. This phenomenon has been cited by some scholars as a potential infringement on national sovereignty that compromises the concept that states reign supreme over their territories and peoples. At the same time, however, countries are increasingly seeking to collaborate internationally in infectious disease surveillance and response, as shown in the current situation of avian influenza (H5N1), and in the formal agreement leading to the revised International Health Regulations (IHR), suggesting that a new world order prevails over issues that once had been considered the sole domain of a sovereign nation.","output":"SARS and emerging infectious diseases: a challenge to place global solidarity above national sovereignty."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aerosols generated during dental procedures are one of the most significant routes for infection transmission and are particularly relevant now in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an indoor air purifier on dental aerosol dispersion in dental offices. The spread and removal of aerosol particles generated from a specific dental operation in a dental office are quantified for a single dental activity in the area near the generation and corner of the office. The effects of the air purifier, door condition, and particle sizes on the spread and removal of particles were investigated. The results show that, in the worst-case scenario, it takes 95 min for 0.5-m particles to settle and that it takes a shorter time for the larger particles. The air purifier expedited the removal time at least 6.3 times faster than the case with no air purifier in the generation zone. Our results also indicate that particles may be transported from the source to the rest of the room even when the particle concentrations in the generation zone dropped back to the background. Therefore, it is inaccurate to conclude that indoor purifiers help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

There have been various debates among philosophers on this issue. Some philosophers reject the new administration policies by claiming that the physical distance required for health has been used for power under the name of social distance with the custody of the street and point out that these policies have created new forms of control, among economically, politically, and socially. Some others are more hopeful and believe that the crisis can build a new economic and social life;it can be an opportunity to find a new starting point;especially from being confined in the pandemic process. The author will refer to Agambens thoughts to understand how the state of exception turned into a rule and how it affects street politics. In this context, COVID-19 is seen as a state of exception that normalises all the dominative practices, strengthens sovereignty by designing the social/economical life like a camp. In the pandemic process, people were accustomed to isolation by the administrations under the name of social distance, just like in a camp life. At this point, Agambens analysis should be understood in relation to a biopolitical paradigm and can be expanded to reflect on street economy, street politics, and the life of cities. ? 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The biopolitics of the covid-19 crisis and a new form of the state of exception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To speed the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the United States federal government has funded multiple phase 3 trials of candidate vaccines.

A decade ago, the idea of offering patients ready access to their clinical notes was a fringe idea. Today, information transparency in health care is a pressing legislative and regulatory issue in the United States and elsewhere. The 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 requires that clinicians and health care organizations give patients electronic access to the information in their electronic medical records. Rules to enact this legislative priority by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services substantially expanded the types of information that must be easily accessible to patients and exchanged among clinicians in electronic form. A growing body of research supports the notion that sharing transparent medical records, including clinical notes with patients, can help to strengthen communication, trust in clinicians, and patient engagement. Patients receiving dialysis may receive particular benefits from this greater transparency due to their increased risk for fragmented care.

METHODS Literature searches were performed in Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycInfo using Medical Subject Heading terms and text words relating to musculoskeletal conditions, interventions to promote work-focused care and work-related outcomes. Articles involving any interventions with elements of work-focused care delivered by healthcare providers to manage musculoskeletal conditions were reviewed for suitability and inclusion. RESULTS A total of 22 articles (18 intervention trials) were identified. Most studies were multidisciplinary interventions incorporating one or more elements of work-focused care including: work-related assessment to identify barriers to working, vocational advice/coaching or education to address barriers to working, involvement of the workplace stakeholders, restoration of fitness for work and regular communication with multidisciplinary team members. Most studies (61 %) concluded that their interventions achieved the desired work-related outcomes although firm conclusions could not be made regarding the effectiveness of a particular component, content or strategy of work-focused care itself because of the variability in the type and number of elements and outcomes used.

Additionally, altered gut microbiome modulates immunity, bringing about health implications in humans. To explore the effects of the mid-term travel on the gut microbiome, we generated 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing data from longitudinal samples collected over six months. We monitored dynamic trajectories of the gut microbiome variation of a Chinese volunteer team (VT) in their whole journey to Trinidad and Tobago (TAT). We found gut microbiome resilience that VTs gut microbial compositions gradually transformed to the local TATs enterotypes during their six-month stay in TAT, and then reverted to their original enterotypes after VTs return to Beijing in one month. Moreover, we identified driven species in this bi-directional plasticity that could play a role in immunity modulation, as exemplified by Bacteroides dorei that attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation and effectively suppressed proinflammatory immune response. Another driven species P. copri could play a crucial role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, a chronic autoimmune disease. Carbohydrate-active enzymes are often implicated in immune and host-pathogen interactions, of which glycoside hydrolases were found decreased but glycosyltransferases and carbohydrate esterases increased during the travel; these functions were then restored after VT returning to Beijing. Furthermore, we discovered these microbial changes and restoration were mediated by VT peoples dietary changes. These findings indicate that half-year travel leads to change in enterotype and functional patterns, exerting effects on human health. Microbial intervention by dietary guidance in half-year travel would be conducive to immunity modulation for maintaining health.","output":"Microbiome Resilience and Health Implications for People in Half-Year Travel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the threats may appear to be vastly different, further investigation reveals that the cybersecurity community can learn much from the COVID-19 messaging response","output":"Pandemic Parallels: What Can Cybersecurity Learn From COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some reports described a possible ritonavir-related retinal toxicity.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an economically significant coronavirus that can cause severe diarrhea in pigs. Silver nanomaterials (Ag NMs) have attracted great interests in recent years due to their excellent anti-microorganism properties. Herein, four representative Ag NMs including spherical Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs, NM-300), two kinds of silver nanowires (XFJ011) and silver colloids (XFJ04) were selected to study their inhibitory effect on TGEV-induced host cell infection in vitro. Ag NPs were uniformly distributed, with particle sizes less than 20 nm by characterization of environmental scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Two types of silver nanowires were 60 nm and 400 nm in diameter, respectively. The average diameter of the silver colloids was approximately 10 nm. TGEV infection induced the occurring of apoptosis in swine testicle (ST) cells, down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, up-regulated the expression of Bax, altered mitochondrial membrane potential, activated p38 MAPK signal pathway, and increased expression of p53 as evidenced by immunofluorescence assays, real-time PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot. Under non-toxic concentrations, Ag NPs and silver nanowires significantly diminished the infectivity of TGEV in ST cells. Moreover, further results showed that Ag NPs and silver nanowires decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by TGEV through regulating p38/mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway.

METHODS: An observational cohort study is performed, using data on all PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Regione Lombardia, Italy, during the first wave of infection from February-June 2020. A multi-state modelling approach is used to simultaneously estimate risks of progression through hospital to final outcomes of either death or discharge, by pathway (via critical care or not) and the times to final events (lengths of stay). Logistic and time-to-event regressions are used to quantify the association of patient and population characteristics with the risks of hospital outcomes and lengths of stay respectively. RESULTS: Risks of severe outcomes such as ICU admission and mortality have decreased with month of admission (for example, the odds ratio of ICU admission in June vs March is 0.247 [0.120C0.508]) and increased with age (odds ratio of ICU admission in 45C65 vs 65 + age group is 0.286 [0.201C0.406]). Care home residents aged 65 + are associated with increased risk of hospital mortality and decreased risk of ICU admission. Being a healthcare worker appears to have a protective association with mortality risk (odds ratio of ICU mortality is 0.254 [0.143C0.453] relative to non-healthcare workers) and length of stay. Lengths of stay decrease with month of admission for survivors, but do not appear to vary with month for non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in clinical knowledge, treatment, patient and hospital management and public health surveillance, together with the waning of the first wave after the first lockdown, are hypothesised to have contributed to the reduced risks and lengths of stay over time.

Hypothesis/Purpose To summarize the findings of current systematic reviews on the effectiveness of lower limb injury prevention programs with multiple neuromuscular components on sports performance and quantify these effects. The authors hypothesized that injury prevention programs can improve certain sports performance criteria. Study Design Umbrella systematic review. Methods Systematic reviews published in French, German, or English between January 1990 and January 2020 were identified in five databases. Only articles that investigated multicomponent lower limb injury prevention programs and their effects on the performance criteria of strength, balance, agility, jumping or speed by both amateur and professional athletes of all ages and sex were included. The methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed by two reviewers independently using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews measurement tool. Results Five systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Overall, beneficial effects of multicomponent exercise-based injury prevention programs were observed for balance, agility, jumping and speed. While the effects on strength were more variable, there was a positive trend in favor of injury prevention programs.

METHODS In this observational analytical study, participants were selected purposively from among single students aged 18-30 years, who were residing at university dormitories in Tabriz, Iran, and had moderate or severe dysmenorrhea. They reported quality of their life during the past week using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) at two time points, days 3-4 and 11-12, of their menstrual cycle. RESULTS Among 52 participants with PMS and 64 without PMS, about half reported severe dysmenorrhea. The mean total quality score was significantly lower during perimenstrual week than during late follicular phase in both group with PMS [48 vs 79, mean difference - 31 (95% confidence interval - 37 to - 26)] and group without PMS [56 vs 78, - 1 (- 27 to - 18)].

Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios. Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation. We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the Covid-19 pandemic.

Yet our understanding of the immune mechanisms of viral tolerance is restricted to a small number of bat-virus relationships and remains poor for coronaviruses (CoVs), despite their relevance to human health. Proteomics holds particular promise for illuminating the immune factors involved in bat responses to infection, because it can accommodate especially low sample volumes (e.g., sera) and thus can be applied to both large and small bat species as well as in longitudinal studies where lethal sampling is necessarily limited. Further, as the serum proteome includes proteins secreted from not only blood cells but also proximal organs, it provides a more general characterization of immune proteins. Here, we expand our recent work on the serum proteome of wild vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) to better understand CoV pathogenesis. Across 19 bats sampled in 2019 in northern Belize with available sera, we detected CoVs in oral or rectal swabs from four individuals (21.1% positivity). Phylogenetic analyses identified all vampire bat sequences as novel -CoVs most closely related to known human CoVs. Across 586 identified serum proteins, we found no strong differences in protein composition nor abundance between uninfected and infected bats. However, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses identified seven to 32 candidate biomarkers of CoV infection, including AHSG, C4A, F12, GPI, DSG2, GSTO1, and RNH1. Enrichment analyses using these protein classifiers identified downregulation of complement, regulation of proteolysis, immune effector processes, and humoral immunity in CoV-infected bats alongside upregulation of neutrophil immunity, overall granulocyte activation, myeloid cell responses, and glutathione processes.

We investigated if an interaction existed between vitamin D levels and social deprivation in those with and without COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Upper or lower respiratory tract samples from 104 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in accordance with Public Health England criteria (January-May 2020) using RT-PCR. The latest serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D(25-OHD) levels, quantified by LC-MS/MS, was obtained for each patient (September 2019-April 2020). Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was generated for each patient. Univariate and logistic regression analyses examined associations between age, gender, 25-OHD, IMD score and SARS-CoV-2 result in the total cohort and subgroups. RESULTS: In the total cohort, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was significantly associated with lower 25-OHD levels and higher IMD. A positive test was associated with higher IMD in the male subgroup and with lower 25-OHD levels in those aged >72 years. Low 25-OHD and IMD quintile 5 were separately associated with positive COVID-19 outcome in the cohort. Patients in IMD quintile 5 with vitamin D levels &#8804; 34.4 nmol/L were most likely to have a positive COVID-19 outcome, even more so if aged >72 years (OR: 19.07, 95%CI: 1.71-212.25; P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, combined low vitamin D levels and higher social deprivation were most associated with COVID-19 infection. In older age, this combination was even more significant.

However, in the more industrialized countries, physical activity rates are declining, and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic may amplify this scenario. Thus, this study aimed to report the Italian populations physical activity profile living in the North-western regions during the national lockdown. METHODS: Physical activity was assessed using the official Italian short form of IPAQ, intended for Social Networking Services (SNS). Participation was voluntary, and people could fill the questionnaire simply by clicking on a specific link. RESULTS: The final sample size was 612 Italians, male and female, equally distributed (49.1% male and 50.9% female). Data showed a percentage of 15.4% of inactive subjects (MET < 700), 61.8% of moderate-active (MET 700C2500), and 22.9% of active people (MET > 2500). Women were more inactive than men (p < 0.01; 57.4% vs 42.6%). Furthermore, participants were classified into four classes of age: 18C29; 30C44; 45C59; and 60C79. Class 18C29 was prevalent (p < 0.01, 68.3%) and showed higher levels of physical activity (p < 0.05).

While initial causes of cytokine storms can vary, late-stage clinical manifestations of cytokine storm converge and often overlap, and therefore a better understanding of how normal immune response turns pathological is warranted. Here we propose a theoretical framework, where cytokine storm phenomenology is captured using a conceptual mathematical model, where cytokines can both activate and regulate the immune system. We simulate normal immune response to infection, and through variation of system parameters identify conditions where, within the frameworks of this model, cytokine storm can arise. We demonstrate that cytokine storm is a transitional regime, and identify three main factors that must converge to result in storm-like dynamics, two of which represent individual-specific characteristics, thereby providing a possible explanation for why some people develop CRS, while others may not. We also discuss possible ecological insights into cytokine-immune interactions and provide mathematical analysis for the underlying regimes.

PEGDA-QT gels were formulated using PEGDA of different molecular weights (PEGDA575 and PEGDA700), and their characteristics were examined in vitro. Experiments examined gel time, mass change, crosslink integrity, cytotoxicity, and protein release capabilities. In general, PEGDA575-QT gels were more hydrophobic, requiring an initiating solution with a higher pH (pH 9.5) to achieve a gel time comparable to PEGDA700-QT gels, which used an initiating solution at pH 9.19. The mass change and crosslink integrity of gels were analyzed over time after gels were submerged in 150 mM phosphate buffered saline. After 380 days, PEGDA575-QT gels achieved a maximum mass increase of 72% due to water uptake, while PEGDA700-QT gels doubled their initial mass (100% increase) by 165 days. Compression tests showed that PEGDA700-QT gels hydrolyzed more quickly than PEGDA575-QT gels. Cytotoxicity assays showed that in general, PEGDA575-QT negatively affected cell growth, while PEGDA700-QT gels promoted cell viability. Sustained, controlled release of lysozyme, a 14.3 kDa protein, was achieved over an 8-week period when loaded into PEGDA700-QT gels, but PEGDA575-QT gels did not show sustained release.

Herein, we investigated the binding of cyanovirin-N (CV-N) to surface-expressed glycoproteins such as those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120, hemagglutinin (HA), and Ebola (GP)1,2 and compared their binding affinities with the binding response to the trimer-folded gp140 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Binding-site knockout variants of an engineered dimeric CV-N molecule (CVN2) revealed a binding affinity that correlated with the number of (high-) affinity binding sites. Binding curves were specific for the interaction with N-linked glycans upon binding with two low-affinity carbohydrate binding sites. This biologically active assembly of a domain-swapped CVN2, or monomeric CV-N, bound to HA with a maximum KD of 2.7 nM.

So far, it is unknown if the reported variety in infection rates among healthcare personnel is related to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) or other factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between PPE use and SARS-CoV-2 infections among ED personnel in the Netherlands. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide survey, consisting of 42 questions about PPE-usage, ED layout - and workflow and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of permanent ED staff, was sent to members of the Dutch Society of Emergency Physicians. Members were asked to fill out one survey on behalf of the ED of their hospital. The association between PPE use and the infection rate was investigated using univariable and multivariable regression analyses, adjusting for potential confounders. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among permanent ED staff between 1 March and 15 May 2020. RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 64 EDs of which 45 responded (70.3%). In total, 164 ED staff workers [5.1 (3.2-7.0)%] tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period compared to 0.087% of the general population. There was significant clustering of infected ED staff in some hospitals (range: 0-23 infection). In 13 hospitals, an FFP2 (filtering facepiece particles >94% aerosol filtration) mask or equivalent and eye protection was worn for all contacts with patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during the whole study period. The unadjusted staff infection rate was higher in these hospitals [7.3 (3.4-11.1) vs. 4.0 (1.9-6.1)%, absolute difference + 3.3%]. Hospital staff testing policy was identified as a potential confounder of the relation between PPE use and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (collinearity statistic 0.95). After adjusting for hospital testing policy, type of PPE was not associated with incidence of COVID 19 infections among ED staff (P = 0.40). CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional study, the use of high-level PPE (FFP2 or equivalent and eye protection) by ED personnel during all contacts with patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to be associated with a lower infection rate of ED staff compared to lower level PPE use.

In this study, we conducted a systematic review of self-administered computerized cognitive assessment measures designed for the detection of cognitive impairment in older adults. Studies were identified via a systematic search of published peer-reviewed literature across major scientific databases. All studies reporting on psychometric validation of brief (30 minutes) self-administered computerized measures for detection of MCI and all-cause dementia in older adults were included. Seventeen studies reporting on 10 cognitive tools met inclusion criteria and were subjected to systematic review. There was substantial variability in characteristics of validation samples and reliability and validity estimates. Only 2 measures evaluated feasibility and usability in the intended clinical settings. Similar to past reviews, we found variability across measures with regard to psychometric rigor and potential for widescale applicability in clinical settings.

In this paper, we study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the delta Time Spent in Public Places (Delta-TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the Delta-TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent components of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find counties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior correlate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. We observe significant correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and unemployment.

Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether fomite transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative fomite transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the fomite route.

In this paper, we summarize recent changes to the scope of practice of pharmacists, cite ethical responsibilities from the American Pharmacists Association Code of Ethics, review data and comments from workplace surveys, and make a call for change. Corporate managers, state boards of pharmacy, and professional organizations have a shared responsibility to work with community pharmacists in all settings to find solutions that ensure optimal and ethical patient care. Attention to these areas will enhance patient care and increase job satisfaction.","output":"Pharmacy Practice in High-Volume Community Settings: Barriers and Ethical Responsibilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter (PM) require urban non-attainment areas to implement pollution-reduction strategies for anthropogenic source emissions. The type of fuel shown to decrease combustion emissions components versus traditional diesel fuel, is the diesel emulsion. The Lubrizol Corporation, in conjunction with Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and several subcontracting laboratories, recently conducted a health assessment of the combustion emissions of PuriNOx diesel fuel emulsion (diesel-water-methanol) in rodents. Combustion emissions from either of two, 2002 model Cummins 5.9L ISB engines, were diluted with charcoal-filtered air to exposure concentrations of 125, 250 and 500 microg total PM/m3. The engines were operated on a continuous, repeating, heavy-duty certification cycle (U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter I) using Rotella-T 15W-40 engine oil. Nitrogen oxide (NO) and PM were reduced when engines were operated on PuriNOx versus California Air Resources Board diesel fuel under these conditions. Male and female F344 rats were housed in Hazleton H2000 exposure chambers and exposed to exhaust atmospheres 6 h/day, five days/week for the first 11 weeks and seven days/week thereafter. Exposures ranged from 61 to 73 days depending on the treatment group. Indicators of general toxicity (body weight, organ weight, clinical pathology and histopathology), neurotoxicity (glial fibrillary acidic protein assay), genotoxicity (Ames assay, micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange), and reproduction and development were measured. Overall, effects observed were mild. Emulsion combustion emissions were not associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive/developmental toxicity, or in vivo genotoxicity. Small decreases in serum cholesterol in the 500-microg/m3 exposure group were observed. PM accumulation within alveolar macrophages was evident in all exposure groups. The latter findings are consistent with normal physiological responses to particle inhalation. Other statistically significant effects were present in some measured parameters of other exposed groups, but were not clearly attributed to emissions exposure. Positive mutagenic responses in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium were observed subsequent to treatment with emulsion emissions subfractions. Based on the cholesterol results, it can be concluded that the 250-microg/m3 exposure level was the no observed effect level. In general, biological findings in exposed rats and bacteria were consistent with exposure to petroleum diesel exhaust in the F344 rat and Ames assays.","output":"Health effects of subchronic exposure to diesel-water-methanol emulsion emission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders (TD) commonly co-occur. In addition, specific inattention difficulties and poor impulse control are related to TD in the absence of comorbid ADHD. In this study we reanalyzed data from a recently completed study comparing internet-delivered, self-help comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (ICBIT) with a waiting-list control group. The current study describes the effects of an (ICBIT) in children and adolescents with TD with and without comorbid diagnoses of ADHD or OCD at post intervention and over three- and six-month follow-up periods. Thirty-eight 7 to 18-year-olds completed the ICBIT. Of these, 16 were diagnosed with comorbid ADHD and 11 were diagnosed with OCD. A significant improvement in tic measures was found in all groups. Both the TD + ADHD and the TD ? ADHD groups were similar in the magnitude of tic reduction from baseline to post-treatment, and at the three and six-month follow-up assessments. However, the TD + OCD group benefitted less from intervention than the TDOCD group. There were meaningful reductions in parental reports of inattention, as well as hyperactive and impulsive symptoms at post intervention and over the 6-month follow-up period. Thus, ICBIT can be effectively delivered in the presence of comorbid ADHD or OCD symptomatology and may reduce symptoms of inattention and impulsivity. Larger studies of ICBIT in children and teens with TD and comorbid ADHD and OCD are needed to optimize responses to ICBIT.","output":"Acute and Long-Term Effects of an Internet-Based, Self-Help Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Children and Teens with Tic Disorders with Comorbid Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: A Reanalysis of Data from a Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases are nonsevere, but severe cases have high mortality and need early detection and treatment. We aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the disease progression of nonsevere COVID-19 based on simple data that can be easily obtained even in primary medical institutions. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we extracted data from initial simple medical evaluations of 495 COVID-19 patients randomized (2:1) into a development cohort and a validation cohort. The progression of nonsevere COVID-19 was recorded as the primary outcome. We built a nomogram with the development cohort and tested its performance in the validation cohort. RESULTS: The nomogram was developed with the nine factors included in the final model. The area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram scoring system for predicting the progression of nonsevere COVID-19 into severe COVID-19 was 0.875 and 0.821 in the development cohort and validation cohort, respectively. The nomogram achieved a good concordance index for predicting the progression of nonsevere COVID-19 cases in the development and validation cohorts (concordance index of 0.875 in the development cohort and 0.821 in the validation cohort) and had well-fitted calibration curves showing good agreement between the estimates and the actual endpoint events. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed nomogram built with a simplified index might help to predict the progression of nonsevere COVID-19; thus, COVID-19 with a high risk of disease progression could be identified in time, allowing an appropriate therapeutic choice according to the potential disease severity.","output":"Development and Validation of a Nomogram for Predicting the Disease Progression of Nonsevere Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SummarySocial workers in China have been involved significantly in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic This article introduces the innovative interdisciplinary remote networking framework which both provides a guide for medical and community social workers? involvement during the COVID-19 outbreaks, and also to support interdisciplinary collaboration with the aim of helping individuals and families in need during the pandemic FindingsThe implementation of interdisciplinary remote networking, developed by Chinese social workers, has effectively addressed the different domains of need experienced by the affected population and has established a new approach for social work in the field of health The framework also provides an effective model for setting up a targeted and sustained service system that links social workers with psychological and medical resources, which capitalize on social resources to buffer the negative impacts of the disease Social workers play an essential role during such a public health emergency, providing critical services for patients and families, medical workers, self-quarantined residents, and the general population ApplicationsThe service mode of interdisciplinary remote networking, based on the frontline experiences of social work interventions in China, may serve as a framework for combating COVID-19 in other countries The framework is among the initiatives that provide transferrable skills to social work practitioners working in network-based social work services during public health emergencies Thus, the framework presents implications for future practice development in both disaster social work and also public health social work","output":"Social work involvement in the COVID-19 response in China: Interdisciplinary remote networking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic has brought not only disaster to humanity but also the best in each human individual.

Chloroplast genomes have been widely used for plant phylogenetic inference recently. The number of complete chloroplast genomes increases rapidly with the development of various genome sequencing projects. However, no comprehensive platform or tool has been developed for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genomes. Thus, we constructed a comprehensive platform for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of complete chloroplast genomes which was named as chloroplast genome analysis platform (CGAP). RESULTS: CGAP is an interactive web-based platform which was designed for the comparative analysis of complete chloroplast genomes. CGAP integrated genome collection, visualization, content comparison, phylogeny analysis and annotation functions together. CGAP implemented four web servers including creating complete and regional genome maps of high quality, comparing genome features, constructing phylogenetic trees using complete genome sequences, and annotating draft chloroplast genomes submitted by users. CONCLUSIONS: Both CGAP and source code are available at http://www.herbbol.org:8000/chloroplast.

One hundred twenty diverse bread wheat genotypes were used in a pot experiment to explore the relationship among their fifteen physio-biochemical traits (PBT) by using multivariate analysis, heatmapping and stress tolerance index (STI) for grain yield as a marker trait to identify high yielding genotype with maximum stress tolerance capability. Increased proline and sugar accumulation were observed from control to moisture deficient environments by 159% and 122%, respectively. Moreover, leaf membrane stability index (LMSI), leaf relative water content (LRWC), relative dry weight (RDW), chlorophyll content, leaf surface area (LSA), Leaf succulence (LS), canopy temperature depression (CTD), relative excised leaf water loss (RELWL) and leaf osmotic potential (LOP) showed significantly decreasing trend in drought stress treatment as compared to well-watered plants by -21%, -21%, -34%, -22%, -38%, -37%, -46%, -18% and -35% respectively. Additionally, principal component analysis and genotype by trait biplot analysis showed that initial 7 principal components (PC1 to PC7) represented 77.27% and 79.02% of total cumulative variation under control and drought stress respectively.

By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation, and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for structure-based vaccine design. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics.

To support the design of a community-pharmacy program, we explored perspectives of PWID with chronic HCV with regard to barriers, motivators, preferences, and prior experiences related to HCV treatment and pharmacists. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with people living with HCV who reported active injection drug use. Participants were recruited from local community service and clinical organizations in the Seattle, Washington region, and focus groups and interviews were conducted in-person or via phone/video-conference. Rapid Assessment Process was used to analyze qualitative data. Dual coders used structured templates to summarize findings and engaged in iterative review to identify themes. RESULTS: Among the 40 participants, 65% were male, 52.5% were white, and 80% were not stably housed. On average, participants had been injecting drugs for 14 years and living with HCV for 6 years. Analyses revealed 3 themes: (1) limited knowledge regarding HCV and DAA treatments; (2) barriers/motivators for receiving treatment included fear of side effects, prior stigmatizing behaviors from physicians, and desire to protect relatives and the PWID community from HCV transmission; and (3) preferences for HCV care delivery, including a need for person-centered, low-barrier, and collaborative treatment integrated with other care (e.g. primary care and addiction treatment) for PWID. Participants were generally receptive to a community-pharmacy model for HCV treatment, but prior interactions with pharmacists were mixed and there were some concerns expressed that care delivered by pharmacists would not be equivalent to that of physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the direct-acting antivirals era, people who inject drugs still face major barriers to hepatitis C treatment which may be reduced by providing low-barrier points of access for care through pharmacists. Key recommendations for community-pharmacy design included providing care team training to reduce stigma and ensuring care team structures and culture target PWID-specific needs for education and engagement.

Little is known about the experiences and needs of these re-entering nurses. Objectives: Assessing the needs and experiences of re-entering nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Qualitative study using a pragmatist approach within the interpretative paradigm. Settings: This study took place in the following settings within the Dutch healthcare system: Intensive care units, COVID and regular departments within hospitals, nursing home settings, a rehabilitation centre and newly established COVID-19 departments within nursing home settings. Participants: We purposively selected 20 nurses who had re-entered nursing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and June 2020 in the Netherlands. The first interview was conducted on the eighth of May 2020. Methods: We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews in Dutch. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed via thematic content analysis in the coding program of MAXQDA2020. This study followed the SRQR and COREQ guidelines. Results: Seven main themes were identified. Clear job description: Participants mentioned that a lack of a clear job description led to lack of clarity about the kind of tasks that re-entering nurses were expected and allowed to perform. Training: the majority of the participants had received none or little training prior to their return. Training content: Re-entering nurses mentioned to wish for an easily accessible mentorship structure and an individualised and practical training program. Positive team dynamic: Re-entering nurses felt supported by a positive team dynamic, which was shaped by the sense of urgency and relevance of their work and helped them deal with stressful experiences. Mental health: Nearly all participants mentioned that re-entering during a pandemic did not lead to impairment of their mental health. mental health support: Most participants mentioned being able to cope with their mental health independently, sharing experiences with family and colleagues Conclusion: The results indicate that a rapid and safe return to nursing during a pandemic could be facilitated by: a clear description of roles and responsibilities; an individualised assessment determining the competences and knowledge disparities of re-entering nurses; practical training focussing on competencies needed during a pandemic; and a collaborative mentorship structure to guide re-entering nurses.

We collect 35 province-specific pre-covid variables related to demographics, geography, economic activity, and work mobility. First, we test whether their within-region variation explains the covid-19 incidence during the Italian second wave. We use the LASSO algorithm to isolate variables with high explanatory power. Then, we test if their explanatory power disappears after the introduction of the regional-level policies.Findings: The within-region variation of seven pre-covid characteristics is statistically significant (F-test p-value < 0  001) and explains a further 21% of the province-level variation of covid-19 incidence, on top of region-specific factors, before regional policies were introduced.

The lack of relief commodities, especially life-saving items, is a life-threatening loss to victims and must be considered when making emergency supply allocation and transportation decisions, even in the pre-disaster prepositioning phase. This paper proposes a scenario-based stochastic program that integrates the decisions of prepositioning facility locations, quantities of stocked emergency supplies, and service allocations in each scenario in the same modeling framework. The estimation of victims losses for waiting for emergency supplies is measured in the typical deprivation cost function and treated as one of the main bases of decision making, besides traditional transportation costs, in determining the service allocation strategies in each scenario. Specifically, a case study with data from the hurricane threat in the Gulf Coast area of the US was conducted to demonstrate the application of this model and the significance of considering victims welfare loss in humanitarian relief logistics.

The car rental is critical to the success of the tourism industry, yet it remains under, and thus there is limited knowledge on how the previous pandemic impacted the car rentals industry. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 on the car rental as well as ride and share transport niches of the tourism industry. Making use of secondary and archival data, the study found that the two subsectors lost revenue amounting to billions of dollars in potential revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic resulted in company rating downgrades, market volatility and loss of share value for leading entities such as Hertz, Avis, Europcar, Uber and Lyft. However, the impact of the pandemic on ride and share transport was moderate compared to car rentals. The pandemic led to Hertz filing for bankruptcy, albeit after paying US$16 million in retention bonuses on the eve of bankruptcy to its executives. Losses led to various cost-containment measures, which saw a record number of employees being laid off and disposal of non-core assets. The chapter recommends a robust, coordinated health and safety certification and protocol for the industry to ensure the safety of passengers and employees to boost confidence in the sector as it emerges from the pandemic. Furthermore, a call is made to revisit employment conditions in this sector with the view to provide better protection of employees from the COVID-19 and other disaster-related market shocks. A revision of the current business model is imperative, given the vulnerability of the sector to shock to ensure disaster resilience.

In contrast to an acute cold, it appears from several questionnaire-based studies that in the context of COVID-19 infection, anosmia is the main rhinological symptom and is usually not associated with other rhinological symptoms such as rhinorrhoea or nasal obstruction. Until now, no study has directly compared smell and taste function between COVID-19 patients and patients with other causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) using valid and reliable psychophysical tests. In this study, we aimed to objectively assess and compare olfactory and gustatory functions in 10 COVID-19 patients (PCR diagnosed, assessed on average 2 weeks after infection), 10 acute cold (AC) patients (assessed before the COVID-19 outbreak) and 10 healthy controls, matched for age and sex.

It also has a considerable influence on the results of rigid body and Finite Element (FE) musculoskeletal models that rely on SM-based kinematics to estimate muscle, contact and ligament forces. Current techniques devised to compensate for STA, in particular multi-body optimization methods, often consider simplified joint models. Although joint personalization with anatomical constraints has improved kinematic estimation, these models yet don't represent a fully reliable solution to the STA problem, thus allowing us to envisage an alternative approach. In this perspective, we propose to develop a conceptual FE-based model of the lower limb for STA compensation and evaluate it for 66 healthy subjects under level walking motor task. Both hip and knee joint kinematics were analyzed, considering both rotational and translational joint motion. Results showed that STA caused underestimation of the hip joint kinematics (up to 2.2) for all rotational DoF, and overestimation of knee joint kinematics (up to 12) except in flexion/extension. Joint kinematics, in particular the knee joint, appeared to be sensitive to soft tissue stiffness parameters (rotational and translational mean difference up to 1.5 and 3.4 mm).

As a counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS and acute lung injury. The affinity of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 for human ACE2 (hACE2) largely determines the degree of clinical symptoms after infection by SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that regulating the ACE2/RAS system is effective in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-induced ARDS and acute lung injury. Since ACE2 is the host cell receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, regulating the ACE2/RAS system may alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.

Individuals who believed wearing masks protected others were more likely to report voluntarily wearing them, showing evidence of altruism. Perceiving social pressure negatively impacted the probability of voluntary mask wearing amongst those who believed masks have a role in society, suggesting social shaming wont increase compliance among these individuals. Free-riding is one possible explanation for why an individual respondent may self-report belief that mask wearing has a role in society and simultaneously self-report not voluntarily wearing a mask in public locations. Alternatively, incomplete knowledge, confusion about the role of masks in controlling spread of COVID-19, or fatigue are all possible explanations for why adults who believe masks play a role demonstrate less than optimal compliance themselves with mask wearing. Promotion of altruism, rather than social shaming, is likely to increase mask wearing based on this analysis.

Its causes have not been investigated yet. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that pulmonary capillary leakage affects the severity of respiratory failure, causing a shift of fluids and proteins through the epithelial-endothelial barrier. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms, 92 admitted to the intermediate medicine ward (IMW) and 82 to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, were studied. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics at admission were considered. Proteins, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed in 26 ICU patients. In addition, ten autopsy ultrastructural lung studies were performed in patients with COVID-19 and compared with postmortem findings in a control group (bacterial pneumonia-ARDS and H1N1-ARDS). ICU patients had lower serum albumin than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g L-1 , P < 0.001]. Serum albumin was lower in more compromised groups (lower PaO2 -to-FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings) and was associated with 30 days of probability of survival. Protein concentration was correlated with IL-8 and IL-10 levels in BALF. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten COVID-19 lung tissues showed loosening of junctional complexes, quantitatively more pronounced than in controls, and direct viral infection of type 2 pneumocytes and endothelial cells.

The target population consisted of patients in whom mTICI 2c-3 was achieved, stratified into two groups: (1) mTICI 2c-3 achieved after the first pass (FPE group) or (2) after multiple passes (non-FPE group). Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource use were compared between groups. Costs from peer-reviewed literature were applied to assess cost consequences from the perspectives of the United States (USA), France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom (UK). RESULTS Among patients who achieved mTICI 2c-3 (n=172), FPE was achieved in 53% (n=91). A higher proportion of patients in the FPE group reached good functional outcomes (90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 80.46% vs 61.04%, p<0.01). The patients in the FPE group had a shorter mean length of stay (6.10 vs 9.48 days, p<0.01) and required only a single stent retriever, whereas 35% of patients in the non-FPE group required at least one additional device. Driven by improvement in clinical outcomes, the FPE group had lower procedural/hospitalization-related (24-33% reduction) and annual care (11-27% reduction) costs across all countries. CONCLUSIONS FPE resulted in improved clinical outcomes, translating into lower healthcare resource use and lower estimated costs.","output":"Health economic impact of first-pass success among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy: a United States and European perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread obstreperously in India. The increase in daily confirmed cases accelerated significantly from ~ 5 additional new cases (ANC)/day during early March up to ~ 249 ANC/day during early June. An abrupt change in this temporal pattern was noticed during mid-April, from which can be inferred a much reduced impact of the nationwide lockdown in India. Daily maximum (T(Max)), minimum (T(Min)), mean (T(Mean)) and dew point temperature (T(Dew)), wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and diurnal range in temperature and relative humidity during March 01 to June 04, 2020 over 9 major affected cities are analyzed to look into the impact of daily weather on COVID-19 infections on that day and 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before those cases were detected (i.e., on the likely transmission days). Spearmans correlation exhibits significantly lower association with WS, T(Max), T(Min), T(Mean), T(Dew), but is comparatively better with a lag of 14 days. Support Vector regression successfully estimated the count of confirmed cases (R(2) > 0.8) at a lag of 12C16 days, thus reflecting a probable incubation period of 14  02 days in India. Approximately 75% of total cases were registered when T(Max), T(Mean), T(Min), T(Dew), and WS at 12C16 days previously were varying within the range of 33.6C41.3 C, 29.8C36.5 C, 24.8C30.4 C, 18.7C23.6 C, and 4.2C5.75 m/s, respectively. Thus, we conclude that coronavirus transmission is not well correlated (linearly) with any individual weather parameter; rather, transmission is susceptible to a certain weather pattern.

METHODS: Using retrospective data from JanuaryCJune 2020, compared to a similar 2019 period, we calculated weekly 2020C2019 ratios of Non-COVID-19 ED visits for adults and children (age 18 years or less) by age range. Outcomes were pediatric ED visit rates before and after the onset of pandemic, by age, disposition, and diagnosis. RESULTS: We included data from 2,213,828 visits to 144 EDs and 4 urgent care centers in 18 U.S. states, including 7 EDs in children's hospitals. During the pandemic period, adult non-COVID-19 visits declined to 60% of 2019 volumes and then partially recovered but remained below 2019 levels through June 2020. Pediatric visits declined even more sharply, with peak declines through the week of April 15 of 74% for children age < 10 years and 67% for 14C17 year. Visits recovered by June to 72% for children age 14C17, but to only 50% of 2019 levels for children < age 10 years. Declines were seen across all ED types and locations, and across all diagnoses, with an especially sharp decline in non-COVID-19 communicable diseases. During the pandemic period, there was 22% decline in common serious pediatric conditions, including appendicitis. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED visits fell more sharply than adult ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and remained depressed through June 2020, especially for younger children. Declines were also seen for serious conditions, suggesting that parents may have avoided necessary care for their children.","output":"Characterizing pediatric emergency department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the article, the author discusses the characteristics and benefits of successful health alliance strategies by presenting evidence from rural healthcare in the U S Also cited are how the COVID-19 pandemic provided opportunities to improve access to healthcare and promote strategic alliances, and the report by the National Rural Health Resource Center showing the trends and disruptors in rural healthcare environment","output":"PRACTITIONER APPLICATION: Characteristics of Successful Health Alliance Strategies: Evidence from Rural Healthcare Experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is highly infectious and its ongoing outbreak has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO.

The intrauterine vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 also remains controversial. Herein, we discuss the potential effect of COVID-19 on maternal and infant outcomes based on current studies, including those published in Chinese, in a total of 80 mothers with COVID-19 and 80 infants. We also comprehensively explored the mother-to-child transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2, in particular the route of intrauterine vertical transmission. Given SARS-CoV-2 is a sister to SARS-CoV, of the SARS-related coronavirus species, we made a comprehensive comparison between them to learn from experiences with SARS. Although there is no evidence supporting the intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, our comprehensive analysis suggests that the adverse maternal and infant outcomes caused by COVID-19 cannot be underestimated. Further, we speculated that the inconsistency between nucleic acids and serological characteristics IgM to SARS-CoV-2 of infants' specimens may be caused by the disruption of the amniotic barrier by the inflammatory factors induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods This was a prospective, controlled study conducted on patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Health Sciences University, Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital. In this study, 55 patients were included. The patients were divided into two groups as the ozone group and the control group. Ozone therapy (major autohemotherapy) was applied to 37 patients who were being treated with the appropriate COVID-19 treatment protocol determined by the infectious diseases committee of our hospital. The ozone treatment protocol consisted of seven sessions (1 session/day) of intravenous ozone administration, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 30 g/mL. Only the conventional COVID-19 treatment protocol was applied to 18 patients in the control group. Clinical follow-up was performed until the discharge of the patients from the hospital with successful treatment or until the mortality occurred. Factors affecting mortality were analyzed using univariate regression analysis. Results Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization was required in six of 37 patients who were treated with ozone (16.2%), while four of 18 patients in the control group required ICU treatment (22.2%) (p = 0.713). When the mortality rates between the two groups were compared, mortality was lower in the ozone group (p = 0.032). As a result of univariate logistic regression analysis performed to determine the factors affecting mortality, treatment without ozone therapy was determined as a risk factor for mortality (OR:0.149, 95%CI 0.026-0.863, p=0.034).

Common susceptible factors originated from intergenerational transmission may be underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the intergenerational transmission of depression and anxiety during early outbreak of COVID-19 and further examined whether the transmission of child neglect and difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) was associated with the transmission of psychological distresses. METHODS: Self-reported questionnaires of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related worries, difficulties in ER, physical and emotional neglect suffered in childhood were completed by 2011 Chinese parent - offspring dyads. Path analysis was used to examine hypothesized relationships. RESULTS: The proportions of physical neglect and emotional neglect were 31.2% and 16.9% respectively among parents, while 28.6% and 20.8% respectively among offspring. There were remarkably similar in response patterns between parents and offspring. Parents' COVID-19 related worries, depression and anxiety levels were significantly associated with offspring's COVID-19 related worries, depression and anxiety. Difficulties in ER not only impacted psychological distresses directly, but also mediated the relationships between childhood neglect and psychological distresses among both parents and offspring. Difficulties in ER and childhood neglect, as important risk factors, were modestly transmitted from parent to offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Family members shared a certain degree of similarity in psychological reactions to trauma. Transmitted susceptible factors from parents to offspring may contribute to this similarity.

DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of these two patient groups met by the emergency medical services. METHODS: All prehospital patients after the World Health Organisation (WHO) pandemic declaration 11.3.2020 until 30.6.2020 were recruited for the study. The patients were screened using modified WHO criteria for suspected COVID-19. Data from the electronic prehospital patient reporting system were linked with hospital laboratory results to check the laboratory confirmation for COVID-19. For comparison, we divided the patients into two groups: screening- and laboratory-positive patients with a hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 and screening-positive but laboratory-negative patients who eventually received a different diagnosis in hospital. RESULTS: A total of 4157 prehospital patients fulfilled the criteria for suspected COVID-19 infection during the study period. Five-hundred-thirty-six (12.9%) of the suspected cases received a laboratory confirmation for COVID-19. The proportion of positive cases in relation to suspected ones peaked during the first 2 weeks after the declaration of the pandemic. In the comparison of laboratory-positive and laboratory-negative cases, there were clinically insignificant differences between the groups in age, tympanic temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, on-scene time, urgency category of the call and mode of transportation. Foreign-language-speakers were overrepresented amongst the positive cases over native language speakers (26,6% vs. 7,4%, p < 0,001).

A pilot study followed by further verification and control melanoma patient cohorts involving three phase III multicenter clinical trials was used to verify if an immune gene SNP panel could identify if adjuvant BCG therapy correlates with disease outcomes. We found a specific immune gene SNP panel that could identify which patients would respond to adjuvant BCG immunotherapy, but it was not applicable in the control non-immunotherapy treated patients. These studies provide evidence that SNP immune-gene assessment has utility in predicting melanoma patients immunotherapy responses to adjuvant BCG immunotherapy. ABSTRACT: Adjuvant immunotherapy in melanoma patients improves clinical outcomes. However, success is unpredictable due to inherited heterogeneity of immune responses. Inherent immune genes associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence anti-tumor immune responses. We assessed the predictive ability of 26 immune-gene SNPs genomic panels for a clinical response to adjuvant BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gurin) immunotherapy, using melanoma patient cohorts derived from three phase III multicenter clinical trials: AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage IV patients given adjuvant BCG (pilot cohort; n = 92), AJCC stage III patients given adjuvant BCG (verification cohort; n = 269), and AJCC stage III patients that are sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive receiving no immunotherapy (control cohort; n = 80). The SNP panel analysis demonstrated that the responder patient group had an improved disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84, 95% CI 1.09C3.13, p = 0.021) in the pilot cohort. In the verification cohort, an improved overall survival (OS) (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.07C2.67, p = 0.025) was observed. No significant differences of SNPs were observed in DFS or OS in the control patient cohort. This study demonstrates that SNP immune genes can be utilized as a predictive tool for identifying melanoma patients that are inherently responsive to BCG and potentially other immunotherapies in the future.","output":"Genetic Variants in Immune Related Genes as Predictors of Responsiveness to BCG Immunotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundTwo-dose mRNA vaccines reduce COVID-19 related hospitalization and mortality, but immune protection declines over time. As such, third vaccine doses are now recommended, particularly for older adults. We examined immune response durability up to six months after two vaccine doses, and immunogenicity after a third vaccine dose, in 151 adults ranging in age from 24 to 98 years. MethodsSpecimens were collected from 81 healthcare workers (median age 41 years), 56 older adults (median 78 years) and 14 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (median 48 years), at one, three and six months following the second vaccine dose, and from 15 HCW, 28 older adults and 3 convalescent individuals at one month following a third vaccine dose. Binding antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain were quantified using a commercial immunoassay. Virus neutralizing activity was assessed using a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. ResultsCompared to healthcare workers, older adults displayed [~]0.3 log10 lower peak binding antibodies one month after the second vaccine dose (p<0.0001) and modestly faster rates of antibody decline thereafter (p=0.0067). A higher burden of chronic health conditions was independently associated with faster rates of antibody decline after correction for age, sociodemographic factors, and vaccine-related variables. Peak neutralizing activity was 4-fold lower in older adults one month after the second vaccine dose (p<0.0001) and became undetectable in the majority of individuals by six months. One month after a third vaccine dose, binding antibodies and neutralizing activities surpassed peak values achieved after two doses in both healthcare workers and older adults, and differences between these groups were no longer statistically significant. Compared to both naive groups, convalescent individuals displayed slower rates of binding antibody decline (p<0.006) and maintained higher neutralizing activity six months after the second vaccine dose. ConclusionsImmune responses to two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are overall weaker in older adults, and also decline more quickly over time, compared to younger adults. A third COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose enhanced binding and neutralizing antibodies to levels higher than those observed after two vaccine doses, but the rate of decline of these responses should be monitored, particularly in older adults with a higher burden of chronic health conditions.","output":"Older Adults Mount Less Durable Humoral Responses to a Two-dose COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Regimen, but Strong Initial Responses to a Third Dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction An international reform on anatomy education has witnessed a transition from traditional cadaveric teaching, often reliant on rote-learning, toward visualization-based learning approaches. Multimodality of the learning preferences of Generation Z and the steep threshold learning curve in anatomy has led to the conception of gamification as a means of improving anatomy engagement, with reference to the Ebbinghaus (1880) forgetting curve. The aim of this study was to quantify student engagement using Quitch?, a gamified mobile learning platform and assess the impact of the app on student academic performance in an undergraduate Musculoskeletal Anatomy unit. Method 157 students enrolled in undergraduate Health and Science degrees at Swinburne University Australia were invited to download Quitch? during the COVID-19 remote learning period. In a student-faculty partnership project, a Quitch? unit with learning modules segregated for six regional anatomy topics, featuring 12 sections, was developed for Musculoskeletal Anatomy by 3rd year past students. Engagement was quantified using a 4-stage ordinal scale (1-4), based on access time from quiz release. The correlation between engagement, retention and academic performance for two virtual ?spotter? examinations was analysed. Results Preliminary results indicate that ?highly engaged? students who completed the quizzes within 14 days, quantified with a mode ordinal score of 1, scored an average grade of 67.050.18% on virtual spotter examinations;21.37% higher than those who did not engage with Quitch?. Students who did not attempt the majority of quizzes (63.92%), quantified with an ordinal score of 4, received an average of 45.680.22% in their examinations. Completion and accuracy data from the Quitch? leaderboard indicated that the top 20 users received an average grade of 77.50%, in comparison to 49.86% for students with low engagement. Student retention increased from 88.7% in 2019 to 96.7% in 2020;while 79% of students reported an ?increased sense of belonging'in the unit. Conclusion Quitch? offers personalized learning capabilities, mobility with notification capacity, tracking of at-risk students and allows the delivery of high-quality case-based, radiology and virtual spotter questions. We showcase the accommodation of multimodal learning preferences of students through content co-creation by students-as-partners in a platform that uses competitive leaderboards and badges to improve student engagement. Our analytics validate the efficacy of spaced repetition to consolidate long-term retention for improved performance in practical examinations. Implications The results on the efficacy of Quitch for improved student engagement in Anatomy is presented, demonstrating how student-centred virtual learning can be cultivated in remote learning, with the benefits of students-as-partners and the social constructivism theory in content design discussed as an approach to improve engagement and performance.","output":"Breaking Boundaries: Effectiveness of Gamification and Student Co-Creation for Anatomy Remote Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This quality improvement project aimed to drive large scale and sustained change to reduce the burden of chronic kidney disease in the UK.

Graphs showing progressive kidney disease are sent directly back to general practitioners (GPs) to alert them to rereview patient care and if necessary, refer to renal services. The aim of this evaluation study was to explain the barriers and drivers to implementation and adoption of the eGFR graph intervention. This evaluation study involved 5 of the 20 participating renal units (sites). A developmental evaluation approach was used. Methods included collection of descriptive data about graph reporting; GP surveys (n=68); focus groups (n=4) with practices; face-to-face interviews with secondary care clinicians (n=10). Results showed the mean number of graphs reviewed per week per site was 230, taking 1 hour per week per site. Only 18.2% graphs highlighted a concerning decline in kidney function. Important enablers to sustain the intervention were low cost, easy to understand, a sense of local ownership and perceived impact. Barriers included nephrologists perceived increase in new referrals. We concluded that developmental evaluation can explain the barriers/drivers to implementation of a national quality improvement project that involves a variety of different stakeholders. The intervention has the potential to slow down progression of kidney disease due to the eGFR prompts alerting GPs to review the patient record and take action, such as reviewing medications and referring to renal teams if progressive kidney disease had not been identified previously.","output":"Quality improvement at scale: evaluation of the drivers and barriers to adoption and sustainability of an intervention to reduce late referral in chronic kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood.

It is unclear how the virus passes from the upper respiratory tract to the myocardium. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 is present in the blood of COVID-19 infected patients, spreading to other organs such as heart. METHODS: We targeted two viroporins, Orf3a and E, in SARS-CoV-2. Orf3a and E form non-voltage-gated ion channels. A combined fluorescence potassium ion assay with three channel modulators (4-aminopyridine, emodin-Orf3a channel blocker, and gliclazide-E channel blocker) was developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a/E channel activity. In blood samples, we subtracted the fluorescence signals in the absence and presence of emodin/gliclazide to detect Orf3a and E channel activity. RESULTS: In lentivirus-spiked samples, we detected significant channel activity of Orf3a/E based on increase in fluorescence induced by 4-aminopyridine, and this increase in fluorescence was inhibited by emodin and gliclazide. In 18 antigen/PCR-positive samples, our test results found 15 are positive, demonstrating 83.3% concordance. In 24 antigen/PCR-negative samples, our test results found 21 are negative, showing 87.5% concordance. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a cell-free test that can detect Orf3a/E channel activity of SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples from COVID-19-infected individuals, confirming a hypothesis that the virus spreads to the heart via blood circulation.","output":"Detecting SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a and E ion channel activity in COVID-19 blood samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of pandemic Coronavirus Disease (COVID19) leading to cause Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction then death However, there was a controversial efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) Novel therapies to treat COVID-19-induced CRS become urgent needed One of the most common cytokine that showed to be critical in the COVID-19 is the IL-6 and this article discuss the pathogenesis of this cytokine in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Also, this article proposes to utilize interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade and potential therapeutic effect of IFN-y to manage COVID19-induced CRS and discuss several factors that should be taken into consideration for its clinical application","output":"Pathogenesis of IL-6 and potential therapeutic of IFN- in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given a closed hyperbolic manifold of dimension $\\\\neq 3$ we prove that the multiplicity of the Pollicott-Ruelle resonance of the geodesic flow on perpendicular one-forms at zero agrees with the first Betti number.

Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs when IgG antibodies form against platelet factor 4-Heparin complex, resulting in platelet activation and removal, leading to a prothrombotic state. Studies have shown that only 6% who are investigated serologically for HIT actually have the diagnosis. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on all COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized between March and June 2020. Patients with suspicion for HIT were tested for HIT antibodies with IgG-specific platelet factor 4(PF4)-dependent enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Confirmatory testing with serotonin release assay (SRA) and heparin-induced platelet aggregation were used in cases with intermediate or low optical density (OD) with EIA positivity (EIA+). Due to rarity of disease, a through literature review on HIT in COVID-19 patients was also analyzed. Results Incidence of EIA + in COVID-19 patients was 0.6%, significantly higher than in the general population 0.2% (p < 0.0001). The incidence of thromboembolic events in EIA + patients was 87.5%, significantly higher than the rate of 10.90% in all COVID-19 patients (p < 0.0001). The mortality rate in EIA + patients was 50%, significantly greater than the mortality rate of 12% in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0011). Serological confirmation of HIT diagnosis was 37.5% which is significantly higher than confirmation of HIT in nonCOVID-19 patients 6% (p < 0.0001). Of 39 HIT antibody positive patients in the literature, 23.07% had positive confirmatory testing (6 SRA, 3 HIPAA) which is significantly higher than 5.6% in the general population (p = 0.00001). The incidence of thrombosis in EIA + COVID-19 patients in the literature was 56.4% which is significantly higher than reported rates of thrombotic events in in all COVID-19 patients in the literature at 4.8% 1 (p = 0.00001). Conclusion Our study indicates incidence of HIT is higher in the COVID-19 population. This can be attributed to the cytokine storm and severe sepsis seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our study also suggests that development of HIT can contribute to increased risk for thromboembolic events as well as mortality of COVID-19 patients, however, our study is limited due to small sample size.","output":"Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited data is available on feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by Leishmania infantum worldwide. The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL, the epidemiological role of the cat in L. infantum infection, clinical manifestations, and recommendations on diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, prognosis and prevention of infection, in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats. The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence-based studies and case reports, clinical experience and critical consensus discussions. While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis, clinical illness due to L. infantum in cats is rare. The prevalence rates of feline infection with L. infantum in serological or molecular-based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 %. Cats are able to infect sand flies and, therefore, they may act as a secondary reservoir, with dogs being the primary natural reservoir. The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative, exfoliative, crusting or nodular dermatitis (mainly on the head or distal limbs), ocular lesions (mainly uveitis), feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome, mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions, hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia. Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis is based on serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) or culture. If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL, the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods (cytology, histology with IHC, PCR, culture) should be employed. The most common treatment used is allopurinol. Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases. Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy. Follow-up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests, serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses. Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available.","output":"LeishVet update and recommendations on feline leishmaniosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be considered a systemic disease with a specific tropism for the vascular system, in which the alterations of the microcirculation have an important pathogenetic role. The lungs are the main organ involved in COVID-19, and severe progressive respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in the affected patients; however, many other organs can be involved with variable clinical manifestations. Concerning abdominal manifestations, the gastrointestinal tract and the hepatobiliary system are mainly affected, although the pancreas, urinary tract and spleen may also be involved. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms are loss of appetite, followed by nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal imaging findings include bowel wall thickening, sometimes associated with hyperemia and mesenteric thickening, fluid-filled segments of the large bowel and rarely intestinal pneumatosis and ischemia. Hepatic involvement manifests as an increase in the enzymatic levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, serum bilirubin and -glutamyl transferase with clinical manifestations in most cases mild and transient. The most frequent radiological features are hepatic steatosis, biliary sludge and gallstones. Edematous acute pancreatitis, kidney infarct and acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis have been described more rarely in COVID-19. Lastly, splenic involvement is characterized by splenomegaly and by the development of solitary or multifocal splenic infarcts with classic wedge-shaped or even rounded morphology, with irregular or smooth profiles. In summary, the abdominal radiological findings of COVID-19 are nonspecific and with poor pathological correlation reported in the literature. Ultrasound and particularly computed tomography with multiphasic acquisition are the diagnostic methods mainly utilized in COVID-19 patients with abdominal clinical symptoms and signs. Although radiological signs are not specific of abdominal and gastrointestinal involvement, the diagnostic imaging modalities and in particular computed tomography are helpful for the clinician in the management, evaluation of the severity and evolution of the COVID-19 patients.","output":"Abdominal and gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19 patients: Is imaging useful?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID19 has challenged the already established predictive tools in critical care There is a plethora of unintegrated, untested, underpowered risk-stratification tools, derived using traditional linear modelling with limited predictability for the wider population Artificial neural network approaches could help developing tools which can be integrated into EMRs METHODS: We have developed a proof of concept algorithm based on our proprietary artificial neural network (ANN) methodology using 8 markers derived from clinical and laboratory data of 40 critical care patients obtained within 24 hours of ICU admission The methodology uses a proprietary stepwise ANN algorithm with extensive regularisation and cross validation to identify an optimised panel of markers having maximum sensitivity and specificity The crossvalidation strategy does not rely on large data sets but rather analyses smaller data sets in parallel In this process, markers are added sequentially, and their classification performance monitored The optimised marker panel is then incorporated into a tuned classifier further optimising performance The final stage takes the validated classifier and converts it to a piece of software RESULTS: Our ANN derived clinical risk-stratification model predicts ICU mortality with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 94% The optimal performance was reached after adding eight parameters: LDH, Bilirubin, Heart rate, platelet count, sex, age, white blood cell count and number of co-morbidities The model resulted in two misclassifications: The one false positive case was in the training set and one false negative in the test set The model AUC overall was 0 98 with a corrected threshold of 0 54 CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, significant amounts of health data covering admission, monitoring and outcome have been collected Routine ICU data capture is well developed and standardised Our preliminary results support the use of the ANN derived algorithm for mortality prediction, derived from commonly available clinical data Our model will need external validation in larger datasets from diverse geographic regions, however has the potential to be integrated in electronic clinical information systems to aid resource utilisation and recruitment of high-risk patients to clinical trials","output":"Icu risk prediction from commonly measured clinical data using artificial neural network tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cluster of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China emerged in December 2019.

In this regard, the Brief Sexuality-Related Communication (BSC) is presented as a viable and effective alternative for addressing sexual and reproductive health problems, assessing risk behaviors and motivating clients to generate behavioral change. Since health providers are key actors in treatment and prevention, it is essential to know their perceptions about the BSC intervention, as well as its acceptability in different contexts, with diverse client populations. Thus, the following paper reflects the findings of the perceptions and experiences of health providers in Peru from the first phase of the Feasibility study of a BSC intervention to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancies. METHODS This is the first phase of a multisite and multiphase study of the feasibility of a BSC intervention. We conducted twenty in-depth interviews (IDI) with health care providers (physicians, obstetricians, psychologists, nurses and peer counselors) recruited from three health care institutions in Peru: The Tahuantinsuyo Bajo Maternal and Child Center (CMI) and the San Jos Maternal and Child Center, both located in the capital city, Lima; and La Caleta Hospital located in Chimbote, northern coast of Peru. Participating health providers included those working at the HIV/STI Reference service and the family planning/reproductive health service. The IDI addressed three domains: 1) Acceptability of the BSC intervention; 2) Perceived willingness to implement the BSC intervention; and 3) Considerations for the Implementation of the BSC intervention. RESULTS Health providers expressed high acceptance of the BSC intervention, considering it as a useful and effective instrument to address sexual and reproductive health problems with all clients; however, some providers had some concerns about the real impact of the intervention to achieve significant behavior change. On the other hand, health providers showed high willingness to learn and implement the BSC intervention, affirming their commitment to learn new techniques and strategies that could allow them to improve their knowledge and the quality of their care. Health care providers consider it necessary to take into account the barriers that arise in the implementation of the BSC intervention, such as the structural limitations to access, the providers' abilities to deliver the intervention effectively, and the participants' reception of the intervention. Finally, providers consider it essential to establish the BSC intervention in a normative framework that allows it to receive the support of the health departments and eventually enforces implementation. CONCLUSIONS Health providers consider the BSC intervention as an interesting and exciting behavioral intervention to deal with the sexual and reproductive health issues existing in different populations, and seemed highly willing to adapt and implement it, hoping that it become beneficial to all client populations to prevent HIV/STIs and unintended pregnancies.","output":"Brief intervention to prevent HIV, STI and unintended pregnancies: preliminary results of a feasibility study from the perspective of healthcare providers in Peru."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light devices are effective in reducing contamination on N95 filtering facepiece respirators.

MEASUREMENTS Two hundred and three participants (mean age = 60.4 [6.5] years, 69.0% female) with mild memory complaints were asked to rate their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and their memory performance using the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), which measures self-awareness of memory ability. Neurocognitive performance was evaluated using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Trail Making Test, Buschke Selective Reminding Test, and the Brief Visuospatial Test - Revised (BVMT-R). RESULTS Total PSQI scores were significantly associated with objective measures of sustained attention (CPT hit reaction time by block and standard error by block) and subjective memory loss (MFQ frequency and seriousness of forgetting). The PSQI components of (poorer) sleep quality and (greater) sleep disturbance were related to (worse) sustained attention scores while increased sleep latency and daytime sleepiness were associated with greater frequency and seriousness of forgetting.

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7-99.4]; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections.

We report our single-center experience of Y-stent assisted coiling of bifurcation aneurysms with the closed cell Enterprise stent in order to evaluate the safety and long-term results of this technique. The literature on Y-stenting and its hemodynamic effects are reviewed. METHODS Fifty-two consecutive patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms underwent Y-stent assisted coiling with two Enterprise stents. The procedure was completed in 48 cases (92.3%) and technical failure occurred in 4 cases (7.3%). Cases performed with other stents were excluded. All procedures were performed under double antiplatelet therapy. Periodic clinical and neuroradiological follow-up was performed. RESULTS Mean neuroradiological follow-up time was 26 months. Complete immediate occlusion was obtained in 87.5% of patients. Two remnants had regrown at follow-up and were recoiled, achieving complete occlusion. The late neuroradiological occlusion rate was: complete occlusion 93.6%, neck remnant 4.3%, sac remnant 2.1%. No in-stent stenosis was detected at follow-up. Among the 48 procedures, two complications occurred (4.2%). Mortality was 2.1%. No delayed ischemic stroke occurred. CONCLUSIONS Y-stent assisted coiling has a high immediate occlusion rate and very good long-term stability. The procedure is relatively safe, although the complication and mortality rates are not negligible. Two Enterprise stents can be safely used for Y-stenting and, indeed, offer the advantage of easier catheterization, delivery and deployment into distal and tortuous vessels than open cell stents.","output":"Y-stent assisted coiling of bifurcation aneurysms with Enterprise stent: long-term follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serology testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasingly being used during the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although its clinical and epidemiologic utilities are still debatable.

The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo total antibody test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7 to 8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with disease severity and serum biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: Viral load was determined via cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 214 adult patients. Ct values were compared with clinical severity, biochemical and hematological biomarkers. RESULTS: Clinical course of the disease was mild (49.1%), moderate (40.2%), and severe (10.7%). Median Ct value was 28.2 (IQR: 22.2-33.8) during the first week of the disease. Ct values were lower within five days after symptom onset [lowest Ct value on the third day (median: 24, IQR: 20.6-32.3)], but they increased significantly during the second and third weeks. No association was detected between admission Ct values and disease severity. Gender, age, co-morbidity, and mortality did not differ significantly in patients with low ( 25) and high (> 25) Ct values. White blood cell, neutrophil, platelet, and especially lymphocyte counts, were significantly lower in patients with low Ct values. CONCLUSIONS: No definitive/clear correlation between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and severity and mortality was found in the studied COVID-19 patients.

We designed a multiwave, multisource study examining whether a proactive orientation is a key resource for frontline health care professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from proactive and conservation of resources theories, we studied a sample of 408 doctors and nurses at a COVID-19 hospital in the locked-down area surrounding Wuhan City, China during the first wave of the virus.

This effect was jointly moderated by routine disruption and perceived organizational support. Proactive personality was indirectly associated with performance and two indicators of well-being (resilience and thriving) through perceived strengths use. More frequent physical exposure to the virus magnified the effects of perceived strengths use on an archival indicator of performance during the first wave of the pandemic.

However, additional local and systemic immunological adaptations also occur, allowing the maternal immune system to continue to protect the dyad against foreign invaders both during pregnancy and after birth through lactation. This fine balance of tolerance and immunity, along with physiological and hormonal changes, contribute to increased susceptibility to particular infections in pregnancy, including more severe COVID-19 disease. Whether these changes also make pregnant women less responsive to vaccination or induce altered immune responses to vaccination remains incompletely understood. To holistically define potential changes in vaccine response during pregnancy and lactation, we deeply profiled the humoral vaccine response in a group of pregnant and lactating women and non-pregnant age-matched controls. Vaccine-specific titers were comparable, albeit slightly lower, between pregnant and lactating women, compared to non-pregnant controls. Among pregnant women, we found higher antibody titers and functions in those vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine. FcR-binding and antibody effector functions were induced with delayed kinetics in both pregnant and lactating women compared to non-pregnant women. Antibody boosting resulted in high FcR-binding titers in breastmilk. These data point to an immune resistance to generate highly inflammatory antibodies during pregnancy and lactation, and a critical need to follow prime/boost timelines in this vulnerable population to ensure full immunity is attained.","output":"COVID-19 mRNA vaccines drive differential Fc-functional profiles in pregnant, lactating, and non-pregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the start of 2020 we were thrilled to have reached 10 years of Beneficial Microbes!

Principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to measure their public health service capacity scores and conduct a comparative analysis. On this basis, the TOBIT model is adopted to explore the driving factors that lead to the spatial differentiation of public health service capabilities, and to combine it with the data of the COVID-19 epidemic as of 8 August 2020 from the official announcements of the World Health Organization and governments for further thinking. The results indicate that the public health service capacity of countries in the EU is showing a gradual increase. The capacity in Western Europe is, in turn, higher than that of Northern Europe, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. In addition, the overall capacity in Western Europe is relatively high, but it is not balanced and stable, while Northern Europe has remained stable and balanced at a high level. Population density, degree of opening up, education level, economic development level, technological innovation level, and degree of aging have a positive effect on public health service capabilities. The level of urbanization has a negative effect on it. However, in countries with strong public health service capabilities, the epidemic of COVID-19 is more severe. The emergence of this paradox may be related to the detection capabilities of countries, the high probability of spreading thCOVID-19 epidemic, the inefficient implementation of government policy, the integrated system of the EU and the adverse selection of youth.

The findings suggest that the pets well-being is an important part of the petCowner relationship for Violet, the older adult. Sharing her daily life with her pet, Jack, gives her a sense of safety, positively influences her mood, and motivates her to carry out her daily activities. In return, Jack benefits from her daily presence and care. The challenges of pet ownership included a low-risk potential of falling, pet-related concerns, and financial costs. Both participants agree that the benefits outweigh the challenges for both Violet and Jack. Findings of this study suggest that caring for the pet is a meaningful aspect of the petCowner relationship. Future studies should explore how to support humanCanimal relationships for community-dwelling older adults via pet ownership. Improving the fit between characteristics of the elderly pet owners and their pets will maximize benefits and minimize potential challenges; thus, supporting both aging-in-place and the well-being of animals. ABSTRACT: HumanCanimal interactions may positively impact the health and well-being of older adults. Considering about one third of community-dwelling older adults report owning a pet, better understanding the benefits, challenges, and the role of pet ownership may help support the relationships between older adults and their pets. This case study aims to better understand the role of pet ownership in the daily lives of older adults and explore the benefits and the challenges of owning a pet for this population. Interviews were conducted with Violet, a 77-year-old dog owner and her healthcare provider. Qualitative data were analyzed by two evaluators and validated by the participants. Both participants agree that the benefits outweigh the challenges for both the older adult and her pet. The benefits and challenges were the following: Violet, taking care of her dog (Jack), (1) could provide Violet with a sense of safety and positively influence her mood; (2) may introduce a slight fall risk; (3) includes financial costs to consider. Ensuring Jacks well-being is important for Violet and her dog benefits from Violets continual presence and care.

METHODS: The microfilariae were purified via a Percoll gradient procedure with blood from hyper-microfilaremic individuals (> 30,000 microfilaria [mf]/ml). DNA extraction was carried out in duplicate at a rate of 350,000 mf/tube for each technique: phenol/chloroform, commercial Qiagen kit, salting out, Tris-EDTA, methanol, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The integrity, purity, concentration, and quality of the DNA extracts were successively verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry (A(260)/A(280) and A(260)/A(230) wavelength ratio), Qubit fluorometry, and endonuclease and polymerase activity. The six techniques were compared on the basis of the following parameters: concentration, purity, efficiency, effectiveness, integrity, safety of the technique, as well as cost and duration of the protocol. RESULTS: The ratios of the optical densities of the extracts A(260)/A(280) and A(260)/A(230) were, respectively: phenol/chloroform (1.82; 1.11), Qiagen (1.93; 1.36), salting-out (1.9; 2.04), Tris-EDTA (1.99; 1.183), methanol (2.126; 1.343), and CTAB (2.01; 2.426). The DNA yield was: phenol/chloroform (3.920 g), Qiagen (10.280 g), salting-out (10.390 g), Tris-EDTA (0.5528 g), methanol (0.1036 g), and CTAB (1.115 g). Endonuclease and polymerase activity was demonstrated by digestion of DNA and through amplicons obtained via polymerase chain reaction assays with phenol/chloroform, Qiagen, and salting-out extracts.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: 61,092 community-dwelling participants in a nationwide population-based serosurvey completed a questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms and received an immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies between April 27-June 22, 2020. Standardized prevalence ratios for asymptomatic infection were estimated across participant characteristics. We constructed a symptom-based risk score and evaluated its ability to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 28.7% of infections were asymptomatic (95% CI 26.1-31.4%). Standardized asymptomatic prevalence ratios were 1.19 (1.02-1.40) for men versus women, 1.82 (1.33-2.50) and 1.45 (0.96-2.18) for individuals <20 and 80 years versus those aged 40-59, 1.27 (1.03-1.55) for smokers versus non-smokers, and 1.91 (1.59-2.29) for individuals without versus with case contact. In symptomatic population, a symptom-based score (weights: severe tiredness=1; absence of sore throat=1; fever=2; anosmia/ageusia=5) reached standardized seroprevalence ratio of 8.71 (7.37-10.3), discrimination index of 0.79 (0.77-0.81), and sensitivity and specificity of 71.4% (68.1-74.4%) and 74.2% (73.1-75.2%) for a score 3.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several prophylactic doses and types of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are being used worldwide; however, there are no high-quality studies or recommendations for an optimal prophylactic LMWH dose. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the relationship between coagulation parameters and the LMWH dose, and mortality and ICU admission in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on clinical features, coagulation parameters and anticoagulant medications of inpatients with severe COVID-19 were collected for the period between 11 March 2020 and 31 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and ICU admission for prophylactic dose LMWH (0.5 mg/kg twice daily) and therapeutic dose LMWH (1 mg/kg twice daily). SAMPLE SIZE: 154 cases. RESULTS: Ninety-eight (63.6%) patients were treated with the LMWH prophylactic dose and 56 (36.4%) patients were treated with the therapeutic dose. Forty-four (44.9%) of 98 patients using the prophylactic dose LMWH died, while 10 (17.9%) of 56 patients using the therapeutic dose LMWH died (P=.001). Mortality was 6.4-fold higher in the prophylactic dose LMWH users than in the therapeutic dose LMWH users (OR=6.5, 95% CI: 2.4C17.6, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic dosing of LMWH may decrease mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 infected pneumonia. More aggressive thromboprophylaxis regimens using higher doses of heparin should be evaluated in prospective studies. LIMITATIONS: Lack of information about bleeding complications. LMWH was not compared with other anticoagulant therapies. There was no comparison between our two groups on the APACHE score. Used different doses of LMWH in different clinics in our hospital.

METHODS: Microsimulation models were created in R using a synthetic sample based on primary data from 63 subjects enrolled in a pilot study of a smartphone application (App), Diabetes Pal compared to a nurse-based telemedicine strategy (Nurse). For comparability, the SMART and an RCT design were constructed to allow comparison of four (embedded) adaptive interventions (AIs). RESULTS: In the base case scenario, the SMART has similar overall mean expected HbA1c and cost per subject compared with RCT, for sample size of n = 100 over 10,000 simulations. SMART has lower (better) standard deviations of the mean expected HbA1c per AI, and higher efficiency of choosing the correct AI across various sample sizes. The differences between SMART and RCT become apparent as sample size decreases. For both trial designs, the threshold value at which a subject was deemed to have been responsive at an intermediate point in the trial had an optimal choice (i.e., the sensitivity curve had a U-shape).

The purpose of the study was to explore physicians perspectives of barriers and facilitators to interprofessional care of patients with T2DM within team-based family practice settings. METHODS: This was a qualitative, descriptive study. Participants included physicians affiliated with a primary care network providing care to patients with T2DM in an interprofessional team-based primary care setting in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Participants contact information was obtained from the publicly available College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and respective primary care network websites. Interview questions addressed physicians perspectives on factors or processes that facilitated and hindered the care and medication management of adult patients with T2DM in primary care team-based clinical practice. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis and a constant comparative approach. RESULTS: A total of 15 family physicians participated in individual interviews. Family physicians identified facilitators of interprofessional team-based care and medication management of patients with T2DM in three theme areasaccess to team members and programs, knowledgeable and skilled health professionals, and provision of patient education by other health professionals. Two themes emerged as barriers to interprofessional care C lack of provider continuity and the loss of skills from delegation of tasks. CONCLUSION: Family physicians perceive both benefits and risks to interprofessional team-based care in caring for patients with T2DM.

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects and associations of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective cohort studies if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted body weight and blood lipid levels outcomes at six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years for RCTs; and for cohort studies, at baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three studies were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous to combine.Effects of dietary counselling to reduce total fat intake from RCTsTwo studies recruited children aged between 4 and 11 years and a third recruited children aged 12 to 13 years. Interventions were combinations of individual and group counselling, and education sessions in clinics, schools and homes, delivered by dieticians, nutritionists, behaviourists or trained, supervised teachers. Concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability.One study of dietary counselling to lower total fat intake found that the intervention may make little or no difference to weight compared with usual diet at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; n = 620; low-quality evidence) and at three years (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Education delivered as a classroom curriculum probably decreased BMI in children at 17 months (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence). The effects were smaller at longer term follow-up (five years: MD 0 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; n = 541; seven years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; n = 576; low-quality evidence).Dietary counselling probably slightly reduced total cholesterol at 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Dietary counselling probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and at five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. Dietary counselling probably made little or no difference to HDL-C at 12 months (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), and at five years (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, counselling probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children at 12 months (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height at seven years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Associations between total fat intake, weight and body fatness from cohort studiesOver half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions. Limited evidence from three trials that randomised children to dietary counselling or education to lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) versus usual or modified fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed small reductions in body mass index, total- and LDL-cholesterol at some time points with lower fat intake compared to controls. There were no consistent effects on weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or height. Associations in cohort studies that related total fat intake to later measures of body fatness in children were inconsistent and the quality of this evidence was mostly very low. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, and may not be applicable in low- and middle-income settings. High-quality, longer-term studies are needed, that include low- and middle-income settings to look at both possible benefits and harms.","output":"Effects of total fat intake on bodyweight in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Trails are ubiquitous and far-reaching, but research on the impact trails have on physical activity is limited by the lack of resource-efficient, accurate, and practical systematic observation tools. Commonly used infrared trail sensors count trail use and may broadly differentiate activity (i.e., bicyclist vs. pedestrian), but cannot detect nuances needed for outcomes research such as frequency, intensity, time, and type of activity. Motion-activated passive infrared cameras (PICs), used in ecological research and visitor management in wildlife areas, have potential applicability as a systematic observation data collection tool. Materials and Methods: We conducted a 7-month field test of a PIC as a systematic observation data collection tool on a hiking trail, using photos to identify each trail user's physical activity type, age, sex, and other characteristics. We also tallied hourly trail use counts from the photos, using BlandCAltman plots, paired t-tests, Concordance Correlation Coefficient, Kendall's Tau-b, and a novel inter-counter reliability measure to test concordance against concurrent hourly counts from an infrared sensor. Results: The field test proved informative, providing photos of 2,447 human users of the trail over 4,974 h of data collection. Nearly all of the users were walkers (94.0%) and most were male (69.2%). More of the males used the trail alone (44.8%) than did females (29.8%). Concordance was strong between instruments (p < 0.01), though biased (p < 0.01). Inter-counter reliability was 91.1% during the field study, but only 36.2% when excluding the hours with no detectable trail use on either device. BlandCAltman plots highlighted the tendency for the infrared sensor to provide higher counts, especially for the subsample of hours that had counts >0 on either device (14.0%; 694 h). Discussion: The study's findings highlight the benefits of using PICs to track trail user characteristics despite the needs to further refine best practices for image coding, camera location, and settings. More widespread field use is limited by the extensive amount of time required to code photos and the need to validate the PICs as a trail use counter. The future potential of PICs as a trail-specific PA research and management tool is discussed.","output":"Field Test of a Passive Infrared Camera for Measuring Trail-Based Physical Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has imposed unprecedented stressors on South Africa (SA)'s healthcare system. Superimposed on the country's quadruple burden of disease, pandemic-related care further exposes existing inequities. Some of these inequities are specific to hospital-based inpatient services, such as the geographical maldistribution of hospital beds, lack of oxygen supplies and assisted ventilation, and scarcity of trained healthcare workers. Certain high-risk groups, such as individuals with cardiometabolic comorbidity, are likely to develop severe COVID-19 disease requiring hospitalisation with potential for a prolonged length of stay (LoS). It may be helpful for health authorities to identify those at risk for prolonged LoS to facilitate appropriate health systems planning. OBJECTIVES To identify hospital admission laboratory parameters associated with a hospital stay >14 days in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS A retrospective observational study design was used. Laboratory data were obtained from an SA private laboratory for 642 inpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, comprising 7 months of admission laboratory data from six private hospitals in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province. RESULTS Of 642 hospital admissions for pneumonia, 497 were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test positive). In the COVID-19-positive group, hospital LoS was prolonged in 35.4% of admissions. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association with the following risk factors for prolonged LoS: older age; male sex; high serum creatinine, sodium (Na), chloride, potassium and urea levels and low estimated glomerular filtration rate; raised white blood cell count, lymphopenia, neutrophilia and an elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR); and elevated levels of D-dimers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin (PCT). The strongest univariate associations (relative risk (RR) 2.0) with a hospital stay >14 days were high Na levels, NRL >18, high PCT levels and IL-6 >40 pg/mL. On multivariable analysis, the following factors remained significantly associated with prolonged LoS: older age (RR 1.015 per year of age; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.005 - 1.024); hypernatraemia (RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.25 - 2.60); hyperkalaemia (RR 1.61; 95% CI 1.18 - 2.20); and neutrophilia (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.15 - 1.88). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 pandemic preparedness requires hospital-based inpatient care to be prioritised in resource-limited settings, and availability of beds and prompt admissions are essential to ensure good clinical outcomes. In this study of COVID-19 patients admitted with pneumonia, multivariable analysis showed older age, hypernatraemia, hyperkalaemia and neutrophilia to be associated with LoS >14 days. This may assist with healthcare systems planning.","output":"Laboratory parameters associated with prolonged hospital length of stay in COVID-19 patients in Johannesburg, South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review article summarizes historical development of stem cell research, presents current knowledge on the plasticity potential of both embryonic and adult stem cells and discusses on the future of stem cell based therapies.","output":"The magic behind stem cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China is now a global health emergency.

The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of risk stratifying patients for COVID-19 testing and to identify which risk factors and which other clinical variables were associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR test positivity. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study on a sample of symptomatic patients evaluated at an immediate care setting. A risk assessment questionnaire was administered to every patient before clinician evaluation. High-risk patients received SARS-CoV-2 test and low-risk patients were evaluated by a clinician and selectively tested based on clinician judgment. Multivariate analyses tested whether risk factors and additional variables were associated with test positivity. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of testing positive was associated with COVID-19-positive or suspect close contact (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10), large gathering attendance with a COVID-19-positive individual (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.34), and, with the largest effect size, decreased taste/smell (aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.01-3.99). Testing positive was associated with ages 45-64 and 65 (aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.44, and aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.49-5.16), systolic blood pressures 120 (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.24), and, with the largest effect size, temperatures 99.0F (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 2.23-4.20). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test was similar between high-risk and low risk patients (225 [22.2%] vs 50 [19.8%]; P = .41). DISCUSSION: The risk assessment questionnaire was not effective at stratifying patients for testing. Although individual risk factors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, the low-risk group had similar positivity rates to the high-risk group. Our observations underscore the need for clinicians to develop clinical experience and share best practices and for systems and payors to support policies, funding, and resources to test all symptomatic patients.","output":"Whom Should We Test for COVID-19?

Of the patients who had repeated testing, the average number of days between first positive test and negative test was 36.8 days (+/- 19.9 days). Three out of four women reported symptoms. Of the 40 pregnant women who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 25 of them delivered. About 84% of the women delivered after 37 weeks. Twelve percent of the women delivered under 33 and 6/7 weeks. Most patients had vaginal deliveries (68%) and the remaining had cesarean deliveries. Neonatal outcomes included: mean 1 and 5 min Apgar scores of 8 and 8.8, respectively and the mean birth weight was 3212 g. Twenty neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and were all found to be negative. Conclusion Overall, with routine prenatal care and preventive measures, pregnant patients and neonates in our study had good outcomes. At this time, there appears to be no evidence of vertical transmission.","output":"Initial review of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extent to which Omicron infection1-9, with or without previous vaccination, elicits protection against the previously dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is unclear. We measured SARS-CoV-2 variant neutralization capacity in 39 Omicron sub-lineage BA.1 infected individuals in South Africa starting at a median of 6 (IQR 3-9) days post-symptoms onset and continuing until a last follow-up sample a median of 23 (IQR 19-27) days post-symptoms to allow BA.1 elicited neutralizing immunity time to develop. Fifteen participants were vaccinated with Pfizer-BNT162b2 or J&J-Ad26.CoV2.S and had BA.1 breakthrough infections, and 24 were unvaccinated. BA.1 neutralization increased from a geometric mean titer (GMT) FRNT50 of 42 at enrollment to 575 at the last follow-up time-point (13.6-fold) in vaccinated and from 46 to 272 (6.0-fold) in unvaccinated participants. Delta virus neutralization also increased, from 192 to 1091 (5.7-fold) in vaccinated and 28 to 91 (3.0-fold) in unvaccinated participants. At the last time-point, unvaccinated BA.1 infected individuals had 2.2-fold lower BA.1 neutralization, 12.0-fold lower Delta neutralization, 9.6-fold lower Beta variant neutralization, 17.9-fold lower ancestral virus neutralization, and 4.8-fold lower Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 neutralization relative to vaccinated, with low absolute levels of neutralization for the non-BA.1 viruses.

The problem of ARDS causing mortality became more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biotherapeutic products containing multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell (MMSC) secretome may provide a new therapeutic paradigm for human healthcare due to their immunomodulating and regenerative abilities. The content and regenerative capacity of the secretome depends on cell origin and type of cultivation (two- or three-dimensional (2D/3D)). In this study, we investigated the proteomic profile of the secretome from 2D- and 3D-cultured placental MMSC and lung fibroblasts (LFBs) and the effect of inhalation of freeze-dried secretome on survival, lung inflammation, lung tissue regeneration, fibrin deposition in a lethal ALI model in mice. We found that three inhaled administrations of freeze-dried secretome from 2D- and 3D-cultured placental MMSC and LFB protected mice from death, restored the histological structure of damaged lungs, and decreased fibrin deposition. At the same time, 3D MMSC secretome exhibited a more pronounced trend in lung recovery than 2D MMSC and LFB-derived secretome in some measures. Taking together, these studies show that inhalation of cell secretome may also be considered as a potential therapy for the management of ARDS in patients suffering from severe pneumonia, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however, their effectiveness requires further investigation.","output":"Inhaled Placental Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Secretome from Two- and Three-Dimensional Cell Cultures Promotes Survival and Regeneration in Acute Lung Injury Model in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Perinatal depression is one of the most common complications during pregnancy and one year following childbirth. A negative impact on the mental and physical health of women, their children, partners, or significant others has been associated with this disease. Web-based and Mobile-based psychological interventions can reduce the burden of the disease through prevention of new cases of depression. It is crucial to know the effectiveness of these interventions to implement them around the globe. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the effectiveness of Web-based and Mobile-based psychological interventions to prevent depression during the perinatal period. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review and meta-analysis will adhere to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies will be identified through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Opengrey, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University, clinicaltrial.gov, beacon.anu.edu.au, and evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org from inception until 31 March 2021. We will also search the reference lists provided in relevant studies and reviews. The selection criteria will be as follows: 1) pregnant women or women who have given birth in the last 12 months and who were non-depressive at baseline; 2) Web-based and Mobile-Based psychological interventions; 3) comparators will be usual care, attention control, waiting list or no intervention; 4) outcomes will be the incidence of new cases of perinatal depression and/or the reduction of depressive symptoms as measured by validated instruments; and 5) the design of the studies will be randomized controlled trials. No restrictions regarding the year or language of publication will be considered. Pooled standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The risk of bias of the studies will be assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias 2.0 tool. Heterogeneity and publication bias will be estimated.

On the other hand, the two different 417 substitutions severely impair the RBD/ACE-2 affinity, but in the combined P.1 and B.1.351 RBD variants, this effect is partly counterbalanced by the effect of the E484K and N501Y.

Here we reflect on how our integrated organisational model has faced the first impact of the pandemic and describe what challenges, opportunities and lessons have emerged. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The organisational model of the Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank (Banc de Sang i Teixits, BST) is described. The new scenario was managed by following international recommendations and considering the pandemic in a context of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), allowing rapid measures to be taken. These aimed to: ensure donor safety, promote proper responses to patients' needs, ensure the health and well-being of personnel, and prepare for future scenarios. RESULTS: The BST has adapted its activities to the changes in demand. No shortage of any product or service occurred. Donor acceptance, safety and wellbeing were maintained except for tissue donation, which almost completely stopped. To support the health system, several activities have been promoted: large-scale convalescent plasma (CP) production, clinical trials with CP and mesenchymal stromal cells, massive COVID-19 diagnoses, and participation in co-operative research and publications. Haemovigilance is running smoothly and no adverse effects have been detected among donors or patients. DISCUSSION: Several elements have proven to be critical when addressing the pandemic scenario: a) the early creation of a crisis committee in combination with technical recommendations and the recognition of a VUCA scenario; b) identification of the strategies described; c) the integrated donor-to-patient organisational model; d) active Research and Development (R&D); and e) the flexibility of the staff. It is essential to underline the importance of the need for centralised management, effective contingency strategies, and early collaboration with peers.","output":"SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic: first wave, impact, response and lessons learnt in a fully integrated Regional Blood and Tissue Bank.

Additionally the suspension of OSCE's in 2020 due to the pandemic ,has meant this cohort of final year students have never been examined on psychiatry skills. Our aims were to assess if our student psychiatry society (PsychSoc) run OSCE could help to prepare medical students for novel virtual stations ahead of their final examinations, and how this format of mock examination could be improved in the future. METHOD: Our PsychSoc (QUB Mind Matters) hosted a virtual mock psychiatry OSCE for 24 final year medical students using the video conference platform Zoom, approximately 1 month before their finals. The OSCE comprised 4 stations each lasting 8 minutes, and covered psychiatric history taking, risk assessment and drug counselling. Stations were marked by psychiatry trainees in individual breakout rooms to closely simulate real examination conditions. A post-event online questionnaire was distributed to all participants. 5-point Likert scales and free text responses were used to gather feedback regarding the content and delivery of the mock. A response rate of 100% was achieved (n = 24). RESULT: The feedback from students was overwhelmingly positive, with 100% (n = 24) agreeing/strongly agreeing that the mock OSCE left them feeling more prepared for their final exam. 95.8% (n = 23) agreed that the opportunity to practice virtual OSCE stations improved their confidence, and all 24 students agreed/strongly agreed that they would like more practice of virtual OSCE stations. A common theme that emerged when asked how our mock could have been improved was the need for a group feedback session covering common pitfalls in addition to individual feedback. CONCLUSION: The lack of clinical experience and shift towards online learning has led to increased stress around clinical exams in the student population. PsychSocs can supplement formal teaching by providing students the opportunity to practice virtual communication and history taking skills that are not always covered in their undergraduate curriculum. However, as a psychiatry society our mock only assessed psychiatry skills, many of which may be relatively well suited to an online format. We would welcome further evaluation of the applicability of student run virtual mock OSCE's to other specialties. We have demonstrated that PsychSocs can offer much needed practice for students through mock OSCE's and have highlighted ways to enhance their delivery.","output":"Preparing students for psychiatry OSCE's in the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This study used data from the 2008-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, 1,089 patients with diabetes aged >40 years were included. The duration of daily sunlight exposure was assessed via health interviews. Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including standard retinal fundus photography after pupil dilation, were conducted. Diabetic retinopathy was graded using the modified Airlie House Classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between daily sunlight exposure duration and the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS: The risk of diabetic retinopathy was 2.66 times higher in the group with &#8805;5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure after adjusting for risk factors such as duration of diabetes, serum hemoglobin A1c level, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (P = 0.023). Furthermore, the risk of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.13 times higher in the group with &#8805;5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure (P = 0.009).

The mechanism/rule-based nature of the CIABM allows for interrogation of the complex dynamics of the human immune system during various types of viral infections. The CIABM is an extension of a prior agent-based model of the innate immune response, incorporating additional cellular types and mediators involved in the response to viral infection. The CIABM simulates the dynamics of viral respiratory infection in terms of epithelial invasion, immune cellular population changes and cytokine measurements. Validation of the CIABM involved effectively replicating in vivo measurements of circulating mediator levels from a clinical cohort of influenza patients. The general purpose nature of the CIABM allows for both the representation of various types of known viral infections and facilitates the exploration of hypothetical, novel viral pathogens.","output":"The Cellular Immunity Agent Based Model (CIABM): Replicating the cellular immune response to viral respiratory infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We evaluated the frequency and outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and myocardial infarction (MI) in a global research network.

This study assessed how tourist behaviors might facilitate respiratory disease transmission at a chimpanzee tracking site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed tourists, guides, and student interns from the time they entered the forest to view the chimpanzees until they left the forest and noted behaviors related to disease transmission.

Computed tomography (CT) in combination with contrast enhanced CT is used more often for diagnosing various head pathology in horses. The objective of this study was to compare intravenous and intra-arterial contrast-enhancement techniques and describe normal and abnormal contrast enhancement in the horse's head. RESULTS All 24 horses included in the study recovered without complication from the procedures. Compared to the pre-contrast studies, post-contrast studies showed significant contrast enhancement in the pituitary gland (IA: p < 0.0001; IV: p < 0.0001), IA nose septum (p = 0.002), nose mucosa (IA: p < 0.0001; IV: p = 0.02), parotid salivary gland (IA: p < 0.0001; IV p < 0.0001), cerebrum (IA: p < 0.0001; IV: p < 0.0001), rectus capitis muscle (IA: p < 0.0001; IV p = 0.001), IA temporal muscle (p < 0.0001), IA masseter muscle (p <0.0001) and IV brainstem (p = 0.01). No significant contrast enhancement was seen in the eye (IA: p = 0.23; IV p = 0.33), tongue (IA p = 0.2; IV p = 0.57), IA brainstem (p = 0.88), IV nose septum (p = 0.26), IV temporal muscle (p = 0.09) and IV masseter muscle (p = 0.46). Three different categories of abnormal enhancement were detected: a strong vascularised mass, an enhanced rim surrounding an unenhanced structure and an inflamed anatomical structure with abnormal contrast enhancement. CONCLUSION Using the intra-arterial technique, similar contrast enhancement is achieved using less contrast medium compared to the intravenous technique. And a potential major advantage of the IA technique is the ability to evaluate lesions that are characterized by increased blood flow. Using the intravenous technique, a symmetrical and homogenous enhancement is achieved, however timing is more crucial and the contrast dosage is more of influence in the IV protocol.

The present study is conducted to investigate that how the suspension of molybdenum-disulfide [Formula: see text] nanoparticles boosts the thermal performance of a Casson-type fluid. Sodium alginate (NaAlg) based nanofluid is contained inside a vertical channel of width d and it exhibits a flow due to the movement of the left wall. The walls are nested in a permeable medium, and a uniform magnetic field and radiation flux are also involved in determining flow patterns and thermal behavior of the nanofluid. Depending on velocity boundary conditions, the flow phenomenon is examined for three different situations. To evaluate the influence of shape factor, [Formula: see text] nanoparticles of blade, cylinder, platelet, and brick shapes are considered. The mathematical modeling is performed in the form of non-integer order operators, and a double fractional analysis is carried out by separately solving Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu operators based fractional models. The system of coupled PDEs is converted to ODEs by operating the Laplace transformation, and Zakians algorithm is applied to approximate the Laplace inversion numerically. The solutions of flow and energy equations are presented in terms of graphical illustrations and tables to discuss important physical aspects of the observed problem. Moreover, a detailed inspection on shear stress and Nusselt number is carried out to get a deep insight into skin friction and heat transfer mechanisms. It is analyzed that the suspension of [Formula: see text] nanoparticles leads to ameliorating the heat transfer rate up to 9.5%. To serve the purpose of achieving maximum heat transfer rate and reduced skin friction, the Atangana-Baleanu operator based fractional model is more effective. Furthermore, it is perceived that velocity and energy functions of the nanofluid exhibit significant variations because of the different shapes of nanoparticles.","output":"Significance of Shape Factor in Heat Transfer Performance of Molybdenum-Disulfide Nanofluid in Multiple Flow Situations; A Comparative Fractional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the article, the author reflects on the activities and challenges faced by the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) during her presidency.

Eligible articles investigated any virus family and provided data on the effects of orally administered LF of any origin in the prevention and/or management of confirmed viral infections in people of any age. A narrative synthesis of the results was performed. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk-Of-Bias and ROBINS-1 tools.

We found data on Flaviviridae (n = 10), Retroviridae (n = 3), Coronaviridae (n = 2), Reoviridae (n = 2) and Caliciviridae (n = 1). Most published trials were at high risk of bias. The findings were heterogeneous across and within viral families regarding virological, immunological and biological response, with no clear conclusion. Some weak but positive results were reported about decrease of symptom severity and duration, or reduction in viral loads. Despite high tolerability, the effects of LF as oral supplement are still inconsistent, both in preventing and managing viral infections.

While optimists foresee the continuation of economic globalization after the pandemic, pessimists expect localization instead of globalization, given the pandemics structural negative consequence on the world economy. By contrast, the centrists anticipate a U-shaped recovery, where Covid-19 will not kill globalization but slow it down. The three existing perspectives on Covid-19s impact on the economic globalization are not without merit, but they do not take sufficient temporal distance from the ongoing issue. This article suggests employing the historical perspective to expand the time frame by examining the rise and fall of economic globalization before and after the 2008 global financial crisis. The authors argue that economic globalization has been in transition since the 2008 financial crisis, and one important but not exclusive factor to explain this change is the evolving USCChina economic relationship, from symbiotic towards increasingly competitive. The economic restructuring in US and China has begun after both countries weathered the 2008 crisis and gained momentum since the outbreak of trade war and Covid-19. The article investigates this trend by distinguishing different types of production activities, and the empirical results confirm that localization and regionalization have been filling the vacuum of economic globalization in retreat in the last decade.","output":"From Globalization to Regionalization: The United States, China, and the Post-Covid-19 World Economic Order"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depression is the most common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide.

In the 2010 US National Academies Decadal Survey of Astronomy (National Research Council, 2010), it was suggested that having to move so frequently which is a career necessity may be unattractive to people wanting to start a family, especially impacting women. Whether in Europe or elsewhere, as postdocs, astrophysicists will relocate every two to three years, until they secure a permanent position or leave research altogether. Astrophysicists do perceive working abroad as important and positive for their careers (Parenti, 2002);however, it was found that the men at equal rank had not had to spend as much time abroad to further their careers (Fohlmeister & Helling, 2012). By implication, women need to work abroad longer or have more positions abroad to achieve the same rank as men. Astrophysicists living in the United Kingdom prefer to work in their country of origin, but many did not do so because of worse working conditions or difficultly finding a job for their spouse (Fohlmeister & Helling, 2014). In sum, mobility and moving is necessary for a career in astrophysics, and even more necessary for women, but astrophysicists prefer not to move as frequently as needed to maintain a research career.

The results of the COD revealed that corneal annuli 0.0C2.0 mm and 2.0C6.0 mm, and the average and maximal values at the incisional site significantly increased postoperatively. Also, the anterior and central stroma of 0.0C2.0 mm, and all three depths of 2.0C6.0 mm, increased remarkably after the operation. For the CT, all ranges of diameters plus incisional sites showed significant increases postoperatively. Furthermore, we analyzed the differences (delta) of COD and CT between pre- and post-operation, and found significant correlations between the delta of COD and the delta of CT, regarding annuli 0.0C2.0 mm, 2.0C6.0 mm, and 6.0C10.0 mm, but no correlation at the incisional site, with either average density or maximal density, was detected.

Methods: We searched five electronic databases from inception to January 18, 2021, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in postCacute MI patients. Primary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality and recurrent MI. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, urgent coronary revascularization, levels of follow-up high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and drug-related adverse events. All meta-analyses used inverse-variance random-effects models. Results: Six RCTs involving 6,005 patients were included.

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. SETTING: 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two weeks (to 17 July 2020). PARTICIPANTS: 651 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. RESULTS: Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35% (225/651) were under 12 months old, and 56% (367/650) were male. 57% (330/576) were white, 12% (67/576) South Asian, and 10% (56/576) black. 42% (276/651) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18% (116/632) of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of whom had profound comorbidity. 11% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; P<0.001) and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity (64% (29/45) v 42% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73% (38/52) v 15% (62/404); P<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with fatigue (51% (24/47) v 28% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34% (16/47) v 10% (26/263); P<0.001), myalgia (34% (15/44) v 8% (21/270); P<0.001), sore throat (30% (14/47) v (12% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20% (9/46) v 3% (10/318); P<0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150  10(9)/L (32% (16/50) v 11% (38/348); P<0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C.

Viral entry requires spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor and cleavage by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a cell surface serine protease. Targeting of TMPRSS2 by either androgen blockade or direct inhibition is in clinical trials in early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We used differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells at the airCliquid interface to test the impact of targeting TMPRSS2 on the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: We first modelled the systemic delivery of compounds. Enzalutamide, an oral androgen receptor antagonist, had no impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, camostat mesylate, an orally available serine protease inhibitor, blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry. However, oral camostat is rapidly metabolised in the circulation, with poor airway bioavailability. We therefore modelled local airway administration by applying camostat to the apical surface of differentiated airway cultures. We demonstrated that a brief exposure to topical camostat effectively restricts SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: These experiments demonstrate a potential therapeutic role for topical camostat for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2, which can now be evaluated in a clinical trial.","output":"Topical TMPRSS2 inhibition prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in differentiated human airway cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, active subspace methods (ASMs) have become a popular means of performing subspace sensitivity analysis on black-box functions. Naively applied, however, ASMs require gradient evaluations of the target function.

In such cases, often a surrogate model is employed, on which finite differencing is performed. When the surrogate model is a Gaussian process, we show that the ASM estimator is available in closed form, rendering the finite-difference approximation unnecessary. We use our closed-form solution to develop acquisition functions focused on sequential learning tailored to sensitivity analysis on top of ASMs. We also show that the traditional ASM estimator may be viewed as a method of moments estimator for a certain class of Gaussian processes. We demonstrate how uncertainty on Gaussian process hyperparameters may be propagated to uncertainty on the sensitivity analysis, allowing model-based confidence intervals on the active subspace.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a tertiary care oncology hospital and included patients who were asymptomatic for COVID-19 infection and underwent FDG PET/CT scans for standard oncologic indications between April 15, 2020, and September 30, 2020. Patients who showed CO-RADS category 4/5 changes (high level of suspicion) on the CT chest component of the PET/CT study were considered for analysis. CT severity score, presence of FDG uptake, and maximum standardized uptake value of FDG avid lung involvement were noted and correlated with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. RESULTS: 1982 PET/CT scans were performed, 78 (3.9%) patients showed lung changes with high degree of suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia (CO-RADS 4/5). Hematolymphoid and head-neck cancer were the most common tumor types (23%), and restaging/response evaluation was the most common PET/CT indication. Of the patients who underwent RT-PCR testing, 70% showed a positive result. The mean CT severity score was 6 (standard deviation 5.9) with no significant difference seen between the RT-PCR positive and negative groups. FDG avidity in lung lesions was noted in 41 out 57 (72%) patients. A significant correlation was seen between the RT-PCR positivity and FDG uptake in lung lesions. CONCLUSION: A small but significant proportion of patients undergoing routine oncologic PET/CT scans showed incidental COVID-19 lung involvement. Lung involvement in these asymptomatic patients showed a low CT severity score in all patients and FDG avidity in majority. Timely detection of such incidental cases can initiate further confirmatory RT-PCR testing and isolation measures that not only influence patient's cancer treatment protocols but also have a larger community impact of limiting the spread of infection.","output":"Incidentally Detected COVID-19 Lung Changes during Oncologic Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Computerized Tomography Studies: Experience from Tertiary Care Cancer Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to COVID-19, seed security interventions are being planned to help bolster fragile livelihoods. After 25 years of research during emergencies, there are many lessons to build on, including that seed systems, especially informal markets, prove fairly resilient and often function even in high stress contexts. As a wise first step, given the possible volatility in supply, farmers seed saving should be supported actively and at scale. Rigorous remote assessments will have to become the new norm for gauging seed security, with reviews recognizing that different crops might be affected in different ways by specific seed channel stress or breakdown. Well-known short-term seed security responses, for example, Direct Seed Distribution, will need to be tailored to the new COVID-19 reality, particularly in terms of altering logistics. More fundamentally, three new factors might herald a transformation in response: 1) Choice for farmers has to be the operative principle (especially as markets may fluctuate quickly); 2) Remote two-way state of the art communication has to be built rapidly; and 3) Seed quality options might need to be liberalized, especially given the scale of possible seed security intervention. Covid-19 effects will likely linger several years or potentially six to nine seasons (depending on agricultural calendar).

Increasing access to such technologies makes an attractive prospect for helping individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) in becoming more active and healthier. However, little is known about their effectiveness in such populations. The aim of this systematic review was to explore whether digital interventions were effective in promoting PA in low SES populations, whether interventions are of equal benefit to higher SES individuals and whether the number or type of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used in digital PA interventions was associated with intervention effects. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was used to identify eligible studies from MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and The Cochrane Library, published between January 1990 and March 2020. Randomised controlled trials, using digital technology as the primary intervention tool, and a control group that did not receive any digital technology-based intervention were included, provided they had a measure of PA as an outcome. Lastly, studies that did not have any measure of SES were excluded from the review. Risk of Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2. RESULTS: Of the 14,589 records initially identified, 19 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Using random-effects models, in low SES there was a standardised mean difference (SMD (95%CI)) in PA between intervention and control groups of 0.06 (? 0.08,0.20). In high SES the SMD was 0.34 (0.22,0.45). Heterogeneity was modest in both low (I(2) = 0.18) and high (I(2) = 0) SES groups. The studies used a range of digital technologies and BCTs in their interventions, but the main findings were consistent across all of the sub-group analyses (digital interventions with a PA only focus, country, chronic disease, and duration of intervention) and there was no association with the number or type of BCTs. DISCUSSION: Digital interventions targeting PA do not show equivalent efficacy for people of low and high SES. For people of low SES, there is no evidence that digital PA interventions are effective, irrespective of the behaviour change techniques used. In contrast, the same interventions in high SES participants do indicate effectiveness. To reduce inequalities and improve effectiveness, future development of digital interventions aimed at improving PA must make more effort to meet the needs of low SES people within the target population.

Deployed in a university course, this playful learning tool was found to support design students to gain vivid understandings about the capabilities and limitations of pretrained CNNs in real-world environments. Concrete examples of students' playful explorations are reported to characterize their sensemaking processes reflecting different depths of thought.","output":"Explainability via Interactivity?

Past studies in reinforcement learning and educational psychology have linked prediction error, a measure of surprise, to successful learning from feedback. However, there are substantial individual differences in belief-updating success, and the psychological factors that influence belief updating remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel factor that may predict belief updating: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which is characterized by a desire for order, structure, and preservation of social norms. We hypothesized that because people who score high on RWA are motivated to preserve entrenched beliefs, they may often fail to successfully update their beliefs when confronted with new information. Using a novel paradigm, we challenged participants' false beliefs and misconceptions to elicit prediction error. In two studies, we found consistent evidence that high-RWA individuals were less successful at correcting their false beliefs. Relative to low-RWA individuals, high-RWA individuals were less likely to revise beliefs in response to prediction error. We argue that RWA is associated with a relatively closed-minded cognitive style that negatively influences belief updating.","output":"Closed-minded cognition: Right-wing authoritarianism is negatively related to belief updating following prediction error"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The markedly high levels of preventable death and injury from COVID-19 in the UK have been refracted by government appeals to \\"British common-sense\\" in response to the crisis We critically explore this appeal as a generator of harm continuous with freemarket common-sense (FMCS) that stretches back to the start of the 1980s and the Thatcherite assault on state protections, \\"enemies within\\" and expertise in the public realm, driving and legitimating a broad landscape of harm under neoliberal restructuring This is the context for understanding government responses to COVID-19 and the Grenfell fire, both of which have resulted in avoidable death and injury and both of which illustrate the role of \\"common-sense\\" in the demonisation and blaming of the victims of state violence along with a deligitimation of expertise in public health Following Gramsci's conceptualisation of common-sense and its role in cultivating a never-guaranteed consensus for the continuance of capitalist state power, we explore the emergence of Gramsci's \\"good sense\\" in the current juncture and its challenge to the harms of state that FMCS has generated","output":"The Harms of State, Free-market Common Sense and Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether routine blood tests and clinical characteristics can predict in-hospital mortality in COVID-19.

Here, we track the geotemporal spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a mutation (D839Y) in a potential host-interacting region involving the Spike fusion peptide, which is a target motif of anti-viral drugs that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. The Spike Y839 variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February and massively disseminated in Portugal during the early epidemic, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal where it represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, by 30 April. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15.5% (1275/8251) and 6.0% (1500/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively], we estimate that, between 14 March and 9 April (covering the epidemic exponential phase) the relative frequency of the Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%C18.2%, CI 95%) every three days, being potentially associated with 24.8% (20.8C29.7%, CI 95%; 3177C4542 cases, CI 95%) of all COVID-19 cases in Portugal during this period.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 7 April and 13 May 2020 (n = 1114). Data on exercise behavior pre and during the pandemic and mood states were collected. A cumulative link model was used to predict changes in exercise frequency during a similar future pandemic by exercise frequency during the pandemic. A linear model was used to predict the influence of exercise frequency before and during the pandemic on mood states during the pandemic. A total of 71.2%, 67.3%, and 58.3% of respondents maintained their exercise intensity, frequency, and duration, respectively, during the pandemic. Frequent exercisers are more likely to maintain their exercise frequency during a similar pandemic (p < 0.001). Higher exercise frequencies during the pandemic were associated with better mood states (p < 0.05). Moreover, the effects of prepandemic exercise frequency on mood states are moderated by changes in exercise frequency during the pandemic (p < 0.05). Additionally, maintenance of exercise frequency during a pandemic specifically for frequent exercisers are recommended to preserve mood states.

To exploit the full potential of cross-institutional clinical big data, machine learning systems must gain the ability to transfer their knowledge across institutional boundaries and learn from new episodes of patient care without forgetting previously learned patterns. In this work, we developed a privacy-preserving learning algorithm named WUPERR (Weight Uncertainty Propagation and Episodic Representation Replay) and validated the algorithm in the context of early prediction of sepsis using data from over 104,000 patients across four distinct healthcare systems. We tested the hypothesis, that the proposed continual learning algorithm can maintain higher predictive performance than competing methods on previous cohorts once it has been trained on a new patient cohort. In the sepsis prediction task, after incremental training of a deep learning model across four hospital systems (namely hospitals H-A, H-B, H-C, and H-D), WUPERR maintained the highest positive predictive value across the first three hospitals compared to a baseline transfer learning approach (H-A: 39.27% vs. 31.27%, H-B: 25.34% vs. 22.34%, H-C: 30.33% vs. 28.33%).

Traditionally, healthcare costs are the dominant consideration in economic evaluations of vaccines, which likely ignores many costs that fall on governments in relation to vaccine-preventable conditions. In recent years, fiscal health modeling has been proposed as a complementary approach to cost-effectiveness analysis for considering the broader consequences for governments attributed to vaccines. Fiscal modeling evaluates public health investments attributed to treatments or preventive interventions in the case of vaccination, and how these investments influence government public accounts. This involves translating morbidity and mortality outcomes that can lead to disability, associated costs, early retirement due to poor health, and death, which can result in lost tax revenue for government attributed to reduced lifetime productivity. To assess fiscal consequences of public health programs, discounted cash flow analysis can be used to translate how changes in morbidity and mortality influence transfer payments and changes in lifetime taxes paid based on initial health program investments. The aim of this review is to describe the fiscal health modeling framework in the context of vaccines and demonstrate key features of this approach and the role that public economic assessment of vaccines can make in understanding the broader economic consequences of investing in vaccination programs. In this review, we describe the theoretical foundations for fiscal modeling, the aims of fiscal model, the analytical outputs, and discuss the relevance of this framework for evaluating the economics of vaccines.","output":"Estimating the Fiscal Consequences of National Immunization Programs Using a \\"Government Perspective\\" Public Economic Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study links the complement-mediated retraction of T helper 1 cell responses to vitamin D receptor signalling, an autoregulatory loop that might be impaired in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Vitamin D shuts down T cell-mediated inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In health care workers SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be an occupational health risk, often associated with transmission between health care workers. Yet, insufficient information on transmission dynamics has been presented to elucidate the precise risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 in this group. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated association between questionnaire answers on potential exposure situations and SARS-CoV-2-positivity. Health care workers with and without COVID-19-patient contact at nine units at Sk?ne University Hospitals in Malm? and Lund, Sweden and university employees from Lund University, Sweden were enrolled. To limit impact of health care worker to health care worker transmission, units with known outbreaks were excluded. A SARS-CoV-2-positive case was defined by a previous positive PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the ZetaGene COVID-19 Antibody Test. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positivity was detected in 11/51 (22%) health care workers in COVID-19-units, 10/220 (5%) in non-COVID-19-units and 11/192 (6%) University employees (p = .001, Fischer's exact). In health care workers, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with work in a designated COVID-19-unit (OR 5.7 (95CI 2.1-16)) and caring for COVID-19-patients during the majority of shifts (OR 5.4 (95CI 2.0-15)). In all participants, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with a confirmed COVID-19 case (OR 10 (95CI 2.0-45)) in the household.

However, in practice, both failed to deliver promised capital to the most marginalized business owners in places most in need. In the case of the Paycheck Protection Program, larger businesses, including those with access to capital from other non-governmental sources, were able to access initial rounds of federal funds because of their close relationship with Small Business Administration-certified lenders.

AIM: Delineation of individual strategies of the members of the Society for Pediatric Rheumatology (GKJR) in cases of COVID-19. METHODS: In May 2020 all GKJR members were invited to take part in an online survey. Opinion data regarding an approach using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in cases of COVID-19 as well as the readiness to use new therapeutic agents in patients in different stages of the disease were collected. RESULTS: A total of 71 respondents (27.3% of all contacted pediatric rheumatologists) took part in the survey. Of these 28.2% had treated patients with COVID-19. Over 95% of the respondents did not support a preventive adaptation of the anti-rheumatic treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In the case of outpatients under immunosuppression with proven COVID-19 more than 50% of the respondents would refrain from administering intravenous high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 antibodies as well as BAFF, CTLA-4 and TNF-alpha blockades. Conversely, >70% of the respondents would continue the treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), oral steroids, mycophenolate, IL-1 blockade and immunoglobulins (Ig). In the case of inpatients 74.6% of respondents would consider targeted COVID-19 treatment. In stable patients with oxygen treatment (stage I) HCQ (18.3%), azithromycin (16.9%) and Ig (9.9%) were most frequently used. In cases of early signs (stage II) or a manifest cytokine storm (stage III) anakinra (40.8% for stage II and 46.5% for stage III), tocilizumab (26.8% and 40.8%, respectively), steroids (25.4% and 33.8%, respectively) and remdesivir (29.6% and 38.0%, respectively) were most frequently used.

We describe herein our experiences with laparoscopic Z-shaped anastomosis and evaluate the clinical outcomes. METHODS Between 2001 and 2010, 26 children with rectosigmoid HD underwent a laparoscopic modified Duhamel procedure comprising Z-shaped anastomosis. Mean age at operation was 17.2 months. Mean weight was 8.7 kg. No children had a colostomy. Seven children had trisomy 21 and one had Klinefelter syndrome. Laparoscopic modified Duhamel procedure was performed using three 5-mm trocars. Intra- and postoperative complications and functional outcomes were evaluated. Patients with trisomy 21 were excluded from the functional evaluation. RESULTS The operation was completed laparoscopically for 25 of the 26 patients, with only one patient requiring conversion to an open procedure because of injury to the ureter. Mean operating time was 296 min. In one case, a minor leak was observed. No infections or related complications were observed. Mean follow-up period was 50.4 months. Sudden death secondary to rotaviral enterocolitis occurred 8 months postoperatively in one case. Twenty-one of the 25 patients (84%) showed episodes of constipation during the early follow-up period, and one child required late myectomy due to sphincter achalasia. As the child grew older, the need for medication was diminished. Of the 14 patients over 4 years old, excluding those patients with trisomy 21, all achieved normal defecation without incontinence.

Thus, animal studies have suggested a time-window for post-insult treatment strategies. Hypothermia has been tested as a treatment for HIE in pdiglet models and subsequently proven effective in clinical trials. Variations of the model have been applied in the study of adjunctive neuroprotective methods and piglet studies of xenon and melatonin have led to clinical phase I and II trials(1,2). The piglet HIE model is further used for neonatal resuscitation- and hemodynamic studies as well as in investigations of cerebral hypoxia on a cellular level. However, it is a technically challenging model and variations in the protocol may result in either too mild or too severe brain injury. In this article, we demonstrate the technical procedures necessary for establishing a stable piglet model of neonatal HIE. First, the newborn piglet (< 24 hr old, median weight 1500 g) is anesthetized, intubated, and monitored in a setup comparable to that found in a neonatal intensive care unit. Global hypoxia-ischemia is induced by lowering the inspiratory oxygen fraction to achieve global hypoxia, ischemia through hypotension and a flat trace amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) indicative of cerebral hypoxia.

To meet the overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, innovative approaches must be employed to significantly expand mental health care delivery capacity. Although it is not feasible to increase the number of mental health care providers or hours they work in the short term, improving their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtually and digitally delivering psychotherapy, which has been shown to be efficient and clinically effective, might be a good method for addressing this growing demand. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using an online, digital, asynchronous care model to treat mental health issues that are started or aggravated by stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program that is tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve weekly self-guided educational material that provides an overview of behavioral skills and weekly homework. Participants (N=80) will receive personalized feedback from and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, which are to be completed by participants at baseline, week 5, and posttreatment. Inclusion criteria includes the capacity to consent; a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, with symptoms that started or worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability to speak and read English; and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria includes active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: This study received funding in May 2020. Ethics approval was received in June 2020. The recruitment of participants began in June 2020. Participant recruitment is being conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 58 participants have been recruited (intervention group: n=35; control group: n=23). Data collection is expected to conclude by the end of 2020.

METHODS 19 COVID-ICU survivors answered a written survey four months after admission. Screening lists measured psychological complaints and sleeping disorders. Visual analogue scales (VAS) measured the influence of the pandemic context and the quality of life. A written survey mapped patient experiences. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and qualitative data by means of thematic analysis. RESULTS: 50% of the participants experienced psychological complaints or sleeping disorders. A limited social network and media coverage of COVID-19 complicated the recovery process of patients. 19% of the participants experienced a reduced quality of life. A weak social network caused feelings of hopelessness. Still, patients showed great resilience.

Low-resource, rural communities often lack programmes for early identification and intervention. The Prechtl General Movement Assessment (GMA) is regarded as the best clinical tool to predict cerebral palsy in infants <5 months. In addition, children with developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, late detected genetic disorders or autism spectrum disorder show abnormal general movements (GMs) during infancy. General Movement Assessment in Neonates for Early Identification and Intervention, Social Support and Health Awareness (G.A.N.E.S.H.) aims to (1) provide evidence as to whether community health workers can support the identification of infants at high-risk for neurological and developmental disorders and disabilities, (2) monitor further development in those infants and (3) initiate early and targeted intervention procedures. METHODS: This 3-year observational cohort study will comprise at least 2000 infants born across four districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Community health workers, certified for GMA, video record and assess the infants GMs twice, that is, within 2 months after birth and at 3C5 months. In case of abnormal GMs and/or reduced MOSs, infants are further examined by a paediatrician and a neurologist. If necessary, early intervention strategies (treatment as usual) are introduced. After paediatric and neurodevelopmental assessments at 12C24 months, outcomes are categorised as normal or neurological/developmental disorders. Research objective (1): to relate the GMA to the outcome at 12C24 months. Research objective (2): to investigate the impact of predefined exposures. Research objective (3): to evaluate the interscorer agreement of GMA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: G.A.N.E.S.H. received ethics approval from the Indian Government Chief Medical Officers of Varanasi and Mirzapur and from the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service in Varanasi. GMA is a worldwide used diagnostic tool, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Graz, Austria (27-388 ex 14/15). Apart from peer-reviewed publications, we are planning to deploy G.A.N.E.S.H. in other vulnerable settings.","output":"Enhancing early detection of neurological and developmental disorders and provision of intervention in low-resource settings in Uttar Pradesh, India: study protocol of the G.A.N.E.S.H. programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to determine what parts of objects and surfaces people touch as they go about their daily lives would be useful in understanding how the COVID-19 virus spreads. To determine whether a person has touched an object or surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the 2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this solution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require significant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint variations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the object onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing their 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected points are close to each other;we call this cross view projection consistency. Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep networks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface space is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy detection for studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in a meeting room using the contact information.","output":"Contact Area Detector using Cross View Projection Consistency for COVID-19 Projects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to assess family physicians' perception of the US Food and Drug Administration-approved mRNA Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, their plans to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and their support for vaccination of patients and family members. METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 307 practicing family physicians, full-time faculty physicians, and resident physicians in Kansas from December 14, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The study participants completed an anonymous, 20-item survey assessing family physicians' concerns about exposure to COVID-19 and their perceptions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. A mixed-method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. RESULTS: There was a 51.1% response rate. The proportion of family physicians who reported their intentions to be vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly higher than those who were hesitant to receive the mRNA vaccines (90.6% vs 9.4%; 2 [1, n = 307] = 201.9.1; P < .0001). Among those who were willing to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons were to prevent COVID-19 infection; protect self, family, and community; contribute to herd immunity; inspire confidence that the vaccines are safe and end the pandemic and bring life back to normal. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a significantly positive association between a physician's concerns and their willingness to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

Developing narrative competence is integral to providing patient-centered care. In January 2020, we designed a narrative medicine curriculum in which medical students at the San Francisco Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Center in California participated as interviewers in My Life My Story (MLMS) program. The curricular objectives for medical students were to build life story skills, appreciate the impact of storytelling on a veteran's health care experience, and understand the VA mission. OBSERVATIONS: Students attended a training session to build narrative medicine skills, interviewed a veteran, entered their life story into the health record, and attended a second session to debrief. Students completed a survey after the MLMS program. From March to July 2020, COVID-19-related restrictions prompted transition of the program to a virtual format. Sixty-two veteran stories were collected, and 54 (87%) veterans requested that their stories be entered into the health record. Students reported that the program helped them develop life story collection skills and understand how sharing a life story can impact a veteran's experience of receiving health care. There was no statistically significant difference in survey responses whether interviews were in person, by telephone, or over video. CONCLUSIONS: A curriculum incorporating MLMS effectively taught narrative medicine skills to medical students. The program achieved its objectives despite curricular redesign for the virtual setting.

Extensive serology and PCR testing were non-contributory toward identifying the etiology and guiding therapy. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was effective in hastening the resolution of lesions. CONCLUSION: Post-fever retinitis appears to be a distinct clinical form of acute hemorrhagic non-necrotizing retinitis without a uniformly identifiable cause, and some evidence pointing toward a para-infectious etiology secondary to flu-like illnesses.

We sought to identify whether implementation of the nationwide lockdown (shelter-in-place) order in South Africa affected ambulatory clinic visitation in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN). DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study SETTING: Data were analyzed from the Africa Health Research Institute Health and Demographic Surveillance System, which includes prospective data capture of clinic visits at eleven primary healthcare clinics in northern KwaZulu-Natal PARTICIPANTS: A total of 36,291 individuals made 55,545 clinic visits during the observation period. EXPOSURE OF INTEREST: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with regression discontinuity methods to estimate changes in outpatient clinic visitation from 60 days before through 35 days after the lockdown period. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses we assessed visitation for the following sub-categories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases, and by age and sex strata. RESULTS: We found no change in total clinic visits/clinic/day from prior to and during the lockdown (?6.9 visits/clinic/day, 95%CI ?17.4, 3.7) or trends in clinic visitation over time during the lockdown period (?0.2, 95%CI ?3.4, 3.1). We did detect a reduction in child healthcare visits at the lockdown (?7.2 visits/clinic/day, 95%CI ?9.2, ?5.3), which was seen in both children <1 and children 1C5. In contrast, we found a significant increase in HIV visits immediately after the lockdown (8.4 visits/clinic/day, 95%CI 2.4, 14.4). No other differences in clinic visitation were found for perinatal care and family planning, non-communicable diseases, or among adult men and women. CONCLUSIONS: In rural KZN, the ambulatory healthcare system was largely resilient during the national-wide lockdown order. A major exception was child healthcare visitation, which declined immediately after the lockdown but began to normalize in the weeks thereafter. Future work should explore efforts to decentralize chronic care for high-risk populations and whether catch-up vaccination programs might be required in the wake of these findings.","output":"Access to primary healthcare during lockdown measures for COVID-19 in rural South Africa: a longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes a case study of a novel teaching method where the Teaching with Industry (TWI) modelCindustry practitioners incorporated as co-instructors in a semester-long classroom settingCis enhanced by using new videoconferencing technologies such as Zoom and Meeting Owl Pro, and innovative classroom setups.

Therefore, several containment strategies to provide requirements for safe events were developed and tested. Nonetheless, every second (50.7%) is afraid of becoming infected on an event. We therefore investigated which hygiene and containment measures are perceived to be important from the visitors point of view and thus might increase subjective sense of safety. Methods This online study was carried out in November 2020. A total of 1,004 persons, who regularly attended events before the pandemic, took part in the study. The importance of different hygiene and containment measures was evaluated using a 5-point Likert-scale (1 unimportant to 5 extremely important). Potential statistical differences in socio-demographical aspects (age, gender, net disposable income for leisure activities) and attendance on events were tested with analyses of variance. Results Participants perceived the use of disinfectant (M = 4.10) as the most important element of containment strategies, followed by transparent information on the hygiene strategy (M = 4.00), reduced occupancy (M = 3.98), and optimized ventilation (M = 3.97). Body temperature measurement at the entrance (M = 3.27), a negative SARS-CoV-2 test (M = 3.11), completion of a health questionnaire (M = 3.05), and abandoning breaks and catering (M = 2.98) were considered as less important. Analyses of group differences in socio-demographical aspects found abandoning breaks and catering to be more important to men than to women. This strategy is also more important to people aged 66 and above than to younger age groups (e.g., age 20C40). For women, the use of disinfectant is considerably more important. No other significant differences exist. Conclusion Combining relevant measures appears to be important to provide a safe containment strategy. Measures aimed at positively influencing peoples sense of safety do not fully correspond to researched knowledge of effectiveness. There are also target group-specific differences in the rating of measures, which should be considered while preparing containment strategies. To describe the dynamic development of changes in subjective rating of containment strategies, continuing research is needed.","output":"Perceived importance of pandemic interventions for attending cultural events C findings from Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with Cushing disease (CD) may present with both chronic and acute perioperative complications that necessitate multidisciplinary care. This review highlights several objectives for these patients before and after transsphenoidal surgery. Preoperative management includes treatment of electrolyte disturbances, cardiovascular comorbidities, prediabetes/diabetes, as well as prophylactic consideration(s) for thromboembolism and infection(s). Preoperative medical therapy (PMT) could prove beneficial in patients with severe hypercortisolism or in cases of delayed surgery. Some centers use PMT routinely, although the clinical benefit for all patients is controversial. In this setting, steroidogenesis inhibitors are preferred because of rapid and potent inhibition of cortisol secretion. If glucocorticoids (GCs) are not used perioperatively, an immediate remission assessment postoperatively is possible. However, perioperative GC replacement is sometimes necessary for clinically unstable or medically pretreated patients and for those patients with surgical complications. A nadir serum cortisol of less than 2 to 5g/dL during 24 to 74 hours postoperatively is generally accepted as remission; higher values suggest nonremission, while a few patients may display delayed remission. If remission is not achieved, additional treatments are pursued. The early postoperative period necessitates multidisciplinary awareness for early diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) to avoid adrenal crisis, which may also be potentiated by acute postoperative complications. Preferred GC replacement is hydrocortisone, if available. Assessment of recovery from postoperative AI should be undertaken periodically. Other postoperative targets include decreasing antihypertensive/diabetic therapy if in remission, thromboprophylaxis, infection prevention/treatment, and management of electrolyte disturbances and/or potential pituitary deficiencies. Evaluation of recovery of thyroid, gonadal, and growth hormone deficiencies should also be performed during the following months postoperatively.","output":"Perioperative Management of a Patient With Cushing Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is an efficacious behaviour to prevent community-associated infections. Estimates of the proportion of populations who wash their hands have indicated limited compliance. While biases of self-report items for hand hygiene, such as the tendency to overestimate one's behaviour, represent a limitation, direct survey questions remain important. This study aims to compare indices of handwashing compliance based on single vs. combined handwashing attributes, i.e., its frequency, technique, and duration. METHODS: Data of a representative survey on hygiene and infection control by the German Federal Centre for Health Education were analysed. In a cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview design, the resident population in Germany aged 16C85 years was surveyed in 2012. For handwashing, duration, frequency in different situations, and technique (use of soap, washing interdigital spaces, and drying hands) were self-reported. Self-reports were rated as (non-)compliant based on national recommendations and combined into single- and multi-attribute indices. Use of hand disinfectants, recall of handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms, and socio-demographics were also assessed. In total, N = 4483 persons participated (response rate: 49.7%). Data were weighted to compensate for sampling bias and analysed by cross-tabulation and multiple logistic regression. Primarily due to missing data, the analysis was confined to N = 4093 respondents (i.e., 91%). RESULTS: Among women, the proportion of those who reported to wash hands almost always in at least seven of nine situations was 30.8% (men: 20.3%). In contrast, 51% of men reported always using soap, drying hands, and washing interdigital spaces (women: 43.5%; p < 0.001). Compliance based on indices that included frequency was higher in women by 5.2% for frequency + technique (17.6% vs. 12.4%), and 2.5% for frequency + duration (13.1% vs. 10.6%) and frequency + duration + technique (8.8% vs. 6.3%; p < 0.02). Socio-demographic differences were most consistent regarding higher compliance among healthcare workers. Finally, especially men recalling handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms had higher compliance than those with no recall, namely, for frequency + technique (15.4% vs. 10.6%; OR: 1.9), all three attributes (7.6% vs. 5.3%; OR = 1.7), and technique (56.9% vs. 47.7%; OR = 1.6). The highest odds ratio was noted for disinfectant use among men (OR = 2.5; 12.2% vs. 4.9%). DISCUSSION: While being representative for Germany, limitations include the survey's cross-sectionality, response rate, and the study representing the situation in 2012. Nonetheless, indices based on combined attributes allow better comparison to scarce compliance estimates for Germany based on observation. Socio-demographic differences add to existing evidence, e.g., higher compliance by healthcare workers. Finally, although reverse causation is possible, it is notable that although handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms focus on duration and technique, women recalling them reported higher frequency, and men more often report hand disinfectant use, suggesting possible carry-over effects. CONCLUSION: Self-reported handwashing compliance assessment may be improved by partitioning the behavioural domain into different attributes and using indices based on combinations of these.","output":"When, how, and how long do adults in Germany self-reportedly wash their hands?

METHODS: Using the Abdominal Wall Reconstruction Surgical Collaborative (AWRSC) registry, patients with ventral hernias who underwent enhanced-view totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) repairs between February 2016 and September 2019 were evaluated. Patients with contamination or active infection within the surgical field, those who underwent an emergent or hybrid repair, or received a concomitant procedure were excluded. Propensity score matching based on the defect size, previous hernia repair status, and the use of posterior component separation (PCS) was used to match patients with drains to patients without drains. We evaluated 180-day outcomes in terms of SSIs, SSOs, and recurrence. RESULTS: 308 patients met the inclusion criteria. After propensity score matching, 48 patients with drains and 72 without drains were included in the analysis cohort. Those with drains were older with a greater likelihood of an incisional hernia, but were broadly similar for other relevant demographic and hernia-related variables. While there was no difference in the incidence of SSOs and SSIs between the two groups, we report a higher risk of SSOs needing procedural intervention (SSOPI) and recurrence, with a lengthened hospital stay in the cohort that received surgical drains.

METHODS: We conducted 12 pre-registered semi-structured interviews with editors of respected SSH journals. Interviews consisted of 21 questions and lasted an average of 67 min. Interviews were transcribed, descriptively coded, and organized into code families. RESULTS: SSH editors saw anonymized peer review benefits to outweigh those of open peer review. They considered anonymized peer review the gold standard that authors and editors are expected to follow to respect institutional policies; moreover, anonymized review was also perceived as ethically superior due to the protection it provides, and more pragmatic due to eased seeking of reviewers.

RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 809 days (range 147C1353) and the mean number of IVI/year among treated eyes was 6.7 (SD 3.1). Mean age at baseline was 70.4 years (SD 10.9), BCVA was 77.6 letters (SD 11.6) and CRT was 263.6 m (SD 86.7) and was similar between patients using and not using home monitoring. In multivariate analyses, patients using home monitoring had a higher chance to improve visual acuity by 5 letters (OR 1.67 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.76; p=0.044)) than controls. Treated eyes using home monitoring had less injection visits/year (?0.99 (95% CI ?1.59 to ?0.40; p=0.001)) and a longer treatment retention +69.2 days (95% CI 2.4 to 136.0; p=0.042). These effects were similar across retinal pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggest that patients capable of performing mobile hyperacuity home monitoring benefit in terms of visual acuity and discontinue treatment less often than patients not using home monitoring.","output":"Visual outcomes and treatment adherence of patients with macular pathology using a mobile hyperacuity home-monitoring app: a matched-pair analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coined three decades ago, the term aptamer and directed evolution have now reached their maturity. The concept that nucleic acid could modulate the activity of target protein as ligand emerged from basic science studies of viruses. Aptamers are short nucleic acid sequences capable of specific, high-affinity molecular binding, which allow for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Compared to traditional antibodies, aptamers have several advantages, including small size, flexible structure, good biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity. In vitro selection method is used to isolate aptamers that are specific for a desired target from a randomized oligonucleotide library. The first aptamer drug, Macugen, was approved by FDA in 2004, which was accompanied by many studies and clinical investigations on various targets and diseases. Despite much promise, most aptamers have failed to meet the requisite safety and efficacy standards in human clinical trials. Amid these setbacks, the emergence of novel technologies and recent advances in aptamer and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) design are fueling hope in this field. The unique properties of aptamer are gaining renewed interest in an era of COVID-19. The binding performance of an aptamer and reproducibility are still the key issues in tackling current hurdles in clinical translation. A thorough analysis of the aptamer binding under varying conditions and the conformational dynamics is warranted. Here, the challenges and opportunities of aptamers are reviewed with recent progress.","output":"Recent Progress and Opportunities for Nucleic Acid Aptamers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The advent of COVID-19 has impinged millions of people. The increased concern of the virus spread in confined spaces due to meteorological factors has sequentially fostered the need to improve indoor air quality. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to review control measures and preventive sustainable solutions for the future that can deliberately help in bringing down the impact of declined air quality and prevent future biological attacks from affecting the occupants health. METHODOLOGY: Anontology chart is constructed based on the set objectives and review of all the possible measures to improve the indoor air quality taking into account the affecting parameters has been done. OBSERVATIONS: An integrated approach considering non-pharmaceutical and engineering control measures together for a healthy indoor environment should be contemplated rather than discretizing the available solutions. Maintaining social distance by reducing occupant density and implementing a modified ventilation system with advance filters for decontamination of viral load can help in sustaining healthy indoor air quality.

It has been prepared with Cytotoxic T-cell (T(C)) and Helper T-cell (T(H)) binding epitopes overlapping with B-cell binding epitopes predicted for 6 proteins conserved among 4 different viral strains isolated across the world. Both the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are ensured due to the presence of T cell and B-cell inducing epitopes along with interferon-gamma inducing epitopes present in the vaccine. The final vaccine construct comprises of an adjuvant at the N terminal, Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte and Helper T Lymphocyte epitopes. The construct showed potential antigenicity and was non-allergic. The molecular docking of the refined, validated tertiary structure model of the vaccine was performed with immune-stimulatory Toll Like Receptors (TLR), TLR-2,3,4. The study of binding energetics of the docked complexes revealed binding interactions of receptor with vaccine. The immune simulation of the vaccine even confirmed the initiation of elevated host immune responses.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study recruited a convenient sample of 15 patients from the pulmonology departments of four hospitals. Validated questionnaires were adapted to meet the context of this study in terms of adequacy, acceptability, adoption, fidelity, and cost. The impact of this program on quality of life and anxiety was measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), the COPD Clinical Questionnaire (CCQ), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). All measurements were performed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: All 15 participants who agreed to participate in this intervention found the program adequate and acceptable for addressing COPD-related issues. Regarding adoption, all participants declared having no difficulty explaining to others the content of the education sessions and that they would suggest this program to other COPD patients. In terms of effectiveness, six patients had improving in quality of life scores, and five patients had lower anxiety and depression scores compared to baseline measures. A knowledge assessment was done at the end of each session, showing an increase in knowledge for all participants. Skills were also assessed at the end of the program. Participants made no errors that had an impact on their health. Regarding the cost, it was difficult to evaluate the relative cost of this intervention given the economic situation in the country.

The aims of the study were to examine the associations between all-cause mortality and PM in the pandemic period and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019). METHODS: We collected daily data regarding all-cause mortality (stratified by age and gender), and PM concentrations for 107 Italian provinces from 1 January 2015 to 31 May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. RESULTS: Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in pandemic period. Each 10 g/m3 increase in PM was associated with much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during the pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 (increased mortality rate: 7.24% (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45% (95%CI: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10; 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10).

To address these challenges, we developed a modular, self-paced, mobile-ready and work-relevant online course covering foundational infection prevention and control (IPC) concepts. Here, we evaluate the first pilot of this course, conducted with HWs in Nigeria. Methods We used a learner-centered design and prototyping process to create a new approach to delivering online training for HWs. The resulting course comprised 10 self-paced modules optimized for use on mobile devices. Modules presented IPC vignettes in which learning was driven by short assessment questions with feedback. Learners were recruited by distributing a link to the training through Nigeria-based email lists, WhatsApp groups and similar networks of HWs, managers and allied professionals. The course was open to learners for 8 weeks. We tracked question responses and time on task with platform analytics and assessed learning gains with pre- and post-testing. Significance was evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and effect size was calculated using Cohens d. Results Three hundred seventy-two learners, with roles across the health system, enrolled in the training;59% completed all 10 modules and earned a certificate. Baseline knowledge of foundational IPC concepts was low, as measured by pre-test scores (29%). Post-test scores were significantly higher at 54% (effect size 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.44). Learning gains were significant both among learners with low pre-test scores and among those who scored higher on the pre-test. We used the Net Promoter Score (NPS), a common user experience metric, to evaluate the training. The NPS was + 62, which is slightly higher than published scores of other self-paced online learning experiences. Conclusions High completion rates, significant learning gains and positive feedback indicate that self-paced, mobile-ready training that emphasizes short, low-stakes assessment questions can be an effective, scalable way to train HWs who choose to enroll.

In the recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, diagnostic kits based on this method are commonly used for molecular detection. One of the main systematic errors that misinterpret the results is using inaccurate internal control in RT-PCR diagnostic kits. Designing primers and probes that span exon-exon junction will avoid genomic DNA amplification and lead to obtaining high specific results. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the endogenous internal control of primers and probe for RNase P RNA to reduce false-negative results in respiratory samples. Methods: In this study, 30 samples of patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B were re-evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 using newly designed primers and probes for RNase P RNA (ultra-specific primers and probe). We also performed bioinformatics analysis on CDC-approved primers and probes of RNase P endogenous internal control. Results: In this analysis, we specified the location of these newly designed primers and probe on target mRNA and genomic DNA.

Based on bioinformatics analysis, the attachment sites of the CDC-approved primers and probe for endogenous internal control of RNase P are located on the first exon of this gene. In addition to identifying the target gene sequence, these primers and probe also non-specifically detect similar sequences on the genomic DNA. Conclusions: The present study showed that the use of specific primers and probes introduced by CDC for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus may cause false results due to non-specific binding to the genomic DNA. Therefore, choosing the right internal control for RNase P RNA can be useful in achieving very accurate results.","output":"False-negative results in taqman one-step rt-pcr test: Evaluation of endogenous internal control function used in sars-cov-2 detection tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A considerable proportion of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acquired secondary bacterial infections (SBIs). The etiology and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria were reported and used to provide a theoretical basis for appropriate infection therapy. Methods: This retrospective study reviewed electronic medical records of all the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Wuhan Union Hospital between January 27 and March 17, 2020. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients who acquired SBIs were enrolled. Demographic, clinical course, etiology, and antimicrobial resistance data of the SBIs were collected. Outcomes were also compared between patients who were classified as severe and critical on admission. Results: Among 1495 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 102 (6.8%) patients had acquired SBIs, and almost half of them (49.0%, 50/102) died during hospitalization. Compared with severe patients, critical patients had a higher chance of SBIs. Among the 159 strains of bacteria isolated from the SBIs, 136 strains (85.5%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The top three bacteria of SBIs were A. baumannii (35.8%, 57/159), K. pneumoniae (30.8%, 49/159), and S. maltophilia (6.3%, 10/159). The isolation rates of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae were 91.2% and 75.5%, respectively. Meticillin resistance was present in 100% of Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase negative staphylococci, and vancomycin resistance was not found. Conclusions: SBIs may occur in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and lead to high mortality. The incidence of SBIs was associated with the severity of illness on admission. Gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, were the main bacteria, and the resistance rates of the major isolated bacteria were generally high. This was a single-center study;thus, our results should be externally examined when applied in other institutions.","output":"Etiology and antimicrobial resistance of secondary bacterial infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents a reflection about the emergency psychologist at Covid-19 time, where he/she is a reliever and a victim to be rescued at the same time This reflection starts from the experiences in the call service, offered by the Psicologi per i Popoli - Trentino ODV association from 17/3/2020 to 29/05/2020 Starting from the collaboration with the l'Assessorato alle Politiche Sociali della Provincia di Trento, an analysis of local needs, and the association's need to not expose its collaborators to the risks of contagion, we share all the activities of the association in the quarantine period: the operation of the call service, the drafting of a vademecum addressed to the various sections of the population, thus describing the activity of the emergency psychologist within this pandemic Furthermore, the paper shifts from doing to being, presenting the emotional experiences of emergency psychologists during the operations: hopes, expectations, emotions, and thoughts shared with colleagues, especially during debriefings, which allowed to overcome \\"the challenging ford of the quarantine\\" Group work and team strength are then emphasized: they have been an \\"opportunity of meaning\\" for the emergency psychologist within a pandemic that leads him/her to be a helper and a victim to be helped at the same time","output":"The emergency psychologist at Covid-19 time: On being helpers and victims to be helped at the same time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background Clinical reports from across the world have documented psychosis in the context of COVID-19 infection;however, there has yet to be a large-scale epidemiological study to confirm this association. Methods We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study (N=15935;conducted between September and December 2020), which was administered online to students attending one of 28 universities in the United States. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the associations between COVID-19 infection/severity and 12-month psychotic experiences, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and international student status, as well as anxiety and depression. Results Over a fifth of the analytic sample reported COVID-19 infection, and around one in six people with COVID-19 infection reported psychotic experiences over the past 12 months. In multivariable logistic regression models, COVID-19 infection was associated with significantly greater odds of having psychotic experiences (aOR: 1.36;95% CI: 1.19-1.48). When compared with being asymptomatic, having moderate (aOR: 1.85;95% CI: 1.03 C 3.31) and severe (aOR: 1.76;95% CI: 1.11 C 2.77) symptoms were associated with significantly greater odds of having psychotic experiences. In weighted models, these associations became statistically non-significant when adjusting for depression and anxiety. Hospitalization was not significantly associated with psychotic experiences among those with COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Psychotic experiences are associated with COVID-19 infections, though much of the association is attenuated when taking into account anxiety and depression. Findings based on this sample of university students should be replicated outside of the university context to determine whether psychosis is a neuropsychiatric symptom during and after COVID-19 infection.","output":"COVID-19 infection and psychotic experiences: Findings from the Healthy Minds Study 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o: o novo coronavrus  semelhante a outras pneumonias coronavirais e tambm pode levar  sndrome do desconforto respiratrio agudo Mtodos: comunica??o breve sobre as repercuss?es pulmonares causadas pela doen?a e uso da ventila??o mecanica invasiva Resultados: a ventil??o mecanica invasiva  a forma de tratamento adequada para pacientes com satura??o abaixo de 92%, press?o arterial de O2 abaixo de 65 mm/Hg com ou sem hipercapnia, frequncia respiratria &gt;30 ipm e piora clnica Conclus?o: o uso da ventila??o n?o invasiva ou de oxigenoterapia nasal de alto fluxo n?o  recomendado na rotina (AU) Introduction: the novel coronavirus is similar to other coronaviral pneumonias, and can also lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome Methods: brief communication about the pulmonary repercussions caused by the disease and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation Results: Invasive mechanical ventilation is the appropriate form of treatment for patients with saturation below 92%, oxygen arterial pressure below 65 mm /hg with or without hypercapnia, respiratory rate&gt;30 ipm and clinical worsening Conclusion: the use of non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy is not recommended in routine","output":"Altera??es pulmonares causadas pelo novo Coronavrus (COVID-19) e o uso da ventila??o mecanica invasiva"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adverse drug reactions / events (ADR/ADE) have a major impact on patient health and health care costs. Detecting ADR's as early as possible and sharing them with regulators, pharma companies, and healthcare providers can prevent morbidity and save many lives. While most ADR's are not reported via formal channels, they are often documented in a variety of unstructured conversations such as social media posts by patients, customer support call transcripts, or CRM notes of meetings between healthcare providers and pharma sales reps. In this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that detects ADR's in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on previous work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the ADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets (91.75%, 78.76%, and 83.41% F1 scores respectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced - one based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - are shown to perform on par with existing state-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary clinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, for deciding if a conversation includes an ADR, obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy on the CADEC dataset (86.69% F1 score). The complete solution is implemented as a unified NLP pipeline in a production-grade library built on top of Apache Spark, making it natively scalable and able to process millions of batch or streaming records on commodity clusters.","output":"Mining Adverse Drug Reactions from Unstructured Mediums at Scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence of neurological complications and direct affection of neuronal structures in the course of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is actually emerging.

METHODS: We conducted an observational study from 28 June to 11 August 2020, enrolling patients admitted to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation MI who did not meet WHO criteria for suspected COVID-19. Samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. We followed up patients at 3 months (13 weeks) postadmission to record adverse cardiovascular outcomes: all-cause death, new MI, heart failure and new percutaneous coronary intervention or stent thrombosis. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We enrolled 280 patients with MI, 79% male, mean age 54.511.8 years, 140 of whom were diagnosed with STEMI. We found 36 (13%) to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 1 with influenza. There was no significant difference between mortality rate observed among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients compared with non-infected (5 (14%) vs 26 (11%); p=0.564). A numerically shorter median time to a recurrent cardiovascular event was recorded among SARS-CoV-2 infected compared with non-infected patients (21 days, IQR: 8C46 vs 27 days, IQR: 7C44; p=0.378). CONCLUSION: We found a substantial rate of occult SARS-CoV-2 infection in the studied cohort, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may precipitate MI.

Although the fecalCoral route is generally accepted, an increased number of reports indicate that airborne transmission may contribute to PEDV outbreak. Here, we show that PEDV could cause typical diarrhea in piglets through a nasal spray. Firstly, PEDV can develop a transient nasal epithelium infection. Subsequently, PEDV-carrying dendritic cells (DCs) allow the virus to be transferred to CD3(+) T cells via the virological synapse. Finally, virus-loaded CD3(+) T cells reach the intestine through the blood circulation, leading to intestinal infection via cell-to-cell contact. Our study provides evidence for airborne transmission of a gastrointestinal infected coronavirus and illustrates the mechanism of its transport from the entry site to the pathogenic site.","output":"An alternative pathway of enteric PEDV dissemination from nasal cavity to intestinal mucosa in swine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polysaccharides play multiple roles and have extensive bioactivities in life process and an immense potential in healthcare, food and cosmetic industries, due to their therapeutic effects and relatively low toxicity.

The data obtained from the newly tested compounds expanded the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of the thiazinoquinone scaffold, indicating that antiplasmodial activity is not affected by the inductive effect but rather by the resonance effect of the introduced group at the para position of the benzyl substituent.

In a similar way, we aimed to utilize a smartphone application to enable postoperative patients to partially self-manage their postoperative pain. The results of a previously performed proof-of-concept study regarding the application were promising, and nurses as well as patients were optimistic regarding this innovative mobile application. Nevertheless, in reality, it appears that the usage and overall implementation of this application have stagnated since its introduction. Problems with innovation adoption are not novel; various studies have been conducted to explore the reasons for low implementation success of eHealth applications and indicated that adoption is influenced by multiple organizational factors. This study investigated the influence of these organizational factors on the adoption process, aiming to provide more insight in the dos and donts for implementing eHealth in the working processes of hospital care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide insight in how to successfully implement a technological eHealth innovation in a general nonacademic hospital. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted to explore organizational factors affecting the innovation adoption process. Data were collected by conducting semistructured one-on-one interviews with 11 stakeholders. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis identifying overarching themes. RESULTS: Absorptive capacity, referred to as an organizations dynamic capability pertaining to knowledge creation and utilization that enhances an organizations ability to gain and sustain a competitive advantage, was regarded as the most influential factor on the applications adoption. Accordingly, it appeared that innovation adoption is mainly determined by the capability and willingness to assimilate and transform new information into productive use and the ability to absorb a novel innovation. Absorptive capacity was found to be influenced by the innovations benefit and the sense of ownership and responsibility. Organizational readiness and management support were also regarded as essential since absorptive capacity seemed to be mediated by these factors. The size of the hospital influenced eHealth adoption by the amount of resources available and by its organizational structure. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, absorptive capacity is essential for eHealth adoption, and it is mediated by management support and organizational readiness. It is recommended to increase the degree of willingness and ability to adopt an eHealth innovation by enhancing the relevance, engaging stakeholders, and assigning appropriate leaders to offer guidance.","output":"Adoption of a Postoperative Pain Self-Report Tool: Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Agricultural pesticides serve as effective controls of unwanted weeds and pests. However, these same chemicals can exert toxic effects in non-target organisms. To determine chemical modes of action, the toxicity ratio (TR) and critical body residues (CBRs) of 57 pesticides were calculated for Daphnia magna. Results showed that the CBR values of inert compounds were close to a constant while the CBR values of pesticides varied over a wider range. Although herbicides are categorized as specifically-acting compounds to plants, herbicides did not exhibit excess toxicity to Daphnia magna and were categorized as inert compounds with an average logTR = 0.41, which was less than a threshold of one. Conversely, fungicides and insecticides exhibited strong potential for toxic effects to Daphnia magna with an average logTR >2. Many of these chemicals act via disruption of the nervous, respiratory, or reproductive system, with high ligand-receptor binding activity which leads to higher toxicity for Daphnia magna. Molecular docking using acetylcholinesterase revealed that fungicides and insecticides bind more easily with the biological macromolecule when compared with inert compounds. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed that the toxicity of fungicides was mainly dependent upon the heat of formation and polar surface area, while the toxicity of insecticides was more related to hydrogen-bond properties. This comprehensive analysis reveals that there are specific differences in toxic mechanisms between fungicides and insecticides. These results are useful for determining relative risk associated with pesticide exposure to aquatic crustaceans, such as Daphnia magna.","output":"Evaluation of modes of action of pesticides to Daphnia magna based on QSAR, excess toxicity and critical body residues."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidences of an association between air pollution and Covid-19 infections are mixed and inconclusive.
