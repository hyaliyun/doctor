Known for its anticoagulant effects, LMWH has recently been reported to have a strong anti-inflammatory effect on colitis, myocarditis, and airway inflammation. However, as a newly-developed drug, its anti-inflammatory mechanism in upper respiratory tract inflammation has not been well-studied. Methods: SD rats were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group was established by building an acute nasal sinusitis model with expansion sponges mixed with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Then the experimental group rats were subcutaneously injected with different concentrations of LMWH. After seven consecutive days of injection, some rats were sacrificed, and blood and nasal mucosa samples were taken to determine their inflammation status. The remaining acute sinusitis rats were randomly selected for a week of nasal irrigation with normal saline or saline mixed with different concentrations of LMWH. One week later, rats were sacrificed, and samples of blood and nasal mucosa were taken to determine the inflammation status. Results: Rat nasal mucosa in the model group had obvious inflammation. The degree of nasal mucosa inflammation damage in the experimental group was lower than in the experimental control group, proving that LMWH has a protective effect on the nasal mucosa and that the effect correlates with dosage. Irrigation of the nose with saline mixed with LMWH can improve the anti-inflammatory effect. Protein related to the TLR4-MyD88-NF-B signaling pathway was activated in the acute sinusitis rat model, and LMWH can significantly inhibit its expression. Conclusion: This is the first report of the anti-inflammatory effect of LMWH in acute upper respiratory tract inflammation, together with an explanation of its anti-inflammatory mechanism. The findings contribute a theoretical basis for its potential anti-tumor effect.","output":"Low Molecular Weight Heparin Improves the Inflammatory State of Acute Sinusitis Rats Through Inhibiting the TLR4-MyD88-NF-B Signaling Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein mediates innate antiviral responses, including responses to certain coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In this study, we explored the mechanisms by which UVA light can activate MAVS, and whether local UVA light application can activate MAVS at locations distant from the light source (e.g. via cell-to-cell communication). MAVS levels were compared in HTEpC exposed to 2 mW/cm(2) narrow band (NB)-UVA for 20 min and in unexposed controls at 30C40% and at 100% confluency, and in unexposed HTEpC treated with supernatants or lysates from UVA-exposed cells or from unexposed controls. MAVS was also assessed in different sections of confluent monolayer plates where only one section was exposed to NB-UVA. Our results showed that UVA increases the expression of MAVS protein. Further, cells in a confluent monolayer exposed to UVA conferred an elevation in MAVS in cells adjacent to the exposed section, and also in cells in the most distant sections which were not exposed to UVA. In this study, human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells exposed to UVA demonstrate increased MAVS protein, and also appear to transmit this influence to confluent cells not exposed to UVA, likely via cell-cell signaling.","output":"Ultraviolet-A light increases mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein in confluent human tracheal cells via cell-cell signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to examine differences in students' attitudes about online teaching, more precisely on the use of the Google classroom platform during a pandemic and their opinions on the quality of such teaching concerning classic teaching The questionnaire was conducted to the third-grade university students divided into two groups: preschool teachers (n=65) and primary school teachers (n=64) A student attitude survey contained 15 items on a 7-point Likert-type scale with two open-ended questions regarding their problems and difficulties in online learning during the coronavirus pandemic in the Republic of Serbia and their opinion about advantages and disadvantages of distance over the classic learning Results revealed that there are statistically significant differences among two groups of students (preschool teachers and primary school teachers), at the level of significance at 005 at the total result at the questionnaire Students reported that one of the advantages of distance learning was that they had additional knowledge and skills on the use of technology and that they can choose the time and place for solving the tasks of the classes As the disadvantage of distance learning is that human contact is lost and they do not get feedback instantly, comparing to classical education","output":"The Differences in Students' Attitudes about Online Teaching during Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are scarce published data in differentiated thyroid cancer patients about new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) disease outcomes and mortality.

This study aimed to analyze the level of compliance among Indonesian people particularly the young adults towards health protocol during exercise and conduct an intervention accordingly. This study used an action research design with consecutive sampling. Respondents were Indonesian young adults who exercise outside of their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 361 Indonesian young adults aged 18-25 years old who exercise during the pandemic inside and/or outside the home and willing to answer the questionnaire completed the online questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed from the six health protocols criteria from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia. Data analysis used chi-squared tests. Furthermore, a short video was developed according to the main research findings and published on Instagram TV as a health intervention to the respondents. The results showed that the level of compliance among Indonesian young adults toward health protocol during exercise was low (24.1%). Moreover only 35.3% of respondents applied physical distancing and 48.7% of respondents wore masks during at low-moderate intensity exercise. There was no significant association between gender exercise intensity and perception of the health protocol and the compliance of health protocol during exercise.

In the present study, we focused our attention on the SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP2, whose role in the viral pathogenicity is poorly understood. Recent proteomic studies shed light on the capacity of NSP2 to bind the 4EHP-GIGYF2 complex, a key factor involved in microRNA-mediated silencing of gene expression in human cells. In order to gain a better understanding of the function of NSP2, we attempted to identify the molecular basis of its interaction with 4EHP-GIGYF2. Our data demonstrate that NSP2 physically associates with the endogenous 4EHP-GIGYF2 complex in the cytoplasm. Using co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, we identified both 4EHP and a central segment in GIGYF2 as binding sites for NSP2. We also provide functional evidence that NSP2 impairs the function of GIGYF2 in mediating mRNA silencing using reporter-based assays, thus leading to a reduced activity of microRNAs. Altogether, these data reveal the profound impact of NSP2 on the post-transcriptional silencing of gene expression in human cells, pointing out 4EHP-GIGYF2 targeting as a possible strategy of SARS-CoV-2 to take over the silencing machinery and to suppress host defenses.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP2 impairs the microRNA-induced silencing capacity of human cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although biological processes have been directly targeted to substantial advantage in effective treatments for major depression, the evidence base for addressing potential \\"existential\\" contributions to depressive syndromes has lagged behind that related to other tractable mediators of the condition, such as cognitive bias, nonadaptive learned behavior, and variation in monoamine neurotransmission.

This work has aimed to evaluate the early, or on diagnosis, T-cell compartment response, T-helper subsets and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody specificity in COVID-19 patients and to classify them according to evolution based on infection severity. A unicenter, randomized group of 146 COVID-19 patients was divided into four groups in accordance with the most critical events during the course of disease. The immunophenotype and T-helper subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals showed a potent and robust Th1 immunity, with a lower Th17 and less activated T-cells at the time of sample acquisition compared not only with symptomatic patients, but also with healthy controls. Conversely, severe COVID-19 patients presented with Th17-skewed immunity, fewer Th1 responses and more activated T-cells. The multivariate analysis of the immunological and inflammatory parameters, together with the comorbidities, showed that the Th1 response was an independent protective factor for the prevention of hospitalization (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03C0.81), with an AUC of 0.844. Likewise, the Th1 response was found to be an independent protective factor for severe forms of the disease (OR 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01C0.63, p = 0.015, AUC: 0.873). In conclusion, a predominant Th1 immune response in the acute phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection could be used as a tool to identify patients who might have a good disease evolution.","output":"An Early Th1 Response Is a Key Factor for a Favorable COVID-19 Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard sutures used in vaginal cuff reapproximation in total laparoscopic hysterectomies and hysterotomy closure in myomectomies require knot placement and tensioning of the suture throughout the closure. This may contribute to wound dehiscence, increased blood loss, and ischemia of tissue surrounding the knots. In 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the Quill? bidirectional barbed suture (Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada)(Fig. 1). In January 2007, the suture was introduced in the United States. The emergence of the bidirectional barbed suture has significantly affected minimally invasive surgery. Initially used by orthopaedic and plastic surgeons, barbed suture has allowed for the tedious task of knot tying to fade away. Following the introduction of the bidirectional barbed suture, the FDA approved the V-Loc? unidirectional suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA)(Fig. 2). The utility of the barbed suture has been instrumental in laparoscopic myomectomy and total laparoscopic hysterectomy. As barbed suture is easily utilized using the same laparoscopic ports, needle drivers, and graspers, the surgeon does not require a third hand to facilitate laparoscopic suturing. The barbs minimize tissue recoil and do so with accurate soft tissue approximation, achieving hemostasis without the use of locking and figure eight sutures. Barbed suture allows for a shorter operative time, as there is an ease of suturing without the complication of knot tying. Barbed sutures are essential tools in the modern laparoscopist's toolbox.","output":"The use of barbed suture in hysterectomy and myomectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a delayed and severe complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection that strikes previously healthy children.

We analyzed blood cytokine expression, and the T cell repertoire and phenotype in 36 MIS-C cases, which were compared to 16 KD, 58 TSS, and 42 COVID-19 cases. We observed an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, IFN?3, CD25s, MCP1, IL-1RA) in MIS-C, TSS and KD, contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes. We detected a specific expansion of activated T cells expressing the V?21.3 T cell receptor ? chain variable region in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in 75% of MIS-C patients and not in any patient with TSS, KD, or acute COVID-19; this correlated with the cytokine storm detected. The T cell repertoire returned to baseline within weeks after MIS-C resolution. V?21.3+ T cells from MIS-C patients expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD38 and CX3CR1 but had weak responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro.

ORFs located in the 3-terminal one-third of the genome encode structural and accessory proteins and are expressed from a set of 5 leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs that are synthesized by a process called discontinuous transcription. Coronavirus protein synthesis not only involves cap-dependent translation mechanisms but also employs regulatory mechanisms, such as ribosomal frameshifting.

Evidence shows that these psychological challenges are especially prominent in healthcare workers (HCW); especially in nurses.

To further look into this, we systematically review the recent literature to see whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic differs between medical doctors and nurses across studies and which aspects of mental health are especially affected in nurses. RECENT FINDINGS: Across studies, there is solid evidence that nurses show poorer mental health outcomes compared with medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, prevalence rates in nurses are often higher than 50%. In contrast, general stress levels and burnout seem to be comparable between nurses and medical doctors.

The results revealed that CYP exposure affected functional and structural integrities of the testes, by depleting sperm count and motility, testosterone, LH, spermatogenic and mature sperm cell population, Leydig cells and PCNA immunoreactive proliferating cells. TQ interventions were able to reverse all cytotoxic CYP impacts, but with differential activities on the hormonal concentrations, specifically LH and FSH.

METHODS: Cohort of hospitalized patients with TIA and stroke discharged alive from a large university hospital in Norway, and their informal caregivers. Questionnaires at 3 and 12 months post discharge were filled out by caregivers (n = 320 and n = 326, respectively) and survivors (n = 368 and n = 383, respectively). Multivariable linear regression analyses tested associations between initial stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) in caregivers and survivors. RESULTS: Caregivers of survivors with TIA or stroke did not report lower HRQoL than matched norms. There was some evidence of an association of the NIHSS with caregiver HRQoL at 3 months only (age-sex-adjusted coefficient - 0.01, p = 0.008), however, this was attenuated after additional adjustments. Survivors with stroke, but not TIA, reported lower HRQoL than population norms at both time points. There was a negative association between higher NIHSS scores and survivors' HRQoL; fully adjusted coefficient - 0.01 at both time points (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The informal caregivers and survivors with TIA did not report lower than expected HRQoL. Increasing stroke severity was associated with decreasing HRQoL among survivors, but had limited predictive value among caregivers.

RESULTS: We searched for eligible studies in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar in April 2020, and conducted a qualitative synthesis of the study findings. The electronic searches yielded 2503 records, from which we included 10 observational and mathematical modeling studies. These studies used data from one or multiple countries on COVID-19 (nine studies) or another viral epidemic such as Zika (one study). Most of the studies show the importance of using physical and social distancing at the start of the epidemic and utilising a staggered approach when easing the restrictions, while scaling up testing. The lifting of lockdown measures should be accompanied by continued use of personal protective equipment, the limiting of workdays, and wide-scale testing. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the importance of timeous action when faced with an epidemic, let alone a pandemic.

We sought to investigate the predictors of prolonged ileus following elective colon resections procedures. METHODS The national participant user files of NSQIP databases were utilized to examine the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing elective colon resection during 2012-2013. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to investigate predictors of prolonged ileus. Prolonged ileus was defined as no return of bowel function in 7 days. RESULTS We sampled a total of 27,560 patients who underwent colon resections; of these, 3497 (12.7%) patients had prolonged ileus. Patients with ileocolonic anastomosis (ICA) had a significantly higher rate of prolonged ileus compared to patients with colorectal anastomosis (CRA) (15 vs. 11.5%, AOR 1.25, P < 0.01). Prolonged ileus was significantly associated with intra-abdominal infections (13 vs. 2.8%, AOR 2.56, P < 0.01) and anastomotic leakage (12 vs. 2.4%, AOR 2.50, P < 0.01). Factors such as preoperative sepsis (AOR 1.63, P < 0.01), disseminated cancer (AOR 1.24, P = 0.01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AOR 1.27, P = 0.02) were associated with an increased risk of prolonged ileus, whereas oral antibiotic bowel preparation (AOR 0.77, P < 0.01) and laparoscopic surgery (AOR 0.51, P < 0.01) are associated with decreased prolonged ileus risk. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged ileus is a common condition following colon resection, with an incidence of 12.7%.

Patient characteristics and PHQ scores were compared before and after March 23, 2020 (California COVID-19 Stay-at-Home order). RESULTS 3,609 encounters with PHQ-2 data were identified. Of these, 223 (6.2%) scored 3 and underwent PHQ-9 assessment. 121 (3.4% of 3,609) scored 10 on the PHQ-9 and 53 (1.5%) endorsed suicidal ideation. Factors associated with PHQ-9 administration were female gender (OR 1.58, p=0.001), obesity (OR 1.48, p=0.043), and Neck Mass/Neoplasm/Cancer diagnosis (OR 1.99, p=0.013). Female gender was also associated with suicidality (OR 2.47, p=0.008). Comparison pre-COVID-19 vs. during COVID-19 showed no differences in depression or suicidality. However subgroup analysis revealed some significant findings. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate substantial prevalence of positive depression screening and suicidal ideation among adolescent pediatric otolaryngology clinic encounters. Depression rates were similar pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19, yet barriers to screening during this time were substantial.

In complex organisms, O-GalNAc glycans comprise a substantial proportion of the glycocalyx, with defined functions in hemostatic, gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. Furthermore, O-GalNAc glycans are important players in host-microbe interactions, and changes in O-glycan composition are associated with certain diseases and metabolic conditions, which in some instances can be used for diagnosis or therapeutic intervention. Breakthroughs in O-glycobiology have gone hand in hand with the development of new technologies, such as advancements in mass spectrometry, as well as facilitation of genetic engineering in mammalian cell lines. High-throughput O-glycoproteomics have enabled us to draw a comprehensive map of O-glycosylation, and mining this information has supported the definition and confirmation of functions related to site specific O-glycans. This includes protection from proteolytic cleavage, as well as modulation of binding affinity or receptor function. Yet, there is still much to discover, and among the important next challenges will be to define the context dependent functions of O-glycans in different stages of cellular differentiation, cellular metabolism, host-microbiome interactions, and in disease.

Nevertheless, the amount and quality of information provided may lead to information overload. Therefore, people need certain skills to search for, identify, and evaluate information from the internet. In the context of health information, these competencies are summarized as the construct of eHealth literacy. Previous research has highlighted the relevance of eHealth literacy in terms of health-related outcomes. However, the existing instrument assessing eHealth literacy in the German language reveals methodological limitations regarding test development and validation. The development and validation of a revised scale for this important construct is highly relevant. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was the development and validation of a revised German eHealth literacy scale. In particular, this study aimed to focus on high methodological and psychometric standards to provide a valid and reliable instrument for measuring eHealth literacy in the German language. METHODS: Two internationally validated instruments were merged to cover a wide scope of the construct of eHealth literacy and create a revised eHealth literacy scale. Translation into the German language followed scientific guidelines and recommendations to ensure content validity. Data from German-speaking people (n=470) were collected in a convenience sample from October to November 2020. Validation was performed by factor analyses. Further, correlations were performed to examine convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity. Additionally, analyses of measurement invariance of gender, age, and educational level were conducted. RESULTS: Analyses revealed a 2-factorial model of eHealth literacy. By item-reduction, the 2 factors information seeking and information appraisal were measured with 8 items reaching acceptable-to-good model fits (comparative fit index [CFI]: 0.942, Tucker Lewis index [TLI]: 0.915, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]: 0.127, and standardized root mean square residual [SRMR]: 0.055). Convergent validity was comprehensively confirmed by significant correlations of information seeking and information appraisal with health literacy, internet confidence, and internet anxiety. Discriminant and criterion validity were examined by correlation analyses with various scales and could partly be confirmed. Scalar level of measurement invariance for gender (CFI: 0.932, TLI: 0.923, RMSEA: 0.122, and SRMR: 0.068) and educational level (CFI: 0.937, TLI: 0.934, RMSEA: 0.112, and SRMR: 0.063) were confirmed. Measurement invariance of age was rejected. CONCLUSIONS: Following scientific guidelines for translation and test validation, we developed a revised German eHealth Literacy Scale (GR-eHEALS). Our factor analyses confirmed an acceptable-to-good model fit. Construct validation in terms of convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity could mainly be confirmed. Our findings provide evidence for measurement invariance of the instrument regarding gender and educational level.

The synovial fluid was collected for leukocyte count, differential cell count, and culture on standard media. The levels of systemic inflammation markers such as the ESR and CRP concentration were determined in serum and full blood. Tissue samples were collected for microbiological studies. Components from endoprostheses were exposed to ultrasound in a process called sonication. Among the parameters measured in serum and full blood the levels of ESR and CRP were higher in the septic group of patients. Cytologic analysis of synovial fluid was in correlation with microbiologic identification. The most frequent isolated bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis. Culture results from materials such as synovial fluid, sonicate and tissues are crucial to establish the infectious aetiology of the loosening. Microscopic analysis of synovial fluid represents a simple, rapid and accurate method for differentiating PJI from aseptic failure.

The attachment-based coding system of family drawings included three levels: (1) 24 individual markers, (2) eight global rating scales (1-7 points), and (3) four attachment categories (secure, avoidant, resistant, and disorganized). RESULTS Late-adopted children assessed with the family drawings were more insecure on the attachment categories and achieved lower scores on positive global ratings such as the Vitality/Creativity and Family Pride/Happiness scales, higher scores on the Role Reversal scale, and a tendency toward higher scores on the Bizarreness/Dissociation scale. No difference emerged between the two groups regarding the individual markers.

Objective: To evaluate whether unanticipated disparities by race or ethnicity arise from a single institution's resource allocation policy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included adults (aged &#8805;18 years) who were cared for on a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ward or in a monitored unit requiring invasive or noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula between May 26 and July 14, 2020, at 2 academic hospitals in Miami, Florida. Exposures: Race (ie, White, Black, Asian, multiracial) and ethnicity (ie, non-Hispanic, Hispanic). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was based on a resource allocation priority score (range, 1-8, with 1 indicating highest and 8 indicating lowest priority) that was assigned daily based on both estimated short-term (using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) and longer-term (using comorbidities) mortality. There were 2 coprimary outcomes: maximum and minimum score for each patient over all eligible patient-days. Standard summary statistics were used to describe the cohort, and multivariable Poisson regression was used to identify associations of race and ethnicity with each outcome. Results: The cohort consisted of 5613 patient-days of data from 1127 patients (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 62.7 [51.7-73.7]; 607 [53.9%] men). Of these, 711 (63.1%) were White patients, 323 (28.7%) were Black patients, 8 (0.7%) were Asian patients, and 31 (2.8%) were multiracial patients; 480 (42.6%) were non-Hispanic patients, and 611 (54.2%) were Hispanic patients. The median (IQR) maximum priority score for the cohort was 3 (1-4); the median (IQR) minimum score was 2 (1-3). After adjustment, there was no association of race with maximum priority score using White patients as the reference group (Black patients: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.12; Asian patients: IRR, 0.95; 95% CI. 0.62-1.45; multiracial patients: IRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72-1.19) or of ethnicity using non-Hispanic patients as the reference group (Hispanic patients: IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.10); similarly, no association was found with minimum score for race, again with White patients as the reference group (Black patients: IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.14; Asian patients: IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.62-1.49; multiracial patients: IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.07) or ethnicity, again with non-Hispanic patients as the reference group (Hispanic patients: IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of adult patients admitted to a COVID-19 unit at 2 US hospitals, there was no association of race or ethnicity with the priority score underpinning the resource allocation policy. Despite this finding, any policy to guide altered standards of care during a crisis should be monitored to ensure equitable distribution of resources.","output":"Assessment of Disparities Associated With a Crisis Standards of Care Resource Allocation Algorithm for Patients in 2 US Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the breakup morphology of an expelled respiratory liquid is an emerging interest in diverse fields to enhance the efficacious strategies to attenuate disease transmission. In this paper, we present the possible hydrodynamic instabilities associated with expelling the respiratory liquid by a human. For this purpose, we have performed experiments with a cylindrical soap film and air. The sequence of the chain of events was captured with high-speed imaging. We have identified three mechanisms, namely, KelvinCHelmholtz (KCH) instability, RayleighCTaylor (RCT) instability, and PlateauCRayleigh (PCR) instability, which are likely to occur in sequence. Furthermore, we discuss the multiple processes responsible for drop fragmentation. The processes such as breakup length, rupture, ligament, and drop formation are documented with a scaling factor. The breakup length scales with We(?0.17), and the number of ligaments scales as [Formula: see text]. In addition, the thickness of the ligaments scales as We(?0.5). Here, We and Bo represent the Weber and Bond numbers, respectively. It was also demonstrated that the flapping of the liquid sheet is the result of the KCH mechanism, and the ligaments formed on the edge of the rim appear due to the RCT mechanism, and finally, the hanging drop fragmentation is the result of the PCR instability.

METHODS From a single-centre retrospective cohort, we enrolled a total of 5633 adult patients diagnosed with MINS between January 2010 and June 2019. The patients were divided into two groups based on evaluation by cardiologist, which was defined as a cardiology consultation or transfer to the cardiology department. For the outcome, 30-day mortality was compared in crude and propensity-score matched populations. RESULTS Of a total of 5633 patients, 2120 (37.6%) were evaluated by cardiologists and 3513 (62.4%) were not. Mortality during the first 30 days after surgery was significantly lower in MINS patients who were evaluated by cardiologists compared with those who were not (5.8% vs 8.3%; HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.80; p<0.001 for all-cause mortality and 1.6% vs 2.0; HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96; p=0.03 for cardiovascular mortality).

We found that a mutation at amino acid position 90 in the H5N1 HA, outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD), could simultaneously induce changes in the RBD conformation to escape from nAb binding and alter the receptor preference through long-range regulation. This mutation was deemed a key event for interspecies transmission. It is likely a result of positive selection caused by antibodies, allowing the original invasion by new species-specific variants. A mutation at amino acid position 160 in the RBD only induced a change in receptor preference. This mutation was deemed a maintaining adaptation, which ensured that influenza virus variants would be able to infect new organisms of a different species successfully. The mutation is the result of adaptation caused by the receptor. Our results suggest that continuing occurrence of these two types of mutations made the variants persist in the new host species.

Approximately 90% of them experienced a reduction in their surgical caseload and patient contact. 38.7% stated that their institutions returned to providing diagnostic arthroscopies. 54.5% reported that they went back to performing anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR), 62.6% were performing arthroscopic meniscus procedures, and 55.8% had resumed performing shoulder arthroscopy. Only 31.9% of the surgeons were able to perform elective total joint arthroplasty. 60% of the participants stated that they had suffered substantial financial loss due to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A gradual resumption of orthopaedic health-care services was observed in May 2020. Typical orthopaedic surgical procedures like ACLR, shoulder arthroscopy and elective total joint arthroplasty were reported to be currently performed by 54%, 56% and 32% of surgeons, respectively. Despite signs of improvement, it appears that there is a prolonged curtailment of orthopaedic health-care at present in the middle of Europe.","output":"It is not business as usual for orthopaedic surgeons in May 2020C the Austrian-German-Swiss experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic impacts daily lives of families globally.

Energy dissipation is one of the most challenging issues due to the limited power supply at the sensor node. All routing protocols are large consumers of energy, as they represent the main source of energy cost through data exchange operation. Cluster-based hierarchical routing algorithms are known for their good performance in energy conservation during active data exchange in WSNs. The most common of this type of protocol is the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), which suffers from the problem of the pseudo-random selection of cluster head resulting in large power dissipation. This critical issue can be addressed by using an optimization algorithm to improve the LEACH cluster heads selection process, thus increasing the network lifespan. This paper proposes the LEACH-CHIO, a centralized cluster-based energy-aware protocol based on the Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimizer (CHIO) algorithm. CHIO is a newly emerging human-based optimization algorithm that is expected to achieve significant improvement in the LEACH cluster heads selection process. LEACH-CHIO is implemented and its performance is verified by simulating different wireless sensor network scenarios, which consist of a variable number of nodes ranging from 20 to 100. To evaluate the algorithm performances, three evaluation indicators have been examined, namely, power consumption, number of live nodes, and number of incoming packets. The simulation results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed protocol over basic LEACH protocol for the three indicators. ? 2022 Tech Science Press.

The mediation of hostCpathogen interactions by mucosal glycans, such as those added by FUT2, is poorly understood. We highlight, with specific examples, important mechanisms by which host glycans influence infection dynamics, including by: acting as pathogen receptors (or receptor-decoys), promoting microbial stability, altering the physical characteristics of mucus, and acting as immunological markers.

Systematic investigation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has been limited to urban environments and large academic centers. Limited data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is available for those who live in a rural community setting, leaving rural practitioners to extrapolate the epidemiology of COVID-19 to a nonhomogeneous population. Objective To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting. The secondary objective of this study was to describe the difference in infection rate and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in the same rural community. Methods A prospective convenience sample of community members and healthcare workers from the Kingman, Arizona area were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using a lateral flow immunoassay with the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) from September 28, 2020 to October 09, 2020. Upon recruitment, participants were asked to complete a demographic survey assessing socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two months. Following enrollment, a retrospective chart review was completed to determine the percentage of patients who had undergone previous SARS-CoV-RT-PCR testing. Results A total of 566 participants were included in the final analysis: 380 (67.1%) were women, 186 (32.9%) were men, a majority (458; 80.9%) self-identified as White, and 303 (53.5%) were employed as healthcare professionals. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 8.0% (45 of 566) across the sample and 9.9% (30 of 303) in healthcare workers. No statistical difference in seroprevalence was found between men and women, healthcare workers and other participants, amongst racial groups, by socioeconomic status, by comorbid conditions, or by education level. Among the participants, 108 (19.1%) underwent previous RT-PCR testing. Of the 45 patients who were antibody positive, 27 (60%) had received a previous RT-PCR test, with 20 (44.4%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Participants with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia (p<0.001), chest congestion (p=0.047), fever (p=0.007), and shortness of breath (p=0.002) within the past two months were more likely to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Only 8% of 566 participants in this rural community setting were found to have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. A large minority (18; 40%) of patients testing seropositive for SARs-CoV-2 had never received a prior test, suggesting that the actual rates of infection are higher than publicly available data suggest.

One potential mechanism for disparities in insomnia severity is perceived discrimination. This study tested discrimination as a mediator in the relationship between race and insomnia. METHODS: Participants were recruited from communities in the Detroit metropolitan area and were diagnosed with insomnia disorder using the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). The final sample included 1,458 individuals. Insomnia symptom severity was assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index and self-reported racial discrimination was evaluated using a single item. Racial discrimination was tested as a mediator in the relationship between race and insomnia symptom severity. Individuals were categroized as either White or a racial minority (i.e., non White individuals), with sensitivity analyses examining Black individuals and non-Black racial minority groups. RESULTS: Consistent with our hypothesis, racial discrimination was a significant mediator accounting for 57.3% of the relationship between race and insomnia symptom severity. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the indirect effect of racial discrimination was stronger in the non-Black racial minority group compared to Black individuals.

Few studies have evaluated the impact of testing for asymptomatic COVID-19 among large populations or whole cities using empirical data. No study to our knowledge has considered if such interventions result in or exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequalities. The aim of our study is to explore social and spatial inequalities in uptake and case-detection of rapid lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests (LFTs) offered to people without symptoms of COVID-19 in Liverpool between 6th November 2020 and 31st January 2021.MethodsLinked pseudonymised records for asymptomatic residents in Liverpool (UK) who received a LFT for COVID-19 between 6th November 2020 to 31st January 2021 were accessed using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action (CIPHA) data resource. Bayesian Hierarchical Poisson Besag, York, and Molli models were used to estimate ecological associations for uptake and positivity of testing.Results214 525 residents (43%) received a LFT identifying 5557 individuals as positive cases of COVID-19 (1.3%). Uptake was highest in November when there was military assistance. High uptake was observed again in the week preceding Christmas and was sustained into a national lockdown. Overall uptake and repeat testing were lower among males (e.g. 40% uptake over the whole period), Black Asian and other Minority Ethnic groups (e.g. 27% uptake for Mixed ethnicity) and in the most deprived areas (e.g. 32% uptake in most deprived areas). These population groups were also more likely to have received positive tests for COVID-19. Models demonstrated that uptake and repeat testing were lower in areas of higher deprivation, areas located further from test sites and areas containing populations less confident in the using Internet technologies. Positive tests were spatially clustered in deprived areas.ConclusionOur study provides the first substantial evidence on inequalities involved in large-scale asymptomatic rapid testing of populations for SARS-CoV-2. Large-scale voluntary asymptomatic community testing saw social, ethnic, and spatial inequalities in an inverse care pattern, but with an added digital exclusion factor. While test uptake was popular, there was a disconnect between the populations accessing testing and those experiencing harms relating to COVID-19.

How its signaling activity is fine-tuned in response to fluctuated Hh gradient is less known. Here, we identify protein phosphatase V (PpV), the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6, as a homeostatic regulator of Hh signaling. PpV is genetically upstream of widerborst (wdb), which encodes a regulatory subunit of PP2A that modulates high-level Hh signaling. We show that PpV negatively regulates Wdb stability independent of phosphatase activity of PpV, by competing with the catalytic subunit of PP2A for Wdb association, leading to Wdb ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, regulated Wdb stability, maintained through competition between two closely related phosphatases, ensures graded Hh signaling. Interestingly, PpV expression is regulated by Hh signaling. Therefore, PpV functions as a Hh activity sensor that regulates Wdb-mediated PP2A activity through feedback mechanisms to maintain Hh signaling homeostasis.","output":"Competition between two phosphatases fine-tunes Hedgehog signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 lockdown measures may have led to more, and increasingly severe, domestic abuse. This study examines police referrals to a specialist domestic abuse service in Wales, UK before and during the first lockdown.

RESULTS: There was little increase in the overall volume of police referrals during lockdown, but the proportion assessed as high risk increased, and children became the primary source of third-party referrals, with a higher proportion of reports made by other third parties as restrictions eased. Police reports for cases of Child/Adolescent to Parent Violence (C/APV) occurred almost exclusively during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in risk level despite less clear increase in volume may suggest unmet need, with victims less likely to seek help during lockdown other than for more severe instances. Increased reports by children suggest increased exposure of children to domestic abuse during school closure.

Indeed, social isolation stress is a major risk factor for several neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. Furthermore, social isolation has a negative impact on health and fitness. However, the neurobiological consequences of long-term chronic social isolation stress (LTCSIS) manifested during the adulthood of affected individuals are not fully understood. Our study assessed the impact of LTCSIS and social buffering (re-socialization) on the behavioural performance and social-affective brain-related proteins in diurnal, social, and long-lived Octodon degus (degus). Thereby, anxiety-like and social behaviour, and social recognition memory were assessed in male and female animals subjected to a variety of stress-inducing treatments applied from post-natal and post-weaning until their adulthood. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship among LTCSIS, Oxytocin levels (OXT), and OXT-Ca2+-signalling proteins in the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that LTCSIS induces anxiety like-behaviour and impairs social novelty preference whereas sociability is unaffected. On the other hand, re-socialization can revert both isolation-induced anxiety and social memory impairment. However, OXT and its signalling remained reduced in the abovementioned brain areas, suggesting that the observed changes in OXT-Ca2+ pathway proteins were permanent in male and female degus. Based on these findings, we conclude degus experience social stress differently, suggesting the existence of sex-related mechanisms to cope with specific adaptive challenges.","output":"\\"Live together, die alone\\": The effect of re-socialization on behavioural performance and social-affective brain-related proteins after a long-term chronic social isolation stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteolytic processing of the mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) replicase gene product, pp1a, results in polypeptides p28, p65, p50, and p240 in infected cells.

Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05).

The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements.

It also identified factors related to the knowledge and behavior regarding the same among older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted via a telephone survey involving 283 older adults living alone in S City from March to April 2020. Knowledge and behavior pertaining to face mask usage were measured using Hilda Ho's Face Mask Use Scale; reliability of the measurement was Kuder-Richardson formula-20 = .62, Cronbach's &#945; = .92. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, independent t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Older adults used one mask for 3.55 days on an average. The knowledge level was 9.97 ( 1.84) out of 12 and behavior level was 15.49 ( 1.55) out of 16. Level of education (? = - .31, p < .001), living region (? = .13, p = .017), personal income (? = .12, p = .041) significantly affected the face mask usage-related knowledge, and living region (? = .15, p = .010) significantly affected the face mask usage-related behavior. CONCLUSION: Older adults living alone are aware of the effects of using face masks. However, their mask usage is inappropriate, for example, the prolonged use of the same mask. Considering the low level of face mask usage-related knowledge, it is necessary to develop customized education programs and infectious disease prevention strategies for older adults possessing low educational levels living alone in urban-rural complex areas.","output":"[Face Mask Usage, Knowledge and Behavior of Face Mask Usage in Older Adults Living Alone in the COVID-19 Era]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 within any given country or community at the onset of the pandemic depended in part on the sheltering-in-place rate of its citizens The pandemic led us to revisit one of psychology's most fundamental and most basic questions in a high-stakes context: what determines human behavior?

Fifty facemasks were offered to participants in intervention tents, to be worn over four days, and none were offered to participants in control tents. All participants recorded facemask use and respiratory symptoms in health diaries. Nasal swabs were collected from the symptomatic for virus detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed by intention- to-treat and per-protocol. A total of 7687 adult participants from 318 tents were randomized: 3864 from 149 tents to the intervention group, and 3823 from 169 tents to the control group. Participants were aged 18 to 95 (median 34, mean 37) years, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.2. Overall, respiratory viruses were detected in 277 of 650 (43%) nasal/pharyngeal swabs collected from symptomatic pilgrims. Common viruses were rhinovirus (35.1%), influenza (4.5%) and parainfluenza (1.7%). In the intervention arm, respectively 954 (24.7%) and 1842 (47.7%) participants used facemasks daily and intermittently, while in the control arm, respectively 546 (14.3%) and 1334 (34.9%) used facemasks daily and intermittently.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional online investigation. METHODS: A questionnaire with 41 questions was designed based on the health belief model (HBM) distributed and collected online in 28 cities around China through multi-stage stratified sampling. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed with Cronbach's  coefficient and split-half reliability, and its validity was evaluated with exploratory factor analysis and content validity index. The structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to explore the relationship between the parents' health beliefs and their children's medication adherence. Subgroup analysis was conducted to study the differences between parents with different demographic characteristics (male and female, rural and urban). RESULTS: 573 questionnaires were included for analysis, with an effective rate of 62.97%. The Cronbach' coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.821 > 0.6, the split-half reliability was 0.651 > 0.6, the I-CVI of each dimension were >0.78, and the S-CVI/AVE (I-CVI average) was 0.95 > 0.9. The result of the questionnaire exploratory factor analysis met the standard. According to the SEM, self-efficacy ( = 0.177), perceived susceptibility ( = ?0.244), and perceived severity ( = 0.243) were direct influencing factors of children's medication adherence. In the subgroup analysis, the model established by each subgroup was consistent with the model established by the overall sample. The absolute values of females' perceived susceptibility, severity, and self-efficacy for their children's medication adherence path coefficients were higher than males'. CONCLUSION: Parents' perceived severity and self-efficacy may positively impact on their children's medication adherence, while parents' susceptibility to children's medication non-adherence may negatively impact on children's medication adherence. Objective constraints, perceived barriers, and benefits may in directly impact on children's medication adherence. Women's health beliefs appear to have a more significant impact on their children's medication adherence than men's. It may be an effective strategy to increase their children's medication adherence by improving parents' health beliefs. Medical staff should explain medication adherence knowledge to the parents of children, and inform the children of the possible consequences of non-adherence with medication, to improve the subjective perception of parents on the severity of children's non-adherence with medication, and improve parents' self-efficacy in rational medication for children.

Study design Experimental observational analytic study. Methods The FE of home-made masks and medical masks (as the control) were tested under laminar flow within a scaled air duct system by using nebulised NaCl aerosols sized 6C220nm. The size-resolved NaCl aerosol count was measured by a scanning mobility particle-size spectrometer. Home-made masks with an external plastic face shield also underwent a splash test. Additionally, the fibre structures of medical masks were studied under an electron microscope after treatment with either 75% alcohol or soap and water at 60C. Results The FE of the home-made masks at 6C200nm were non-inferior to that of medical masks (84.54% vs 86.94%, p = 0.102). Both types of masks achieved an FE of 90% at 6C89nm. A significantly higher FE was achieved when one piece of tissue paper was added adjacent to the inner surface of the medical mask than medical mask alone (6C200nm: 91.64% vs 84.75%, p < 0.0001; 6C89nm: 94.27% vs 90.54%, p < 0.0001; 90C200nm: 82.69% vs 73.81%, p < 0.0001). The plastic face shield prevented the home-made mask from fluid splash. The fibre structures of the external surface of medical masks were damaged after treatment with either 75% alcohol or soap and water at 60C. Conclusions The home-made masks in this study, which were made of one piece of tissue paper and two pieces of kitchen towels, layered from face to external, had an FE at 6C200nm non-inferior to that of medical mask materials, which had a certified FE of 95% at 3m. In the current COVID-19 pandemic with the shortage of medical masks, these home-made masks combined with an external plastic shield could be used as an alternative to medical masks for community mitigation. In addition, one piece of tissue paper could be placed adjacent to the inner surface of a medical mask to prolong effective lifespan of the medical mask.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundant antibody class present at these sites. It passively contributes to mucosal homeostasis via immune exclusion maintaining a tight balance between tolerating commensals and providing protection against pathogens. Once pathogens have succeeded in invading the epithelial barriers, IgA has an active role in host-pathogen defense by activating myeloid cells through divers receptors, including its Fc receptor, FcRI (CD89). To evade elimination, several pathogens secrete proteins that interfere with either IgA neutralization or FcRI-mediated immune responses, emphasizing the importance of IgA-FcRI interactions in preventing infection. Depending on the IgA form, either anti- or pro-inflammatory responses can be induced. Moreover, the presence of excessive IgA immune complexes can result in continuous FcRI-mediated activation of myeloid cells, potentially leading to severe tissue damage. On the one hand, enhancing pathogen-specific mucosal and systemic IgA by vaccination may increase protective immunity against infectious diseases. On the other hand, interfering with the IgA-FcRI axis by monovalent targeting or blocking FcRI may resolve IgA-induced inflammation and tissue damage.

METHODS: We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 61 problem drinkers to characterize the functional connectivity of the hypothalamus and ventral striatum (VS) in relation to PB. We specifically examined whether the connectivities of the hypothalamus and VS were differentially influenced by PB to produce contrasting effects on alcohol use. Finally, we evaluated how individual differences in social support modulate the inter-relationships of social isolation, neural connectivity, and the severity of problem drinking. RESULTS: Whole-brain multiple regressions show a positive relationship between PB and hypothalamic connectivity with the hippocampus and an inverse pattern for VS connectivity with the middle frontal gyrus. Difference in strength between the 2 connectivities predicted the severity of problem drinking, suggesting an imbalance involving elevated hypothalamic and diminished prefrontal cortical modulation in socially isolated problem drinkers. A path analysis further revealed that the lack of social support was associated with a bias toward low prefrontal connectivity, which in turn increased PB and facilitated problem drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Altered hypothalamus and VS connectivity may underlie problem drinking induced by social isolation. The current findings also highlight the important role of social support as a potential protective factor against alcohol misuse.","output":"The Neural Processes Interlinking Social Isolation, Social Support, and Problem Alcohol Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: One of the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the risk of shortages in Blood Centres. OBJECTIVES: To verify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the blood donor's attendance and production of blood components in Fundao Hemominas, a Brazilian public institution was formed by several Blood Centres. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from January to June 2020. Data collected were compared to a historical series from 2016 to 2019. RESULTS: The study showed a reduction in the attendance of blood donors, whole blood collections and blood component production from March 2020, when the first case of COVID-19 was notified in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The results evidenced that Hemominas Blood Centres were affected in a very distinct way by the pandemic with a general mean reduction around 17% in attendance of blood donors and in production of blood components in the period of March to June. On the other hand, the return of blood donors rate increased. CONCLUSION: The reduction in blood donation during the pandemic period was significant, despite the measures adopted. Still, the recruitment of return donors appears to be an important measure to be considered to decrease the pandemic's effect on blood stocks.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 in the attendance of blood donors and production on a Brazilian Blood Centres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses first garnered widespread attention in 2002 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from bats in China and rapidly spread in human populations. Since then, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged and still actively infects humans. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the resulting disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID19) have rapidly and catastrophically spread and highlighted significant limitations to our ability to control and treat infection. Thus, a basic understanding of entry and replication mechanisms of coronaviruses is necessary to rationally evaluate potential antivirals. Here, we show that polyamines, small metabolites synthesized in human cells, facilitate coronavirus replication and the depletion of polyamines with FDA-approved molecules significantly reduces coronavirus replication. We find that diverse coronaviruses, including endemic and epidemic coronaviruses, exhibit reduced attachment and entry into polyamine-depleted cells. We further demonstrate that several molecules targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway are antiviral in vitro. In sum, our data suggest that polyamines are critical to coronavirus replication and represent a highly promising drug target in the current and any future coronavirus outbreaks.","output":"Targeting Polyamines Inhibits Coronavirus Infection by Reducing Cellular Attachment and Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sejak teridentifikasi Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pada Desember 2019 sudah banyak laporan infeksi pada tenaga kesehatan.

Kata kunci : Pencegahan dan pengendalian infeksi, Tenaga kesehatan, COVID-19 There have been numerous reports of infections in health workers after the discovery of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019. Infection transmission, which is common in the health-care setting, is extremely dangerous for health-care workers. As a result, it is vital to take efforts to prevent and control COVID-19 infection in health services so that health workers may continue to deliver health services while being safe. The goal of this paper is to examine the literature on infection prevention and control (PPI) for health care workers in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. Scientific literature and library studies are used to acquire data for this investigation. Themes from the literature study subject on data analysis methods. The findings of this literacy research revealed five significant themes. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the results demonstrated that personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, knowledge, workload, and the structure of the Infection Prevention and Control Committee could be used to prevent and control infection in health workers. The importance of Infection Prevention and Control during the COVID-19 pandemic provides a real opportunity for health workers to minimize exposure to the COVID-19 virus and PPI management support helps strengthen infection prevention activities by designing control mechanisms and taking corrective actions regarding non-compliant health workers.

This mixed-methods study examines adherence to and enforcement of NPIs implemented to curb COVID-19 in Nigeria, Rwanda, and Zambia, leading up to the 10,000 th case of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in each country. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the relationship between levels and changes of NPIs over time and changes in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Methods: This mixed-methods analysis utilized semi-structured interviews and a quantitative dataset constructed using multiple open data sources, including the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. To understand potential barriers and facilitators in implementing and enforcing NPIs qualitative data were collected from those involved in the COVID-19 response and analyzed using NVivo. Quantitative results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, plots, ANOVA, and post hoc Tukey. Results: Individual indicator scores varied with the COVID-19 response in all three countries. Nigeria had sustained levels of strict measures for containment and closure NPIs, while in Rwanda there was substantial variation in NPI score as it transitioned through the different case windows for the same measures. Zambia implemented moderate stringency throughout the pandemic using gathering restrictions and business/school closure measures but maintained low levels of strictness for other containment and closure measures. Rwanda had far more consistent and stringent measures compared to Nigeria and Zambia. Rwandas success in implementing COVID-related measures was partly due to strong enforcement and having a population that generally obeys its government. Conclusion: Various forces either facilitated or hindered adherence and compliance to COVID-19 control measures. This research highlights important lessons, including the need to engage communities early and create buy-in, as well as the need for preparation to ensure that response efforts are proactive rather than reactive when faced with an emergency.","output":"Adherence to and enforcement of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for COVID-19 prevention in Nigeria, Rwanda, and Zambia: A mixed-methods analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the mol-ecular structure of the title compound, C(20)H(21)N(3)O(7), the quinoline ring system is slightly bent, with a dihedral angle between the phenyl and the pyridine rings of 3.47 (7).

Following a viral infection, the host may initiate complex antiviral immune responses to antagonize viral invasion and replication. However, proinflammatory antiviral immune responses pose a great threat to the host if not properly held in check. Interleukin (IL)-17 is a pleiotropic cytokine participating in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including tissue integrity maintenance, cancer progression, autoimmune disease development and, more intriguingly, infectious diseases. Abundant evidence suggests that while IL-17 plays a crucial role in enhancing effective antiviral immune responses, it may also promote and exacerbate virus-induced illnesses. Accumulated experimental and clinical evidence has broadened our understanding of the seemingly paradoxical role of IL-17 in viral infections and suggests that IL-17-targeted immunotherapy may be a promising therapeutic option.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 25 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID - 19 as well as 22 healthy volunteer. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum TWEAK, LTE4, and prostaglandin F2? (PGF2?) levels were determined. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2? levels were higher in the group of SARS - CoV - 2 infection without lung involvement. In the group of SARS - CoV - 2 infection with lung involvement, age, fibrinogen, sedimentation, C - reactive protein and ferritin, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2? levels were higher, and lymphocyte levels were lower compared with the asymptomatic group. CONCLUSIONS: In the study, TWEAK and LTE4 levels increased in cases with COVID -19.

Playing wind instruments can produce condensation water, droplets of saliva, and aerosol particles, which hover and convectional spread in the environmental air and can be potentially infectious. The aim of this study is to investigate the primary impulse dispersion of aerosols during playing different wind instruments in comparison to breathing and speaking. Nine professional musicians (3 trumpeters, 3 cross flutists and 3 clarinetists) of the Bavarian Symphony Orchestra performed the main theme of Ludwig van Beethoven' 9th symphony, 4th movement in different pitches and loudness. Thereby, the inhaled air volume was marked with small aerosol particles produced with a commercial e-cigarette. The expelled aerosol cloud was recorded by cameras from different perspectives. Afterwards, the dimensions and dynamics of the aerosol cloud was measured by segmenting the video footage at every time point. Overall, the flutes produced the largest dispersion at the end of task of up to maximum distances of 1.88 m in front direction. Thereby it was observed an expulsion of aerosol in different directions: upwards and downwards at the mouthpiece, at the end of the instrument and along the flute at the key plane. In comparison, the maximum impulse dispersion generated by the trumpets and clarinets were lower in frontal and lateral direction (1.2 m and 1.0 m in front- direction). The expulsion to the sides was also lower. Consequently, a distance of 3 m to the front and to the sides of 2 m for the flutes in an orchestral formation is proposed, for trumpets and clarinets a safety distance of 2 m to the front and 1.5 m between instrumentalists are recommendable.","output":"Impulse dispersion of aerosols during playing wind instruments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide.

Nevertheless, the early detection of muscle wasting is difficult. Therefore, we investigated the reliability and accuracy of ultrasonography to evaluate skeletal muscle wasting in critically ill children and adults. METHODS This prospective observational study enrolled 30 sedated critically ill children and 14 critically ill adults. Two independent investigators made 210 ultrasonographical assessments of muscle thigh thickness. Inter- and intraobserver reliability and cutoff levels were calculated as a function of muscle thickness and the expected reduction in muscle size (predefined at 20% and 30%). RESULTS Mean  SD muscle thickness was 1.67  0.55 cm in the pediatric and 2.10  0.85 cm in the adult population. The median absolute interobserver variability was 0.07 cm (interquartile range [IQR], 0.04-0.20 cm) in the pediatric population and 0.05 cm (IQR, 0.03-0.09 cm) in the adult population. However, the absolute intraobserver accuracy had a 95% confidence interval of 0.43 cm in children and 0.22 cm in adults. Only a 30% decrease (0.50 cm) in muscle thickness can be detected in critically ill children. CONCLUSION Although the interobserver variability is acceptable in the pediatric population, the intraobserver variability is too large with respect to the expected reduction in muscle thickness.

Forehead sensors using reflectance technology might be useful in these circumstances. We hypothesized that reflectance SpO(2) would be more accurate than finger SpO(2) in patients with severe shock. METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted in an intensive care unit of a university hospital of patients in shock who were treated with high norepinephrine and/or epinephrine doses (0.1 g kg(-1) min(-1)). When blood gas determinations were requested, forehead SpO(2) and finger SpO(2) values were simultaneous recorded. Agreement between SpO(2) measurements with arterial saturation (SaO(2)), obtained by blood analysis with a co-oximeter, was assessed using the Bland-Altman method. The number of outliers, defined by the formula SaO(2) - SpO(2) > 3 %, indicated the proportion of measurements considered to be clinically unacceptable. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study. With the forehead sensor no reading failure occurred, and 140 paired data sets (forehead SpO(2) vs. SaO(2)) were obtained. Bias and precision were +1.0 and +2.5 %, respectively, and the limits of agreement ranged from -4.0 to 6.0 %. The finger sensor failed to give a value in four cases, thus providing 136 paired data sets (finger SpO(2) vs. SaO(2)) for analysis.

To understand the influence of different test strategies, we implemented them on realistic random social networks with a COVID-19-like epidemic in progression. Specifically, we compared the performance of two tests mimicking the characteristics of popular tests implemented for COVID-19 detection. We present procedures and intuitive understanding to ascertain the optimum combination of the tests to minimize the peak infection as well as total quarantine days when the number of tests is constrained by a fixed total budget.","output":"Quality-Quantity Trade-offs in Tests for Management of COVID-19-like Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study analyses the levels of distress and related psychosocial factors among cancer patients during the Spanish lockdown due to COVID-19. METHODS A total of 2,779 cancer patients took part in an observational and lateral study carried out between April 16, 2020 and April 25, 2020. An online questionnaire was distributed including distress-related variables, demographic variables, clinical variables about their oncological condition, socioeconomic variables and variables related to information management and social communication. Distress was measured according to the Kessler (K-6) scale, and its relationship with the remaining variables was analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS 33.5% of the patients yielded levels of clinical distress during lockdown. Younger patients and women yielded significantly higher levels of distress. High distress levels were generally associated with the following factors: trust in medical institutions; deterioration of the household's financial conditions; and media management of the information about the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The lockdown triggered by COVID-19 increased distress among cancer patients, and this can be significantly related to a number of variables. Identifying distress, and said factors, at an early stage can help to develop mitigation strategies. Similarly, early detection can help to improve the way information is shared with patients, offer them support and resources and direct them to psychosocial services, increasing the patient's ability to return to normal after COVID-19.","output":"Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown on Spanish oncological patients: a quantitative approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic forced the Association of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Program Directors to change the 2020 annual conference to a virtual format with relatively short notice.

The disease has worldwide distribution with significant economic impact. In Serbia, there is neither an Aujeszkys disease eradication nor national vaccination programme of domestic pigs. Since clinical symptoms of Aujeszkys disease are not specific, it is important to establish a link between clinical signs and presence of ADV active infection in wild boars. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of active infection within wild boar showing signs of ADV and also to examine relationship between isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar. Having in mind that virus has not been previously isolated from wild boars in Serbia, we report the first isolation of Suid Herpesvirus 1 from this species in Serbia. RESULTS: Tissue and serum samples from 40 wild boars from eastern Serbia were examined for evidence of Aujeszkys disease (AD). Suid Herpesvirus 1 (SHV1), the cause of AD was isolated on PK15 cell line from three tissue samples, inducing cytopathic effect (CPE) with syncytia forming, and viral genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in eight samples. Genetic analysis of us4, us9 and ul49.5 partial sequences showed high homology between ADV isolates from wild boars and between isolates from wild boars and domestic animals. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected by virus neutralisation test (VNT) in sera from four out of eight PCR positive wild boars suggesting recent infection in those animals.

Methods: A total of 320 college students were assessed twice at 6- month intervals with the Health Risk Perception Scale (HRPS) and Questionnaire of Life Consciousness for College Students (QLCCS). The subjects were divided into middle and high-risk areas group (n = 165) and low-risk areas group (n = 131) according to the COVID-19 epidemic risk level of their location. A structural equation model was established to analyze the cross-lag effect of HRPS score and QLCCS score, and the group difference test was conducted to reveal the inter-group difference. Results: The baseline HRPS scores were lower in the middle and highrisk areas group than in the low-risk areas group (P < 0. 05) . After 6 months, the HRPS scores decreased, and the QLCCS scores increased in both groups (Ps < 0. 05). In the cross-lagged model analysis, the baseline HRPS scores positively associated with the QLCCS scores 6 months later ( = 0. 22), while the baseline QLCCS scores positively associated with the HRPS scores 6 months later ( = 0. 15).

In this COVID pandemic, the decision to continue elective cancer surgeries, and their subsequent outcomes, are sparsely reported from hotspots. METHODS: A prospective database of the Department of Surgical Oncology was analysed from March 23rd to April 30th, 2020. FINDINGS: Four hundred ninety-four elective surgeries were performed (377 untested and 117 tested for Covid 19 before surgery). Median age was 48 years with 13% (n = 64) above the age of 60 years. Sixty-eight percent patients were American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade I. As per surgical complexity grading, 71 (144%) cases were lower grade (I-III) and 423 (85.6%) were higher grade complex surgeries (IV - VI).Clavien-Dindo &#8805; grade III complications were 5.6% (n = 28) and there were no postoperative deaths. Patients >60 years documented 9.3% major complications compared to 5.2% in <60 years (P = 0.169). The median hospital stay was 1 to 9 days across specialties.Postoperatively, 26 patients were tested for COVID 19 and 6 tested positive. They all had higher grade surgeries but none required escalated or intensive care treatment related to COVID infection. INTERPRETATION: A combination of scientific and administrative rationale contributed to favorable outcomes after major elective cancer surgeries. These results support the continuation of elective major cancer surgery in regions with Covid 19 trends similar to India.","output":"Outcomes of Elective Major Cancer Surgery During COVID 19 at Tata Memorial Centre: Implications for Cancer Care Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited information is available regarding reversal of gastric bypass. While reversal will lead to weight regain and return of comorbid conditions, procedure reversal is sometimes necessary due to complications. The decision to reverse versus revise is difficult; currently, there are no established guidelines. The objective was to review one center's experience with reversals of gastric bypass and jejunoileal bypass procedures and identify potential indications as well as technical feasibility and short-term outcomes. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database from 1999 to 2010 was conducted; 12 patients who underwent reversal of non-banding bariatric procedures were included. There was no major perioperative morbidity in elective patients; one patient whose reversal was part of a second-look operation had massive intestinal necrosis. There was one (8.3 %) non-procedure-related postoperative death. No leaks were identified in any of the reversals. Leak rates were compared with other revisional procedures such as reversals, revisions, and conversions, with no statistical significance regarding leak rates between all three groups; however, revisions and conversions were performed via open or laparoscopic approach, while reversals were performed exclusively via open approach. Reversals of bariatric (non-banding) procedures, either combined or purely malabsorptive, are technically challenging. Indications remain poorly defined. In our experience, short gut syndrome, renal failure, marginal ulceration, and malnutrition were the most common indications for reversal, differing from previously published data. Indications can depend on patient and surgeon preferences, but primarily on surgeon experience and type of complications. Based on this initial experience, these operations can be performed using the open approach with good outcomes.","output":"Reasons and operative outcomes after reversal of gastric bypass and jejunoileal bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data Availability: The individual level datasets generated or analyzed during the current study do not fulfill the requirements for open data access: 1) The SHCS informed consent states that sharing data outside the SHCS network is only permitted for specific studies on HIV infection and its complications, and to researchers who have signed an agreement detailing the use of the data and biological samples;and 2) the data is too dense and comprehensive to preserve patient privacy in persons living with HIV According to the Swiss law, data cannot be shared if data subjects have not agreed or data is too sensitive to share Abbreviations: ART, antiretroviral therapy;BCG, bacillus CalmetteCGurin;CI, confidence interval;HET, heterosexual;IDU, intravenous drug user;IGRA, Interferon-gamma Release Assay;LTBI, latent tuberculosis infection;MSM, men who have sex with men;MTB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis;OI, opportunistic infection;OR, odds ratio;SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2;SHCS, Swiss HIV Cohort Study;SPVL, set point viral load;TB, tuberculosis;TST, tuberculin skin test Background Models suggest that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) might have emerged as a human pathogen around 400,000 years ago [1] Exposure of pathogen-free laboratory mice to naturally occurring, nonlethal mouse pathogens, for example, has profound effects on the composition of the immune system and confers protection against unrelated pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes [7]","output":"Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection is associated with reduced HIV viral load and lower risk for opportunistic infections in people living with HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the kinetic characteristics and cycle stability of Fe-complex/TiO2 in the process of degradation of phenolic pollutants and reduction of heavy metal Cr(VI) were studied systematically.

Compared with the single degradation, the efficiency of synergistic degradation/reduction had been improved and the degradation/reduction rate had been obviously accelerated.

Second, to Fe-HQS/TiO2 nanoparticle or Fe-HQS/TiO2 nanotube (HQS (8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid)), the synergistic degradation/reduction (2,4-dichlorophenol/Cr(VI)) efficiencies were always greater than those of a single degradation/reduction and the time was greatly reduced. All the results indicated that there were interactions between Cr(VI) and phenol or 2,4-dichlorophenol in the photocatalytic process.

OBJECTIVES: This study estimated the burden of both types of pathogens among adults seeking care for an AECOPD during two consecutive winter seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Patients 50 years or older who consulted within 10 days of AECOPD onset were eligible. Clinical data were collected on a standardized questionnaire, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), paired sera, and non-induced sputum were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PRC) assays were used to identify viral, atypical and bacterial pathogens in NPA specimen. RESULTS: Overall, 108 patients with AECOPD were included, 88% of patients were admitted and 2 patients (2%) received intensive care. A third of patients (31%) had evidence of a viral infection, 9% with influenza A, 7% RSV and 7% with PIV-3. One patient was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 49% of patients with available sputum, most frequently Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. Among virus-infected patients, 14 (58%) also had bacteria in their sputum, but co-infected patients did not present with different symptoms than patients with single infections. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that influenza and RSV are frequent contributors of AECOPD, and that coinfection with bacteria does not appear to be more severe among virus-infected patients. Clinicians should be aware that AECOPD may be frequently triggered by viruses, and may consider antivirals and proper infection control measures in appropriate epidemiological setting.","output":"Importance of viral and bacterial infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to use low- and non-radiating chest imaging techniques on a large scale in the context of an infectious disease, which has never been done before Previously, low-dose techniques were rarely used for infectious diseases, despite the recognised danger of ionising radiation Method: To evaluate the role of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and lung ultrasound (LUS) in managing COVID-19 pneumonia, we performed a review of the literature including our cases Results: Chest LDCT is now performed routinely when diagnosing and assessing the severity of COVID-19, allowing patients to be rapidly triaged The extent of lung involvement assessed by LDCT is accurate in terms of predicting poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19-infected patients Infectious disease specialists are less familiar with LUS, but this technique is also of great interest for a rapid diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 and is effective at assessing patient prognosis Conclusions: COVID-19 is currently accelerating the transition to low-dose and no-dose imaging techniques to explore infectious pneumonia and their long-term consequences","output":"Low Dose Chest CT and Lung Ultrasound for the Diagnosis and Management of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer audition (CA) has experienced a fast development in the past decades by leveraging advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques.

On the other hand, relevant studies in exploring the capacity of CA are extremely lacking and underestimated. To this end, we propose a novel multitask speech corpus for COVID-19 research usage. We collected 51 confirmed COVID-19 patients' in-the-wild speech data in Wuhan city, China. We define three main tasks in this corpus, i.e., three-category classification tasks for evaluating the physical and/or mental status of patients, i.e., sleep quality, fatigue, and anxiety. The benchmarks are given by using both classic machine learning methods and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. We believe this study and corpus cannot only facilitate the ongoing research on using data science to fight against COVID-19, but also the monitoring of contagious diseases for general purpose.","output":"Computer Audition for Fighting the SARS-CoV-2 Corona Crisis-Introducing the Multitask Speech Corpus for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is known to have a wide spectrum of effects on the respiratory, cardiac, neurological, hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, ocular and urological systems, but there is very little information on its effects on the human ovary.

A 27-year-old female patient presented with amenorrhea. She had fever on the second day of the menstrual cycle, and her cycle had been interrupted on the same day. The patient had a sub-febrile temperature, myalgia, fatigue, sweating, loss of appetite, and mild sleep disorder. Based on clinical, laboratory, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) data of a nasopharyngeal swab sample, she had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Till now there are limited publications on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ovaries. In particular, the potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on fertility are unclear. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients need to be followed up for a long time, and clinicians need to pay attention to menstrual disturbances, especially in young female patients.

Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) generates antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Coding SNPs in ERAP1 have been associated with predisposition to inflammatory rheumatic disease and shown to affect functional properties of the enzyme, but the interplay between combinations of these SNPs as they exist in allotypes has not been thoroughly explored. We used phased genotype data to estimate ERAP1 allotype frequency in 2504 individuals across five major human populations, generated highly pure recombinant enzymes corresponding to the ten most common ERAP1 allotypes, and systematically characterized their in vitro enzymatic properties. We find that ERAP1 allotypes possess a wide range of enzymatic activities, up to 60-fold, whose ranking is substrate dependent. Strikingly, allotype 10, previously associated with Beh?ets disease, is consistently a low-activity outlier, suggesting that a significant percentage of individuals carry a subactive ERAP1 gene. Enzymatic analysis revealed that ERAP1 allotypes can differ in both catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity, differences that can change intermediate accumulation in multistep trimming reactions. Alterations in efficacy of an allosteric inhibitor that targets the regulatory site suggest that allotypic variation influences the communication between the regulatory and the active site. Our work defines the wide landscape of ERAP1 activity in human populations and demonstrates how common allotypes can induce substrate-dependent variability in antigen processing, thus contributing, in synergy with major histocompatibility complex haplotypes, to immune response variability and predisposition to chronic inflammatory conditions.","output":"Common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 have substrate-dependent and highly variable enzymatic properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The first case and first death of COVID-19 in Turkey were officially announced on March 10 and March 15, 2020, respectively Ministry of Health (MoH) of Turkey prepared a clinical guideline and published the guideline in March 2020 for guiding the clinicians for COVID-19 patients management across the country Social Security Institution (SGK) increased the reimbursement coverage and prices for COVID-19 patients management This study aimed to calculate the cost of management of patients infected with COVID-19 in Turkey Methods: An expert opinion form was prepared depending on the MoH of Turkeys COVID-19 Treatment Guideline The form has been answered by 5 physicians from Istanbul, Ankara, and Kocaeli cities, where the majority of COVID-19 patients were diagnosed The cost of management of COVID-19 patients has been calculated depending on MoHs guideline and analysis of expert opinion forms The updated SGK reimbursement list prices were used to calculate the cost Results: It was calculated that 17 40% of COVID-19 patients required hospitalization, 7 4% of hospitalized patients required intensive care unit stay in Turkey depending on the expert opinion form The cost of outpatient, inpatient, and intensive care unit stay depending on expert opinion per patient were calculated as 367,04, 16,534 09, and 66,278 23, respectively The same costs depending on the MoH's guideline per patient were calculated as 198,64, 19 133,98, and 47 872,08 respectively Conclusions: The analysis calculated per patient treatment cost of COVID-19 patients in Turkey depending on the Ministry of Health of Turkeys COVID-19 treatment guideline and expert opinions It is seen that real cost which was represented by experts may be higher than MoHs guideline offers, except inpatient These findings should be re-evaluated including real-life data with further analysis","output":"PIN56 Cost of COVID-19 Patients Treatment in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that participates in the progression of numerous diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dysregulated in diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the role of lncRNAs in DR-induced ferroptosis is unclear.

The intracellular contents of glutathione, malondialdehyde, and ferrous ions were analyzed using the corresponding kits. The MTT assay was performed to measure the cell survival rate, and cell death was determined using propidium iodide and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining assays. Western blotting was conducted to detect the protein levels of GPX4, SLC7A11, and TFR1.

Lengthy waiting times for patients will inevitably affect their mood and reduce satisfaction. For patients who are in urgent need of hospitalization, delayed admission often leads to exacerbation of the patient's condition and may threaten the patient's life. We gathered patients' information about outpatient visits and hospital admissions in the Nephrology Department of a large tertiary hospital in western China from January 1st, 2014, to December 31st, 2016, and we used big data-enabled analysis methods, including univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression models, to explore the factors affecting waiting time.

Control optimality was checked by Lagrangian functions. Numerical simulations and bifurcation analyses were carried out. The study concludes that the COVID-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a significant level three weeks after applying all the control strategies together.

Methods: We report two cases of false negative COHb in patients with CO poisoning and one case of false positive COHb in a patient without CO poisoning. Results: In the first case, a 20-year-old male developed headache, confusion, and near-syncope while operating a gasoline-powered pressure washer in an enclosed space. In the emergency department (ED), his COHb was 1.8%, but this level was disregarded, and he was referred for hyperbaric oxygen. His COHb just before hyperbaric oxygen was 4.1%, and later analysis of his blood collected at ED arrival revealed a COHb of 20.1%. The referral ED blood gas machine calibration and controls were within specification. In the second case, a 45-year-old male presented with several others to the ED with symptoms of CO poisoning after exposure at a conference. All others had elevated COHb levels, but his COHb was 2%. He was discharged but returned shortly with continued symptoms and requested his COHb be repeated. The repeat COHb was 17% (84 minutes after the first). After three hours of oxygen, his COHb was 7%. In the final case, an 83-year-old non-smoking male presented to an ED with breathlessness and tachypnea and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. His COHb was 7.1%, but he reported living in an all-electric home. Another adult who lived with him and rode with him to the ED was asymptomatic and had a COHb of 3%.

While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs The wet or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the dry or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis The aetiological diagnosis of FIP ante-mortem may be difficult, if not impossible. The background of the cat, its history, the clinical signs, laboratory changes, antibody titres and effusion analysis should all be used to help in decision-making about further diagnostic procedures. At the time of writing, there is no non-invasive confirmatory test available for cats without effusion. Disease management In most cases FIP is fatal. Supportive treatment is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory and detrimental immune response. However, there are no controlled studies to prove any beneficial effect of corticosteroids. Vaccination recommendations At present, only one (intranasal) FIP vaccine is available, which is considered as being non-core.

We performed title, abstract, and full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random effects model and evaluated the overall quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS We identified three eligible RCTs (n = 5203) and 21 observational studies (n = 11,855). The three RCTs and four observational studies were at low risk of bias. In RCTs (mean follow-up, 30 days), thromboembolic events occurred in 0.18% of patients receiving DOACs, as compared with 0.55% receiving VKAs (relative risk [RR] 0.40, 95% CI [0.13, 1.24], moderate quality). Major bleeding occurred in 0.42% of patients receiving DOACs as compared with 0.64% receiving VKAs (RR 0.62, 95% CI [0.28, 1.35], moderate quality), and death occurred in 0.28% of patients receiving DOACs as compared with 0.38% receiving VKAs (RR 0.70, 95% CI [0.23, 2.10], low quality).

AIM: We aimed to determine the longitudinal course of clinical symptoms in non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Berlin, Germany. METHODS: Between March and May 2020, 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases in home isolation notified in Berlin, Germany, were sampled using total population sampling. Data on 25 symptoms were collected during telephone consultations (a maximum of four consultations) with each patient. We collected information on prevalence and duration of symptoms for each day of the first 2 weeks after symptom onset and for day 30 and 60 after symptom onset. RESULTS: Median age was 35 years (range 18C74), 57% (58/102) were female, and 37% (38/102) reported having comorbidities. During the first 2 weeks, most common symptoms were malaise (94%, 92/98), headache (71%, 70/98), and rhinitis (69%, 68/98). Malaise was present for a median of 11 days (IQR 7C14 days) with 35% (34/98) of cases still reporting malaise on day 14. Headache and muscle pain mostly occurred during the first week, whereas dysosmia and dysgeusia mostly occurred during the second week.

This limits the understanding of the underlying biology of depression and raises questions about the transferability of findings between populations. Objective To investigate the genetics of depression among individuals of East Asian and European descent living in different geographic locations, and with different outcome definitions for depression. Design, Setting, and Participants Genome-wide association analyses followed by meta-analysis, which included data from 9 cohort and case-control data sets comprising individuals with depression and control individuals of East Asian descent. This study was conducted between January 2019 and May 2021. Exposures Associations of genetic variants with depression risk were assessed using generalized linear mixed models and logistic regression. The results were combined across studies using fixed-effects meta-analyses. These were subsequently also meta-analyzed with the largest published GWAS for depression among individuals of European descent. Additional meta-analyses were carried out separately by outcome definition (clinical depression vs symptom-based depression) and region (East Asian countries vs Western countries) for East Asian ancestry cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures Depression status was defined based on health records and self-report questionnaires. Results There were a total of 194 548 study participants (approximate mean age, 51.3 years; 62.8% women). Participants included 15 771 individuals with depression and 178 777 control individuals of East Asian descent. Five novel associations were identified, including 1 in the meta-analysis for broad depression among those of East Asian descent: rs4656484 ( = -0.018, SE = 0.003, P = 4.43x10-8) at 1q24.1. Another locus at 7p21.2 was associated in a meta-analysis restricted to geographically East Asian studies ( = 0.028, SE = 0.005, P = 6.48x10-9 for rs10240457). The lead variants of these 2 novel loci were not associated with depression risk in European ancestry cohorts ( = -0.003, SE = 0.005, P = .53 for rs4656484 and  = -0.005, SE = 0.004, P = .28 for rs10240457). Only 11% of depression loci previously identified in individuals of European descent reached nominal significance levels in the individuals of East Asian descent. The transancestry genetic correlation between cohorts of East Asian and European descent for clinical depression was r = 0.413 (SE = 0.159). Clinical depression risk was negatively genetically correlated with body mass index in individuals of East Asian descent (r = -0.212, SE = 0.084), contrary to findings for individuals of European descent.

Three different routes can lead to inflammasome activation: a canonical two-step, a non-canonical Caspase-4/5- and Gasdermin D-dependent, and an alternative Caspase-8-mediated pathway. Natriuretic Peptides (NPs), Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), binding to Natriuretic Peptide Receptor-1 (NPR-1), signal by increasing cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) levels that, in turn, stimulate cGMP-dependent protein kinase-I (PKG-I). We previously demonstrated that, by counteracting inflammasome activation, NPs inhibit IL-1 secretion. Here we aimed to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying NPs effects on THP-1 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + ATP. Involvement of cGMP and PKG-I were assessed pre-treating THP-1 cells with the membrane-permeable analogue, 8-Br-cGMP, and the specific inhibitor KT-5823, respectively. We found that NPs, by activating NPR-1/cGMP/PKG-I axis, lead to phosphorylation of NLRP3 at Ser295 and to inflammasome platform disassembly. Moreover, by increasing intracellular cGMP levels and activating phosphodiesterases, NPs interfere with both Gasdermin D and Caspase-8 cleavage, indicating that they disturb non-canonical and alternative routes of inflammasome activation.

Humans possess two TOPIIA paralogue genes (TOP2A and TOP2B) with high sequence and structural similarity but distinct cellular functions. Despite their functional and clinical relevance, the evolutionary history of TOPIIA is still poorly understood. Here we show that TOPIIA is highly conserved in Metazoa. We also found that TOPIIA paralogues from jawed and jawless vertebrates had different origins related with tetraploidization events. After duplication, TOP2B evolved under a stronger purifying selection than TOP2A, perhaps promoted by the more specialized role of TOP2B in postmitotic cells. We also detected genetic signatures of positive selection in the highly variable C-terminal domain (CTD), possibly associated with adaptation to cellular interactions. By comparing TOPIIA from modern and archaic humans, we found two amino acid substitutions in the TOP2A CTD, suggesting that TOP2A may have contributed to the evolution of present-day humans, as proposed for other cell cycle-related genes. Finally, we identified six residues conferring resistance to chemotherapy differing between TOP2A and TOP2B. These six residues could be targets for the development of TOP2A-specific inhibitors that would avoid the side effects caused by inhibiting TOP2B.

Specifically, some general chemical and physical properties of alginate and different types of alginate-based delivery systems are discussed, and various kinds of alginate-based carriers are introduced. Finally, recent innovative strategies to functionalize alginate-based vehicles for cancer targeting are described to highlight research towards the optimization of alginate.","output":"Alginate-Based Platforms for Cancer-Targeted Drug Delivery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has improved tremendously in recent years due to the introduction of new drug therapies but remains complex in terms of non-pharmaceutical issues. In order to determine the direction of scientific progress by characterizing the current spectrum of ongoing clinical research in JIA, we analyzed all ongoing studies in the field of JIAregistered in clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.euconcerning sponsoring, enrollment, duration, localization, and particularly objectives. The close of the database was 7 January 2021. After identifying double-registered studies, n = 72 went into further analysis. Of these, 61.1% were academia-sponsored and 37.5% were sponsored by the pharma industry. The majority of the studies was of the interventional type (77.8%), while others (22.2%) were observational. The median planned enrollments were 100 participants (interventional studies) and 175 participants (observational studies), respectively. The duration differed remarkably from one month to more than 15 years, with a median of 42.5 months. A total of 61.1% of studies were located in a single country, and 38.9% were in several. Europe and North America clearly dominated the study localizations. The study objectives were DMARDs (56.9%), followed by diagnostics and disease activity measurement (18.1%), and medication other than DMARD (12.5%), besides others. Studies on DMARDs were mainly sponsored by industry, predominantly interventional studies on established and novel biologics, with several on specific issues such as systemic JIA and others. The spectrum of registered studies is currently centered on drug therapy and diagnostics, while other issues in JIA play a subordinated role in current research. Drug development was transferred from adult rheumatology into the JIA population with little innovation for children.

Among these, most of the viruses jump from other species of animals to humans called zoonotic viruses. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), by crossing species-barrier, has infected the human population for the third time in the current century and has caused the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) . Mutation and adaptation for years have greatly influenced the co-evolution and existence of coronaviruses and their possible hosts including humans. The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in China thrust coronaviruses into the limelight and shocked the world. Presently, no coronavirus vaccines are clinically available to combat the virus's devastating effects. To counter the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore important to understand the complex nature of coronaviruses and their clinical attributes. SARS and MERS outbreaks had ultimately led to socio-economic deprivation in the previous decades. In addressing the recent disastrous situation, the COVID-19 pandemic still needs some lessons from prior experience. In this review, we have highlighted the chronological order of coronavirus strains, their genomic features, the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, and its disastrous repercussions on the world.

METHODS: Clinical data of moderate COVID-19 patients admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center for treatment from January 20, 2020, to March 16, 2020, were collected. A retrospective study was conducted and the patients were divided into two groups according to whether they used proton-pump inhibitors or not. The differences in SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital stay between the two groups were compared by Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models and the propensity score matching method. RESULTS: A total of 154 patients with moderate COVID-19 were included in this study, including 80 males (51.9%), 35 patients (22.7%) in the proton-pump inhibitor group, and 119 patients (77.3%) in the control group. In the proton-pump inhibitor group and the control group, the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 clearance was 7 days (95% CI, 6C9) and 7 days (95% CI, 6C11), and the duration of the hospital stay was 21 days (95% CI, 16C25) and 20 days (95% CI, 15C26), respectively. There was no significant difference between the both groups in the cumulative incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the discharge, and the same results were obtained after the propensity score matching, all P > 0.05. There was no significant association between the use of proton-pump inhibitors and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance, according to univariate analysis (HR, 1.309; 95% CI, 0.893C1.918) and multivariate analysis (HR, 1.575; 95% CI, 0.993C2.499).

Digitalization of obesity management provides an opportunity to innovate our traditional model of health care delivery within this setting, and to transform its scalability potentially to the population level. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the Low Carb Program app for weight loss, applied within our hospital-based (tier 3) obesity service. Due to the disrupting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our obesity service, we compared the clinical outcomes from the Low Carb Program app applied in the context of remote patient appointments over the telephone with the prepandemic traditional standard of care. METHODS: We invited patients who attended our hospital-based obesity service to engage with the Low Carb Program smartphone app. We combined this approach with remote delivery (over the telephone) of obesity management from medical and psychology members of our obesity team during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome variables included changes in body weight and changes in HbA(1c) as a marker of glycemic control. We compared data from the Low Carb Program group with a retrospective control group (n=126) that had received traditional face-to-face obesity management from our team without concomitant use of the Low Carb Program app in the preCCOVID-19 era. T test comparisons were employed, with P<.05 considered significant. RESULTS: The mean weight of participants (n=105) was 130.2 kg, with 59% (n=62) females and a mean age of 48.8 years. Most participants (90/105, 86%) completed the Low Carb Program app registration process and engaged with the Low Carb Program app program; at follow-up, most participants (88/105, 84%) had actively engaged with the Low Carb Program app within the prior 30 days. The majority of participants (58/105, 55%) self-reported outcomes within the app. Mean duration of clinical follow-up for recruited participants who received the app was 7.4 months. Paired data were available for 48 participants for body weight and 41 participants for HbA(1c). Paired sample t test analysis revealed a statistically significant mean loss of body weight of 2.7 kg (P=.001) and improvement in HbA(1c) of 3.3 mmol/mol (P=.01). The mean weight of control group patients (n=126) was 137.1 kg, with 74% (93/126) females and a mean age of 44.4 years. The mean follow-up for this group was 6 months. Data comparisons between the app user group and the preCCOVID-19 retrospective control group revealed equivalence for loss of body weight and change in HbA(1c) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence to support the feasibility of implementing the Low Carb Program app combined with remote management; this is the first proof of concept for digitalized management within a hospital-based (tier 3) obesity service. We demonstrate the potential clinical efficacy of the approach in terms of improvements in body weight and glycemic control.","output":"Low Carb Program Health App Within a Hospital-Based Obesity Setting: Observational Service Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explored social factors that are associated with the US deaths caused by COVID\\\\19 after the declaration of economic reopening on May 1, 2020 by President Donald Trump. We seek to understand how county\\\\level support for Trump interacted with social distancing policies to impact COVID\\\\19 death rates. Overall, controlling for several potential confounders, counties with higher levels of Trump support do not necessarily experience greater mortality rates due to COVID\\\\19. The predicted weekly death counts per county tended to increase over time with the implementation of several key health policies. However, the difference in COVID\\\\19 outcomes between counties with low and high levels of Trump support grew after several weeks of the policy implementation as counties with higher levels of Trump support suffered relatively higher death rates. Counties with higher levels of Trump support exhibited lower percentages of mobile staying at home and higher percentages of people working part time or full time than otherwise comparable counties with lower levels of Trump support. The relative negative performance of Trump\\\\supporting counties is robust after controlling for these measures of policy compliance. Counties with high percentages of older (aged 65 and above) persons tended to have greater death rates, as did more populous counties in general.

We now report actively demyelinating lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis are associated with increased glial expression of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), which we demonstrate inhibits myelination and remyelination in vitro. This inhibitory activity is associated with the appearance of multi-branched pre-myelinating MBP(+)/PLP(+) oligodendrocytes that interact with axons but fail to assemble myelin sheaths; an oligodendrocyte phenotype described previously in chronically demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions. This inhibitory activity is not due to a direct effect of FGF9 on cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage but is mediated by factors secreted by astrocytes. Transcriptional profiling and functional validation studies demonstrate that these include effects dependent on increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-sensitive proteases, enzymes more commonly associated with extracellular matrix remodelling. Further, we found that FGF9 induces expression of Ccl2 and Ccl7, two pro-inflammatory chemokines that contribute to recruitment of microglia and macrophages into multiple sclerosis lesions. These data indicate glial expression of FGF9 can initiate a complex astrocyte-dependent response that contributes to two distinct pathogenic pathways involved in the development of multiple sclerosis lesions. Namely, induction of a pro-inflammatory environment and failure of remyelination; a combination of effects predicted to exacerbate axonal injury and loss in patients.","output":"Fibroblast growth factor signalling in multiple sclerosis: inhibition of myelination and induction of pro-inflammatory environment by FGF9"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Incisional hernia is a frequent complication of abdominal surgery, often requiring surgical intervention.

To study the enhanced water uptake in the longitudinal direction by shiitake mycelium in shiitake cultivation logs, six dried test logs (Quercus serrata, diameter of 38 to 48 mm, length of 110 to 118 mm) were used. Three test logs had shiitake mycelium grown on them, and the remaining three test logs had mold generated on them. Liquid water was supplied to the bottom surface of the test log which had its longitudinal direction along the line of gravity. Water content distribution in the logs was measured in chronological order using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with 1 Tesla. The calibration curve for converting the signal intensity of the MR image into the water content in the test log was determined by cutting the test log at 5-mm intervals and measuring the water content distribution using the mass method. Spatial distribution of the water content of the test log without shiitake mycelium depending on the cumulative water supply time was obtained, and the distribution shape was always concave corresponding to the exact solution of an unsteady one-dimensional diffusion equation with one diffusion coefficient. In the case of the test log in which shiitake mycelium grew, within a few hours after liquid water supply the water content increased in the whole region where shiitake mycelium grew, and the shape of the water content distribution in the longitudinal direction became convex. Based on observation of water penetration into logs by MRI and an optical microscope, it is believed that the driving force behind increased rise in liquid water in the longitudinal direction in the test log is the capillary force acting in vessels.","output":"Enhanced water uptake in the longitudinal direction by shiitake mycelium in shiitake cultivation logs: water content distribution in logs measured by magnetic resonance imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A short reflection on the emergence of the environmental justice movement from the Toxic Wastes and Race report and Michigan's Conference on Race and the Incidence of Environmental Hazards.

The improved technical quality and dependability of video-mediated consultations has opened up the possibility for more widespread use. However, questions remain regarding clinical quality and safety. Video-mediated consultations are sometimes criticized for being not as good as face-to-face, but there has been little previous in-depth research on their interactional dynamics, and no agreement on what a good video consultation looks like. OBJECTIVE: Using conversation analysis, this study aimed to identify and analyze the communication strategies through which video-mediated consultations are accomplished and to produce recommendations for patients and clinicians to improve the communicative quality of such consultations. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the clinician-patient interaction in a sample of video-mediated consultations and a comparison sample of face-to-face consultations drawn from 4 clinical settings across 2 trusts (1 community and 1 acute care) in the UK National Health Service. The video dataset consisted of 37 recordings of video-mediated consultations (with diabetes, antenatal diabetes, cancer, and heart failure patients), 28 matched audio recordings of face-to-face consultations, and fieldnotes from before and after each consultation. We also conducted 37 interviews with staff and 26 interviews with patients. Using linguistic ethnography (combining analysis of communication with an appreciation of the context in which it takes place), we examined in detail how video interaction was mediated by 2 software platforms (Skype and FaceTime). RESULTS: Patients had been selected by their clinician as appropriate for video-mediated consultation. Most consultations in our sample were technically and clinically unproblematic. However, we identified 3 interactional challenges: (1) opening the video consultation, (2) dealing with disruption to conversational flow (eg, technical issues with audio and/or video), and (3) conducting an examination. Operational and technological issues were the exception rather than the norm. In all but 1 case, both clinicians and patients (deliberately or intuitively) used established communication strategies to successfully negotiate these challenges. Remote physical examinations required the patient (and, in some cases, a relative) to simultaneously follow instructions and manipulate technology (eg, camera) to make it possible for the clinician to see and hear adequately. CONCLUSIONS: A remote video link alters how patients and clinicians interact and may adversely affect the flow of conversation. However, our data suggest that when such problems occur, clinicians and patients can work collaboratively to find ways to overcome them. There is potential for a limited physical examination to be undertaken remotely with some patients and in some conditions, but this appears to need complex interactional work by the patient and/or their relatives.

A self-administered questionnaire (18 items) and a well-known Kessler 10 Psychological Distress questionnaire (10 items) were used to collect the data related to perceived stress with an association of educational, psychological, and coping variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of overall stress was significantly higher ((2)= 16.3; P=0.000) in female medical students, ie, (40%) as compared to the male students (16.6%), and was highest (48.8%) during the 3rd medical year. It was also noted that the most effective strategy, embraced by students to cope with the severe stress, was indulging in religious activities (OR= 1.08; P=0.81). Furthermore, 22.3% of students had perceived severe stress as they did not prefer online learning. Similarly, those students who have not believed or refused the online learning or disagree in there is pleasure in the study due to COVID they have significantly higher stress ((2)=39.7; P=0.000) 21.5% mild, 17.8% of moderate, and 21.2% severe. CONCLUSION: We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has induced stress and changes in medical students educational attitudes and strategies. The results exhibited that the predominance of stress is higher in females than males, and also more stress was perceived by the students during their transitional year, ie, 3rd medical year (from pre-clinical to clinical) and also the respondents who regularly did religious meditation were at lower levels of stress. COVID-19s influence on medical education and students well-being will be felt at an extended level, which necessitates an appropriate plan for preparedness.","output":"Association of COVID-19 Pandemic with undergraduate Medical Students' Perceived Stress and Coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease involving neuromuscular transmission and possible respiratory failure when concomitant with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to analyze the need for ventilatory support (VS), length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality in patients diagnosed with MG and COVID-19. In this systematic review, PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, MEDLINE and IBECS databases were searched for primary studies published from January 2010 to March 2021, with no language restrictions. Fourteen eligible studies were identified. The main factor associated with the need for VS was the use of antibiotics other than azithromycin (AZM) for the treatment of COVID-19 (RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.20-2.91; p = 0.009). Patients who used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and AZM had almost twice the risk of needing invasive ventilatory support (IVS) (RR 1.94; 95% CI 1.07-3.52; p = 0.16). There were nonsignificant trends towards less need for IVS in patients who used intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and corticosteroid therapy (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.09-3.26; p = 0.60). There was a trend towards shorter LOS in patients who received therapy with IVIg and corticosteroid therapy [8 (5 - 8) vs 19 (12.2-23.7); p = 0.007]. 10.3% (n = 4/39) died and 100% did not use IVIg or IVIg and prednisone. There was a non-significant trend towards higher mortality in patients who used AZM (RR 2.55; 95% CI 0.26-30.02; p = 0.60). IVIg and corticotherapy presented themselves as a favorable alternative in relation to the outcomes.

Our aim is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety in medical students during this pandemic. This systematic review and mini meta-analysis has been conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Two researchers independently searched PubMed on 26 August 2020 for cross-sectional studies on medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, with no language restrictions applied. We then performed a manual search to detect other potentially eligible investigations. To the 1361 records retrieved in the initial search, 4 more were added by manual search on medRxiv. Finally, eight studies were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analysis, which yielded an estimated prevalence of anxiety of 28% (95% CI: 22-34%), with significant heterogeneity between studies. The prevalence of anxiety in medical students is similar to that prior to the pandemic but correlates with several specific COVID-related stressors. While some preventive and risk factors have been previously identified in a non-pandemic context, knowledge and cognitions on COVID-19 transmission, treatment, prognosis and prevention negatively correlate with anxiety, emerging as a key preventive factor that may provide a rationale for why the levels of anxiety have remained stable in medical students during the pandemic while increasing in their non-medical peers and the general population. Other reasons for the invariability of anxiety rates in this population are discussed. A major limitation of our review is that Chinese students comprised 89% the total sample, which could compromise the external validity of our work.","output":"Prevalence of Anxiety in Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A study was carried out in Kamuli and Hoima districts in Eastern and Western regions of Uganda to determine the Taenia solium porcine cysticercosis (PCC) and gastrointestinal (GI) parasites co-infection status in pigs. One hundred sixty-one households were selected randomly and visited between November and December 2019. A household questionnaire was administered, and faecal and blood samples were collected from at least one pig older than 3 months per household. A blood sample was obtained from a jugular venipuncture, and a rectal faecal sample was obtained. Taenia spp. circulating antigen levels in the sample sera were tested using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, apDia? cysticercosis Ag ELISA. The modified McMaster technique was used to identify and quantify the GI parasites. The apparent animal-level seroprevalence for PCC was 4.8% (95% CI 2.7C7.1) and differed across the two districts (p = 0.018). At the pig herd level, the prevalence was 9.7% (95% CI 5.5C14.4). The prevalence of the different nematode eggs and coccidian oocysts in the two districts was as follows: strongyles 79.0% (95% CI 74.3C83.6), coccidia 73.3% (95% CI 68.3C78.6), Trichuris spp. 7.4% (95% CI 4.9C10.6), Strongyloides ransomi 2.1 (95% CI 0.7C3.5) and Ascaris spp. 4.9 (95% CI 2.8C7.4). Overall, across the two districts, the arithmetic mean for the oocysts per gram (OPG) for coccidia was 2042.2  5776.1, and eggs per gram (EPG) were the highest in strongyles 616.1  991. Overall, 57.4% of the porcine cysticercosis seropositive pigs were also positive for at least one of the gastrointestinal helminths which included strongyles, Strongyloides ransomi, Trichuris spp. and Ascaris spp. The co-infection status of pigs with both PCC and GI parasites demonstrated by this study can provide an incentive for integrating the control and management of both parasites with oxfendazole. Further studies are required to understand the feasibility of using oxfendazole including costCbenefit analysis and the acceptability by local stakeholders for the control of T. solium cysticercosis and gastrointestinal parasites in pigs.

The conformational structure of the IBV spike protein was predicted from a homologous protein, human coronavirus NL63 spike.

In the model, the region located in the proximity of the fusion peptide appeared to be well conserved, and we evaluated the antigenicity of these domains, which are involved in the membrane fusion machinery. Western blotting revealed that IBV TM86 spike residues 686-723 were antigenic. Epitope mapping analysis using synthesized peptides revealed that IBV TM86 spike 669-685 (SNFSTGAFNISLLLTPP), 686-697 (SNPRGRSFIEDL), and 692-703 (SFIEDLLFTSVE) residues were major linear epitopes; two identified epitopes (686-697 and 692-703) were covered by the fusion peptide, and the other epitope (669-685) was adjacent to the fusion peptide. Although the identified epitopes are identically located as the neutralizing epitope in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the recombinant protein that includes those epitopes could not elicit neutralizing antibodies against IBV.

DRG macrophages acquired a M1-like phenotype and depletion of DRG macrophages resolved OA pain in male and female mice. Sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee joint shape DRG macrophages into a M1-like phenotype.

Inhibition of M1-like macrophages in the DRG, by intrathecal injection of a IL4-IL10 fusion protein or M2-like macrophages resolved persistent OA pain. In conclusion, these findings reveal a crucial role for macrophages in maintaining OA pain independent of the joint damage and suggest a new direction to treat OA pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn osteoarthritis (OA) patients pain poorly correlates with joint tissue changes indicating mechanisms other than only tissue damage cause pain in OA. We identified that DRG containing the somata of sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee are infiltrated with macrophages that are shaped into a M1-like phenotype by sensory neurons. We show that these DRG macrophages actively maintain OA pain remotely and independent of joint damage. The phenotype of these macrophages is crucial for their pain promoting role. Targeting the phenotype of DRG macrophages with either M2-like macrophages or a cytokine fusion protein that skews macrophages into M2-like phenotype OA pain resolves pain.

Unfortunately, the Web is plagued by reference rot which causes important Web resources to disappear. Web archive collections help reduce the costly effects of reference rot by saving Web resources that chronicle important stories/events before they disappear. These collections often begin with URLs called seeds, hand-selected by experts or scraped from social media. The quality of social media content varies widely, therefore, we propose a framework for assigning multi-dimensional quality scores to social media seeds for Web archive collections about stories and events. We leveraged contributions from social media research for attributing quality to social media content and users based on credibility, reputation, and influence. We combined these with additional contributions from the Web archive research that emphasizes the importance of considering geographical and temporal constraints when selecting seeds. Next, we developed the Quality Proxies (QP) framework which assigns seeds extracted from social media a quality score across 10 major dimensions: popularity, geographical, temporal, subject expert, retrievability, relevance, reputation, and scarcity. We instantiated the framework and showed that seeds can be scored across multiple QP classes that map to different policies for ranking seeds such as prioritizing seeds from local news, reputable and/or popular sources, etc. The QP framework is extensible and robust. Our results showed that Quality Proxies resulted in the selection of quality seeds with increased precision (by ~0.13) when novelty is and is not prioritized.

RECENT FINDINGS Norovirus (NoV) is the most common viral foodborne pathogen globally (125 million cases and 35 000 deaths). The role of the asymptomatic food handlers in contributing to NoV outbreaks is becoming increasingly clear, with up to one-quarter of outbreaks attributable to them. Handwashing with soap and water remains the best method for removing NoV from fingers. Risk assessment for transmission of emerging viruses through the food chain should include consideration of all means by which food could post a hazard, that is not just consumption. New technologies have demonstrated the widespread nature of viral contamination in the food chain, but this does not necessarily correlate with the risk of disease. Finally, understanding people's knowledge and behaviour is just as important as understanding virus characteristics and epidemiology when assessing risks of foodborne transmission.

However, few studies have investigated the impact of individual socioeconomic position (SEP) on these disparities. Objectives: To determine the joint effects of SEP, race/ethnicity, and gender on the burden of COVID-19 mortality. A secondary objective was to determine whether differences in opportunities for remote work were correlated with COVID-19 death rates for sociodemographic groups. Design: Annual mortality study which used a special government tabulation of 2020 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by decedents SEP (measured by educational attainment), gender, and race/ethnicity. Setting: United States in 2020. Participants: COVID-19 decedents aged 25 to 64 years old (n = 69,001). Exposures: Socioeconomic position (low, intermediate, and high), race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Black, Asian, Indigenous, multiracial, and non-Hispanic white), and gender (women and men). Detailed census data on occupations held by adults in 2020 in each of the 36 sociodemographic groups studied were used to quantify the possibility of remote work for each group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates for 36 sociodemographic groups. Disparities were quantified by relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. High-SEP adults were the (low-risk) referent group for all relative risk calculations. Results: A higher proportion of Hispanics, Blacks, and Indigenous people were in a low SEP in 2020, compared with whites. COVID-19 mortality was five times higher for low vs. high-SEP adults (72.2 vs. 14.6 deaths per 100,000, RR = 4.94, 95% CI 4.82C5.05). The joint detriments of low SEP, Hispanic ethnicity, and male gender resulted in a COVID-19 death rate which was over 27 times higher (178.0 vs. 6.5 deaths/100,000, RR = 27.4, 95% CI 25.9C28.9) for low-SEP Hispanic men vs. high-SEP white women. In regression modeling, percent of the labor force in never remote jobs explained 72% of the variance in COVID-19 death rates.

Therefore, we examined the risk of severe infection course and hospital admission in a large cohort of patients with IEI. In this multicenter nationwide retrospective survey-based trial, the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected by investigating physicians from 8 national referral centers for the diagnosis and treatment of IEI using a COVID-19-IEI clinical questionnaire. In total, 81 patients with IEI (including 16 with hereditary angioedema, HAE) and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled, and were found to have a 2.3-times increased (95%CI: 1.44C3.53) risk ratio for hospital admission and a higher mortality ratio (2.4% vs. 1.7% in the general population). COVID-19 severity was associated with the presence of clinically relevant comorbidities, lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia, but not with age or BMI. No individuals with HAE developed severe disease, despite a hypothesized increased risk due to perturbed bradykinin metabolism. We also demonstrated a high seroconversion rate in antibody-deficient patients and the safety of anti-spike SARS CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma. Thus, IEI except for HAE, represent significant risk factors for a severe COVID-19.

These can have severe adverse outcomes in patients with established asthma. AIM The aim of the study was to identify the viral causes of acute respiratory infection that precipitate acute asthma exacerbation in Egyptian asthmatic children. PATIENTS AND METHODS The current prospective study was conducted in Cairo University Children's Hospitals from December 2010 to December 2011. All asthmatic children (n=130) aged 2-12 years admitted with asthma exacerbation due to severe lower respiratory tract infection were included. All cases were subjected to nasopharyngeal or throat swabs that were analyzed for common respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza B (Flu B), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), influenza A (H1N1), and adenovirus (ADV) using the real-time PCR technique. All patients were followed up to record the outcome. RESULTS PCR analysis was positive for one respiratory virus in 54 asthmatic patients (41.5%) and was negative in 76 patients (58.5%), with a high predominance of RSV (51.9%) and hMPV (25.9%) especially in winter and early spring months. Hypoxia was detected in all patients with RSV infection; of these patients, 21.4% were admitted to the ICU, 14.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 14.3% died. In contrast, among those with hMPV infection, hypoxia was detected in 71.4%; none required ICU admission or mechanical ventilation.

Objectives: In this secondary analysis, we delineate types and frequency of empathic communication and examine relationships between patient empathic opportunities and clinician responses. Design: We used the Empathic Communication Coding System to analyze empathic opportunities across three types: emotion (i.e., negative affective state), progress (i.e., stated recent positive life event or development), and challenge (i.e., stated problem or recent, negative life-changing event) and clinician responses. Setting/Subjects: Transcripts from a pilot randomized trial of communication coaching in specialty PC encounters (N = 71) audio-recorded by 22 PC clinicians at two sites in the United States: an academic health system and a community-based hospice and PC organization. Results: Empathic opportunities were frequent across encounters; clinicians often responded empathically to those opportunities (e.g., confirming or acknowledging patients' emotions or experiences). Even though challenge empathic opportunities occurred most frequently, clinicians responded empathically more often to progress opportunities (i.e., 93% of the time) than challenge opportunities (i.e., 75% of the time). One in 12 opportunities was impeded by the patient or a family member changing the topic before the clinician could respond. Conclusions: PC patients frequently express emotions, share progress, or divulge challenges as empathic opportunities.

This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of the B/A ratio with severity and 30\\\\day mortality in COVID\\\\19 patients. METHODS: A total of 433 adult patients with COVID\\\\19 were enrolled. The laboratory markers were measured on admission. Disease severity was categorized into mild disease, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and septic shock. The mortality was followed for 30 days after admission.  (2) test, Fisher's exact test, and MannCWhitney U test were performed, as appropriate. Also, logistic regression and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the B/A ratio are included. RESULTS: Thirty\\\\day mortality rate was 27.25%. The frequency of mild, severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis, and septic shock was 30.72%, 36.95%, 24.02%, 6.00%, and 2.31%, respectively. B/A ratio and SA levels were statistically different between alive and deceased patients. The mean B/A ratio was different among classified disease severities, except for mild disease. Logistic regression revealed the B/A ratio as an independent risk factor for sepsis after adjusting for age and sex. ROC analysis showed B/A ratio had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.733 for mortality at the cutpoint of 4.944. AUC for sepsis was 0.617 which was greater than other disease severities. CONCLUSION: The results showed that B/A ratio and SA levels are associated with mortality of COVID\\\\19 patients. A higher B/A ratio is, additionally, associated with COVID\\\\19 severity, except in mild cases and it can act as an independent risk factor in sepsis. However, a greater B/A ratio is not a significant predictor of COVID\\\\19 severity, but it can predict mortality. Therefore, we suggest this marker for clinical assessment of patients with severe COVID\\\\19.","output":"The role of blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio in the prediction of severity and 30\\\\day mortality in patients with COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A range of strict nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented in many countries to combat the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These NPIs may also be effective at controlling seasonal influenza virus infections, as influenza viruses have the same transmission path as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different NPIs on the control of seasonal influenza. METHODS: Data for 14 NPIs implemented in 33 countries and the corresponding influenza virological surveillance data were collected. The influenza suppression index was calculated as the difference between the influenza positivity rate during its period of decline from 2019 to 2020 and during the influenza epidemic seasons in the previous 9 years. A machine learning model was developed using an extreme gradient boosting tree regressor to fit the NPI and influenza suppression index data. The SHapley Additive exPlanations tool was used to characterize the NPIs that suppressed the transmission of influenza. RESULTS: Of all NPIs tested, gathering limitations had the greatest contribution (37.60%) to suppressing influenza transmission during the 2019C2020 influenza season. The three most effective NPIs were gathering limitations, international travel restrictions, and school closures. For these three NPIs, their intensity threshold required to generate an effect were restrictions on the size of gatherings less than 1000 people, ban of travel to all regions or total border closures, and closing only some categories of schools, respectively. There was a strong positive interaction effect between mask-wearing requirements and gathering limitations, whereas merely implementing a mask-wearing requirement, and not other NPIs, diluted the effectiveness of mask-wearing requirements at suppressing influenza transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Gathering limitations, ban of travel to all regions or total border closures, and closing some levels of schools were found to be the most effective NPIs at suppressing influenza transmission. It is recommended that the mask-wearing requirement be combined with gathering limitations and other NPIs. Our findings could facilitate the precise control of future influenza epidemics and other potential pandemics.

METHODS: Thirty-one clinical indicators concerning accessibility, appropriateness, continuity and safety were defined and estimated using healthcare utilisation (HCU) databases, containing data on mental health treatments, hospital admissions, outpatient interventions, lab tests and drug prescriptions. RESULTS: A total of 70 586 prevalent patients with schizophrenia and related disorders treated in 2015 were identified, of whom 1752 were newly taken-in-care by the facilities of regional mental health services. For most patients community care was accessible and moderately intensive. However, care pathways were not implemented based on a structured assessment and only half of the patients received psychosocial treatments. One patient out of ten had access to psychological interventions and psychoeducation. Activities specifically addressed to families involved a third of prevalent patients and less than half of new patients. One patient out of six was admitted to a community residential facility, and one out of ten to a General Hospital Psychiatric Ward (GHPW); higher values were identified in new cases. In general hospitals, few patients had a length of stay (LoS) of more than 30 days, while one-fifth of the admissions were followed by readmission within 30 days of discharge. For two-thirds of patients, continuity of community care was met, and six times out of ten a discharge from a GHPW was followed by an outpatient contact within 2 weeks. For cases newly taken-in-care, the continuity of community care was uncommon, while the readiness of outpatient contacts after discharge was slightly more frequent. Most of the patients received antipsychotic medication, but their adherence to long-term treatment was low. Antipsychotic polytherapy was frequent and the control of metabolic side effects was poor. The variability between regions was high and consistent in all the quality domains. CONCLUSIONS: The Italian mental health system could be improved by increasing the accessibility to psychosocial interventions, improving the quality of care for newly taken-in-care patients, focusing on somatic health and mortality, and reducing regional variability. Clinical indicators demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the mental health system in these regions, and, as HCU databases, they could be useful tools in the routine assessment of mental healthcare quality at regional and national levels.","output":"The quality of mental health care delivered to patients with schizophrenia and related disorders in the Italian mental health system.

The present work introduces an innovative and high-yield microrecycling strategy to simultaneous synthesis of TM alloy (i.e., Ni-based superalloy) and RE oxide (REO) nanostructures from obsolete Ni-MH batteries mixed with zinc-rich electric arc furnace dust (EAFD). This strategy involves integration of high-temperature thermal isolation followed by thermal nanowiring techniques. The impure thermally-isolated REOs were purified and transformed into one dimensional (1D) nanorods of hybrid REOs. Besides, during high-temperature thermal isolation, defect-rich ZnO with tailored structures of nanorods and nanoribbons were fabricated using controllable vapour deposition. The electrochemical performance of ZnO nanoribbons for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) revealed a considerable overpotential reduction of 131 mV (18%) compared to pure commercial nano-ZnO. This approach is transformational in providing a scalable and cost-effective pathway to facilitate recycling of the challenging, yet critical, waste materials into functional nanostructures for energy and environmental applications.","output":"Nanoscale design of 1D metal oxides derived from mixed Ni-MH battery/transition metal dust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Better understand knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant women and mothers of infants around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Although doctor recommendation methods have been proposed, they fail to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, and electronic medical records (EMRs), patient preferences, potential interest of service providers and the changes over time are largely under-explored. Therefore, this study develops a self-adaptive telemedicine specialist recommendation method that incorporates specialist activity and patient utility feedback from the perspective of privacy protection to fill the research gaps. Methods: First, text vectorization, view similarity and probabilistic topic model are used to construct the patient and specialist feature models based on patients EMRs and specialists long- and short-term knowledge backgrounds, respectively. Second, the recommended specialist candidate set and recommendation index are obtained based on the similarity between patient features. Then, the specialist long-term knowledge feature model is used to update the newly registered specialist recommendation index and the recommended specialist candidate set to overcome the data sparsity and cold-start issues, and the specialist short-term knowledge feature model is adopted to extend the recommended specialist candidate set at the semantic level. Finally, we introduce the specialists activity and patients perceived utility feedback mechanism to construct a closed-loop adjusted and optimized specialist recommendation method. Results: An empirical study was conducted integrating EMRs of telemedicine patients from the National Telemedicine Center of China and specialists profiles and ratings from an online healthcare platform. The proposed method successfully recommended relevant and active telemedicine specialists to the target patient, and increased the recommended opportunities for newly registered specialists to some extent. Conclusions: The proposed method emphasizes the adaptability and acceptability of the recommended results while ensuring their accuracy and relevance. Specialists activity and patients perceived utility jointly contribute to the acceptability of recommended results, and the recommendation strategy achieves the organic fusion of the two. Several comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and operability of the hybrid recommendation strategy under the premise of data sparsity and privacy protection, enabling effective matching of patients demand and service providers capabilities, and providing beneficial insights for data-driven telemedicine services.","output":"Self-Adaptive Telemedicine Specialist Recommendation Considering Specialist Activity and Patient Feedback"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has produced terrible effects in the world economy and is shaking social and political stability around the world. The world of sport has obviously been severely affected by the pandemic, as authorities progressively canceled all level of competitions, including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In Spain, the initial government-lockdown closed the Sports High-performance Centers, and many other sports facilities. In order to support athlete's health and performance at crises like these, an online questionnaire named RECOVID-19, was designed to assess how athletes were living their lives during such periods of home confinement. The main purpose of the questionnaire was to assess the impact of prolongued confinement on athlete's psychological, emotional, and behavioral performance. One thousand, two hundred forty-eight athletes participated in the survey. They had the fllowing characteristics: (Mean age = 22.31  11.49, Female: 53%), who compete at National (N: 1017, Mean age = 21.58  11.42, Female: 52%) and International level (N: 231, Mean age = 25.56  11.22, Female: 57%). Results showed that during the confinement period, those athletes who lacked motivation reported a higher level of stressful thoughts, more behavioral problems, and greater emotional upheaval (anger, fatigue, tension, and depression). However, those athletes who accepted confinement measures as necessary, and were in favor of respecting the rules of social isolation, fostered positive emotional states such as feelings of friendship. In addition, the availability of some sport equipment together with the ability to continue some training, were (1) protective factors against emotional stress, lack of motivation and behavioral problems; and (2) they were associated with greater respect for, and adherence to, confinement rules. Gender differences, tested by multigroup analysis, revealed that coping activities were more often associated to negative emotional states among women, whereas the ongoing availability of training information and future conditions were equally protective factors for both genders. This study also showed that receiving coaching, support and completing frequent training routines seem to be valuable tools to prevent or reduce some of the harmful effects of isolation on athlete's emotional well-being. The conclusions derived from this research would possibly help sport authorities to design supporting policies and plans to support athletes and trainers in future disruptive health crises.","output":"Emotional Reactions and Adaptation to COVID-19 Lockdown (or Confinement) by Spanish Competitive Athletes: Some Lesson for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION We are in an era of bioinformatics and cheminformatics where we can predict data in the fields of medicine, the environment, engineering and public health.

The aim of this study is to determine the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 using indices such as deterioration in oxygenation and CT images of the chest. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study of 53 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in Narita who were admitted to our hospital between March 2020 and August 2020. CACS was calculated based on non-gated CT scans of the chest performed on admission day. The patients were divided into the following two groups based on CACS: group 1 (CACS 180, n=11) and group 2 (CACS <180, n=42). Following univariate analysis of the main variables, multivariate analysis of variables that may be associated with COVID-19 progression was performed. RESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression analysis of age, sex, smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, number of days from symptom onset to hospitalisation and CACS of 180 was performed. It revealed that unlike CACS of <180, CACS of 180 is associated with exacerbation of oxygenation or CT images of the chest during hospitalisation (OR: 12.879, 95% CI: 1.399 to 380.401). Furthermore, this model of eight variables showed good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=0.119). CONCLUSION: CACS may be a prognosis marker of COVID-19 severity.

METHODS An online cross-sectional study was carried out during the period between December 08 and 28 2020. Participants included registered nurses and midwives working in public or private service provision. A self-administered questionnaire was used with questions about sociodemographic characteristics, questions assessing attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination, and participants' general vaccine knowledge. FINDINGS A total of 437 responders answered the survey, with 93% being nurses and 7% midwives. Around two-thirds (67.3%) of the participants had a high vaccination knowledge, while the remaining have moderate (30.7%), and low (2.1%), respectively. Most of the participants agreed that by vaccinating they protect themselves and those around them (80.5%) and that when most people are not vaccinated, epidemics can easily initiate (74%). Oppositely, many participants disagreed with vaccination and avoided it due to a fear of injections (95.4%) or the belief that it is better to get sick rather than be vaccinated (69.1%). Neutral attitudes toward vaccine-mediated side effects (43.1%) and vaccination safety (41.7%) were observed. Sociodemographic factors such as age, educational status, and work setting significantly affected the nurses' and midwives' knowledge and attitudes toward vaccination (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that the overall vaccination knowledge of participants was high, however, gaps in vaccination knowledge were observed. Individuals who adopted a neutral stance toward vaccination can be prone to changes either toward positive or negative attitudes.

The clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic infection to severe atypical pneumonia or even fatal meningitis. Early recognition of psittacosis is difficult because of its nonspecific clinical manifestations. Culture and gene probe techniques for C. psittaci are not available for routine clinical use, which makes the diagnosis difficult too. Although psittacosis has increasingly been recognized and reported in recent years, cure of severe pneumonia complicated with meningitis, with etiologic diagnosis aided by the use of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), is still uncommon. So, it is necessary to report and review such potentially fatal case. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a 54-year-old woman with C. psittaci caused severe atypical pneumonia and meningitis. She presented with symptoms of fever, dry cough and dyspnea, accompanied by prominent headache. Her condition deteriorated rapidly to respiratory failure and lethargy under the treatment of empirical antibacterial agents, and was treated with invasive mechanical ventilation soon. She denied contact with birds, poultry or horses, but unbiased mNGS of both the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified sequence reads corresponding to C. psittaci infection, and there was no sequence read corresponding to other probable pathogens. Combined use of targeted antimicrobial agents of tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones was carried out, and the patients condition improved and she was discharged home 28 days later. Her status returned close to premorbid condition on day 60 of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: When clinicians come across a patient with atypical pneumonia accompanied by symptoms of meningitis, psittacosis should be taken into consideration. mNGS is a promising detection method in such condition and is recommended.

Studies conducted in southern China found that bats carried a variety of viruses. However, few studies have been conducted on bats in northern China, which harbours a diversity of endemic insectivorous bats. It is important to understand the prevalence and diversity of viruses circulating in bats in northern China. In this study, a total of 145 insectivorous bats representing six species were collected from northern China and screened with degenerate primers for viruses belonging to six families, including coronaviruses, astroviruses, hantaviruses, paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses and circoviruses. Our study found that four of the viruses screened for were positive and the overall detection rates for astroviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and circoviruses in bats were 21.4%, 15.9%, 20% and 37.2%, respectively.

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, 372 hospitalized patients with nonsevere COVID-19 were followed for > 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and those who maintained a nonsevere state were assigned to the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. Based on baseline data of the 2 groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance. RESULTS: The training cohort consisted of 189 patients, and the 2 independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.4%) patients developed severe COVID-19. Older age; higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, and direct bilirubin; and lower albumin were associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (area under the curve [AUC], 0.912 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .846-.978]; sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 87.6%) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.853 [95% CI, .790-.916]; sensitivity 77.5%, specificity 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analyses indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram could help clinicians with early identification of patients who will progress to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe disease.","output":"A Tool for Early Prediction of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Multicenter Study Using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Little is known about the effect of economic recessions on cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we investigated the association of the economic recession in Finland in the 1990s with the incidence of cardiovascular disease among middle-aged and older women. METHODS: A total of 918 women aged 53C73 years were examined for health and socioeconomic position in 1998C2001, as part of the population-based prospective Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. The participants were asked whether Finlands economic recession in the early 1990s had affected their lives socially or economically. The cohort was followed for 18 years, and incident physician-diagnosed cases of cardiovascular disease were obtained through record linkage with the national hospital discharge registry that covers every hospitalisation in Finland. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the risk of cardiovascular disease among those with and without exposure to socioeconomic hardships during the recession, after adjusting for possible confounders. RESULTS: At the baseline, 587 women reported having experienced socioeconomic hardships due to the recession. During the 20 years follow-up, 501 women developed cardiovascular disease. After adjustment for age, the risk of cardiovascular disease was 27% higher among women exposed to socioeconomic hardships compared to those who were not (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.06C1.53, P=0.012). Further adjustments for overall socioeconomic position at baseline, prior cardiovascular health, and lifestyle factors did not attenuate the association (hazard ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.02C1.5, P=0.029).

METHODS Routine electron microscopy was performed for observing RCV-infected rat thymus tissues. RESULTS Following RCV infection, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pools of different dimensions were observed in the cytoplasm of the thymic epithelial reticular cells, merging subsequently with each other into larger ER lakes filled with particles of mature RCV, or viral inclusion bodies. After germination on the ER membrane, the viruses entered the matrix of the ER lake to mature and were eventually excreted to the extracellular space. The RCV particles were spherical in shape with a diameter of 100-130 nm and two distinct membranes, the outer one being the envelope and the inner one the nuclear capsid to enclose the viroplasm. Between the envelop and nuclear capsid was a electron-lucent middle layer comprising one to two thin membranous structures. Large quantity of short spike-like projections starting from the nucleus capsid penetrated the middle layer and the envelop to reach the glycoprotein coat and formed a corona-like structure. Mature RCV particles were distributed around the ER pools, cytoplasm, and intercellular space, and the RCVs in the endosome/lysosome were devoid of the envelop and nuclear capsid. CONCLUSION The ER lakes are involved in the maturation of the viruses, and the envelop and nuclear capsid of the virus entering the cells from extracellular space are removed and degraded in the endosome/lysosome.

RESULTS: Excess purchases due to confinement during 2020 were 178 g of alcohol per 100 households per day (adjusted for numbers of adults in each household) above an expected base of 438 g based on averaged 2015C2018 data, representing a 40.6% increase. However, when adjusting for expected normal purchases from on-licenced premises (i.e. bars, restaurants, etc.), there was evidence for no excess purchases of grams of alcohol (a 0.7% increase). With these adjustments, beer purchases dropped by 40%, wine purchases increased by 15% and spirits purchases by 22%. Excess purchases increased the richer the household and the lower the age of the main shopper. Confinement was associated with a shift in purchases from lower to higher strength beers.

However, no prior studies examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. Therefore, we examined temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability to quantify disparities in trends over time. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 15 to December 31, 2020, for each US county using data from USAFacts. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with higher values indicating more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles, adjusting for rurality, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage female, percentage of smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, daily temperature and precipitation, and proportion tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: At the outset of the pandemic, the most vulnerable counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than least vulnerable SVI quartile. However, on March 28, we observed a crossover effect in which the most vulnerable counties experienced higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to the least vulnerable counties (RR = 1.05, 95% PI: 0.98, 1.12). Vulnerable counties had higher death rates starting on May 21 (RR = 1.08, 95% PI: 1.00,1.16). However, by October, this trend reversed and the most vulnerable counties had lower death rates compared to least vulnerable counties.

It is important to understand patient health-related behaviors and perceptions to guide public health vaccination strategies. OBJECTIVES: To examine perceptions of COVID-19 and vaccination beliefs, and identify predictors of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the US. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey guided by the Health Belief Model was conducted using a web-based Qualtrics survey panel of US adults. The main outcome was the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Additional measures included: demographics, perceptions of COVID-19 severity, risk and susceptibility, views of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, virus and vaccine information sources, vaccine beliefs and behaviors, and seasonal flu vaccine history. RESULTS: A total of 1047 complete responses were included. Females had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than males (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.80). Those with a two-year degree/some college had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those with a high school degree/GED (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36-0.97).

Demographical data, usage of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin were recorded, and laboratory findings as HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at the 6th and 12th months. Diabetes remission criteria were used to assess success of the surgical treatment. RESULTS Totally 88 patients were included in this study. 55 patients were using oral antidiabetic drugs and 33 patients were using insulin.

Compared to those aged 30-49 years, those 0-29 years were more likely to recover (aHR 1.22, 95%CI 1.10-1.34) while those aged 50-69 and 70+ years were less likely to recover (aHR respectively 0.74, 95%CI 0.67-0.81 and 0.63, 95%CI 0.56-0.71). Men were faster to recover than women (aHR 1.20, 95%CI 1.11-1.29) and those with pre-existing co-morbidities took longer to recover than those without (aHR 0.90, 95%CI 0.83-0.98). INTERPRETATION: In a setting where most cases of COVID-19 were ascertained and followed, 80% of those with COVID-19 recover within a month, but about 5% will continue to experience symptoms 3 months later.","output":"Whole of population-based cohort study of recovery time from COVID-19 in New South Wales Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current study, attempts were made to analyze the effect of COVID\\\\19 lockdown on the heavy metal concentrations in River Gomti through comparison with pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 lockdown status.

It exerts class specific adverse effects that are shared by other MRAs. Additionally, it exerts unique off target steroidal effects that include gynecomastia, impotence and loss of libido in males and menstrual irregularity in females. Together, these have led to a poor tolerability and limited use despite positive results in many randomized, controlled clinical trials. We review the off-target effects of spironolactone that may summate with its MRA action to provide an advantageous profile for prevention or treatment of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Literature review using PubMed Central. Results: The blockade by spironolactone of the androgen receptor should diminish the expression of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that has an androgen promoter while its MRA action should enhance the expression of protease nexin1 (PN1) that inhibits furin and plasmin. TMPRSS2, furin and plasmin cooperated to process the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to increase its high affinity binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and thereby promote viral cell entry. Its actions as an MRA may reduce inflammation and preserve pulmonary, cardiac and vascular functions. Its anti-plasmin action may combat hemostatic dysfunction. Conclusion: The hypothesis that the off-target effects of spironolactone summate with its MRA actions to provide special benefits for COVID-19 is worthy of direct investigation and clinical trial.","output":"When Off Target Effects Are On Target: The Role Of Spironolactone In Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study is to analyze the results of the work of the territorial center for disaster medicine of the Voronezh region to improve the organization of medical care for patients with suspected and confirmed new coronavirus infection COVID19 in 2020.

Recent studies have shown that lymphopenia and a cytokine mass release represent important pathogenic features, with clinical evidence of dyspnea and hypoxemia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in severely ill patients, with a high death toll. Currently, stem cells are actively being investigated for their potential use in many \\"untreatable\\" diseases. In this regard and in particular, Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), due to their intrinsic features, including either ability to impact on regulation of the immune system, or association with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, or potential for differentiation into several cell lineages, have become a promising tool for cell and molecular-based therapies. On this background, we wished to explore whether human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMS) would represent a potential viable therapeutic approach for the management of critically ill COVID19 patients. METHODS We tested the hUCMS effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) retrieved from patients with COVID19 (Ethical Committee CEAS Umbria, Italy CER N3658/20 7, May, 2020), both as free cell monolayers and after envelopment in sodium alginate microcapsules. Both cell systems, after priming with IFN-, proved able to produce several immunomodulatory molecules such as IDO1 and HLAG5, although only the microencapsulated hUCMS were associated with massive and dose-dependent production of these factors. RESULTS The microencapsulated hUCMS improved allo-suppression in mixed lymphocytes reactions (MLRs), while also blunting T helper 1 and T helper 17 responses, that are involved with the cytokine storm and greatly contribute to the patient death. Moreover, we observed that both free and microencapsulated hUCMS permitted 5 days survival of in vitro culture maintained PBMCs extracted from very ill patients. CONCLUSION We have provided evidence that microencapsulated hUCMS in vitro, seem to represent a powerful tool to impact on several immune pathways, clearly deranged in COVID19 patients. Further study is necessary to begin in vivo assessment of this experimental system, upon determining both, the most appropriate time of the disease onset for intervention, and cell dosage/patient of our experimental product.","output":"Microencapsulated Wharton Jelly-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells as a potential new therapeutic tool for patients with COVID-19 disease: an in vitro study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives with unprecedented popularity and a diverse selection of apps. The continuous upgrading of information technology has also enabled smartphones to display great potential in the field of health care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the future research direction of mobile health (mHealth) by analyzing its research trends and latest research hotspots. METHODS: This study collected mHealth-related literature published between 2000 and 2020 from the Web of Science database. Descriptive statistics of publication trends of mHealth research were determined by analyzing the annual number of publications in the literature and annual number of publications by country. We constructed visualization network maps of country (or regional) collaborations and author-provided keyword co-occurrences, as well as overlay visualization maps of the average publication year of author-provided keywords to analyze the hotspots and research trends in mHealth research. RESULTS: In total, 12,593 mHealth-related research papers published between 2000 and 2020 were found. The results showed an exponential growth trend in the number of annual publications in mHealth literature. JMIR mHealth and uHealth, the Journal of Medical Internet Research, and JMIR Research Protocols were the 3 top journals with respect to number of publications. The United States remained the leading contributor to the literature in this area (5294/12,593, 42.0%), well ahead of other countries and regions. Other countries and regions also showed a clear trend of annual increases in the number of mHealth publications. The 4 countries with the largest number of publicationsthe United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australiawere found to cooperate more closely. The rest of the countries and regions showed a clear geographic pattern of cooperation. The keyword co-occurrence analysis of the top 100 authors demonstrated 5 clusters, namely, development of mHealth medical technology and its application to various diseases, use of mHealth technology to improve basic public health and health policy, mHealth self-health testing and management in daily life, adolescent use of mHealth, and mHealth in mental health. The research trends revealed a gradual shift in mHealth research from health policy and improving public health care to the development and social application of mHealth technologies. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the most current bibliometric analysis dates back to 2016. However, the number of mHealth research published between 2017 and 2020 exceeds the previous total. The results of this study shed light on the latest hotspots and trends in mHealth research. These findings provide a useful overview of the development of the field; they may also serve as a valuable reference and provide guidance for researchers in the digital health field.","output":"Exploring the Shift in International Trends in Mobile Health Research From 2000 to 2020: Bibliometric Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung damage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia may be so severe that management with lung-protective ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, and proning cannot sustain life. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may allow patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to undergo a period of lung recovery before being transitioned back to mechanical ventilation. A successful outcome requires both timely initiation of ECMO before development of irreversible organ injury from severe ARDS and selection of patients with adequate physiologic reserve. We present a 40-year-old healthy male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia not responsive to more conservative options for ARDS management. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) rescue therapy was instituted and after 34 days he was successfully decannulated and eventually discharged from the hospital in good condition. Despite needing ECMO for longer than what is reported in most case reports and series involving patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, our patient made a complete recovery. He was also followed up in an outpatient setting and seen to be doing well. With appropriate patient selection and timely initiation of ECMO, many patients stand to benefit from this treatment. Ensuring that therapy be delivered to these patients when the need arises requires meticulous planning and provision of the appropriate resources. In addition, inflammatory markers may serve as a further guide to decision-making in patients already on ECMO as has already been indicated in the literature.","output":"Successful Use of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in a Patient With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal cancer is a high death rate cancer until now; from the clinical view, the diagnosis of the tumour region is critical for the doctors.

With the development of computer vision, detection and segmentation of the colorectal cancer region from CT or MRI image series are a great challenge in the past decades, and there still have great demands on automatic diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed a novel transfer learning protocol, called CST, that is, a union framework for colorectal cancer region detection and segmentation task based on the transformer model, which effectively constructs the cancer region detection and its segmentation jointly. To make a higher detection accuracy, we incorporate an autoencoder-based image-level decision approach that leverages the image-level decision of a cancer slice. We also compared our framework with one-stage and two-stage object detection methods; the results show that our proposed method achieves better results on detection and segmentation tasks.

To determine whether these loci function as gene-regulatory regions, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi; CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB) has been recently used. Here, we applied CRISPRi along with Hi-C, ChIP-seq and eQTL to determine the functional roles of loci established as highly associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Notably, Hi-C, ChIP-seq and eQTL predicted that non-coding regions located at chromosome 19q13 or chromosome 17q21 harboring single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to asthma/CF/COPD and chromosome 11p15 harboring an SNP linked to IPF interact with nearby genes and function as enhancers; however, CRISPRi indicated that the regions with rs1800469, rs2241712, rs12603332 and rs35705950, but not others, regulate the expression of nearby genes (single or multiple genes).

Unlike previous studies, this study aims to evaluate the role of the pandemic, i.e., Covid-19 and its possible impact on volatility in natural resources commodity prices for China. China has been the center of this epidemic disease and is considered one of the major economies affected by the Covid-19; therefore, it is better to conduct this study for China.

Moreover, this study employs the novel wavelet power spectrum and wavelet coherence approach to better capture volatility within commodity prices volatility and Covid-19 and evaluate the association between both variables. The empirical results reveal that only natural resources commodity prices are volatile and only short. While Covid-19 positive cases and Covid-19 deaths are not vulnerable during the study period. Moreover, the wavelet coherence conforms that both Covid-19 positive cases and Covid-19 deaths significantly cause volatility in natural resources commodity prices. Although, volatility is found at different periods; still, volatility is observed only in the short-run.

METHODS: Preschool children presenting for care or admission to a tertiary paediatric hospital during the 2008\\\\2014 influenza seasons were tested for respiratory virus by polymerase chain reaction and culture. Parental surveys were used to determine the impact of infection on illness duration, medication use, absenteeism and health service utilisation. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the impact of influenza and to evaluate the association between influenza status and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 1191 children assessed, 238 had influenza. Among children with influenza, 87.8% were administered antipyretics and 40.9% antibiotics. 28.6% had secondary complications. 65.4% of children missed school/day care, and 53.4% of parents missed work.

Until recently, these devices consisted mainly of GPS tools that track location, software that scrutinizes browser activity and keyboard strokes, and heat/motion sensors that monitor workstation presence. Today, however, a new generation of biometric devices has emerged that can sense, read, monitor and evaluate the affective state of a worker. More popularly known by its commercial moniker, Emotional AI, the technology stems from advancements in affective computing. But whereas previous generations of biometric monitoring targeted the exterior physical body of the worker, concurrent with the writings of Foucault and Hardt, we argue that emotion-recognition tools signal a far more invasive disciplinary gaze that exposes and makes vulnerable the inner regions of the worker-self. Our paper explores attitudes towards empathic surveillance by analyzing a survey of 1015 responses of future job-seekers from 48 countries with Bayesian statistics. Our findings reveal affect tools, left unregulated in the workplace, may lead to heightened stress and anxiety among disadvantaged ethnicities, gender and income class. We also discuss a stark cross-cultural discrepancy whereby East Asians, compared to Western subjects, are more likely to profess a trusting attitude toward EAI-enabled automated management. While this emerging technology is driven by neoliberal incentives to optimize the worksite and increase productivity, ultimately, empathic surveillance may create more problems in terms of algorithmic bias, opaque decisionism, and the erosion of employment relations. Thus, this paper nuances and extends emerging literature on emotion-sensing technologies in the workplace, particularly through its highly original cross-cultural study.

OBJECTIVES: To correlate endothelial dysfunction to in-hospital mortality in a bi-centric cohort of COVID-19 adult patients. METHODS: Consecutive ambulatory and hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. A panel of endothelial biomarkers and von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers were measured in each patient  48 h following admission. RESULTS: Study enrolled 208 COVID-19 patients of whom 23 were mild outpatients and 189 patients hospitalized after admission. Most of endothelial biomarkers tested were found increased in the 89 critical patients transferred to intensive care unit. However, only von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) scaled according to clinical severity, with levels significantly higher in critical patients (median 507%, IQR 428C596) compared to non-critical patients (288%, 230C350, p < 0.0001) or COVID-19 outpatients (144%, 133C198, p = 0.007). Moreover, VWF high molecular weight multimers (HMWM) were significantly higher in critical patients (median ratio 1.18, IQR 0.86C1.09) compared to non-critical patients (0.96, 1.04C1.39, p < 0.001). Among all endothelial biomarkers measured, ROC curve analysis identified a VWF:Ag cut-off of 423% as the best predictor for in-hospital mortality. The accuracy of VWF:Ag was further confirmed in a KaplanCMeier estimator analysis and a Cox proportional Hazard model adjusted on age, BMI, C-reactive protein and d-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: VWF:Ag is a relevant predictive factor for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. More than a biomarker, we hypothesize that VWF, including excess of HMWM forms, drives microthrombosis in COVID-19.","output":"Circulating Von Willebrand factor and high molecular weight multimers as markers of endothelial injury predict COVID-19 in-hospital mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respect for patient privacy and confidentiality is an ancient and a contemporary professional responsibility of physicians.

As of August 2020, it has affected more than 18 million humans and caused over 700,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Under certain circumstances, the viral infection leads to excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory response, which is associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary alveolar structures. This phenomenon has been referred to as the cytokine storm, and it is closely linked to lung injury, acute respiratory syndrome and mortality. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine available to prevent the infection, and no effective treatment is available to reduce the mortality associated with the severe form of the disease. The cytokine storm associate with COVID-19 shows similarities with those observed in other pathologies such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury and other viral infection including severe cases of influenza. However, the specific mechanisms that cause and modulate the cytokine storm in the different conditions remain to be determined. micro-RNAs are important regulators of gene expression, including key inflammatory cytokines involved in the massive recruitment of immune cells to the lungs such as IL1, IL6, and TNF. In recent years, it has been shown that nutraceutical agents can modulate the expression of miRs involved in the regulation of cytokines in various inflammatory diseases. Here we review the potential role of inflammatory-regulating-miRs in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and propose that nutraceutical agents may represent a supportive therapeutic approach to modulate dysregulated miRs in this condition, providing benefits in severe respiratory diseases.","output":"Nutraceutical Targeting of Inflammation-Modulating microRNAs in Severe Forms of COVID-19: A Novel Approach to Prevent the Cytokine Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for an accessible and low-cost COVID-19 vaccine suitable for low- and middle-income countries.

After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel? were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies.

Examining specific infectious exposures would be useful in describing their current trends as well as guidance with appropriate protective measures an emergency medical services (EMS) system should consider. OBJECTIVE To describe the types of infectious occupational health exposures and associated outcomes reported at an urban EMS system. METHODS A retrospective review of all reported exposures was performed for a three-year period from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009. Descriptive analysis was performed on data such as provider demographics, types of exposures reported, confirmation of exposure based on patient follow-up information, and outcomes. RESULTS Three hundred ninety-seven exposure reports were filed with the designated infection control officer (ICO), resulting in an overall exposure rate of 1.2 per 1,000 EMS incidents. The most common exposure was to possible meningitis (n = 131, 32.9%), followed by tuberculosis (TB) (n = 68, 17.1%), viral respiratory infections (VRIs) such as influenza or H1N1 (n = 61, 15.4%), and body fluid splashes to skin or mucous membranes (n = 56, 14.1%). Body fluid splashes involving the eyes accounted for 41 cases (10.3%). Only six cases (1.5%) of needlestick injuries were reported. Three hundred thirty-two of all cases (83.6%) were considered true exposures to an infectious hazard, of which 177 (53.3%) were actually confirmed. Half of all exposures required only follow-up with the ICO (52.6%). One hundred twenty-seven cases (31.9%) required follow-up at a designated occupational health services or emergency department. Of these, only 23 cases (18.1%) required treatment. There was a significant trend of increasing incidence of VRI exposures from 2008 to 2009 (6.3% vs. 26.8%, p < 0.001), while a significant decrease in TB exposures was experienced during the same year (22.9% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Trends in our data suggest increasing exposures to viral respiratory illnesses, whereas exposures to needlestick injuries were relatively infrequent.

The sample is parents who were hourly service-sector workers prior to the pandemic, had a young child between the ages of 3 and 8, and were at least partially responsible for their children's school and/or care in Fall 2020 (N = 676); half of the sample were non-Hispanic Black, 22% were Hispanic, and 18% are non-Hispanic White. Parents were asked to complete 30 days of daily surveys about whether their care and school arrangements went smoothly and as predicted that day, about their mood, parenting behaviors, and children's behavior. Results showed that daily disruptions to care and school were common, with families reporting a disruption on 24% of days. Families with children in exclusively remote schooling experienced more frequent disruption than families with children in in-person care or school. For all families, care or school disruptions were related to worse child behavior, more negative parental mood, and increased likelihood of losing temper and punishment. Within-family mediation suggests that parents' difficulties supporting children's learning, and to a lesser degree their mood and parenting behaviors, partially mediate effects of disruptions on child behavior.

We observed that the virus maintains a low preference for 'GGG' codon for glycine (3%) in its genome. We also observed multiple putative introns of 26-44 nucleotide (nt) length in the genomic region between the coding regions of Nsp10 and RPol in the viral ORF1ab, like several other beta-coronaviruses of similar infectivity levels. It appears that the virus employs a dual strategy to ensure unhindered replication within the host. One of the strategies employ a (- )1 frameshift translation event through programmed ribosomal slippage at the ribosomal slippage site in the ORF1ab. The alternate strategy relies on intron excision to generate a read through frame. The presence of 'GGG' in this conserved ribosomal slippage site ensures adequate tRNA in cytoplasm to match the codon, implying no additional frameshift translation due to ribosomal stalling. With fewer replication events, viral load remains low and resulting in asymptomatic cases. We suggest that this strategy is the primary reason for the prevalence of asymptomatic cases in the disease, enabling the virus to spread rapidly.","output":"Complexities in viral replication strategies as a potential explanation for prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in Covid-19 infections: analytical observation on SARS-Cov2 genome characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The abundance of courses available in a university often overwhelms students as they must select courses that are relevant to their academic interests and satisfy their requirements.

DESIGN: Mixed methods approach involving an online cross-sectional survey (conducted between 19(th) April and 11(th) May 2020) and semi-structured telephone interviews (conducted between 27(th) April and 27(th) May 2020). PARTICIPANTS: 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents took part in follow-up interviews. RESULTS: The majority of survey respondents (85.7%) considered it important for their children to receive routine vaccinations on schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, several barriers to vaccination were identified. These included a lack of clarity around whether vaccination services were operating as usual, particularly amongst respondents from lower income households and those self-reporting as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity; difficulties in organising vaccination appointments; and fears around contracting COVID-19 while attending general practice. Concerns about catching COVID-19 while accessing general practice were weighed against concerns about children acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease if they did not receive scheduled routine childhood vaccinations. Many parents and guardians felt their childs risk of acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease was low as the implementation of stringent physical distancing measures (from March 23(rd) 2020) meant they were not mixing with others. CONCLUSION: To promote routine childhood vaccination uptake during the current COVID-19 outbreak, further waves of COVID-19 infection, and future pandemics, prompt and sustained national and general practice level communication is needed to raise awareness of vaccination service continuation and the importance of timely vaccination, and invitation-reminder systems for vaccination need to be maintained.

Milk removal during breastfeeding can be impacted by infant and maternal factors other than NS use. The aim of this study was to control electric breast pump vacuum strength, pattern and duration across multiple study sessions to determine if NS use reduces milk removal from the breast. METHODS A within-subject study with two groups of breastfeeding mothers (infants < 6 months) were recruited; Control Group (CG): no breastfeeding difficulties; Pain Group (PG) used NS for persistent nipple pain. Mothers completed three randomised 15 min pumping sessions using the Symphony vacuum curve (Medela AG); no NS, fitted NS, and a small NS. Sessions were considered valid where the applied vacuum was within 20 mmHg of the set vacuum. Milk removal was considered as pumped milk volume, and also percentage of available milk removed (PAMR), which is calculated as the pumped volume divided by the estimated milk volume stored in the breast immediately prior to pumping. RESULTS Of 62 sessions (all: n = 31 paired sessions) a total of 11 paired sessions from both PG (n = 03) and CG (n = 08) were valid (subset) with and without a fitted NS. Only 2 small shield sessions were valid and so all small shield measurements were excluded. Both pumped volumes and PAMR were significantly lower with NS use for all data but not for subset data. (All: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 76.5 mL, 69%, Fitted NS: 32.1 mL, 41% respectively (volume p = 0.002, PAMR p = 0.002); Subset: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 83.8 mL, 72%; Fitted NS: 35.2 mL, 40% (volume p = 0.111 and PAMR p = 0.045). The difference in PAMR, but not volume, was statistically significant when analysed by linear mixed modelling. A decrease of 10 mmHg was associated with a 4.4% increase in PAMR (p = 0.017).

A cluster was defined as two or more patients with pneumothorax presenting within three consecutive days. Meteorological factors were compared between days with and without pneumothorax patients. This comparison was based on meteorological data from the day of symptom onset (D), the day before symptom onset (D1), and the difference between those days (D-D1). Meteorological data from the index day (D) were also compared between patients with first episode and recurrence of pneumothorax. RESULTS: The study included 149 (88.7%) men and 19 (11.3%) women.

The treatment of osteoporotic fractures is a major challenge as bone quality is poor, and healing is expected to delay due to the impaired healing properties with respect to bone formation, angiogenesis, and mineralization. Enhancement of osteoporotic fracture healing and function is therefore critical as a major goal in modern fracture management. Previous pre-clinical studies have shown that low-magnitude high-frequency vibration (LMHFV) accelerates osteoporotic fracture healing. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of LMHFV on accelerating trochanteric hip fracture healing and functional recovery. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of LMHFV in accelerating trochanteric hip fracture healing. All fractures undergo cephalomedullary nail fixation. The primary outcome of this study is time to fracture healing by X-ray. Computed tomography (CT) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will also be performed. Blood circulation at the fracture site will be assessed by dynamic perfusion magnetic resonance (MR). Clinical results include functional recovery by muscle strength, timed up and go test (TUG), quality of life questionnaire (SF-36), balancing, falls, and mortality. DISCUSSION: Previous animal studies have demonstrated LMHFV to improve both normal and osteoporotic fracture healing by accelerating callus formation and mineralization. The mechanical stimulation stimulates angiogenesis by significantly enhancing vascular volume and blood flow velocity. This is the first study to translate LMHFV to enhancing hip fracture healing clinically. Positive results would provide a huge impact in the recovery of hip fracture patients and save healthcare costs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04063891.

A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL-6 and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57+DMAB or CXCL9+DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)- in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57+DMAB and CXCL9+DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9+DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57+DMAB mice. Compared with C57+DMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL-6 and TGF- was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9+DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57+DMAB mice.

Here, we show that an ultrahigh magnetic field of 500 T renders the insulator phase of tungsten (W)-doped VO2 metallic. The spin Zeeman effect on the d electrons of the V ions dissociates the dimers in the insulating phase, resulting in the delocalisation of electrons.

A dynamic stochastic epidemic model was developed to produce time-varying population estimates of epidemic parameters including the transmission and infection observation rate. The epidemic and risk models were integrated to produce estimates of subpopulation-stratified probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR for LAC. The probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR were found to vary as extensively between age groups as within age categories combined with the presence of absence of other risk factors, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for age categories alone, let alone the entire population.

Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glycemic and lipid profile of 633 PCOS and 2,172 non-PCOS women from January 2018 to June 2021 were analyzed. The results showed that the prevalence of MetS was 28.0% and 9.4% in PCOS and non-PCOS women, respectively. The prevalence of MetS, hypertention, obesity, central obesity, hyperglycemia and dyslipidaemia was also significantly higher in both PCOS and non-PCOS women with larger NC. Additionally, logistic regression analysis showed that PCOS women in the highest quartile of NC had the highest prevalence of MetS (RR = 9.94, 95%CI: 2.41-40.99) after adjusting for confounding factors, while the association between NC and MetS was much attenuated after adjusting for confounding factors in non-PCOS women. Furthermore, we also identified that the optimal NC cutoff value was 33 cm in PCOS women for the prediction of MetS. The potential mechanism could be attributed to the increased release of adipokines and excessive free fatty acids release from subcutaneous adipose tissue, which consequently precipitate the development of MetS.

We determined the proportions of donor candidates who passed initial telephone health screening, who qualified after diagnostic testing, who presented to the regional CCP donation center, and who completed CCP donation. RESULTS There were 900 CCP donor candidates, including 363 volunteers and 537 referred donors. Of 360 contacted volunteers, 186 (5.7%) were excluded by interview; 133 were referred for additional diagnostic screening, 97 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 87 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 35 CCP donations (9.7% of initial telephone contacts). Among 533 referred donors, 448 (84.1%) were excluded by interview, 71 were referred for additional screening, 48 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 40 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 1 CCP donation (0.2% of initial telephone contacts). CONCLUSION In this community, screening of a high number of candidates yielded a limited number of CCP donations. These observations have important implications for CCP donor recruitment and community pandemic planning.","output":"Screening Donors for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data of bloodstream infections (BSI) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of our study was to compare the incidence and characteristics of blood stream infections (BSI) in hospitalized patients before and during the surge of COVID-19 pandemic in a community hospital in South Bronx. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational comparative study of adult hospitalized patients with BSI admitted before (Jan 1-Feb 28, 2020) and during COVID-19 surge (Mar 1- May 1,2020). The incidence of BSI, patient demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of infections including treatment and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Of the 155 patients with BSI, 64 were before COVID and 91 were during the COVID surge (Table 1). Incidence of BSI was 5.84 before COVID and 6.57 during surge (p = 0.004). Majority of patients during COVID period had ARDS (39.6%), required mechanical ventilation (57%), inotropic support (46.2%), therapeutic anticoagulation (24.2%), proning (22%), rectal tube (28.6%), Tocilizumab (9.9%), and steroids (30.8%) in comparison to pre-COVID (Table 2). Days of antibiotic therapy prior to BSI was 5 days before COVID and 7 during COVID. Mortality was higher among patients with BSI admitted during COVID surge (41.8% vs. 14.1% p < 0.0001). Of 185 BSI events, 71 were Pre-COVID and 114 during surge. Primary BSI were predominant (72%) before COVID contrary to secondary BSI (46%) (CLABSI) during COVID. Time from admission to positive culture was 2.5 days during COVID compared to 0.9 pre-COVID. Majority of BSI during COVID period were monomicrobial (93%) and hospital acquired (50%) (p=0.001). Enterococcus (20.2%), E.coli (13.2%), and MSSA (12.3%) were predominant microbes causing BSI during COVID vs. MRSA (15.5%), Streptococci (15.5%), and S. pneumoniae (14.1%) before COVID (Figure 1). In multivariate logistic regression, Enterococcal coinfection was associated with COVID positivity (OR 2.685, p = 0.038), mechanical ventilation (OR 8.739, p = 0.002), and presence of COPD/Asthma (OR 2.823, p = 0.035). [Image: see text] Comparison of Microorganisms Isolated in the BSI [Image: see text] X-axis represents the total number of BSI events whereas the number at the end of each bar represents the percentage [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Higher incidence of secondary BSI (CLABSI) due to Enterococcus spp. was observed during the surge of COVID-19 infection in the South Bronx.

This motivates the widely accepted idea from Lin (Nat Lang Semant 6:201C243, 1998) that Mandarin does not have genuine distributive universal quantifiers, and mei-NPs are disguised plural definites, which thus need doua distributive operator (or an adverbial universal quantifier in Lee (Studies on Quantification in Chinese.

This paper defends the opposite view that mei-NPs are true universal quantifiers while dou is not. Dou is truth-conditionally vacuous but carries a presupposition that its prejacent is the strongest among its alternatives (Liu in Linguist Philos 40(1):61C95, 2017b). The extra presupposition triggers Maximize Presupposition (Heim in: Semantik: Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgenssischen Forschung, pp 487-535. de Gruyter, Berlin, 1991), which requires [dou S] block [S] whenever dous presupposition is satisfied.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with a representative sample (development) and a case-control sample (validation). SETTING: The two largest Swiss prisons. PARTICIPANTS: (1) Development sample: all male persons detained in P&ouml;schwies, Zurich (n = 365); (2) Validation sample: case-control sample of male persons detained in Champ-Dollon, Geneva (n = 192, matching 1:3 for participants at risk for severe course of COVID-19 and participants without risk factors). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CIRA combined seven risk factors identified by the World Health Organization and the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health as predictive of severe COVID-19 to derive an absolute risk increase in mortality rate: Age &ge;60 years, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, immunodeficiency and cancer. RESULTS: Based on the development sample, we proposed a three-level classification: average (&lt;3.7), elevated (3.7-5.7) and high (&gt;5.7) risk. In the validation sample, the CIRA identified all individuals identified as vulnerable by national recommendations (having at least one risk factor). The category &ldquo;elevated risk&rdquo; maximised sensitivity (1) and specificity (0.97). The CIRA had even higher capacity in discriminating individuals vulnerable according to clinical evaluation (a four-level risk categorisation based on a consensus of medical staff). The category &ldquo;elevated risk&rdquo; maximised sensitivity and specificity (both 1). When considering the individuals classified as extremely high risk by medical staff, the category &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; had a high discriminatory capacity (sensitivity =0.89, specificity =0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The CIRA scores have a high discriminative ability and will be important in custodial settings to support decisions and prioritise actions using a standardised valid assessment method. However, as knowledge on risk factors for COVID-19 mortality is still limited, the CIRA may be considered preliminary. Underlying data will be updated regularly on the website (http://www.prison-research.com), where the CIRA algorithm is freely available.","output":"COVID-19 Inmate Risk Appraisal (CIRA): development and validation of a screening tool to assess COVID-19 vulnerability in prisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the year 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has spread globally at a tremendous pace.

Diagnosis of LRTIs relies mostly on clinical symptoms and is not fully satisfactory. Influenza laboratory diagnosis improves the efficiency of prophylaxis or treatment of influenza by antiviral molecules and has a strong impact on the cost-effectiveness of curative treatment. Inappropriate treatment of patients may result in spreading of resistant strains. Molecular diagnostics play a central role in the surveillance and response of pandemic influenza due to highly pathogenic strains. Real-time assays can be used for diagnosis or surveillance purposes in humans and animals, and microarrays can be used to identify and monitor the spread of dangerous variants. Molecular assays are also useful to identify and distinguish influenza, other respiratory viruses and bacteria, although their cost-effectiveness must be proven on a large scale. As new antiviral options will be available to clinicians, a better treatment choice will benefit the patient and community. Recent progress in molecular techniques will be reviewed. Examples of real-time assays for the detection of influenza viruses, including the highly pathogenic influenza A strains H5N1 and H7N7, will be discussed. Promising new techniques that allow detailed genotyping of viruses or multiplex detection of several respiratory pathogens from a unique specimen will also be discussed.

The bactericidal activities against A. baumannii and prophylactic effects of the fusion protein were further evidenced by a significant reduction in the bacterial load in the organs and blood. In addition, the candidate vaccine could provide broad protection against lethal challenges with a variety of A. baumannii strains.

A shortage of respirators can be expected during a pandemic. The availability of surgical N95 FFRs can potentially be increased by incorporating FDA clearance requirements in the NIOSH respirator approval process. METHODS: Fluid resistance of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs, and FDA-cleared surgical N95 FFRs and surgical masks was tested using the ASTM F1862 method at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities and compared with the results from a third-party independent laboratory. Blood penetration through different layers of filter media of masks were also analyzed visually. RESULTS: Four N95 FFR models showed no test failures at both velocities.

In this study, we investigated and compared outcomes of Ivermectin-Doxycycline vs. Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin combination therapy COVID19 patients with mild to moderate disease.Methods Patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, tested positive by RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection at Chakoria Upazilla Health Complex, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, were included in this study. Patients were divided randomly into two groups: Ivermectin 200gm/kg single dose + Doxycycline 100 mg BID for 10days in group A, and Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg 1st day, then200mg BID for 9days + Azithromycin 500 mg daily for 5 days in group B. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was repeated in all symptomatic patients on the second day onward without symptoms, or, for those who were asymptomatic (throughout the process), on the 5th day after taking medication and repeated every two days onward if the result is positive. Time to negative PCR and time to full symptomatic recovery was measured for each group.Results All subjects in the Ivermectin-Doxycycline group (group A) reached a negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2, at a mean of 8.93days, and all reached symptomatic recovery, at a mean of 5.93days, with 55.10% symptom-free by the 5th day. In the Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromcyin group (group B), 96.36% reached a negative PCR at a mean of 6.99days and were symptoms-free at 9.33days. Group A patients had symptoms that could have been caused by the medication in 31.67% of patients, including lethargy in 14(23.3%), nausea in 11(18.3%), and occasional vertigo in 7(11.66%) of patients. In Group B, 46.43% had symptoms that could have been caused by the medication, including 13(23.21%) mild blurring of vision and headache;22(39.2%) increased lethargy and dizziness, 10(17.85%) occasional palpitation, and 9(16.07%) nausea and vomiting.Conclusion The Ivermectin-Doxycycline combination showed a trend toward superiority to the Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin combination therapy in the case of patients with mild to moderate COVID19 disease, though the difference in time to becoming symptom-free and the difference in time to negative PCR was not statistically significant.","output":"A Randomized Trial of Ivermectin-Doxycycline and Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin therapy on COVID19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I examine to what extend the financial crisis of 2008 affected levels of individual satisfaction with governments in general and three policy areas in particular; the economy, health services and education. I use data from the European Social Survey (9 rounds, 2002-2018, 14 countries, approx.195000 observations). Running Interrupted Time Series regressions I find that, on aggregate, there was a decrease of satisfaction with the government and the economy immediately after the crisis, but an increase for health and educational services. Longer term, satisfaction gradually increased for all the four indicators examined. In separate regressions for each country, a consistent pattern of behavior emerges. Where the short-term effect on satisfaction was negative, the long-term effect was positive, and vice versa. The switch, from short-term negative to long-term positive effect, could be attributed to the successful efforts of governments to correct the immediate adverse effects of the crisis. On the contrary, some individuals seeing the problems other countries faced, applauded their own governments short term performance in handling the crisis. With the passing of time however, they gradually became more critical.

Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases. ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure. There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.","output":"Respiratory conditions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Important considerations regarding novel treatment strategies to reduce mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, leading to neurodegeneration and manifesting as a variety of symptoms. These can include invisible symptoms, not externally evident to others, such as fatigue, mood disorders, cognitive impairments, pain, bladder/bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and vision changes. Invisible symptoms are highly prevalent in people living with MS, with multifactorial etiology and potential to impact the disease course. Patient experiences of these symptoms include both physical and psychosocial elements, which when unaddressed negatively influence many aspects of quality of life and perception of health. Despite the high impact on patient lives, gaps persist in awareness and management of these hidden symptoms. The healthcare provider and patient author experiences brought together here serve to raise the profile of invisible symptoms and review strategies for a team-based approach to comprehensive MS care. We summarize the current literature regarding the prevalence and etiology of invisible symptoms to convey the high likelihood that a person living with MS will contend with one or more of these concerns. We then explore how open communication between people living with MS and their care team, stigma mitigation, and shared decision-making are key to comprehensive management of invisible symptoms. We recommend validated screening tools and technological advancements that may be incorporated into MS care to regularly monitor these symptoms, offering insight into how healthcare providers can both educate and listen to patients, with the goal of improved patient quality of life. By pairing clinical knowledge with an understanding and consideration of the patient perspective, providers will be equipped to foster a patient-centered dialogue that encourages shared decision-making.

Hypocalcemia is a common laboratory finding in critically ill patients. Data regarding levels of calcium in SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with hypocalcemia could have a worse outcome. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and included all patients who had any serum calcium measurement in the first 72 hours since hospital admission. Main objective was to investigate the relation of low serum calcium with adverse outcome, measured by the requirement of high oxygen support C defined as high flow nasal cannula oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and/or invasive ventilation-, intensive care unit admission or death. Results A total of 316 patients were included in the study. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-74), 65% were men. Hypocalcemia within 72 hours since hospital admission was present in 63% of patients. A higher number of patients in the hypocalcemia group required high oxygen support during hospitalization (49% vs 32%; p = 0,01) and were admitted to the ICU (42% vs 26%; p = 0,005).

The increase in students working hours due to COVID-19 and the switch to a digital teaching format raised the question as to how a successful and flexible educational concept can be created online in this context. A blended-learning strategy in combination with a competency model for interprofessional learning was chosen as theoretical reference point for implementation. Based on a module for academic poster presentation in front of an interprofessional plenum, the sequence of the learning process organization in the phases kick-off, self-directed learning and online seminar is exemplified and discussed with regard to its suitability for digital interprofessional teaching. Implementation: During implementation it was important to clearly define the modules scope and sequence at the very beginning. The use of screencasts enabled students to individually pace their learning during the preparatory self-directed learning phase. Embedding assignments in the screencasts served to aid students in their learning. The synchronous exchange in interprofessional small groups was experienced as profitable for the own poster production. Several students perceive their own poster presentation in digital format as an increase in competence and a basis for future academic presentations.

However, individual social contact data and population mobility data can offer near real-time proxy information. Aim To compare social contact data and population mobility data with respect to their ability to predict transmission dynamics during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany. Methods We quantified the change in social contact patterns derived from self-reported contact survey data collected by the German COVIMOD study from 04/2020-06/2020 (compared to the pre-pandemic period), and estimated the percentage mean reduction in the effective reproduction number R(t) over time. We compared these results to the ones based on R(t) estimates from open-source mobility data and to R(t) values provided by the German Public Health Institute. Results We observed the largest reduction in social contacts (90%, compared to pre-pandemic data) in late April corresponding to the strictest contacts reduction measures. Thereafter, the reduction in contacts dropped continuously to a minimum of 73% in late June. R(t) estimates based on social contacts underestimated measured R(t) values slightly in the time of strictest contact reduction measures but predicted R(t) well thereafter. R(t) estimates based on mobility data overestimated R(t) considerably throughout the study. Conclusions R(t) prediction accuracy based on contact survey data was superior to the one based on population mobility data, indicating that measuring changes in mobility alone is not sufficient for understanding changes in transmission dynamics triggered by public health measures.","output":"Individual social contact data reflected SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics during the first wave in Germany better than population mobility data - an analysis based on the COVIMOD study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We document that during market shocks that cause large drops in firm value (e.g., COVID-19), firms with more state-endorsed antitakeover provisions (ATPs) experience smaller declines in value.

Persons with influenza can develop complications that result in hospitalization and death. These are most commonly respiratory related, but cardiovascular or neurologic complications or exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions may also occur. Patterns of complications observed during pandemics may differ from typical influenza seasons, and characterizing variations in influenza-related complications can provide a better understanding of the impact of pandemics and guide appropriate clinical management and planning for the future. Methods. Using a population-based surveillance system, we compared clinical complications using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis codes in adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza (n = 5270) or 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm09; n = 4962). Results. Adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were younger (median age, 47 years) than those with seasonal influenza (median age, 68 years; P < .01), and differed in the frequency of certain underlying medical conditions. Whereas there was similar risk for many influenza-associated complications, after controlling for age and type of underlying medical condition, adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were more likely to have lower respiratory tract complications, shock/sepsis, and organ failure than those with seasonal influenza. They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, or die. Young adults, in particular, had 2C4 times the risk of severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 than persons of the same ages with seasonal influenza. Conclusions.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a rare disease that can cause severe dehydration along with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia because of renal tubular unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. Autosomal dominant PHA1 (ADPHA1, OMIM #177735) is caused by inactivating mutations in the NR3C2 gene, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor, and it can lead to renal salt-wasting, dehydration, and failure to thrive during infancy. Here, we report a case of a 20-day-old female neonate who presented as severe dehydration with hyponatremia and polyuria. We suspected that her diagnosis might be PHA1 based on markedly elevated plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels. For the genetic diagnosis of PHA1, we performed targeted exome sequencing of all causative genes of PHA1, but the result was negative. We confirmed by chromosomal microarray that a novel heterozygous microdeletion was found in the 4q31.23 region spanning exons 7-9 of the NR3C2 gene, and the patient was diagnosed with ADPHA1.

Therefore, to get deeper in this topic, between October 2020 and March 2021, we carried out an observational study in the pediatric primary care setting in Italy. Methods: The study enrolled patients with Covid-19 disease (cases);patients with suspicious symptoms but negative swab;close contacts of Covid-19 cases. The follow-up was 28 days for patients with Covid-19 disease, 14 days for the other subjects enrolled. Results: 1947 patients aged 0-13 were enrolled: 465 with Covid-19 disease;549 with suspicious symptoms but negative swab;933 close contacts of Covid-19 cases. 130 subjects with Covid-19 were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Among the others, in children aged 0-2 the most frequent symptom was rhinitis (41%) followed by fever (38%) and cough (31%). In children aged 3-13 the most frequent symptom was headache (30%) followed by rhinitis (23%), asthenia (18%), fever (16%), cough (11%). No symptoms alone were sufficient to induce or rule out the suspicion of the Covid-19 disease diagnosis. A multiple logistic regression analysis, conducted for the purpose, allowed to build a score capable of inducing disease suspicion in patients older than 2 years of age, based on: fever, rash, rhinitis, headache and asthenia.

They have rightfully prioritised reducing the spread of the virus through social distancing interventions. However, shuttered business and widespread restrictions on travel and mobility have led to an economic collapse with increasing uncertainty of how quickly recovery will be achieved. METHODS: The authors carried out a review of publicly available information on the economic interventions countries have put in place to ameliorate the impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: The strategies and scale of economic interventions have been broad, ranging from 2.5% to a reported 50% of Gross Domestic Product. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions and restart economies in different ways. There is therefore evolving, real-world data that should be used dynamically by governments and policymakers. The strategies on restarting the economy must be balanced against the uncertainty of a possible second wave of COVID-19. A nuanced approach to easing restrictions needs to take into account not only immediate risk to life but longer-term risks of widening inequalities and falling life expectancy.","output":"Economic interventions to ameliorate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and health: an international comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with thrombosis. We conducted a cohort study of consecutive patients, suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection presented to the emergency department. We investigated haemostatic differences between SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative patients, with dedicated coagulation analysis. The 519 included patients had a median age of 66 years, and 52.5% of the patients were male. Twenty-six percent of the patients were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2.PCR positive patients had increased levels of fibrinogen and (active) von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and decreased levels of protein C and 2-macroglobulin compared to the PCR negative patients. In addition, we found acquired activated protein C resistance in PCR positive patients. Furthermore, we found that elevated levels of factor VIII and VWF and decreased levels of ADAMTS-13 were associated with an increased incidence of thrombosis in PCR positive patients. In conclusion, we found that PCR positive patients had a pronounced prothrombotic phenotype, mainly due to an increase of endothelial activation upon admission to the hospital. These findings show that coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19 at risk for thrombosis.","output":"Haemostatic differences between SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and negative patients at the time of hospital admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow have potent stabilizing effects for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, low efficiency and survival in MSC homing to injured lung tissue remains to be solved. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether large intergenic noncoding RNA (LincRNA)-p21 promote MSC migration and survival capacity through hypoxic preconditioning in vitro. METHODS: MSCs were cultured and divided into the normoxia culture group (20% O2) and hypoxia culture group (1% O2). To determine roles and mechanisms, lentivirus vector-mediated LincRNA-p21 knockdown of MSCs and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) inhibitor KC7F2 were introduced. Additionally, MSC migration was analyzed by scratch test and transwell migration assays. MSC proliferation was tested by cell counting kit-8 and trypan blue dye. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD stained flow cytometry. Moreover, LincRNA-p21 and HIF-1 mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and HIF-1 and CXCR4/7 protein were assayed by western blot (WB) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis protein caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 were investigated by WB analysis. Considering interactions between VHL and HIF-1 under LincRNA-p21 effect, co-immunoprecipitation was detected. RESULTS: Hypoxic preconditioning MSC promoted migration capacity and MSC survival than normoxia culture group. MSCs induced by hypoxic preconditioning evoked an increase in expression of LincRNA-p21, HIF-1, and CXCR4/7(both were chemokine stromal-derived factor-1(SDF-1) receptors). Contrarily, blockade of LincRNA-p21 by shRNA and HIF-1 inhibitor KC7F2 abrogated upregulation of hypoxic preconditioning induced CXCR4/7 in MSCs, cell migration, and survival. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that hypoxic preconditioning isolated VHL and HIF-1 protein by increasing HIF-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic preconditioning was identified as a promoting factor of MSC migration and survival capacity.

Diagnostics was quickly ramped up worldwide based on the detection of viral RNA. Based on the scientific knowledge for pre-existing coronaviruses, it was expected that the RNA of this novel coronavirus will be detected at significant rates from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals due to existence of non-infectious RNA. To increase the efficacy of diagnostics, surveillance, screening and pandemic control, rapid methods, such as antigen tests, are needed for decentralized testing and to assess infectiousness. The objectives were to verify analytical sensitivity and specificity, and assess the clinical sensitivity, specificity and usability of a novel automated mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 test based on sophisticated optical laser technology detecting viral structure proteins. Analytical performance was verified using bacterial and viral preparations. Clinical performance of the test was evaluated against qRT-PCR in a retrospective study with nasopharyngeal swab specimens (N=211) collected from symptomatic patients suspected of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections. Sensitivity and specificity of the mariPOC test were 92.3% (12/13) and 100.0% (198/198), respectively. The test's limit of detection was 22 PFU/test and it had no cross-reactions with the tested respiratory microbes. Our study shows that the mariPOC can detect infectious individuals already in 20 minutes while clinical sensitivity close to qRT-PCR is achieved in two hours or less. The test targets conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, making it robust against strain variations. The new test is a promising and versatile tool for syndromic testing of symptomatic cases and for high capacity infection control screening.","output":"Clinical Validation of Automated and Rapid mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This pilot study assessed the effectiveness and acceptability of personalized nutrition intervention for mobile food pantry users.

BACKGROUND Fully bioresorbable scaffolds are a novel approach to treatment for coronary narrowing that provides transient vessel support with drug delivery capability without the long-term limitations of metallic drug-eluting stents. However, a potential drawback of the bioresorbable scaffold is the potential for disruption of the strut network when overexpanded. Conversely, the structural discontinuity of the polymeric struts at a late stage is a biologically programmed fate of the scaffold during the course of bioresorption. METHODS The ABSORB cohort B trial is a multicenter single-arm trial assessing the safety and performance of the Absorb BVS in the treatment of 101 patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions. The current analysis included 51 patients with 143 OCT pullbacks who underwent OCT at baseline and follow-up. The presence of acute disruption or late discontinuities was diagnosed by the presence on OCT of stacked, overhung struts or isolated intraluminal struts disconnected from the expected circularity of the device. RESULTS Of 51 patients with OCT imaging post-procedure, acute scaffold disruption was observed in 2 patients (3.9%), which could be related to overexpansion of the scaffold at the time of implantation. One patient had a target lesion revascularization that was presumably related to the disruption. Of 49 patients without acute disruption, late discontinuities were observed in 21 patients. There were no major adverse cardiac events associated with this finding except for 1 patient who had a non-ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization. CONCLUSIONS Acute scaffold disruption is a rare iatrogenic phenomenon that has been anecdotally associated with anginal symptoms, whereas late strut discontinuity is observed in approximately 40% of patients and could be viewed as a serendipitous OCT finding of a normal bioresorption process without clinical implications.

METHODS During February and March 2011, all 450 ICUs in public hospitals in Italy were invited to take part in an online survey. The questionnaire focused on ICU characteristics, methods used to prevent, diagnose, and treat infections, and antimicrobials prescribing policies. The frequency of each reported practice was calculated as a percentage of the total number of units answering the question. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 38.8% (175 of the 450 ICUs contacted) with homogeneous distribution across the country and in terms of unit type. RESULTS Eighty-eight percent of the responding facilities performed periodical surveillance cultures on all patients. In 71% of patients, cultures were also collected on admission. Endotracheal/bronchial aspirates were the most frequently cultured specimens at both time points. Two-thirds of the responding units had never performed screening cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Around 67% of the ICUs reported the use of antimicrobial de-escalation strategies during the treatment phase. In general, the use of empirical antimicrobial drug regimens was appropriate. Although the rationale for the choice was not always clearly documented, the use of a combination therapy was preferred over antibiotic monotherapy. The preferred first-line agents for invasive candidiasis were fluconazole and an echinocandin (64% and 25%, respectively). Two-thirds of the ICUs monitored vancomycin serum levels and administered it by continuous infusion in 86% of cases. For certain antibiotics, reported doses were too low to ensure effective treatment of severe infections in critically ill patients; conversely, inappropriately high doses were administered for certain antifungal drugs. CONCLUSIONS Although infection control policies and management practices are generally appropriate in Italian ICUs, certain aspects, such as the extensive use of multidrug empirical regimens and the inappropriate antimicrobial dosing, deserve careful management and closer investigation.","output":"A survey on infection management practices in Italian ICUs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously called 2019 novel CoV, emerged from China in late December 2019. This virus causes CoV disease-19 (COVID-19), which has been proven a global pandemic leading to a major outbreak. As of June 19, 2020, the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed more than 8.7 million confirmed cases in over 200 countries/regions.

Here, we demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK? synthetic peptide scaffolds act as antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells. Critically, SARS-BLOCK? peptides are able to potently and competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2, the main cellular entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In order to create this potential therapeutic antidote-vaccine, we designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted peptide folding, and characterized behavior of a novel set of synthetic peptides. The biomimetic technology is modeled off the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and modified to provide enhanced stability and folding versus the truncated wildtype sequence. These novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities for ACE2 and a neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and demonstrate significant reduction of infection in nanomolar doses. We also demonstrate that soluble ACE2 abrogates binding of RBD to neutralizing antibodies, which we posit is an essential immune-evasive mechanism of the virus. SARS-BLOCK? is designed to uncloak the viral ACE2 coating mechanism, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies with the intention of stimulating a specific neutralizing antibody response. Our peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise for future studies evaluating specificity and sensitivity of immune responses to our antidote-vaccine. In summary, SARS-BLOCK? peptides are a promising COVID-19 antidote designed to combine the benefits of a therapeutic and vaccine, effectively creating a new generation of prophylactic and reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses can be enhanced rather than blunted.","output":"Peptide Antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Vector Autoregressive Integrated with Exogenous Variable (VARIX) model can be used to examine the relationship between covid-19 positive case numbers (as endogenous variables) and population growth rate (as exogenous variables) while predicting covid-19 positive case numbers In this paper, we apply the VARIX model to covid-19 phenomena in two regencies/cities in West Java Province, Bandung and Purwakarta The results of the analysis show that the VARIX model is a suitable model used to describe the intended relationship The VARIX model has a good forecasting ability characterized by a relatively small MAPE value The exogenous variables show positive results, so it can be concluded that the positive covid-19 numbers in Bandung City and Purwakarta Regency have a positive correlation with the population growth rate in West Java Province ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing All rights reserved","output":"The application of vector autoregressive integrated with exogenous variable to model the relationship between covid-19 positive numbers with population growth rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study, adopting the Foucauldian lenses of citizenship, investigates how a group of students understand the prevailing social discourses and how such understanding and perceptions influence students sense of citizenship and coping strategies.

Given the physical health problems faced by clergy, understanding where physical health falls within the priorities of seminary students, the ways students conceptualize physical health, and how seminary students do or do not attend to their physical health in the years immediately prior to becoming clergy, can inform intervention development for both seminary students and clergy. Moreover, understanding and shaping the health practices of aspiring clergy may be particularly impactful, with cascading effects, as clergy serve as important role models for their congregants. Drawing on 36 in-depth, qualitative interviews with first-year seminary students, this study examines the complex dynamics between religious frameworks related to physical health, explicit intentions to maintain healthy practices, and reported physical health behaviors. Our findings suggest that even students who deploy religious frameworks in relation to their physical healthand who, as a result, possess positive intentions to implement and maintain healthy behaviorsoften report being unable to live up to their aspirations, especially in the face of barriers to health practices posed by the seminary program itself.

METHODS: Nationwide cohort study using electronic health care data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases (n= 66,287) and reference group subjects (n=254,969) with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 testing and death records. FINDINGS: People infected with SARS-COV-2 had more than three times the risk of dying over the following year compared with those who remained uninfected (aHR 31, 95%CI 29-33). Short-term mortality (up to 5 weeks post-infection) was significantly higher among COVID-19 group (16230/10 000) than in the reference group (118/10 000). For COVID-19 cases aged 60 years or older, increased mortality persisted until the end of the first year after infection, and was related to increased risk for cardiovascular (aHR 21, 95%CI 18-23), cancer (aHR 15, 95%CI 12-19), respiratory system diseases (aHR 19, 95%CI 12-30), and other causes of death (aHR 18, 95%CI 14-22).

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 628 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. These patients were randomly grouped into a training cohort (60%) and a validation cohort (40%). In the training cohort, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were utilized to identify prognostic factors for in-hospital survival of patients with COVID-19. A nomogram based on the three variables was built for clinical use. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC), concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to evaluate the efficiency of the nomogram in both the training and validation cohorts. RESULTS: Hypertension, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and increased NT-proBNP value were found to be significantly associated with poorer prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The three predictors were further used to build a prediction nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram in the training and validation cohorts was 0.901 and 0.892, respectively.

While social scientists know a fair amount about compliance with these recommendations, we know less about why some people may have been more likely to comply than others. Building on insights from Human Values Theory, we argue that people who are more self-transcendent (i.e. more likely to put others' needs before their own) are more likely to engage in a variety of prosocial health behaviors (PSHB). In a demographically representative survey (N = 1,015) conducted at the pandemic's outset, we find that self-transcendent people were significantly more likely to engage in PSHB;irrespective of partisanship and local COVID-19 transmission rates. Recognizing the limitations of self-reported data, we validate these findings by merging international and interstate phone-tracking data into opinion surveys. We find that, on average, people in both countries and states that place a higher emphasis on self-transcendence values were more likely to engage in social distancing.

Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) is a classical traditional antitumor medicine commonly used in China. However, the potential mechanism of DBD against NSCLC has not yet been expounded. Therefore, this study clarified the potential molecular mechanism and key targets of DBD in NSCLC treatment through several technological advances, such as network pharmacology, molecular docking, and bioinformatics. Firstly, the relative active ingredients and key DBD targets were analyzed, and subsequently, a drug-ingredient-target-disease network diagram was constructed for NSCLC treatment with DBD, resulting in the identification of five main active ingredients and ten core targets according to the enrichment degree. The enrichment analysis revealed that DBD can achieve the purpose of treating NSCLC through the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications. Secondly, the molecular docking approach predicted that quercetin and hederagenin have the best working mechanisms with PDE3A and PTGS1, while the survival analysis results depicted that high PDE3A gene expression has a relatively poor prognosis for NSCLC patients (p < 0.05). Additionally, PDE3A is mainly distributed in the LU65 cell line that originated from Asian population. In summary, our study results showed that DBD can treat NSCLC through the synergistic correlation between multiple ingredients, multiple targets, and multiple pathways, thus effectively improving NSCLC prognosis. This study not only reflected the medicinal value of DBD but also provided a solid structural basis for future new drug developments and targeted therapies.","output":"Utilizing Bioinformatics Technology to Explore the Potential Mechanism of Danggui Buxue Decoction against NSCLC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAs a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, telecommuting has become a new way of working that has not only changed individuals work, but also their health, lifestyle, family and community relationships. However, the impact of telecommuting on diet is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between telecommuting frequency and unhealthy dietary habits among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA total of 33,302 Japanese workers completed an Internet survey about telecommuting and dietary habits. Data from 13,468 office workers who telecommuted were analyzed. Telecommuting frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic was extracted from a questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) of four types of dietary habits, namely, skipping breakfast, solitary eating, lower meal frequency, and meal substitution associated with telecommuting frequency were estimated using multilevel logistic regression. ResultsThe multivariate OR of skipping breakfast was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.03-1.29, p=0.013) for participants who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. Similarly, the multivariate OR of solitary eating, lower meal frequency and meal substitution were 1.44 (95%CI: 1.28-1.63, p<0.001), 2.39 (95%CI: 1.66-3.44, p<0.001), and 1.26 (95%CI: 1.04-1.51, p=0.015) for those who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. There was a statistically significant increase in the dose-response trend in ORs of solitary eating (p for trend <0.001), lower meal frequency (p for trend <0.001), and meal substitution (p for trend =0.001) with increasing telecommuting frequency. ConclusionIncreasing telecommuting frequency was associated with an increasing number of unhealthy dietary habits in Japanese workers. Telecommuting during the COVID-19 pandemic, together with other social changes such as refraining from going out and socializing, is having a significant impact on workers daily lives and behaviors. This study suggests that in addition to challenges related to physical activity, loneliness, and mental health, telecommuters may also be developing unhealthy dietary habits, indicating the need for strategies to help telecommuters manage their nutrition and diet.

Initial efforts to evaluate changes in college drinking have not yet accounted for typical drinking patterns within a semester. METHODS: To fill this gap, we evaluated how college student drinking patterns changed with the onset of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic during spring 2020 relative to spring 2018 and 2019. Participants were 1,365 college students aged 19 and older, including 895 students who reported past-month alcohol use. Daily drinking data were extracted from an online Timeline Followback survey. RESULTS: Negative binomial hurdle models revealed that, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, college student drinkers did not increase their drinking frequency as was typical in late spring semester, and the number of drinks per occasion declined substantially (28% reduction), greater than the change observed from early to late spring 2018 (3% reduction) or spring 2019 (8% increase). This reduction in drinking quantity in spring 2020 was larger for college student drinkers who moved residences because of the pandemic (49% reduction) than students who did not move (21% reduction). Perceptions in pandemic-related changes in drinking also revealed that 83.5% of college student drinkers self-reported that their drinking stayed the same or decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that, on average, college students drank less-not more-during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of living situation in college student drinking behavior. More research is needed to assess alcohol use in other universities, as this information could be utilized in norms-based interventions to further reduce drinking in students who remain at risk.","output":"Is the COVID-19 Pandemic a High-Risk Period for College Student Alcohol Use?

With most studies focusing on COVID-19 disinformation in social media, little attention has been paid to how mainstream news outlets framed COVID-19 narratives compared to alternative sources. To fill this gap, we use cognitive network science and natural language processing to reconstruct time-evolving semantic and emotional frames of 5745 Italian news, that were massively re-shared on Facebook and Twitter, about COVID-19 vaccines.

We sought to evaluate mortality benefit among older persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were taking metformin as compared to those who were not. Design Retrospective cohort study Setting and Participants: 775 nursing home residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 who resided in one of the 134 Community Living Centers (CLC) of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) during March 1, 2020 to May 13, 2020 were included. Methods Using a window of 14 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing, bar coded medication administration records were examined for dispensing of medications for diabetes. The COVID-19 infected residents were divided into groups: 1) residents administered metformin alone or in combination with other medications, 2) residents who used long acting or daily insulin, 3) residents administered other diabetes medications, and 4) residents not administered diabetes medication, including non-diabetics and untreated diabetics. Proportional hazard models adjusted for demographics, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, and renal function. Results Relative to those not receiving diabetes medications, residents taking metformin were at significantly reduced hazard of death (adjusted HR 0.48, 95%CI 0.28, 0.84) over the subsequent 30 days from COVID-19 diagnosis. There was no association with insulin (adjusted HR 0.99, 95% 0.60, 1.64) or other diabetes medications (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38, 1.32). Conclusions and Implications Our data suggests a reduction in 30-day mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents who were on metformin-containing diabetes regimens. These findings suggest a relative survival benefit in nursing home residents on metformin, potentially through its mTOR inhibition effects. A prospective study should investigate the therapeutic benefits of metformin among persons with COVID-19.","output":"Metformin is associated with Decreased 30-day Mortality among Nursing Home Residents Infected with SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extent and impact of neglected diseases has been well documented in the public health and medical science literature However, from a strategic management and organizational perspective, there is a gap in understanding the complex relationships that underpin the functioning of product development partnerships (PDPs) in managing the drug development process This paper focuses on (a) identifying the importance of PDPs in the development of new drugs for neglected and emerging infectious diseases and (b) identifying the key stakeholders and their relationships and (levels of) dependencies in PDPs through the resource dependence lens Our model offers a unique perspective to the strategic alliance literature not only by showing the complex interrelationships among various stakeholders but also in highlighting power, trust, and governance as key challenges Based on our extensive analysis of the literature and the contextualization of the recent novel coronavirus epidemic as a case, we offer conclusions and reflections from a management perspective on the ability of PDPs to mitigate risks related to neglected and emerging infectious diseases ?

Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, particularly when tidal volume is restricted during mechanical ventilation, may experience the most distressing form of dyspnea known as air hunger. Air hunger activates brain pathways known to be involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. These conditions are considered part of the post-intensive care syndrome. These sequelae may be even more prevalent among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Low tidal volume, a mainstay of modern therapy for ARDS is difficult to avoid and is likely to cause air hunger despite sedation. Adjunctive neuromuscular blockade does not prevent or relieve air hunger, but it does prevent the patient from communicating discomfort to caregivers. Consequently, paralysis may also contribute to the development of PTSD. Although research has identified post-ARDS PTSD as a cause for concern and investigators have taken steps to quantify the burden of disease, there is little information to guide mechanical ventilation strategies designed to reduce its occurrence. We suggest such efforts will be more successful if they are directed at the known mechanisms of air hunger. Investigation of the anti-dyspnea effects of sedative and analgesic drugs commonly used in the ICU and their impact on post-ARDS PTSD symptoms is a logical next step. While in practice we often accept negative consequences of life-saving therapies as unavoidable, we must understand the negative sequalae of our therapies and work to minimize them under our primary directive to first, do no harm to our patients.","output":"Dyspnea, Acute Respiratory Failure, Psychological Trauma, and Post-ICU Mental Health: A caution and a call for research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of newly emerging diseases is constantly present in a world where changes occur significantly in climatic, commercial, and ecological conditions, in addition to the development of biomedical investigations in new situations.

The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with elevation of several immune plays as well as inflammatory factors which contributes to cytokine storms. Currently, the detection of CoV-19 RNA is through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of suppressing several kinds of cytokines via the paracrine secretion system. Therefore, MSCs therapy could be game charges in the treatment of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, intravenous IG may be capable of suppressing the high expression of IL-6 by the CoV-19 resulting in lessen disease burden. Anti-inflammatory medications like, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, glycyrrhetinic acid, as well as etoposide may be very advantageous in decreasing the COVID-19 burden because, their mode of action targets the cytokine storms initiated by the CoV-19. It is important to indicate that, these medication does not target the virus itself. Therefore, potent CoV-19 anti-viral medications are needed to completely cure patients with COVID-19. Also, a vaccine is urgently needed to stop the spread of the virus.

Maternal age ranged from 19 to 37 years. The number of first births was 37 (18.5%). All pregnant women were divided into 3 groups by gestational age: Group 1 included 27 (13.5%) pregnant women who had coronavirus infection in the first trimester of pregnancy, Group 2 included 48 (24%) pregnant women who had coronavirus infection in the second trimester, and the Group 3 included 125 (62.5%) pregnant women who had coronavirus infection in the third trimester. Results. The frequency of obstetric complications after novel coronavirus infection increases with gestational age (from 7.4% in the first trimester to 28% in the third trimester). Pregnant women in the second trimester have an increased risk of developing severe forms of novel coronavirus infection and pneumonia (up to 70.8%). The use of recombinant interferon (IFN) alpha-2b in newborns with perinatal exposure to COVID-19 has a preventive effect. Among neonates from COVID-positive mothers who received intranasal recombinant IFN alpha-2b for the prevention only 7.7% of children developed COVID-19, whereas in the group of neonates who did not receive this preventive medicine 20% of children contracted the disease.

The data were collected during June 10C17, 2020 using the psychosocial FCV-19S. RESULTS: COVID-19 quarantine was negatively correlated with the physical, nutritional, psychosocial life and work aspects of the Saudi Arabias population (P < 0.05). As a result of the correlation analysis, gender, sociodemographic status and having a family member dying of COVID-19, marital status (single), monthly income (<3000) and occupation (student), and lost a job or businesses were significantly associated with fear of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the participants reported a reduction in their physical activity by 59%, whereas 26.5% of participants showed an increase of body weight. Moreover, 23% of participants lost their jobs during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown period was associated with an increase in the COVID-19 fear score. The degree FCV-19S was varied in different categories in several aspects. Low levels of physical activity and weight gained were observed during the lockdown period.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic quarantine on physical, nutritional, psychosocial life and work aspects in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Op 26 januari was het de Dag van het respect voor de zorg.

To cope with this issue, we use fuzzy logic (FL) as one of the most suitable methods in modeling systems with high uncertainty and complexity. We intend to make use of the advantages of FL in decisions on cases that need to treat in ICU. In this study, an interval type-2 fuzzy expert system is proposed for prediction of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. For this prediction task, we also developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Finally, the results of these fuzzy systems are compared to some well-known classification methods such as Naive Bayes (NB), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), Decision Tree (DT), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

Electromagnetic navigation with or without endobronchial ultrasound for diagnosis of the above has been well described. Bronchoscopic Trans Bronchial Access Tool is a novel endoscopic technique that creates a virtual pathway to the lesion and is less limited by location of the airway. The CrossCountryTM Transbronchial Access Tool (CovidienTM, Plymouth, MN, USA) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved off airway device that utilizes a catheter equipped guide sheath for a trans-parenchymal approach to a distal lesion. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) is a real-time onsite extrathoracic navigational modality used in the bronchoscopy suite that allows for an open working channel. All three of the above modalities can have reasonable diagnostic yields when used independently. While utilizing the above tools we frequently found ourselves in situations where one technique was not enough, prompting the use of a combination of modalities to obtain the most efficient and accurate diagnosis. We are reporting the feasibility and safety of utilizing these three modalities in conjunction with one another. Methods Patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography underwent a navigation bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. CBCT and radial ultrasound was used in every case to confirm navigation to the target lesion. Lesions without definitive airways leading to them were accessed with the transbronchial access tool (TBAT). Results Electromagnetic bronchoscopy using CBCT and radial US was performed on 22 patients from April 2016 to September 2016. The TBAT tool was used in 7 patients. The overall diagnostic yield was 77.2% (17 of 22). Diagnostic yield of with use TBAT was 100% (7 of 7). There were no complications. Average case length was 79.95 (range, 50-124) minutes and average fluoroscopy time was 10.39 (1-21.7) minutes.

The recent outbreaks of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 have rapidly formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and isolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain the outbreak. Based on trajectory provided by the big data and the mean field theory, we establish an aggregated risk mean field that contains information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency enabling fast update. We then propose an objective individual epidemic risk scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop statistical inference and machine learning methods for detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as hospital and station. HiRES-p score seems to be an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk.

The imposition of tariffs seriously disturbs the global trade and supply chain operations. This paper studies a supply chain composed of an overseas manufacturer, a domestic supplier and a third-party integrated international logistics service provider. A three-level decentralized leader-follower decision-making model and its variant--leader-follower alliance decision-making models are established, and the influences of revenue sharing and cost sharing on the three-level decentralized decision-making are analyzed. The results show that it is difficult for the supply chain to achieve coordination when the transportation and insurance costs are considered in the tariff cost. The increase of tariff rates will reduce the profits of all parties and the overall profit of the supply chain, and weaken the dominant position of the supplier in the supply chain. Revenue sharing can improve the supply chain performance;the performance of the whole supply chain cannot be improved or may even deteriorate by sharing the transportation cost alone. The study can provide practitioners with implications for how to carry effective cooperation and coordination in the supply chain and how to effectively reduce the influence of tariffs in the global trade system.","output":"Decision-Making of Transnational Supply Chain Considering Tariff and Third-Party Logistics Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We design and develop a new high performance implementation of a fast direct LU-based solver using low-rank approximations on massively parallel systems. The LU factorization is the most time-consuming step in solving systems of linear equations in the context of analyzing acoustic scattering from large 3D objects. The matrix equation is obtained by discretizing the boundary integral of the exterior Helmholtz problem using a higher-order Nystr?m scheme. The main idea is to exploit the inherent data sparsity of the matrix operator by performing local tile-centric approximations while still capturing the most significant information. In particular, the proposed LU-based solver leverages the Tile Low-Rank (TLR) data compression format as implemented in the Hierarchical Computations on Manycore Architectures (HiCMA) library to decrease the complexity of classical dense direct solvers from cubic to quadratic order. We taskify the underlying boundary integral kernels to expose fine-grained computations. We then employ the dynamic runtime system StarPU to orchestrate the scheduling of computational tasks on shared and distributed-memory systems. The resulting asynchronous execution permits to compensate for the load imbalance due to the heterogeneous ranks, while mitigating the overhead of data motion. We assess the robustness of our TLR LU-based solver and study the qualitative impact when using different numerical accuracies. The new TLR LU factorization outperforms the state-of-the-art dense factorizations by up to an order of magnitude on various parallel systems, for analysis of scattering from large-scale 3D synthetic and real geometries.","output":"Solving Acoustic Boundary Integral Equations Using High Performance Tile Low-Rank LU Factorization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 is a virus which has lead to a global pandemic. Worldwide, more than 100 countries have imposed severe restrictions regarding freedom of movement amongst their citizens in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. These restrictions, which are part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions, have recently been classified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) team and a nominal index measure has been defined for use by the wider international community. We address the use of this index measure to establish the degree and characteristics of control of the transmission rate of the virus within a representative sample of countries in the World and states in the United States of America. Methods Country specific, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deaths (SIRD) models with latent dynamics were constructed using publicly available data for 23 countries and 25 states of the United States of America. Each of the models were linearised and classical frequentist error propagation was applied to them individually. The time varying, observable model parameters were extracted for each day that data was made available. The OxCGRT stringency index, p, was used to regress against these model parameters. The regression of the transmission rate as a function of p in each locale was through a linear parameter _s. In addition, macroscopic indices from the World Bank were used to explore inter-country variation in the measured parameters. Results The world average was _s=0.01 (95% CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) with an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I. 0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior. While lockdown measures have been successful in curbing the spread, our study indicates that removing them too swiftly will result in the resurgence of the spread within one to two months. Reducing the stringency index by 10 will delay reaching the apex by about 6 months, where reducing it by 20 will delay by only four months. During the post-lockdown period it is essential to increase _s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which _s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. The spread of the virus is found to be insensitive to the Gini index and other socio-economic indexes. The typical adjustment time to see the effects of control varied between 1.49 days for Peru and 38.09 days for Sweden. In the United States, the typical adjustment time to see the effects of control varied between 1.41 days for Colorado to 15.91 days for Ohio. Interpretation Given the measured characterisations of each locale, the effects of any change in non-pharmaceutical intervention may be anticipated and predictions can be made regarding the possible case load which is specific to that environment. This is accomplished by specifying an acceptable level of transmission, {beta}_f, given the prevailing economic and social constraints which uniquely determines an overall stringency of intervention level p. As a policy maker, there are possible intervention combinations to choose from and a combination must be selected that achieves p or greater.","output":"Worldwide Effectiveness of Various Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Control Strategies on the Global COVID-19 Pandemic: A Linearised Control Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Systemic vascular involvement in COVID-19 has been identified in several patients: not only endothelial derangement and increased permeability are reported to be early hallmarks of organ damage in patients with COVID-19 but are also the most important cause of worsening of clinical conditions in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These connections are underpinned by a vast array of RNA elements that coordinate RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, each directing mRNA fate from transcription to translation. Consequently, viruses have evolved an arsenal of strategies to target these RNA features and ultimately take control of the pathways they influence, and these strategies contribute to the global shutdown of the host gene expression machinery known as Host Shutoff. This takeover of the host cell is mechanistically orchestrated by a number of non-homologous virally encoded endoribonucleases. Recent large-scale screens estimate that over 70 % of the host transcriptome is decimated by the expression of these viral nucleases. While this takeover strategy seems extraordinarily well conserved, each viral endonuclease has evolved to target distinct mRNA elements. Herein, we will explore each of these RNA structures/sequence features that render messenger RNA susceptible or resistant to viral endonuclease cleavage.

Indeed, neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as fatigue, febrile seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and delirium, are consistently observed in COVID-19. The neurobiological basis of neuropsychiatric COVID-19 symptoms is not fully understood. However, previous evidence about systemic viral infections pointed to an ongoing neuroinflammatory response to viral antigens and proinflammatory mediators/immune cells from the periphery. Microglia cells mediate the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and damage signals, culminating with neurotoxic consequences. Semi-synthetic second-generation tetracyclines, including minocycline (MINO) and doxycycline (DOXY), are safe bacteriostatic agents that have remarkable neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Promising results have been obtained in clinical trials using tetracyclines for major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression.

In the previous study, the presence of the farnesyl group in the structure of 2-arylbenzofurans was found to have positive influences on their pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity. In the present study, we have confirmed the authenticity of the notation based on the PTP1B inhibitory activity of farnesylated 2-arylbenzofurans. Specifically, two farnesylated 2-arylbenzofurans [morusalfurans B (2) and C (3)] showed strong inhibitory effects on PTP1B with IC(50) values of 8.92 and 7.26 M, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of the positive controls [sodium orthovanadate (IC(50) = 15.10 M) and ursolic acid (IC(50) = 11.34 M)]. Besides, two 2-arylbenzofurans [morusalfurans A (1) and F (6)], one flavonoid [morusalnol B (9)], and one geranylated stilbene [morusibene A (11)] exhibited PTP1B inhibition with IC(50) values ranging from 11.02 to 26.56 M. Kinetic studies revealed compounds 2, 3, 6, and 11 as mixed type PTP1B inhibitors, while 1 and 9 are known as noncompetitive. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated that these active compounds can bind with the respective catalytic or/and allosteric sites of PTP1B with negative binding energies and the results are in accordance with that of the kinetic studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time, the PTP1B inhibitory activity of eleven compounds (1C11), as well as the mechanism of action underlying the effects on PTP1B enzyme of the active compounds, were investigated. In vitro and in silico results suggest that the farnesylated 2-arylbenzofurans from M. alba may potentially be utilized as an effective treatment therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications.","output":"Inhibition of PTP1B by farnesylated 2-arylbenzofurans isolated from Morus alba root bark: unraveling the mechanism of inhibition based on in vitro and in silico studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indigenous communities in Bangladesh are comparatively disadvantaged and face several barriers regarding rights.

The objective of this study was to better understand factors leading to this participation gap by capturing the physical activity perspectives of individuals living with SCI. We completed small group interviews with nine individuals living with SCI across the United States. Iterative thematic analysis systematically revealed meaningful core concepts related to physical activity engagement with SCI. Emergent themes revealed challenges to lifestyle physical activity behavior including gaps in physical activity education, isolation during psychological adjustment, and knowledge limitations in community exercise settings. A secondary theme related to the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, highlighting additional environmental constraints affecting participation. Our findings suggest that most physical activity education is delivered during inpatient rehabilitation and is related to physical function. Lifetime physical activity strategies are achieved through self-education and peer networking. Personal motivators for physical activity include secondary condition prevention, while social and emotional barriers prevent regular adherence. These findings can inform the development and delivery of physical activity programs to maximize physical activity engagement in individuals living with chronic SCI.","output":"Staying active after rehab: Physical activity perspectives with a spinal cord injury beyond functional gains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic we have seen a surge in online transactions.

Primary donor-derived infection can be associated with severe and rapidly fatal non-neoplastic disease, and diagnosis is made with high HHV-8 DNAemia. METHODS: We carried out an international survey to investigate the current approach to HHV-8 screening and management in SOT since a protocol has not been established by international guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 51 transplant centers from 15 countries filled out the survey. HHV-8-associated diseases in SOT have been diagnosed during the previous 5 years in 67% of centers. Pre-transplant serological screening is performed in 17 centers (33%) and post-transplant HHV-8 nucleic acid testing (NAT) monitoring is performed in 21 centers (41%). Performing HHV-8 NAT monitoring and serological screening were found associated with having diagnosed in the previous 5 years a non-malignant HHV-8-associated disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serological pre-transplant screening of donors and recipients and post-transplant HHV-8 NAT monitoring recommendations should be standardized. Even though serological assays are not optimal, they could contribute to increasing knowledge on epidemiology and management of HHV-8 associated diseases after SOT.

We have determined the genome sequences of CyHV1 and CyHV2 and compared them with the published CyHV3 sequence. The CyHV1 and CyHV2 genomes are 291,144 and 290,304 bp, respectively, in size, and thus the CyHV3 genome, at 295,146 bp, remains the largest recorded among the herpesviruses. Each of the three genomes consists of a unique region flanked at each terminus by a sizeable direct repeat. The CyHV1, CyHV2, and CyHV3 genomes are predicted to contain 137, 150, and 155 unique, functional protein-coding genes, respectively, of which six, four, and eight, respectively, are duplicated in the terminal repeat. The three viruses share 120 orthologous genes in a largely colinear arrangement, of which up to 55 are also conserved in the other member of the genus Cyprinivirus, anguillid herpesvirus 1. Twelve genes are conserved convincingly in all sequenced alloherpesviruses, and two others are conserved marginally.

This resulted in emergency medicine (EM)-bound students having less specialty experience and exposure to outside programs and practice environments, and fewer opportunities to gain additional Standardized Letters of Evaluation, a cornerstone of the EM residency application. We filled this void by implementing a virtual clerkship. METHODS: We created a two-week virtual, fourth-year visiting clerkship focused on advanced medical knowledge topics, social determinants of health, professional development, and professional identity formation. Students completed asynchronous assignments and participated in small group-facilitated didactic sessions. We evaluated the virtual clerkship with pre- and post-medical knowledge tests and evaluative surveys. RESULTS: We hosted 26 senior medical students over two administrations of the same two-week virtual clerkship. Students had a statistically significant improvement on the medical knowledge post-tests compared to pre-tests (71.7% [21.5/30] to 76.3% [22.9/30]). Students reported being exposed to social determinants of health concepts they had not previously been exposed to. Students appreciated the interactive nature of the sessions; networking with other students, residents, and faculty; introduction to novel content regarding social determinants of health; and exposure to future career opportunities. Screen time, technological issues, and mismatch between volume of content and time allotted were identified as potential challenges and areas for improvement. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that a virtual EM visiting clerkship is feasible to implement, supports knowledge acquisition, and is perceived as valuable by participants. The benefits seen and challenges faced in the development and implementation of our clerkship can serve to inform future virtual clerkships, which we feel is a complement to traditional visiting clerkships even though in-person clerkships have been re-established.","output":"An Emergency Medicine Virtual Clerkship: Made for COVID, Here to Stay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the increasing interest toward sustainability issues in supply chain over the academic and practitioners perspectives, a comprehensive and updated assessment of the existing literature is still negotiated.

These CSs included both compounds with a highly defined target (e.g. mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors) as well as compounds with poorly defined molecular initiation events (e.g. short-chain branched carboxylic acids). The initial project focus was on developing a science-based strategy for read-across (RAx) as an animal-free approach in chemical risk assessment. Moreover, seamless incorporation of new approach method (NAM) data into this process (= NAM-enhanced RAx) was explored. Here, the EU-ToxRisk consortium has collated its scientific and regulatory learnings from this particular project objective. For all CSs, a mechanistic hypothesis (in the form of an adverse outcome pathway) guided the safety evaluation. ADME data were generated from NAMs and used for comprehensive physiological-based kinetic modelling. Quality assurance and data management were optimized in parallel. Scientific and Regulatory Advisory Boards played a vital role in assessing the practical applicability of the new approaches. In a next step, external stakeholders evaluated the usefulness of NAMs in the context of RAx CSs for regulatory acceptance. For instance, the CSs were included in the OECD CS portfolio for the Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment project. Feedback from regulators and other stakeholders was collected at several stages.

METHOD: We performed a retrospective study where medical records of 60 patients with histological diagnosis of allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis from January 2009 to November 2020. In these patients, we studied the incidence of COVID-19 infection, clinical characteristics and prognosis from March to the actual date. RESULTS: Of 60 patients with allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis, 6 (10%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The first case, an 85-year-old woman with a history of metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab and allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis by immunobiological agents in 2018, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 infection in April 2020 without deterioration of renal function in controls at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The second case, a 51-year-old woman with a history of large B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation and progression to multiple myeloma of lambda light chains and allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis due to chemotherapy since 2019, admitted for acute pyelonephritis and PRES syndrome secondary to first dose of bortezomib complicated with COVID-19 nosocomial pneumonia and acute pancreatitis treated with corticosteroids and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy; she died of abdominal refractory septic shock. The third patient, a 64-year-old man without prior renal impairment, was admitted for severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubulointerstitial nephritis of uncertain etiology that required orotracheal intubation and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for a week who received methylprednisolone in bolus for 3 days and continued treatment with corticosteroid therapy with complete recovery of renal function and improvement in proteinuria at 3 months of follow-up. The fourth patient, an 82-year-old woman with acute kidney injury AKIN 3 secondary to acute allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis related to ciprofloxacin complicated with severe COVID-19 nosocomial pneumonia, who died despite ventilatory support and high-dose steroids therapy and tocilizumab. The fifth patient, a 75-year-old with a history of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma treated with immunobiological agents and allergic tubulointerstitial nephritis in 2018, admitted in march 2020 for mild COVID-19 pneumonia treated with steroids and hydroxychloroquine without deterioration of respiratory and kidney function.

Blood, lung, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial lymph node (BLN) samples were collected to evaluate the cellular immune responses. The humoral responses were evaluated by measuring the levels of anti-PRRSV IgG and serum virus-neutralizing (SVN) antibodies. Consequently, the highest viral loads in the sera and lungs of the infected pigs were detected between 3 and 10 dpc, and these resulted in moderate to mild interstitial pneumonia, which resolved accompanied by the clearance of most of the virus by 28 dpc. At peak viremia, the frequencies of alveolar macrophages in infected pigs were significantly decreased, whereas the monocyte-derived DC/macrophage and conventional DC frequencies were increased, and these effects coincided with the early induction of local T-cell responses and the presence of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the lungs, BAL, and BLN as early as 10 dpc. Conversely, the systemic T-cell responses measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were delayed and significantly induced only after the peak viremic stage between 3 and 10 dpc. Taken together, our results suggest that activation of immune responses in the lung could be the key elements for restraining PRRSV through the early induction of T-cell responses at the sites of virus replication.","output":"Evaluation of local and systemic immune responses in pigs experimentally challenged with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As safe and effective vaccines become widely available, attaining herd immunity and limiting the spread of COVID-19 will depend on individuals choosing to vaccinateand doing so quickly enough to outpace mutations.

As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: \\"in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?\\", \\"Are there repeated offenders?\\", and \\"How are new crowd management measures performing?\\". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.","output":"Monitoring physical distancing for crowd management: real-time trajectory and group analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lung lesions are considered to be the main damage caused by SARSCoV-2 infection. In addition, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. However, the effect of antiviral treatment on liver injury in critically ill patients is not yet clear. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the effect of antiviral treatment and antiviral drug arbidol on liver injury in COVID-19 critically ill patients. Baseline characteristics were collected from patients who were admitted to intensive care units of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, and confounders were balanced by propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses. RESULTS Both the PSM (OR=2.77; 95% CI: 1.03, 7.48; P=0.045) and the IPTW-adjusted (OR=2.33; 95% CI: 1.02, 5.34; P=0.047) results showed that COVID-19 critically ill patients receiving antiviral treatment had a significantly higher risk of liver injury. However, arbidol treatment did not have a significant effect on liver injury (IPTW: OR=2.11; 95% CI: 0.79, 5.67; P=0.14). CONCLUSIONS Our results show that although arbidol treatment does not seem to be significantly associated with liver injury complications, the overall use of antiviral drugs increases the risk of liver injury for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Antiviral drugs are widely used to treat COVID-19, but we recommend that for critically ill patients, antiviral treatment should be used with caution considering both effectiveness and potential adverse effects.","output":"Liver injury after antiviral treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19: a single-centered retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Publisher Correction: 10.1038/s41401-020-0400-z,10.1038/s41401-020-0414-6,10.1038/s41401-020-0372-z."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The largest non-nuclear blast in modern history took place on August 4, 2020, at 6:07 PM in Beirut, Lebanon, after an estimated 2750 tons of unsafely stored ammonium nitrate exploded.

In the current study, we aimed to assess a novel telementoring application during the learning curve of transurethral enucleation of the prostate using bipolar energy (TUEB). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A telementoring system was developed by our engineering department. This application was used to mentor ten prospective cases of TUEB performed by an expert endourologist (novice to the TUEB). A questionnaire was filled by the operating surgeon and the mentor to provide subjective evaluation of the telementoring system. Finally, the outcomes of these patients were compared to a control group consisting of ten consecutive patients performed by the mentor. RESULTS: Ten consecutive TUEB were performed using this telementoring application. Delayed and interrupted connection were experienced in two and one patients, respectively; however, their effect was minor, and they did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients required conversion to conventional transurethral resection of the prostate. Only one patient in our series experienced grade IIIb complication. CONCLUSION: The telementoring application for TUEB is promising. It is a simple and low-cost tool that could be a feasible option to ensure patients safety during the initial phase of the learning curve without time and locations constraints for both the mentor and the trainee; However, it should be mentioned that telementoring cannot yet replace the traditional surgical training with the mentor and trainee being in the operative room.

The aim of this study was to determine if, among trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhages, there is an association of geographic region with the proportion of patients that received tranexamic acid. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Potentially eligible papers were first screened via title and abstract screening. A full copy of the remaining papers was then obtained and screened for final inclusion. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised control trials was used for quality assessment of the final studies included. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, reporting variation in use sub-grouped by geographical location. Results: There were 727 papers identified through database searching and 23 manuscripts met the criteria for final inclusion in this review. There was a statistically significant variation in the use of TXA for included patients. Europe and Oceania had higher usage rates of TXA compared to other continents. Use of TXA in Asia and Africa was significantly less than other continents and varied use was observed in North America. Conclusions: A large geographical variance in the use of TXA for trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhage currently exists. The populations in Asia and Africa, where the results of CRASH-2 could be most readily generalised to, reported low rates of use.

The thermal stability of newborn piglets is a fundamental aspect of neonatal care, so maintaining a constant, ideal temperature will substantially reduce newborn mortality. Species-specific characteristics, such as a limited capacity for thermoregulation, low energy reserves, a lack of brown adipose tissue (BAT) (-, and environmental conditions that are adverse for the piglet around the time of birth, including the absence of a microclimate, all of them contribute to difficulties in reaching thermal homeostasis in the first hours post-birth.

METHODS Cross-sectional, community-based, nationally representative data from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) were analyzed. Self-reported past 12-month food insecurity was assessed with two questions on frequency of eating less and hunger due to lack of food. Questions based on the World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used for the endorsement of past 12-month DSM-IV depression. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and meta-analysis were conducted to assess associations. RESULTS In total, 34,129 individuals aged 50 years [mean (SD) age, 62.4 (16.0) years; 52.1% females] were included in the analysis. Overall, the prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity was 6.7% and 5.1%, respectively, while the prevalence of depression was 6.0%. Meta-analyses based on countrywise estimates showed that overall, moderate food insecurity (vs. no food insecurity) is associated with a nonsignificant 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82-3.48) times higher odds for depression, while severe food insecurity is significantly associated with 2.43 (95% CI = 1.65-3.57) times higher odds for depression. CONCLUSIONS In this large representative sample of older adults from six LMICs, those with severe food insecurity were over two times more likely to suffer from depression (compared with no food insecurity).

METHODS: This retrospective study of prospectively collected data was conducted at the ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy, between 21 February and 31 November 2020. Uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the impact of the patients' origin on the probability of COVID-19-related death. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1,179 COVID-19 patients: 921 Italians (78.1%) and 258 immigrants (21.9%) who came from Latin America (99, 38%), Asia (72, 28%), Africa (50, 19%) and central/eastern Europe (37, 14%). The Italians were significantly older than the immigrants (median age 70 years, interquartile range (IQR) 58C79 vs 51 years, IQR 41C60; p < 0.001), and more frequently had one or more co-morbidities (79.1% vs 53.9%; p < 0.001). Mortality was significantly greater among the Italians than the immigrants as a whole (26.6% vs 12.8%; p < 0.001), and significantly greater among the immigrants from Latin America than among those from Asia, Africa or central/eastern Europe (21% vs 8%, 6% and 8%; p = 0.016). Univariable analysis showed that the risk of COVID-19-related death was lower among the immigrants (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30C0.63; p < 0.0001], but the risk of Latin American immigrants did not significantly differ from that of the Italians (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.47C1.15; p = 0.183). However, after adjusting for potential confounders, multivariable analysis showed that there was no difference in the risk of death between the immigrants and the Italians (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.70C1.55; p = 0.831), but being of Latin American origin was independently associated with an increased risk of death (aHR 1.95, 95% CI 1.17C3.23; p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was lower among the immigrants hospitalised with COVID-19 than among their Italian counterparts, but this difference disappeared after adjusting for confounders. However, the increased risk of death among immigrants of Latin American origin suggests that COVID-19 information and prevention initiatives need to be strengthened in this sub-population.","output":"Mortality among Italians and immigrants with COVID-19 hospitalised in Milan, Italy: data from the Luigi Sacco Hospital registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is used to treat acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) even outside the ICU and the ROX index (pulse oximetry/fraction of inspired oxygen/respiratory rate) may predict HFNC failure. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was therefore to verify whether the ROX index is an accurate predictor of HFNC failure for COVID-19 patients treated outside the intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the validity of the previously suggested threshold. DESIGN: Multicenter study. Retrospective observational analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: 3 centres specialized in non-invasive respiratory support (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Bolzano and Treviso, Italy). Patients treated outside the ICU were analysed MEASUREMENTS: The variables to calculate the ROX index were collected during the first day of therapy at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then recorded every 24 hours. HFNC failure was defined as escalation of respiratory support to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 35 (29%) patients failed HFNC and required intubation. ROC analysis identified the 12-hour ROX index as the best predictor of intubation with an AUC of 0.7916[CI 95% 0.6905-0.8927] and the best threshold to be 5.99[Specificity 96% Sensitivity 62%]. In the survival analysis, a ROX value <5.99 was associated with an increased risk of failure (p = 0008 log C rank test). The threshold of 4,9 identified by Roca as the best predictor in non-COVID patients, was not able to discriminate between success and failure (p = 0.4 log-rank test) in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: ROX index may be useful in guiding the clinicians in their decision to intubate patients, especially in patients with moderate ARF, treated therefore outside the ICU. Indeed, it also demonstrates a different threshold value than reported for non-COVID patients, possibly related to the different mechanisms of hypoxia.","output":"COVID-19 Pneumonia and ROX index: Time to set a new threshold for patients admitted outside the ICU."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growing evidence suggests that empathy is a relevant psychological trait to face the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but at the present very little is known on whether this multi-dimensional construct has been affected by the pandemic outbreak differently in its separate components.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search string was developed with the aid of a scientific librarian and the search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL and Embase. The studies were screened independently by two authors using Covidence. Data were extracted by two authors and quality assessment was performed using Robins-I tool. The meta-analyses were performed in STATA IC 16 using Risk Ratio as the primary effect estimate. RESULTS: In total, 617 studies were screened and ten studies were included with a total of 3,131 patients. The mean age ranged from 68.3 to 85.0 years and the prevalence of posterior tilt 20 in the studies ranged from 4.5% to 27.6%. There were 10.3% reoperations when posterior tilt was <20 whereas there were 24.5% when posterior tilt was 20 The meta-analysis therefore demonstrated an overall risk ratio of 0.11 (95% confidence interval; 0.04-0.18). Only one study investigated functional outcome, using ADL as measurement, but found no significant difference. No studies investigated PROM. In general, the studies were assessed to be of poor quality mainly due possible bias and confounding. CONCLUSION: A posterior tilt 20 leads to a higher risk of reoperations in uFNF.

Design Prospective monocentric observational study. Setting Conducted between December 20-21 at the Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS. Participants 61 volunteers (Mean age 41.62, range 21-62; 38F/23M) with different vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection backgrounds donated 15 ml of blood. Of these donors, one had recently completed chemotherapy, and one was undergoing treatment with monoclonal antibodies; the others reported no known health issue. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) The outcomes were the measurement of T cell reactivity to the mutated regions of the Spike protein of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant and the assessment of remaining T cell immunity to the spike protein by stimulation with peptide libraries. Results Lymphocytes from freshly drawn blood samples were isolated and immediately tested for reactivity to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. T cell responses to peptides covering the mutated regions in the Omicron variant were decreased by over 47% compared to the same regions of the ancestral vaccine strain. However, overall reactivity to the peptide library of the full-length protein was largely maintained (estimated 83%). No significant differences in loss of immune recognition were identified between groups of donors with different vaccination and/or infection histories. Conclusions and Relevance We conclude that despite the mutations in the Spike protein, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is nonetheless recognized by the cellular component of the immune system. It is reasonable to assume that protection from hospitalization and severe disease is maintained. Key Points Question Does the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 escape cellular immunity? Findings This observational study was performed on 61 vaccinated donors with established immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Cellular responses to the mutated regions of the Omicron Spike protein were detected in 80% of donors. The mutations reduced T cell recognition by 47% compared to the vaccine strain. Reactivity to the whole Spike protein, however, was present in 100% of donors, and the fraction of remaining immunity to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 83%. Meaning Cellular immunity to the Omicron variant is maintained despite the mutations in its Spike protein, and may thus confer protection from severe COVID-19 in vaccinated individuals.","output":"Preserved T cell reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant indicates continued protection in vaccinated individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE There has been a surge in videoconferencing technology use in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Radiomics features were extracted from chest CT of the patients. The data of the cohort were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets using a 7:1:2 ratio. A ML pipeline consisting of a model to predict severity and time-to-event model to predict progression to critical illness were trained on radiomics features and clinical variables. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC), concordance index (C-index), and time-dependent ROC-AUC were calculated to determine model performance, which was compared with consensus CT severity scores obtained by visual interpretation by radiologists. RESULTS: Among 981 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 274 patients developed critical illness. Radiomics features and clinical variables resulted in the best performance for the prediction of disease severity with a highest test ROC-AUC of 0.76 compared with 0.70 (0.76 vs. 0.70, p = 0.023) for visual CT severity score and clinical variables.

In lymph node aspirate, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity against culture was 86.2% (78.0 to 92.3), lower than that against a composite reference standard. Using the latent class model, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity was 99.5% (99.1 to 99.7), similar to that observed with a composite reference standard.

Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 100 would be Xpert Ultra\\\\positive (resistant): of these, zero (0%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 900 would be Xpert Ultra\\\\negative (susceptible): of these, zero (0%) would have rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF (19 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 96.5% (91.9 to 98.8) (148 participants; high\\\\certainty evidence) and 99.1% (98.0 to 99.7) (822 participants; high\\\\certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 105 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\\\\positive (resistant): of these, 8 (8%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 895 would be Xpert MTB/RIF\\\\negative (susceptible): of these, 3 (0.3%) would have rifampicin resistance. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF may be helpful in diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens: while for most specimens specificity is high, the tests rarely yield a positive result for people without tuberculosis. For tuberculous meningitis, Xpert Ultra had higher sensitivity and lower specificity than Xpert MTB/RIF against culture. Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF had similar sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance. Future research should acknowledge the concern associated with culture as a reference standard in paucibacillary specimens and consider ways to address this limitation.","output":"Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF assays for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is occasionally associated with manifold diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). We sought to present the neuroimaging features of such CNS involvement. In addition, we sought to identify typical neuroimaging patterns that could indicate possible COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. METHODS: In this systematic literature review, typical neuroimaging features of cerebrovascular diseases and inflammatory processes associated with COVID-19 were analyzed. Reports presenting individual patient data were included in further quantitative analysis with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We identified 115 studies reporting a total of 954 COVID-19 patients with associated neurological manifestations and neuroimaging alterations. A total of 95 (82.6%) of the identified studies were single case reports or case series, whereas 660 (69.2%) of the reported cases included individual information and were thus included in descriptive statistical analysis. Ischemia with neuroimaging patterns of large vessel occlusion event was revealed in 59.9% of ischemic stroke patients, whereas 69.2% of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage exhibited bleeding in a location that was not associated with hypertension. Callosal and/or juxtacortical location was identified in 58.7% of cerebral microbleed positive images. Features of hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis were detected in 28.8% of patients with meningo-/encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: Manifold CNS involvement is increasingly reported in COVID-19 patients. Typical and atypical neuroimaging features have been observed in some disease entities, so that familiarity with these imaging patterns appears reasonable and may assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 CNS manifestations.","output":"COVID-19: Neuroimaging Features of a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) infection is a highly prothrombotic state, resulting from a dysregulation of the coagulation cascade.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a well-known complication of heparin therapy. In this article, we report a case of HIT in a patient with COVID-19. A 63-year-old male presented with 1 week of dry cough and diarrhea. He had a positive nasopharyngeal COVID-19 reverse-transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction. On admission, the platelet count and liver function tests were within normal limits. During his hospitalization, he developed a right femoral deep venous thrombosis and was started on therapeutic anticoagulation. Due to worsening respiratory failure, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Between days 11 and 12 of hospitalization, platelet count dropped from 304 000 to 96 000 cells/L. He had a high pretest probability for HIT with a 4T score of 6 and a positive anti-PF4/heparin antibody. Heparin drip was discontinued and was switched to argatroban.

In this case report, we present a patient with a therapy-related BCR-JAK2(+) myeloid neoplasm with extensive extramedullary disease localizing in the lymph nodes. While treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor (ruxolitinib) was not able to stop disease progression, combination treatment with inhibitors of both JAK2 and BCL2 (venetoclax) resulted in disease control for over 1.5 years. Combining these two inhibitors might be strategic in these patients, not only because BCL2 is a downstream target of JAK/STAT signaling but also because BCL2 is crucial for JAK2 inhibitor resistance. The recent inclusion of JAK2-rearranged malignancies in major classification systems and guidelines emphasizes the importance of not only getting a better understanding of the clinical phenotype of these rare disorders but also of identifying alternative treatment options for patients ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Considering the low toxicity of combination treatment with these two small molecule inhibitors, this regimen could be further explored in future studies.","output":"Combined Ruxolitinib and Venetoclax Treatment in a Patient with a BCR-JAK2 Rearranged Myeloid Neoplasm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become a global pandemic not long after its inception in late 2019 SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced and shared on public repositories at a fast pace To keep up with these updates, scientists need to frequently refresh and reclean datasets, which is ad hoc and labor-intensive Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, an integrated webserver to enable simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes METHODS: Given a new sequence, CoV-Seq automatically predicts gene boundaries and identifies genetic variants, which are displayed in an interactive genome visualizer and are downloadable for further analysis A command-line interface is also available for high-throughput processing Also, we aggregate all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID, NCBI, ENA, and CNGB, and extract genetic variants from these sequences for download and downstream analysis The CoV-Seq database is updated weekly RESULTS: CoV-Seq is implemented in Python and JavaScript The web server is available at http://covseq baidu com/ and the source code is available from https://github com/boxiangliu/covseq CONCLUSIONS: We have developed CoV-Seq, an integrated web service for fast and easy analysis of custom SARS-CoV-2 sequences The web server provides an interactive module for the analysis of custom sequences and weekly updated database of genetic variants from all publicly accessible SARS-CoV-2 sequences We hope CoV-Seq will help improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of COVID-19","output":"CoV-Seq: SARS-CoV-2 Genome Analysis and Visualization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly affected normalcy around the world, and has shifted traditional means of operation for businesses. With the introduction of worldwide lockdowns, consumer spending, workforce management and supply chains have been some of the areas most affected. These unexpected challenges force businesses to re-evaluate their strategies moving forward to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic and adapt to the slowly evolving market conditions worldwide. The paper studies the effects of the pandemic on the UAE business environment and society through analyzing the employment growth rates of different sectors in the UAE for the first quarter of 2020 and compared it with their rates pre-pandemic (2010-2019). It was found that all sectors in the UAE suffered from negative growth, concluding that the pandemic has had a clear adverse economic effect on industries in the UAE. However, the uncertainty the pandemic has created has lead businesses to strategize for survival and, in doing so, focus more on organizational resilience and risk management. To steer clear from vulnerability and risk of business failure, an entrepreneurial hustle is needed to provide businesses with a competitive advantage in the post-pandemic era. This paper concludes with a hopeful observation that while many sectors in the UAE suffered economically, the UAE government's hands on initiatives to save businesses across the country has left many sectors on a stronger footing to withstand the after-effects post-pandemic era may throw their way. As result, this paper recommends economic diversification in the UAE to help transition its economy to a more sustainable path. ? 2021.

By quantifying kinetic and muscle activity data, it was possible to distinguish two kinds of movement patterns. Highly asymmetric postures and movements corresponded to distinct extremes in lower limb and spine muscle activity data. The use of collaborative robotics significantly reduced maximum force exertion in the caregiving process by up to 51%. Lateral flexion and torsion of the trunk were reduced by up to 54% and 87%, respectively, leading to a significant reduction in mean spine muscle activity of up to 55%.

The pandemic brought into light structural weaknesses of the health system, including its governance and decision-making process, but also provoked changes that helped to improve its resilience. We analyse the French experience of Covid-19 in 2020 by critically reviewing major policy measures implemented during the first two waves of the pandemic. France has struggled to find the right balance between the rock of economic and social damage caused by containment measures and the hard alternative of a rapidly spreading pandemic. The response to the first wave, including a full lock-down, was an emergency response that revealed the low level of preparedness for pandemics and the overly hospital-centred provision of health care in France. During the second wave, this response evolved into a more level strategy trying to reconcile health needs in a broader perspective integrating socio-economic considerations, but without fully managing to put in place an effective health strategy. We conclude that to achieve the right balance, France will have to strengthen health system capacity and improve the cooperation between actors at central and local levels with greater participatory decision-making that takes into account local-level realities and the diversity of needs.","output":"France's response to the Covid-19 pandemic: between a rock and a hard place"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The surgical management of enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) in the setting of large abdominal wall defects can be challenging.

In addition to physical illness, they have experienced mental health challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of PTSD among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic via an umbrella review and meta-analysis. Methods: This study was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline to perform a systematic literature search using various medical databases (Web of science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Embase, and Google scholar). The search included all articles published through the first of January 2020 the end of March 2021. The systematic review and meta-analysis studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD among health care workers were included in the study, and studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD in normal people or other epidemics were excluded. The random effects model was used to perform a meta-analysis, and the I(2) index was used to evaluate heterogeneity among studies. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test. Data was analyzed using STATA (version 14) software. Results: The initial literature search yielded 145 studies. After excluding duplicates and assessing the quality of the studies, 7 studies were selected for meta-analysis. The results showed that the overall prevalence of PTSD among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic was 13.52% (95% CI: 9.06C17.98, I(2) = 65.5%, p = 0.008).

Our results showed that the range of optimal allocation per testing center are: Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (4.17%-6.34%), San Lazaro Hospital (14.65%-24.03%), University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (16.25%-44.80%), Lung Center of the Philippines (15.8%-26.40%), Baguio General Hospital Medical Center (0.58%-0.76%), The Medical City, Pasig City (5.96%-25.51%), St. Luke's Medical Center, Quezon City (1.09%-6.70%), Bicol Public Health Laboratory (0.06%-0.08%), Western Visayas Medical Center (0.71%-4.52%), Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (1.02%-2.61%), and Southern Philippines Medical Center (approx 0.01%). If there will be changes in the number of testing centers, our model can still be used to modify the test kit allocation. Our results can serve as a guide to the authorities in distributing the COVID-19 test kits. These can also be used to determine the capacity of testing centers and the effects of increasing its number. The model can also be used for proposing additional number and location of new testing centers.","output":"Optimal Allocation of COVID-19 Test Kits Among Accredited Testing Centers in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Direct and indirect sequels of COVID-19 in the cardiovascular system are unclear The present study aims to investigate the echocardiography findings in COVID-19 patients and possible correlations between the findings and the disease outcome Methods: In this cross-sectional study, baseline characteristics and echocardiographic findings of hospitalized COVID-19 cases, and their correlation with mortality were evaluated Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed to assess possible pulmonary embolism In-hospital mortality was considered as the main outcome of the present study Results: 680 confirmed COVID-19 cases with the mean age of 55 15 +/- 10 92 (range: 28 - 79) years were studied (63 09% male) Analysis showed that history of ischemic heart disease (RR=1 14;95% CI: 1 08-1 19), history of hypertension (RR=1 04;95% CI: 1 00-1 08), presence of embolism in main pulmonary artery (RR=1 53;95% CI: 1 35-1 74), CT involvement more than 70%(RR=1 08;95% CI: 1 1 01-1 16), left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 (RR=1 19;95% CI: 1 07-1 32), pleural effusion (RR=1 08;95% CI: 1 00-1 16), pulmonary artery systolic blood pressure 35 to 50 mmHg (RR=1 11;95% CI: 1 03-1 18), right ventricular dysfunction (RR=1 54;95% CI: 1 40-1 08), and collapsed inferior vena-cava (RR=1 05;95% CI: 1 01-1 08) were independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality Conclusion: Our study showed that cardiac involvement is a prevalent complication in COVID-19 patients Echocardiography findings have independent prognostic value for prediction of in-hospital mortality Since echocardiography is an easy and accessible method, echocardiography monitoring of COVID-19 patients can be used as a screening tool for identification of high-risk patients","output":"Echocardiographic Abnormalities as Independent Prognostic Factors of In-Hospital Mortality among COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As chemical drugs, separation and quantification of the specific enantiomer from the chiral compounds in herbal medicines are becoming more important. To clarify the chemical characterization of chiral glucosinolatesthe antiviral active ingredients of Radix Isatidis, an optimized efficient method of HPLC-UV-CD was developed to simultaneously separate and quantify the four main chiral glucosinolates: progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin. The first step was to determine progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin using HPLC-UV, and then determine the R-goitrin and S-goitrin by coupling with CD detection. Subsequently, through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g factor) and the percent optical purity of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin from the R,S-goitrin mixture were calculated separately. Furthermore, the chemical composition features of the four chiral glucosinolates in 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis were conducted. The total content of the four glucosinolates was obviously higher in crude drugs, and the variance character of each glucosinolate contents was different. In summary, the accurate measurement method reported here allows for better control of the internal quality of R. Isatidis and its granules and provides a powerful approach for the analysis of other chiral components in traditional Chinese medicines.","output":"Separation and Quantification of Four Main Chiral Glucosinolates in Radix Isatidis and Its Granules Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography/Diode Array Detector Coupled with Circular Dichroism Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remain the largest global public health threat.

This study aimed to compare outcomes of IBD patients undergoing surgery in COVID-19-treatment and COVID-19-free hospitals. METHODS: Retrospective study involving patients undergoing IBD surgery in seven centres (six COVID-19-treatment hubs and one COVID-free hospital) across 5 European countries during the period of highest reduction of elective activity due to the first peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Predictive variables of the risk of moderate-to-severe postoperative complications were analysed using logistic regression analysis. Considering the large number of regressors and the risk of over-fitting due to the small number of events, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used. RESULTS: Of the 91 patients (59 males, 64.8%) with Crohns disease (54, 59.3%) or ulcerative colitis (37, 40.7%), 66 (72.5%) had surgery in a COVID-19-treatment hospital, while 25 (27.5%) were treated in the COVID-19-free centre. A higher proportion of COVID-19-treatment patients required urgent surgery (48.4% vs 24%, p=0.035), did not discontinue the biologic therapy (15.1% vs. 0%, p=0.039), underwent surgery without a SARS-CoV-2 test (19.7% vs. 0%, p=0.0033), and were admitted to intensive care postoperatively (10.6% vs. 0%, p=0.032). Three patients (4.6%) of the COVID-19-treatment group had a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the hospital course. Use of steroids at surgery (Odds ratio [OR]=4.10, 95% CI 1.14C15.3, p=0.03), presence of comorbidities (OR=3.33, 95% CI 1.08C11, p=0.035), and Crohns disease (vs. ulcerative colitis, OR=3.82, 95% CI 1.14C15.4, p=0.028) were associated with risk of moderate-to-severe postoperative complications. The admission to a COVID-19-treatment hospital was not associated with higher risks of complications (OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.54C10.4, p=0.30) CONCLUSION: Although a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the postoperative period represented a concrete risk in IBD patients undergoing surgery in COVID-19-treatment hospitals, the study showed that IBD patients can undergo surgery regardless of the COVID-19-status of the referral centre. The study also showed the lack of standardized practice for IBD patients requiring surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"P145 Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients requiring surgery can be treated in referral centres regardless of the COVID-19 status of the hospital: results of a multicentric European study during the first COVID-19 outbreak (COVIBD-Surg)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High phenotypic plasticity has long been considered as a characteristic promoting exotic plant invasions. However, the results of the studies testing this hypothesis are still inconsistent. Overlooking the effects of species resource requirements and environmental resource availability may be the main reasons for the ambiguous conclusions. Here, we compared phenotypic plasticity between five noxious invasive species with different nutrient requirements (evaluated using the soil nutrient status of their natural distribution ranges) and their phylogenetically-related natives under five nutrient levels. We found that species with high nutrient requirements showed greater plasticity of total biomass than species with low nutrient requirements, regardless of their status (invasive or native). Invasives with high nutrient requirements had greater growth plasticity than their related natives, which may contribute to their invasiveness under high-nutrient environments. However, compared to the related natives, a higher growth plasticity may not help exotic species with low nutrient requirements to invade nutrient-rich habitats, and exotic species with high nutrient requirements to invade nutrient-limited habitats. In contrast, invasives with low nutrient requirements exhibited lower growth plasticity than their related natives, contributing to their invasiveness under nutrient-limited habitats. Functional traits showed growth-related plasticity in only 10 cases (3.8%), and there was no functional trait whose plastic response to soil nutrients was beneficial to exotic plant invasions. Our study indicates that low growth plasticity could also promote exotic plant invasions, high plasticity may not necessarily lead to invasiveness. We must test the adaptive significance of plasticity of functional traits when studying its biological roles.","output":"Phenotypic plasticity and exotic plant invasions: effects of soil nutrients, species nutrient requirements and types of traits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The medical tourism industry has been growing rapidly in recent years as governments seek new sectors for sustainable growth.

In these patients, volatile sedation may represent a valid alternative to IV drugs. The aim of our study was to describe the feasibility of volatile sedation in a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ultraprotective ventilation. DESIGN: Retrospective monocentric study. SETTING: Adult ICU, ASST Monza, Italy. PATIENTS: Adult patients who underwent volatile sedation with isoflurane during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between 2009 and 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Isoflurane was delivered via the AnaConDa system. The sedation level, hemodynamics, and laboratory tests were compared between the volatile sedation phase and the IV sedation phases before and after the isoflurane sedation period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: About 74 patients (50 yr [43C56 yr]) were included. Median duration of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was 22 days (14C51 d). Volatile sedation started on day 3 (2C6) of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and its median duration was 7 days (4C13 d), ranging from 1 to 38 days. A total of 970 venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation days were analyzed. During the volatile phase, the sedation level was slightly deeper (bispectral index 39  6) compared with the IV phase before and after isoflurane (42  8 and 43  9, respectively, p < 0.001). Requirements of fentanyl and remifentanyl were reduced during the volatile phase. Minor differences in hemodynamics were observed during volatile sedation: mean arterial pressure was lower (75  13 vs 79  14 and 80  15; p < 0.001), whereas cardiac output was higher (8.5  1.9 vs 7.9  1.8 and 8.0  1.8; p = 0.003). Aspartate aminotransferase levels were lower during the volatile sedation phases (p < 0.001), whereas alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, and creatine phosphokinase were more altered during the IV sedation phase before isoflurane (p < 0.001).

One group particuarly likely to be affected by this in the immediate future are the healthcare professionals working on the frontline of the NHS pandemic response. As members of a foundation cohort of these junior doctors we aimed to create a way to quanitfy the wellbeing of ourselves and our colleagues at this challeging time. We aimed to use a combination of numerous tools to monitor foundation doctors in Blackburn during this crisis. This would inform which measures would be best suited to be put in place to protect this cohort from early burnout and poor mental health in the future.MethodWe designed a survey of 25 questions which we invited our foundation colleagues to fill in anonymously during the first and second waves of the pandemic in response to times when foundation doctors were redeployed to aid the frontline. The survey has been based on the PHQ9, GAD7, Epworth Sleepiness scale, Physician wellbeing index, Medical students wellbeing index, Maslach burnout inventory BMA burnout questionnaire and the QOL scale.ResultFrom a cohort of around 140 foundation doctors we had 46 participants in our trial of this tool;46% had been redeployed and 54% not redeployed. Over 50% of survey respondents reported high stress, poor motivation and depersonalisation over the two weeks at the peak of the pandemic, key early signs of burnout. Lack of interest in their work, poor sleep and anhedonia were increased across both groups (redeployed and non redeployed). The interventions after the first wave data which repondents found beneficial included;financial reassurances during redeployments, protected non clinical areas for rest, a named individual senior staff member for wellbeing support.ConclusionKey issues the survey raised were fed back to foundation programme leads in monthly meetings. This allowed us with our foundation leads to make targeted changes in order to support foundation doctors at this time. Without the data from this tool which we tailored to the foundation experience we believe these rapidly worsening issues during the pandemic would not have been addressed so swiftly. We then resurveyed the foundation cohort to assess which of these interventions have been most widely used and appreciated.","output":"Assessing wellbeing in foundation doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 that was originating from Wuhan in China has then evolved into various variants, which are specific to regions.

Whilst over 400 have been developed for use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), only a minority have undergone full external validation and just one, the DECAF score, has undergone an implementation study supporting use in clinical practice. Little is known about how such tools are used in the UK. We distributed surveys at two time points, in 2017 and 2019, to hospitals included in the Royal College of Physicians of London national COPD secondary care audit program. The survey assessed the use of prognostic tools in routine care of hospitalized COPD patients. Hospital response rates were 71/196 in 2017 and 72/196 in 2019. The use of the DECAF and PEARL scores more than doubled in decisions about unsupported discharge (7%-15.3%), admission avoidance (8.1%-17%) and readmission avoidance (4.8%-13.1%); it more than tripled (8.8%-27.8%) in decisions around hospital-at-home or early supported discharge schemes. In other areas, routine use of clinical prognostic tools was uncommon. In palliative care decisions, the use of the Gold Standards Framework Prognostic Indicator Guidance fell (5.6%-1.4%). In 2017, 43.7% of hospitals used at least one clinical prognostic tool in routine COPD care, increasing to 52.1% in 2019. Such tools can help challenge prognostic pessimism and improve care. To integrate these further into routine clinical care, future research should explore current barriers to their use and focus on implementation studies.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1959540.","output":"Uptake of Clinical Prognostic Tools in COPD Exacerbations Requiring Hospitalisation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we report a case of a 61-year-old male who was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation and hemodynamic support, marked D-Dimer and troponin I elevation, worsening ST-elevation myocardial infarction on repeat electrocardiograms, and a negative coronary angiogram ruling out a coronary artery thrombosis or occlusion. With worsening diffuse ST-segment elevation on electrocardiograms and reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography in the setting of systemic inflammation, fulminant myocarditis was highly suspected. Despite optimal medical treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated and was complicated by cardiac arrest that failed resuscitation.

This programme, known as CardioWebinar, has continued ever since. We looked to study the effectiveness of delivering virtual Cardiology education 1 year into the COVID pandemic. Methods Expert speakers throughout the UK were sought after via social media and 'word of mouth.' Weekly webinars were organised and advertised (Canva posters) on social media (Twitter), as well as via the British Cardiovascular Society and British Junior Cardiologists' Association (BJCA) media links. Each webinar was scheduled mid-week at 17:30 (UK). Interested attendees registered for free using an online ticketing platform (Eventbrite). Webinars were delivered using an online video conferencing platform (Zoom) which required a 14.99 monthly subscription. Each webinar consisted of a 40-minute presentation followed by Q&A (20mins). All webinars were recorded and later accessible for free on the BJCA TV Gallery. A Learning Management System (LMS) was used to collect feedback after each session and generate certificates of attendance for attendee appraisal. We systematically reviewed the LMS feedback of live attendees from 6 consecutive webinars delivered between Jan- Feb 2021. We further surveyed our most recent (March 2021) attendees (145 participants) via an extended questionnaire through the LMS exploring their experiences of our virtual education. Results 55 CardioWebinars have been delivered since April 2020. The speakers have been predominantly Consultant Cardiologists from the UK. Some of the recordings have had &gt;1000 views. Other than the video platform subscription, no cost was incurred in the delivery of this entire programme. We collected feedback from 392 respondents (65 live attendees per webinar) from each session between Jan- Feb 2021. The sessions were rated as 'very good-excellent' by 97%. We collected a further 145 responses from March 2021 attendees to an extended questionnaire. 90% rated the whole series as 'very good -excellent' in supporting their cardiology education during the Covid pandemic, and 84% felt the programme sufficiently covered even the more challenging areas of the Cardiology curriculum (e.g aortopathies). 90% of the respondents felt that their work-life schedule allowed them to join the live webinars at this time. The respondents where predominantly from the UK (91%), though included an international audience (9%). Whilst 74% of attendees were cardiology trainees, the remaining 26% included physiologists, nursing staff, consultants and other junior doctors. 99% felt that virtual education should continue to play a formal part in their training after the COVID pandemic.

To our knowledge, little is known about how these programs serve this vulnerable population outside the hospital setting. Objective: To assess the safety of a hotel-based isolation and quarantine (I/Q) care system and its association with inpatient hospital capacity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study of a hotel-based I/Q care system for homeless and unstably housed individuals in San Francisco, California, was conducted from March 19 to May 31, 2020. Individuals unable to safely isolate or quarantine at home with mild to moderate COVID-19, persons under investigation, or close contacts were referred from hospitals, outpatient settings, and public health surveillance to 5 I/Q hotels. Of 1009 I/Q hotel guests, 346 were transferred from a large county public hospital serving patients experiencing homelessness. Exposure: A physician-supervised team of nurses and health workers provided around-the-clock support, including symptom monitoring, wellness checks, meals, harm-reduction services, and medications for opioid use disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Characteristics of I/Q hotel guests, program retention, county hospital readmissions, and mean length of stay. Results: Overall, the 1009 I/Q hotel guests had a median age of 44 years (interquartile range, 33-55 years), 756 (75%) were men, 454 (45%) were Latinx, and 501 (50%) were persons experiencing sheltered (n = 295) or unsheltered (n = 206) homelessness. Overall, 463 (46%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19; 303 of 907 (33%) had comorbid medical disorders, 225 of 907 (25%) had comorbid mental health disorders, and 236 of 907 (26%) had comorbid substance use disorders. A total of 776 of 955 guests (81%) completed their I/Q hotel stay; factors most strongly associated with premature discontinuation were unsheltered homelessness (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.6; P < .001) and quarantine status (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; P = .001). In total, 346 of 549 patients (63%) were transferred from the county hospital; of 113 ineligible referrals, 48 patients (42%) had behavioral health needs exceeding I/Q hotel capabilities. Thirteen of the 346 patients transferred from the county hospital (4%) were readmitted for worsening COVID-19. Overall, direct transfers to I/Q hotels from emergency and outpatient departments were associated with averting many hospital admissions. There was a nonsignificant decrease in the mean hospital length of stay for inpatients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from 5.5 to 2.7 days from March to May 2020 (P = .11). Conclusions and Relevance: To support persons experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco rapidly and safely scaled a hotel-based model of I/Q that was associated with reduced strain on inpatient capacity.

Doxycycline is widely reported to possess immunomodulatory activity through inhibition of various inflammatory pathways. Considering the broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity, protective effect of doxycycline was evaluated in clinically relevant murine polymicrobial sepsis model induced by caecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, sepsis is accompanied with infection and therefore ceftriaxone at sub-protective dose was combined to retard the bacterial growth. Three hours after CLP challenge, mice were administered vehicle, ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg subcutaneously) alone and in combination with immunomodulatory dose of doxycycline (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and survival were monitored for 5 days.

Wrist-worn fitness wearable devices record heart beats 24/7 having a complete overview of users' heart status. Due to motion artefacts affecting QRS complexes recording, and the different nature of the heart rate sensor used on wearable devices compared to ECG, traditionally used to compute SDNN24, the estimation of this important Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric has never been performed from wearable data. We propose an innovative approach to estimate SDNN24 only exploiting the Heart Rate (HR) that is normally available on wearable fitness trackers and less affected by data noise. The standard deviation of inter-beats intervals (SDNN24) and the standard deviation of the Average inter-beats intervals (ANN) derived from the HR (obtained in a time window with defined duration, i.e., 1, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min), i.e., ANN=60HR (SDANNHR24), were calculated over 24 h. Power spectrum analysis using the Lomb-Scargle Peridogram was performed to assess frequency domain HRV parameters (Ultra Low Frequency, Very Low Frequency, Low Frequency, and High Frequency). Due to the fact that SDNN24 reflects the total power of the power of the HRV spectrum, the values estimated from HR measures (SDANNHR24) underestimate the real values because of the high frequencies that are missing. Subjects with low and high cardiovascular risk show different power spectra. In particular, differences are detected in Ultra Low and Very Low frequencies, while similar results are shown in Low and High frequencies. For this reason, we found that HR measures contain enough information to discriminate cardiovascular risk. Semi-continuous measures of HR throughout 24 h, as measured by most wrist-worn fitness wearable devices, should be sufficient to estimate SDNN24 and cardiovascular risk.","output":"SDNN24 Estimation from Semi-Continuous HR Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kawasaki syndrome (KS) is an acute vasculitis in children complicated by the development of heart disease.

Proven risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 are common diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular or respiratory disorders. Until today, little is known about the psychological burden of individuals suffering from these high-risk diseases regard to COVID-19. The aim of the study was to define the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on behavior and mental health in individuals at high risk for developing a severe COVID-19 course. Items assessed generalized anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior, and the subjective risk perception of regarding symptoms, having a severe course and dying because of COVID-19. Data were compared between participants with the high risk diseases and individuals without any of those diseases. 16,983 respondents completed the study. Generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior and subjective risk perception were elevated in participants with high-risk diseases. The increased COVID-19-related fear as a functional concern is a conclusion on the increased risk of a severe course. The functionality of the fear is reflected in people's increased need for security and includes an increase in both adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior that underlines the need for psychological support strategies.","output":"Increased COVID-19-related fear and subjective risk perception regarding COVID-19 affects behavior in individuals with internal high-risk diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients with COVID-19 is generally high but varies markedly. However, the relationship between anticoagulation and mortality in patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the incidence of VTE and evaluate the role of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. Random effects models were used to determine overall pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: After a database search, 25 observational studies (20 on VTE incidence and 5 on the relationship between anticoagulation and mortality) were included. The pooled incidence rates of VTE, pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalised COVID-19 patients were 21% (95% CI 15-27%), 15% (95% CI 10-20%), and 27% (95% CI 19-36%), respectively.

This study was aimed at evaluating the analytical performance of the novel Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG) chemiluminescent immunoassay. Methods: This analytical assessment encompassed the calculation of intra-assay, inter-assay and total imprecision, linearity, limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD), functional sensitivity, and comparison of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies values obtained on paired serum samples using DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Diagnostic performance was also tested against results of molecular testing on nasopharyngeal swabs, collected over the previous 4 months. Results: Intra-assay, inter-assay and total imprecision of Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were between 4.3-4.8%, 2.3-3.9% and 4.9-6.2%, respectively. The linearity of the assay was excellent between 0.11-18.8 antibody titers. The LOB, LOD and functional sensitivity were 0.02, 0.02 and 0.05, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve;AUC) of Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG compared to molecular testing was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91;P<0.001) using manufacturer's cut-off, and increased to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.94;P<0.001) with antibody titers. The AUC was non-significantly different from that of Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, but was always higher than that of DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG. The correlation of Beckman Coulter Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84;P<0.001) with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66-0.77;P<0.001) with DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, respectively.

Oil has been a particular point of interest in recent news. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and after a series of disagreements within the OPEC+ alliance, an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia took place, which caused prices to decrease drastically. Moreover, the demand for oil dramatically decreased because of the suspension of transportation and air travel. Prices kept dropping, and cost of storage became increasingly unattractive, to the point where traders were willing to pay to get oil taken off their hands. On 4/20/2020, for the first time in history, the generic first crude commodity contract dropped from $10.01 to $-37.63 recording a negative price, puzzling most investors. This unprecedented event shocked the stock market, and most average investors were perplexed on how to calculate returns on negative prices. Interestingly, there was a clear divergence between the equity and energy prices, where the former kept on rallying while the latter completely collapsed into negative territory. This paper pragmatically analyzes the reasons for this divergence between the two markets, the diversification benefit of investing in both assets simultaneously, and presents a quantum mechanics methodology to calculate returns when a price goes negative.

A major hurdle in kinase inhibitor development is the reduction of toxicity due to nonspecific kinase activity in host cells. Here a novel class of PknB inhibitors was developed from hit aminopyrimidine 1 (GW779439X), which was originally designed for human CDK4 but failed to progress clinically because of high toxicity and low specificity. Replacing the pyrazolopyridazine headgroup of the original hit with substituted pyridine or phenyl headgroups resulted in a reduction of Cdk activity and a 3-fold improvement in specificity over the human kinome while maintaining PknB activity.

We used a longitudinal cohort study using the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) collected at 3 time points: an initial assessment in April 2020 (\\"April\\"), a reassessment 3 weeks later (\\"May\\"), and a 7-month follow-up in November 2020 (\\"November\\"). Online surveys were collected in the United States and United Kingdom by Prolific Academic, a survey recruitment service, with a final sample of 859 Adults and 780 children (collected via parent report). We found subtypes of pandemic-related life change stress in social and economic domains derived through Louvain Community Detection. We assessed recalled mood and perceived mental health prior to the pandemic; worries about COVID-19; personal and family impacts of COVID-19; and socio-demographic characteristics. Levels of mood symptoms in November 2020 measured with the circumplex model of affect. We found 3 life change stress subtypes among adults and children: Lower Social/Lower Economic (adults and children), Higher Social/Higher Economic (adults and children), Lower Social/Higher Economic (adults), and Intermediate Social/Lower Economic (children). Overall, mood symptoms decreased between April and November 2020, but shifting from lower to higher-stress subtypes between time points was associated with increasing symptoms. For both adults and children, the most informative predictors of mood symptoms in November identified by conditional random forest models were prior mood and perceived mental health, worries about COVID, and sources of life change. The relative importance of these predictors was the most prominent difference in findings between adults and children, with lifestyle changes stress regarding friendships being more predictive of mood outcomes than worries about COVID in children. In the US, objective state-level indicators of COVID-19 threat were less predictive of November mood than these other predictors. We found that in addition to the well-established influences of prior mood and worry, heterogeneous subtypes of pandemic-related stress were differentially associated with mood after the initial phase of the pandemic.

A recent publication by the V3SWG described live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1 (Clarke et al., 2016). The rVSV vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rVSV vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rVSV vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a live, replication competent vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV. Multiple copies of GP are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity. The vaccine (designated V920) was originally constructed by the National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, further developed by NewLink Genetics Corp. and Merck & Co., and is now in final stages of registration by Merck. The vaccine is attenuated by deletion of the principal virulence factor of VSV (the G protein), which also removes the primary target for anti-vector immunity. The V920 vaccine caused no toxicities after intramuscular (IM) or intracranial injection of nonhuman primates and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in a rat model. In multiple studies, cynomolgus macaques immunized IM with a wide range of virus doses rapidly developed ZEBOV-specific antibodies measured in IgG ELISA and neutralization assays and were fully protected against lethal challenge with ZEBOV virus. Over 20,000 people have received the vaccine in clinical trials; the vaccine has proven to be safe and well tolerated. During the first few days after vaccination, many vaccinees experience a mild acute-phase reaction with fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia of short duration; this period is associated with a low-level viremia, activation of anti-viral genes, and increased levels of chemokines and cytokines. Oligoarthritis and rash appearing in the second week occur at a low incidence, and are typically mild-moderate in severity and self-limited. V920 vaccine was used in a Phase III efficacy trial during the West African Ebola epidemic in 2015, showing 100% protection against Ebola Virus Disease, and it has subsequently been deployed for emergency control of Ebola outbreaks in central Africa. The template provided here provides a comprehensive picture of the first rVSV vector to reach the final stage of development and to provide a solution to control of an alarming human disease.","output":"rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP (also designated V920) recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with Ebola Zaire Glycoprotein: Standardized template with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Studies have found race-related stress psychologically and physiologically harms members of stigmatized racial groups.

METHODS This quasi-experimental trial without a control group included 42 COVID-19 patients aged 20-59 years. Participants were recruited conveniently in the COVID-19 isolation ward in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. They watched three brief psychotherapy videos including relaxation, managing thoughts and emotions, and mindfulness for approximately 30 min.

Herein we present COVID-19 Flow-Maps, a cross-referenced Geographic Information System that integrates regularly updated time-series accounting for population mobility and daily reports of COVID-19 cases in Spain at different scales of time spatial resolution. This integrated and up-to-date data-set can be used to analyse the human dynamics to guide and support the design of more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions.","output":"COVID-19 Flow-Maps an open geographic information system on COVID-19 and human mobility for Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization COVID-19 Partners Platform represents the first step towards a new model of health crisis information sharing across stakeholders and could evolve into an engagement mechanism of choice for future cross-border public health emergencies.","output":"COVID-19 Partners PlatformAccelerating Response by Coordinating Plans, Needs, and Contributions During Public Health Emergencies: COVID-19 Vaccines Use Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to young children for treating bacterial infections such as invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite the obvious benefits of antibiotics, little is known about their possible side effects on childrens nasopharyngeal microbiota. In other ecological niches, antibiotics have been described to perturb the balanced microbiota with short- and long-term effects on childrens health. The present study aims to evaluate and compare the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children with IPD and different degree of antibiotic exposure. METHODS: We investigated differences in nasopharyngeal microbiota of two groups of children <18 years with IPD: children not exposed to antibiotics before sample collection (n=27) compared to children previously exposed (n=54). Epidemiological/clinical data were collected from subjects, and microbiota was characterized by Illumina sequencing of V3-V4 amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Main epidemiological/clinical factors were similar across groups. Antibiotic-exposed patients were treated during a median of 4 days (IQR: 3C6) with at least one beta-lactam (100.0%). Higher bacterial richness and diversity were found in the group exposed to antibiotics. Different streptococcal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were differentially abundant across groups: antibiotic use was associated to lower relative abundances of Streptococcus ASV2 and Streptococcus ASV11 (phylogenetically close to S. pneumoniae), and higher relative abundances of Streptococcus ASV3 and Streptococcus ASV12 (phylogenetically close to viridans group streptococci). ASVs assigned to typical bacteria from the oral cavity, including Veillonella, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Granulicatella, or Capnocytophaga, were associated to the antibiotic-exposed group. Common nosocomial genera such as Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas were also enriched in the group exposed to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Our results point toward a reduction of S. pneumoniae abundance on the nasopharynx of children with IPD after antibiotic treatment and a short-term repopulation of this altered niche by oral and nosocomial bacteria. Future research studies will have to evaluate the clinical implications of these findings and if these populations would benefit from the probiotic/prebiotic administration or even from the improvement on oral hygiene practices frequently neglected among hospitalized children.","output":"Rapid Increase of Oral Bacteria in Nasopharyngeal Microbiota After Antibiotic Treatment in Children With Invasive Pneumococcal Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Editorial, the Editor\\\\in\\\\Chief Professor Miguel A.

Owing to restrictions in elective surgery and social distancing guidelines, the training curriculum for neurosurgical trainees has been rapidly evolving. This evolution could have significant long-term effects on the training of neurosurgery residents. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of COVID-19 on neurosurgical training programs and residents. METHODS: A survey consisting of 31 questions assessing changes to resident clinical and educational workload and their sentiment regarding how these changes might affect their careers was distributed electronically to neurosurgery residents in the United States and Canada. RESULTS: The survey respondents were from 29 states and Canada and were relatively evenly spread across all levels of residency. Nearly 82% reported that the inpatient and outpatient volumes had been either greatly (44.0%) or moderately (37.8%) reduced. Greater than 91% reported that their work responsibilities or access to the hospital had been reduced, with a significant reduction in work hours and a significant increase in resident didactics (P < 0.001). Senior residents expressed concern about their educational experience and their future career prospects as a result of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Universally, residents have experienced reduced work hours and a reduction in their operative case volumes. Programs have adapted by increasing didactic time and using electronic platforms. It is quite possible that this remarkable period will prompt a critical reappraisal of the pre-COVID-19 adequacy of educational content in our training programs and that the enhanced educational efforts driven by this pandemic could be lasting.","output":"An Evaluation of Neurosurgical Resident Education and Sentiment During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A North American Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I would like to welcome our readers to volume 11 of Pain Management Since the launch of the journal in 2011, the title has gone from strength to strength, and we are delighted to bring you a new year of content We are starting off this issue with a look back on some of our article highlights from 2020, alongside some of this month's key content","output":"Welcome to the 11(th) Volume of Pain Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria and some autoimmune disorders, potently inhibits viral infection of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 in cell-culture studies. However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated or when it is introduced into the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry is attenuated by TMPRSS2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Philippines confirmed local transmission of COVID-19 on 7 March 2020.

Although youth have a tendency to engage in high-risk behaviors that could facilitate COVID-19 transmission, there is limited research on the characteristics of PD messaging targeting this population on social media platforms with which youth frequently engage. This study examined social media posts created by Canadian public health entities (PHEs) with PD messaging aimed at youth and young adults aged 16C29 years and reported behavioral change techniques (BCTs) used in these posts. METHODS: A content analysis of all social media posts of Canadian PHEs from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube were conducted from April 1st to May 31st, 2020. Posts were classified as either implicitly or explicitly targeting youth and young adults. BCTs in social media posts were identified and classified based on Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1). Frequency counts and proportions were used to describe the data. RESULTS: In total, 319 youth-targeted PD posts were identified. Over 43% of the posts originated from Ontario Regional public health units, and 36.4 and 32.6% of them were extracted from Twitter and Facebook, respectively. Only 5.3% of the total posts explicitly targeted youth. Explicit posts were most frequent from federal PHEs and posted on YouTube. Implicit posts elicited more interactions than explicit posts regardless of jurisdiction level or social media format. Three-quarters of the posts contained at least one BCT, with a greater portion of BCTs found within implicit posts (75%) than explicit posts (52.9%). The most common BCTs from explicit posts were instructions on how to perform a behavior (25.0%) and restructuring the social environment (18.8%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more PD messaging that explicitly targets youth. BCTs should be used when designing posts to deliver public health messages and social media platforms should be selected depending on the target population.

Families were questioned on their experiences with preoperative counseling, practical teaching, additional support and the patient literature that was provided by the orthoptists in the CL clinic. Qualitative data and free comments were analyzed. 18/20 (90%) said they had received good practical insertion and removal teaching. 19/20 (95%) felt they received good emotional support.

Since biotransformation significantly influences drug actions in an organism, metabolism studies represent a crucial part of such tests. Hence, an optimized and economical capillary electrophoretic method for on-line studies of the enantioselective drug metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes was developed. It comprises a diffusion-based procedure, which enables mixing of the enzyme with virtually any compound inside the nanoliter-scale capillary reactor and without the need of additional optimization of mixing conditions. For CYP3A4, ketamine as probe substrate and highly sulfated -cyclodextrin as chiral selector, improved separation conditions for ketamine and norketamine enantiomers compared to a previously published electrophoretically mediated microanalysis method were elucidated. The new approach was thoroughly validated for the CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation pathway of ketamine and applied to the determination of its kinetic parameters and the inhibition characteristics in presence of ketoconazole and dexmedetomidine. The determined parameters were found to be comparable to literature data obtained with different techniques.

MU discharge rate was analysed for each of the TS muscles, using High-Density surface electromyography during 10 and 20% isometric plantar flexor contractions. Results: MU mean discharge rate was lower in the Gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) in AT compared to controls. In AT, GL MU mean discharge rate did not increase as torque increased from 10% peak torque, 8.24pps (95%CI: 7.08 to 9.41) to 20%, 8.52pps (7.41 to 9.63, p=0.540); however, in controls, MU discharge rate increased as torque increased from 10%, 8.39pps (7.25 to 9.53) to 20%, 10.07pps (8.89 to 11.25, p<0.001). There were no between-group difference in Gastrocnemius medialis (GM) or Soleus (SOL) MU discharge rates. We found no between-groups differences in coefficient of variation of MU discharge rate in any of the TS muscles nor in TS torque steadiness. Conclusion: Our data demonstrates that runners with AT may have a reduced neural drive to GL, failing to increase MU discharge rate to adjust for the increase in torque demand. Further research is needed to understand how interventions focusing on increasing neural drive to GL would affect muscle function in runners with AT.","output":"Reduced motor unit discharge rates in gastrocnemius lateralis, but not in gastrocnemius medialis or soleus, in runners with Achilles tendinopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The therapeutic landscape in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor has evolved.

The aim of this study was to quantify the performance of different available types of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) in the real-world hospital setting. Methods In this retrospective analysis the diagnostic performance of seven different Ag-RDTs was compared with the real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in terms of sensitivity, specificity and expected predictive values. Results A total of 321 matched Ag-RDTCRT-qPCR samples were analyzed retrospectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity of Ag-RDTs were 78.7% and 100%, respectively. However, a wide range of sensitivity estimates by brand (66.0C93.8%) and cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off values (Ct <25: 96.2%; Ct 30C35: 31.1%) was observed. The optimal Ct cut-off value that maximized sensitivity was 29. Conclusions The routine use of Ag-RDTs may be convenient in moderate-to-high intensity settings when high volumes of specimens are tested every day.

PROSPERO registration: CRD42020174996. We included 46 studies enrolling more than 12,000 patients. Using 38 C (100.4 H) as cut-off temperature, temporal infrared thermometry had a sensitivity of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.65, 0.84; low certainty) and specificity of 0.96 (0.92, 0.98; moderate certainty); tympanic infrared thermometry had a sensitivity of 0.77 (0.60, 0.88; low certainty) and specificity of 0.98 (0.95, 0.99; moderate certainty). For all the other index devices, it was not possible to pool the estimates. Compared to the rectal mercury-in-glass thermometer, mean temperature differences were not statistically different from zero for temporal or tympanic infrared thermometry; the median coefficient of reproducibility ranged between 0.53 C [0.95 H] for infrared temporal and 1.2 C [2.16 H] for axillary digital thermometry. Several peripheral thermometers proved specific, but not sensitive for diagnosing fever with rectal thermometry as a reference standard, meaning that finding a temperature below 38 C does not rule out fever.

These unprecedented recorded data give rise to some novel concepts, discussions and models. Macroscopic modeling of the period of hospitalization is one of these new issues. METHODS: Modeling of the lag between diagnosis and death is done by using two classes of macroscopic analytical methods: the correlation-based methods based on Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients, and the logarithmic methods of two types. Also, we apply eight weighted average methods to smooth the time series before calculating the distance. We consider five lags with the least distance. All the computations are conducted on Matlab R2015b. RESULTS: The length of hospitalization for the fatal cases in the USA, Italy and Germany are 2-10, 1-6 and 5-19 days, respectively. Overall, this length in the USA is 2 days more than that in Italy and 5 days less than that in Germany. CONCLUSION: We take the distance between the diagnosis and death as the length of hospitalization. There is a negative association between the length of hospitalization and the case fatality rate. Therefore, the estimation of the length of hospitalization by using these macroscopic mathematical methods can be introduced as an indicator to scale the success of the countries fighting the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Comparing length of hospital stay during COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, Italy and Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: (i) to describe the operational strategies implemented to practise electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) safely, and (ii) to explore the effect of the lockdown and operational strategies on the characteristics of patients who received ECT during the initial 6 months of the COVID-19 lockdown.

Innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections are researched in vitro, in vivo, and in silico using mathematical and computational methods. The construction of computational models is an iterative and interactive process which combines existing knowledge and hypotheses (knowledge-driven approach) with empirical datasets (data-driven approach). The resulting models should ideally provide reusability, composability, and interoperability to support system simulation. The main premises of this paper are (1) computational models can be used not only for representation of existing knowledge, but also as experimental tools to demonstrate, exemplify, create, and serve as test-beds for the analysis of empirical data;and (2) computational models should be evaluated in terms of their usability (defined as a measure of how well a specified group of users can achieve predefined goals effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily in a specified context of use). The usability measure is specified by the context information: user characteristics, their goals, and additional constraints (e.g., data availability, temporal limitations).

Among the deep learning neural networks, convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular networks, which suffers from difficulties in dealing with small samples and keeping relative structures of features. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture based on capsule network for TM, called CapsTM, where capsule network is a new type of neural network architecture proposed to address some of the short comings of CNN and shows great potential in many tasks. METHODS: CapsTM is a five-layer neural network, including an input layer, a representation layer, an aggregation layer, a capsule layer and a prediction layer. In CapsTM, two pieces of text are first individually converted into sequences of embeddings and are further transformed by a highway network in the input layer. Then, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is used to represent each piece of text and attention-based interaction matrix is used to represent interactive information of the two pieces of text in the representation layer. Subsequently, the two kinds of representations are fused together by BiLSTM in the aggregation layer, and are further represented with capsules (vectors) in the capsule layer. Finally, the prediction layer is a connected network used for classification. CapsTM is an extension of ESIM by adding a capsule layer before the prediction layer. RESULTS: We construct a corpus of Chinese medical question matching, which contains 36,360 question pairs. This corpus is randomly split into three parts: a training set of 32,360 question pairs, a development set of 2000 question pairs and a test set of 2000 question pairs. On this corpus, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the proposed CapsTM and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods. CapsTM achieves the highest F-score of 0.8666.

METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing testing outcomes with HIVST to standard testing in the general population and published between January 1, 2006 and June 4, 2019. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted and pooled risk ratios (RRs) were reported. The certainty of evidence was determined using the GRADE methodology. FINDINGS: We identified 14 eligible RCTs, 13 of which were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Support provided to self-testers ranged from no/basic support to one-on-one in-person support. HIVST increased testing uptake overall (RR:2.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.69C2.58; p < 0.0001;13 RCTs; moderate certainty evidence) and by service delivery model including facility-based distribution, HIVST use at facilities, secondary distribution to partners, and community-based distribution.

Detailed information on glomerulonephritis diagnosis, kidney parameters, and baseline immunosuppression prior to infection were recorded, as well as clinical presentation, laboratory values, treatment, complications, and outcomes of COVID-19. This cohort was compared to 80 COVID-positive control cases from the general population without glomerulonephritis matched for the time of infection. The majority (70%) of the patients with glomerulonephritis and all the controls were hospitalized. Patients with glomerulonephritis had significantly higher mortality (15% vs. 5%, respectively) and acute kidney injury (39% vs. 14%) than controls, while the need for kidney replacement therapy was not statistically different between the two groups. Receiving immunosuppression or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors at presentation did not increase the risk of death or acute kidney injury in the glomerulonephritis cohort. In the cohort with glomerulonephritis, lower serum albumin at presentation and shorter duration of glomerular disease were associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and need for kidney replacement therapy. No differences in outcomes occurred between patients with primary glomerulonephritis versus glomerulonephritis associated with a systemic autoimmune disease (lupus or vasculitis). Thus, due to the higher mortality and risk of acute kidney injury than in the general population without glomerulonephritis, patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 should be carefully monitored, especially when they present with low serum albumin levels.","output":"Results from the IRoc-GN international registry of patients with COVID-19 and glomerular disease suggest close monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection is associated in some individuals with a rapid onset of systemic proinflammatory state leading to cytokine storm followed by multisystem organ failure.

In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the \\"psychodemia\\".

The objective of this study was to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had a greater impact on Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Veterans who live with chronic pain compared to non-Veterans. An online survey of Canadian adults with chronic pain was conducted between April and May 2020;76 respondents reported having formerly served in the CAF and were compared with 76 similar non-Veterans. About two thirds of the Veterans had been living with chronic pain for longer than 10 years. Two thirds reported worsened pain since the pandemic began. Nearly half experienced moderate to severe psychological distress. These changes were similar to those in non-Veterans with chronic pain. A significant number of Veterans and non-Veterans changed their pain treatments due to the pandemic. In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restriction measures did not have a greater impact in CAF Veterans with chronic pain compared with non-Veterans. However, changes in chronic pain supports are needed to be better prepared for COVID-19 waves to come and future health crises. Introduction: Chronic pain is more prevalent in military Veterans than in the general population. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Veterans living with chronic pain is unknown. This study compared the impact of the pandemic and public health measures on Canadian Veterans and non-Veterans. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted across Canada. Participants (n = 3,159) were adults with chronic pain recruited from April to May 2020. Seventy-six participants reported having formerly served in the CAF and were pair-matched with non-Veterans. Results: CAF Veteran participants' mean age was 55.1 (standard deviation = 9.6) years;50.0% were female. Over 60% lived with chronic pain for > 10 years. Two thirds of Veterans (67.1%) reported worsened pain since pandemic onset, and 44.7% experienced moderate to severe psychological distress. This was comparable to the non-Veteran group (63.2%, p = 0.61;35.5%, p = 0.25), and no differences were found between female and male Veterans (p = 0.22, p = 0.36). Percentages of participants reporting changes in pharmacological pain treatments because of the pandemic were similar in CAF Veterans (14.9%) and non-Veterans (13.3%) (p = 0.68). Over 50% of Veterans modified their physical/psychological pain treatments due to the pandemic, compared with 45.3% of non-Veterans (p = 0.24). Discussion: Pain deterioration, psychological distress, and pain treatment changes were observed in CAF Veterans living with chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic, as was the case in non-Veterans. These results will help develop interventions to adequately face pandemic waves to come and future health crises.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian Armed Forces Veterans who live with chronic pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo A vulnerabilidade  um fator chave no enfrentamento da COVID-19 tendo em vista que pode influenciar no agravamento da doen?a.

The main mechanism of this effect is impairment by the HIV-1 protein Nef of the ABCA1 interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin, which leads to a block in ABCA1 maturation followed by its degradation. However, ABCA1 is also downmodulated by Nef delivered with the extracellular vesicles, suggesting involvement of a direct Nef:ABCA1 interaction at the plasma membrane. Here, we present an optimized model of the Nef:ABCA1 interaction, which identifies interaction sites and provides an opportunity to perform a virtual screening for potential inhibitors. Interestingly, the predicted sites on Nef involved in the ABCA1 interaction overlap with those involved in the interaction with calnexin. The compounds previously shown to block Nef:calnexin interaction were among the top ranking ligands in docking simulations with ABCA1-interacting sites on Nef, suggesting the possibility that both interactions can be inhibited by the same chemical compounds.

Lately, the pneumonia was related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the diseases was termed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At the end of January 2020, the infection spread all over Italy, but with high infection rates and mortality in the northern part, especially in Lombardy, the most industrialized and polluted region of the country. It is noteworthy that a strong association between severe viral respiratory disease and air pollution has been described. Air pollutant could be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and can be of natural origin (such as ash from a volcanic eruption) or released from motor vehicle depletes (carbon monoxide gas) or factories (sulfur dioxide). Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulphuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid into the atmosphere. Pulmunary diseases spreadby means of small droplets in thebreath, also called aerosols, and air pollution may facilitate the outside survival of viruses. We suppose that ash and gases emitted from the Mount Etna contributed to air pollution, potentially favouring the major contagion of COVID-19 in the eastern flank of the mountain, as in Catania city. In fact, ash and gases (with regard to radon) are usually particularly intense in winter, with a reduction of emission of specific metals with warmer weather. This is the first paper that elaborates the hypothesis of a potential role of volcanic gases and heavy metals-related air pollution, combined to specific climatic conditions and regional topography, in favouring severe COVID-19 diffusion in Sicily. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to support the hypothesis and plan the due prevention and awareness-raising campaigns.","output":"Can volcanic trace elements facilitate Covid-19 diffusion?

The SEIR compartmental model considers several areas within the hospital where transmission occurred. We use a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the following units: emergency department (ED), out-patient clinic, intensive care unit, and hospital wards, where each area has its own carrying capacity and distinguishes the transmission by three individuals in the hospital: patients, health care workers (HCW), or mobile health care workers. The emergency department, as parameterized has a large influence over the epidemic size for both patients and health care workers. Trend of the basic reproduction number (R0), which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end, shows that until added hospital controls are introduced, the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards.

Even the most well-resourced health systems faced pressures from new challenges brought on by COVID-19, and every country had to make difficult choices about how to maintain access to essential care while treating a novel communicable disease. Using the information available on the HSRM platform from the early phases of the pandemic, we analyze how countries planned services for potential surge capacity, designed patient flows ensuring separation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and maintained routine services in both hospital and outpatient settings. Many country responses displayed striking similarities despite very real differences in the organization of health and care services. These include transitioning the management of COVID-19 mild cases from hospitals to outpatient settings, increasing the use of remote consultations, and cancelling or postponing non-urgent services during the height of the first wave. In the immediate future, countries will have to continue balancing care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to minimize adverse health outcomes, ideally with supporting guidelines and COVID-19-specific care zones. Many countries expect to operate at lower capacity for routinely provided care, which will impact patient access and waiting times. Looking forward, policymakers will have to consider whether strategies adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic will become permanent features of care provision.","output":"A cross-country comparison on providing health services effectively during the first wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Cerebral infarct volume as observed in follow-up CT is an important radiologic outcome measure of the effectiveness of treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, manual measurement of CIV is time-consuming and operator-dependent. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a robust automated measurement of the CIV. MATERIALS AND METHODS The CIV in early follow-up CT images of 34 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke was segmented with an automated intensity-based region-growing algorithm, which includes partial volume effect correction near the skull, midline determination, and ventricle and hemorrhage exclusion. Two observers manually delineated the CIV. Interobserver variability of the manual assessments and the accuracy of the automated method were evaluated by using the Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and Dice coefficients. The accuracy was defined as the correlation with the manual assessment as a reference standard. RESULTS The Pearson correlation for the automated method compared with the reference standard was similar to the manual correlation (R = 0.98). The accuracy of the automated method was excellent with a mean difference of 0.5 mL with limits of agreement of -38.0-39.1 mL, which were more consistent than the interobserver variability of the 2 observers (-40.9-44.1 mL). However, the Dice coefficients were higher for the manual delineation. CONCLUSIONS The automated method showed a strong correlation and accuracy with the manual reference measurement. This approach has the potential to become the standard in assessing the infarct volume as a secondary outcome measure for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment.","output":"Automated cerebral infarct volume measurement in follow-up noncontrast CT scans of patients with acute ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is associated with serious complications, such as staple line (SL) leaks and bleeding. In order to prevent the occurrence of these complications, surgeons have advocated the need to strengthen the staple line. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare the efficacy of three different ways of strengthening of the SL in LSG in preventing surgical post-operative complications. METHODS Between April 2012 and December 2014, 600 patients (pts) scheduled for LSG were prospectively randomized into groups without SL reinforcement (group A) or with SL reinforcement including fibrin glue coverage (group B), or oversewn SL with imbricating absorbable (Monocryl?; group C) or barbed (V lock?) running suture (group D). Primary endpoints were post-operative leaks, bleeding, and stenosis, while secondary outcomes consisted of the time to perform the staple line reinforcement (SLR) and total operative time. RESULTS Mean SLR operative time was lower for group B (3.4  1.3 min) compared with that for groups C (26.8  8.5 min) and D (21.1  8.4 min) (p < 0.0001). Mean total operative time was 100.7  16.4 min (group A), 104.4  22.1 min (group B), 126.2  18.9 min (group C), and 124.6  22.8 (group D) (p < 0.0001). Post-operative leaks, bleeding, and stenosis were recorded in 14 pts (2.3 %), 5 pts (0.8 %), and 7 pts (1.1 %), respectively, without statistical difference between the groups. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that SLR during LSG, with an imbricating or non-imbricating running suture or with fibrin glue, is an unrewarding surgical act with the sole effect of prolonging the operative time.","output":"Staple Line Reinforcement During Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: Absorbable Monofilament, Barbed Suture, Fibrin Glue, or Nothing?

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the pandemic on urological residency in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS From the 20th of May 2020 until the 20th of June 2020, a Germany-wide online survey on the continuing residency training was distributed via the members of the working group, social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and the German Society of Residents in Urology (GeSRU e.V.) newsletter. The survey covered 3 topics: 1) basic characteristics of the participants, 2) general and 3) subjective influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinics and further residency training. RESULTS A total of 50 residents took part in the survey; 54% were women. The median age was 31 years. Most of the participants were in their 2nd (22%) and 5th (26%) year of training and worked in a university hospital (44%) or in a clinic of maximum care (30%). 38% of the respondents stated that they only served urological emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 28% this meant a very large delay (80-100%) in the specialisation, while 28% stated only a minor impact. 66% documented training impairments caused by fewer operations, low patient numbers in the outpatient department (50%), congress (50%) and workshop (44%) cancellations. 46% of residents reported direct contact with COVID-19 patients while 10% were deployed on interdisciplinary IMC units. Numerous physical distancing and hygiene measures have been implemented by the clinics. CONCLUSION On average, around 50% of the urology residents indicated significant restrictions in training due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The delay in training cannot currently be measured in units of time, but it can be assumed that training for residents during the pandemic is likely to be of a lower quality compared to previous generations.","output":"[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urology residency training programs in Germany]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To present a rare case report of Onodi cell-associated optic neuropathy, conducting a review of the literature.

METHODS Between November 20, 2020, and March 23, 2021, we surveyed US physicians and a probability-based sample of the US working population using methods similar to our prior studies. Burnout and WLI were measured using standard tools. Information about specific work-related COVID-19 experiences was collected. RESULTS There were 7510 physicians who participated in the survey. Nonresponder analysis suggested that participants were representative of US physicians. Mean emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores were lower in 2020 than in 2017, 2014, and 2011 (all P<.001). However, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores did not improve in specialties most heavily affected by COVID-19. Overall, 38.2% of physicians reported 1 or more symptoms of burnout in 2020 compared with 43.9% in 2017, 54.4% in 2014, and 45.5% in 2011 (all P<.001). Providing care without adequate personal protective equipment (odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.72) and having suffered disruptive economic consequences due to COVID-19 (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.69) were independently associated with risk of burnout. On multivariable analysis, physicians were at increased risk for burnout (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.58) and were less likely to be satisfied with WLI (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.79) than other working US adults.

The solvation energy value of (O) in aqueous media is between the predicted for antiviral Idoxuridine and Ribavirin. Besides, (O) containing a NH(2) group and NH group reveals lower solvation energy compared with other antiviral agents with an NH(2) group, such as Ribavirin, Cidofovir, and Brincidofovir.

So, more evidence is required to determine the potential pathway of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 including airborne transmission. Therefore, we examined the potential aerosol transmission of the virus through hospital wards indoor air by confirmed COVID-19 patients on May 7, 2020. In order to capture airborne SARS-CoV-2, the liquid impinger biosampler was used to take fourteen air samples in different wards of the indoor air of the hospital.

Accordingly, we found two positive air samples (in the ICU) out of 14 ones taken from different wards with confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results revealed the possibility of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 though more studies are required to determine the role of actual mechanisms such as cough, sneeze, normal breathing and speaking in the emission of airborne size carrier aerosols.

Poverty must be addressed based on the question: \\"Inequality of what?\\" It is in reflecting on the realities of such groups when their basic needs are not met that public policies can be improved and implemented with legitimate priorities. OBJECTIVE Describe coverage and access to public health, education and social assistance services and the related effects on the quality of life of families in extreme poverty. METHODS An exploratory mixed methods study was conducted applying Amartya Sen's \\"Basic Capability Equality\\" framework, with: 1) 27 interviews with managers and professionals from public services serving territories with extreme poverty; 2) Survey with a systematic proportionate stratified sample of 336 heads of households in extreme poverty from a total 2605 families. The resulting data was analyzed with thematic content analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively. RESULTS The managers and professionals described the lives of families in extreme poverty with phrases such as, \\"These people suffer. Sadness weighs on their lives!\\" and \\"Depression is the most common illness\\". Their precarious circumstances and inadequate access were cited as causes. Quality of life was considered bad or very bad by 41.4% of heads of households. A total income of less than one-third of the minimum wage was received by 56.9% of the sample. One or more people were unemployed in the family in 55.8% of cases. For 53.3% of heads of households, public services \\"did not meet any or few of their needs\\".

The extraordinary interhuman transmission of this disease has urged scientists to examine the various facets of its pathogenic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, based on publicly available genomic data, we analyzed the codon usage co-adaptation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs) with their human host, identified CoV-responsive human genes and their functional roles on the basis of both the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)-based correlation of viral genes with human genes and differential gene expression analysis, and predicted potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment based on these genes. The relatively high codon adaptation index (CAI) values (>0.70) signposted the gene expressivity efficiency of CoVs in human. The ENc-GC3 plot indicated that SARS-CoV-2 genome was under strict selection pressure while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were under selection and mutational pressures. The RSCU-based correlation analysis indicated that the viral genomes shared similar codons with a panoply of human genes. The merging of RSCU-based correlation data and SARS-CoV-2-responsive differentially expressed genes allowed the identification of human genes potentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were enriched in biological processes and pathways related to host response to viral infection and immune response. Using the drug-gene interaction database, we screened a list of drugs that could target these genes as potential COVID-19 therapeutics. Our findings not only will contribute in vaccine development but also provide a useful set of drugs that could guide practitioners in strategical monitoring of COVID-19.

However, there is limited understanding of how external shocks may shape early implementation. In October 2019, the VHA Office of Primary Care launched national Clinical Resource Hubs (CRHs) to provide staffing gap coverage for primary care and mental health services. Through a hub and spoke model, providers at 18 regional hubs deliver virtual and in\\\\person care to patients at spoke clinics. Using CRH implementation as a case study, we consider the impact of Covid\\\\19 on early implementation efforts. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted semi\\\\structured interviews about early implementation experiences with eight program office leads and six regional hub directors from JuneCSeptember 2020. Data were analyzed using a rapid analysis approach, which entailed interview summaries cross\\\\validated by two project team members. Summaries were synthesized with consensus checks to identify major themes regarding CRH implementation from key interview domains. Data were aggregated across roles. POPULATION STUDIED: National program office leaders and regional hub directors involved in implementation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Covid\\\\19 pandemic was perceived as both facilitating and hindering implementation. For example, it accelerated achievement of some goals including telehealth emergency management support which was fast tracked in response to the pandemic during the first year of implementation although not required until year two. Hub providers also expanded support for regional nurse advice telephone call centers (a year 3 implementation goal) during March and April. In addition, Covid\\\\19 was recognized as a game changer in terms of increasing the acceptability of telehealth as an effective mode of care among VA national offices and spoke sites during a time of restricted in\\\\person appointments. The pandemic also posed significant implementation barriers. Hub directors reported difficulty establishing relationships at new spoke sites due to sites' focus on patient care during Covid\\\\19 surges. Additionally, they faced collaboration challenges, such as the inability of the national program office leaders to travel in person to assist with spoke site set\\\\up due to travel restrictions. In response to these challenges, leaders made several program modifications. Marketing efforts were broadened through increased outreach to potential spoke sites, in\\\\person visits to establish new spoke sites were suspended in favor of virtual training, and patient care delivery was modified to include in\\\\home telehealth visits. Respondents expected that these modifications may become permanent after Covid\\\\19 has ended, thereby altering CRH processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the complex effects of Covid\\\\19 on early program implementation, acting as both a facilitator and barrier in service provision, marketing, and training. Because some VA healthcare systems had telehealth pilot programs already in place, they may have been more ready to expand virtual visits when Covid\\\\19 struck. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: The program modifications we identified in response to Covid\\\\19 carry actionable lessons for healthcare organizations similarly impacted by external environmental factors. Telehealth capacity and specifically the capacity to switch from in\\\\person to virtual modes of patient care and provider training may facilitate emergency response.

The functional abilities of a species, such as its plasticity in various environments, can determine its distribution, species richness and beta diversity patterns. In this study, we evaluate how functional traits influence the distribution of amphibians, and hypothesize which functional traits explain the current pattern of amphibian species composition. LOCATION: Atlantic Forest, Brazil. TAXON: Amphibia (Anura and Gymnophiona) METHODS: Using potential distributions of Brazilian amphibians from Atlantic Forest based on their functional traits, we analysed the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on species richness, endemism (with permutation multivariate analysis) and beta diversity components (i.e. total, turnover and nestedness dissimilarities). RESULTS: Environmental variables explained 59.5% of species richness, whereas functional traits explained 15.8% of species distribution (geographical species range) for Anuran and 88.8% for Gymnophiona. Body size had the strongest correlation with species distribution. Results showed that species with medium to large body size, and species that are adapted to living in open areas tended to disperse from west to east direction. Current forest changes directly affected beta diversity patterns (i.e. most species adapted to novel environments increase their ranges). Beta diversity partitioning between humid and dry forests showed decreased nestedness and increased turnover by increasing altitude in the south\\\\eastern region of the Atlantic Forest. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that functional traits directly influence the ability of the species to disperse. With the alterations of the natural environment, species more apt to these alterations have dispersed or increased their distribution, which consequently changes community structure. As a result, there are nested species distribution patterns and homogenization of amphibian species composition throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.","output":"Functional traits explain amphibian distribution in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

Furthermore, doranidazole and misonidazole, but not metronidazole, manifested radiation-independent cytotoxicity for hypoxic GSCs that was mediated by ferroptosis induced partially through blockade of mitochondrial complexes I and II and resultant metabolic alterations in oxidative stress responses. Doranidazole also limited the growth of GSC-derived subcutaneous tumors and that of tumors in orthotopic brain slices. Our results thus reveal the theranostic potential of 2-nitroimidazoles as ferroptosis inducers that enable targeting GSCs in their hypoxic niche.","output":"2-Nitroimidazoles induce mitochondrial stress and ferroptosis in glioma stem cells residing in a hypoxic niche"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Little is known about the environmental conditions that drive the spatiotemporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2, and preliminary research suggests an association with weather parameters. However, the relationship with temperature and humidity is not yet apparent for COVID-19 cases in US cities first impacted. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between COVID-19 cases and weather parameters in select US cities. A case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate the contribution of ambient temperature and specific humidity on COVID-19 cases in select US cities. The case-crossover examines each COVID case as its own control at different time periods (before and after transmission occurred). We modeled the effect of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission using a lag period of 7 days. A subset of 8 cities were evaluated for the relationship with weather parameters and 5 cities were evaluated in detail. Short-term exposure to humidity was positively associated with COVID-19 transmission in 4 cities. The associations were small with ? cities exhibiting higher COVID19 transmission with specific humidity that ranged from 6 to 9 g/kg.

While it is clear that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 is better understood, the exact pathological alterations following infection require further investigation. The purpose of this paper is to report and share our histopathological findings from a right hemicolectomy specimen of a confirmed COVID-19 positive case, which exhibited a Mycobacterium Tuberculosis co-infection. Methods: Microscopic sections from right hemicolectomy specimen were appropriately stained and studied by two anatomical pathologists. Additionally, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases for reports/observations regarding pathological alterations of the intestine following COVID-19 infection. Results: Histological sections showed novel peculiar pathological alterations in the terminal ileal mucosa involving principally absorptive enterocytes with evidence of striking cellular injury as well as prominent erythrophagocytosis in the mesenteric lymph nodes. No specific pathological alterations were observed in the appendix or colon. The characteristic pathological features of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis infection were also observed throughout the specimen. Conclusions: Our observations showed that the novel SARS-CoV-2 can affect the gastrointestinal tract, causing epithelial injury and pathological alterations attributed to its ability to infect absorptive enterocytes by interacting with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. These pathological findings could be regarded as viral cytopathic changes and should be considered when evaluating gastrointestinal specimens from COVID-19 infected patients.","output":"Peculiar Histopathological Alterations of Enterocytes in A Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patient with Mycobacterial Tuberculosis Co-Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an area of key interest in military medicine but has not been studied among the US Army Special Forces (SF), the most elite group of US soldiers. SF soldiers make up a disproportionate 60% of all Special Operations casualties. The objective of this study was to better understand SCI incidence in the SF, its mechanisms of acquisition, and potential areas for intervention by addressing key issues pertaining to protective equipment and body armor use. METHODS An electronic survey questionnaire was formulated with the close collaboration of US board-certified neurosurgeons from the Mount Sinai Hospital and Cleveland Clinic Departments of Neurosurgery, retired military personnel of the SF, and operational staff of the Green Beret Foundation. The survey was sent to approximately 6000 SF soldiers to understand SCI diagnosis and its associations with various health and military variables. RESULTS The response rate was 8.2%. Among the 492 respondents, 94 (19.1%) self-reported an SCI diagnosis. An airborne operation was the most commonly attributed cause (54.8%). Moreover, 87.1% of SF soldiers reported wearing headgear at the time of injury, but only 36.6% reported wearing body armor, even though body armor use has significantly increased in post-9/11 SF soldiers compared with that in their pre-9/11 counterparts. SCI was significantly associated with traumatic brain injury, arthritis, low sperm count, low testosterone, erectile dysfunction, tinnitus, hyperacusis, sleep apnea, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Only 16.5% of SF soldiers diagnosed with SCI had been rescued via medical evacuation (medevac) for treatment. CONCLUSIONS A high number of SF soldiers self-reported an SCI diagnosis. Airborne operations landings were the leading cause of SCI, which coincided with warfare tactics employed during the Persian Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other conflicts. A majority of SCIs occurred while wearing headgear and no body armor, suggesting the need for improvements in protective equipment use and design. The low rate of medevac rescue for these injuries may suggest that medical rescue was not attainable at the time or that certain SCIs were deemed minor at the time of injury.","output":"Spinal cord injury in the United States Army Special Forces."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, which started at Wuhan, has shut down world economies, prompting governments to impose drastic lockdown measures of the economy and the society. As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed.","output":"Modeling the lockdown relaxation protocols of the Philippine government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: An intuitionistic fuzzy DEMATEL analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus may be upending our lives, but we aren't helpless against it","output":"A strange new world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic prompted the need for a surveillance program to determine the viral status of the California National Primate Research Center non-human primate breeding colony, both for reasons of maintaining colony health and minimizing the risk of interference in COVID-19 and other research studies.

OBJECTIVES: To determine and further elucidate the general populations knowledge and attitude with regard to HL in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey-based study conducted on the general population of Saudi Arabia. A predetermined questionnaire was translated into Arabic. This was distributed among the targeted participants in several provinces of Saudi Arabia (central, northern, eastern, western, and southern) by using an online survey via social media.

A small proportion of patients who had this condition developed severe respiratory failure that was unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions. In this report, we describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of critically ill patients in Canada who had H1N1-2009 infection and were treated with extracorporeal lung support (ECLS). METHODS: We report the findings of a case series of six patients supported with ECLS who were included in a cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1-2009 infection. The patients were treated in Canadian adult and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) from April 16, 2009 to August 12, 2009. We describe the nested sample treated with ECLS and compare it with the larger sample. RESULTS: During the study period, 168 patients in Canada were admitted to ICUs for severe respiratory failure due to confirmed H1N1-2009 infection. Due to profound hypoxemia unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions, six (3.6%) of these patients were treated with ECLS in four ICUs. Four patients were treated with veno-venous pump-driven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO), and two patients were treated with pumpless lung assist (NovaLung iLA). The mean duration of support was 15 days. Four of the six patients survived (66.6%), one of the surviving patients was supported with iLA and the other three surviving patients were supported with ECMO. The two deaths were due to multiorgan failure, which occurred while the patients were on ECLS. INTERPRETATION: Extracorporeal lung support may be an effective treatment for patients who have H1N1-2009 infection and refractory hypoxemia. Survival of these patients treated with ECLS is similar to that reported for patients who have acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiologies and are treated with ECMO.","output":"Extracorporeal lung support for patients who had severe respiratory failure secondary to influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infection in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report four studies (N=1419) examining emotional reactions from March to April 2020, when COVID-19 exhibited exponentially increasing infections and fatalities.

Study 1A, 1B, and Study 2 provided naturalistic evidence that mixed emotions predicted legitimate virus-prevention behaviors and eudaimonic functioning in the USA and Singapore, and Study 2 also supported receptivity as a mediator. Finally, Study 3 provided experimental evidence that mixed emotions causally increased legitimate virus-prevention behaviors relative to neutral, positive emotion, and negative emotion conditions, whereas eudaimonic functioning was increased only relative to the neutral condition. Across all studies, positive and negative emotions were unrelated to legitimate virus-prevention behaviors, while relationships with eudaimonic functioning were inconsistent.

Most efforts follow variants of the established SIR methodological framework that divides a population into Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered/Removed fractions and defines their dynamic inter-relationships with first-order differential equations. Goal: This paper proposes a novel approach based on data-guided detection and concatenation of infection waves C each of them described by a Riccati equation with adaptively estimated parameters. Methods: This approach was applied to Covid-19 daily time-series data of US confirmed cases, resulting in the decomposition of the epidemic time-course into five Riccati modules representing major infection waves to date (June 18th). Results: Four waves have passed the time-point of peak infection rate, with the fifth expected to peak on July 20th. The obtained parameter estimates indicate gradual reduction of infectivity rate, although the latest wave is expected to be the largest. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that, if no new waves of infection emerge, the Covid-19 epidemic will be controlled in the US (<5000 new daily cases) by September 26th, and the maximum of confirmed cases will reach 4,160,000. Importantly, this approach can be used to detect (via rigorous statistical methods) the emergence of possible new waves of infections in the future.

Since its first recognition, over 90.2 and 1.9 million people are infected and dead, respectively. Although it is not easily available for low-income countries, after many trials vaccination is initiated by some industrialized nations. However, still now there is no effective treatment for the infection. Henceforth, adherence with COVID-19 preventive and control measures is the only option to stop its spread and minimize its disastrous impact, especially, in developing nations like Ethiopia. Knowledge and behavior change are pillars to engage with preventive measures. Thus, the motivation behind this study was to assess communities adherence with COVID-19 preventive measures and its associated factors among inhabitants of Dirashe district, Southern Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was directed among 648 inhabitants in Dirashe district from June 20 to July 5, 2020. A multistage sampling technique was applied to select the participants. A pretested, validated and reliable interviewer-administered survey tool comprising the socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge ( = 0.78), and adherence with COVID-19 preventive measures ( = 0.73) was used. The data were assorted electronically using Open Data Kit (ODK) collect version 1.17.2 android application and exported to Stata version 15.0 for analysis. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% CI was used to identify variables associated with the communitys adherence with COVID-19 preventive measures. RESULTS: An aggregate of 644 inhabitants were participated in this study; of them, only 12.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.8, 15.1] adhered to the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures. Likewise, 63.51% [95% CI: 59.7, 67.2] and 54.5% [95% CI: 50.6, 58.4] of the participants had good knowledge and favorable attitude towards COVID-19 preventive measures, respectively.

While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water, the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses, but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied. The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past, but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments. Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.","output":"Waterborne Transmission of Enteric Viruses and Their Impact on Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer patients have been regarded as having a high risk of severe events if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, particularly those under medical or surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the posttreatment risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in a population of patients operated on for colorectal cancer 3 months before the COVID-19 outbreak and who after hospitalization returned to an environment where the virus was circulating. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This French, multicenter cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer between January 1 and March 31, 2020, at 19 GRECCAR hospitals. The outcome was the rate of COVID-19 infection in this group of patients who were followed until June 15, 2020. RESULTS: This study included 448 patients, 262 male (58.5%) and 186 female (41.5%), who underwent surgery for colon cancer (n = 290, 64.7%), rectal cancer (n = 155, 34.6%), or anal cancer (n = 3, 0.7%). The median age was 68 years (19C95). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of the patients, 52% were at least overweight, and the median BMI was 25 (12C42). At the end of the study, 448 were alive. Six patients (1.3%) developed COVID-19 infection; among them, 3 were hospitalized in the conventional ward, and none of them died. CONCLUSION: The results are reassuring, with only a 1.3% infection rate and no deaths related to COVID-19. We believe that we can operate on colorectal cancer patients without additional mortality from COVID-19, applying all measures aimed at reducing the risk of infection.","output":"Are colorectal cancer patients at risk for COVID-19 infection during the postoperative period?

There is, however, a paucity of information on SimEx application to test the functionality of health systems alongside emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Given the important implications health services resilience has for the protection and improvement of human life, this scoping review was undertaken to determine how the publicly available body of existing global SimEx materials considers health systems, together with health security functions in the event of disruptive emergencies. The global review identified 668 articles from literature and 73 products from institutional sources. Relevant screening identified 51 materials suitable to examine from a health system lens using the six health system building blocks as per the WHO Health System Framework. Eight materials were identified for further examination of their ability to test health system functionality from a resilience perspective. SimEx are an effective approach used extensively within health security and emergency response sectors but is not yet adequately used to test health system resilience. Currently available SimEx materials lack an integrated health system perspective and have a limited focus on the quality of services delivered within the context of response to a public health emergency. The materials do not focus on the ability of systems to effectively maintain core services during response. Without adjustment of the scope and focus, currently available SimEx materials do not have the capacity to test health systems to support the development of resilient health systems. Dedicated SimEx materials are urgently needed to fill this gap and harness their potential as an operational tool to contribute to improvements in health systems. They can act as effective global goods to allow testing of different functional aspects of health systems and service delivery alongside emergency preparedness and response.

Newer technologies in interventional endoscopy have led to a substantial paradigm shift in the management of early-stage neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus comprising high-grade dysplasia (HGD), intramucosal carcinoma, and, in some cases, submucosal carcinoma. However, there has been no consensus regarding the indications for esophageal preservation in these cases. In this work, consensus guidelines were established for the management of early-stage esophageal neoplasia considering clinically relevant aspects (age, comorbidities, and social environment) in each scenario. METHODS Seventeen experts were invited to participate based on their background and clinical expertise at high-volume centers. A questionnaire was created that included four clinical scenarios covering a wide range of situations within HGD and/or early esophageal neoplasia, particularly where controversies are likely to exist. Each of the clinical scenarios was open to discussion subdivided by patient age (20, 50, and 80 s). For each clinical scenario an expert was chosen to defend that position. Each defense triggered a subsequent discussion during a consensus meeting. Conclusions of that discussion together with an accompanying literature analysis allowed experts to confirm or change their original choices and served as the basis for the recommendations stated in this article. RESULTS There was 100 % consensus supporting esophageal preservation in patients with HGD, independent of patient age or Barrett's length. In patients with T1a adenocarcinoma, consensus for preservation was not reached (65 %) for young and middle-aged individuals but was supported for elderly patients (100 %). For T1b adenocarcinoma, consensus was reached for surgical resection (90 %), leaving organ preservation for patients with very low risk of nodal invasion or poor surgical candidates. CONCLUSION Advances in endoscopic imaging and therapy allow for organ preservation in most settings of early-stage neoplasia of the esophagus, provided that the patient understands the implications of this decision.","output":"Management of early-stage esophageal neoplasia (MESEN) consensus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims COVID-19 poses many challenges to the way in which rheumatology services are delivered. In particular, the sudden change from face-to-face (F2F) appointments to telephone consultations (TC) has adversely impacted upon the assessment and management of disease activity. Therefore, we established a dedicated urgent F2F rheumatology clinic to rapidly assess new or follow-up patients with symptoms that could not be managed remotely during the pandemic. Herein we present patient outcomes to inform future service planning in the context of the ongoing pandemic and continuing need for rationing of F2F services. Methods Patients requiring urgent F2F assessment between 22(nd) April and 28(th) July 2020 were evaluated. Referrals came from rheumatologists, rheumatology trainees, nurse specialists, general practitioners, and other medical teams. Prior to attendance, patients were screened for symptoms of COVID-19 by a clinician. Temperature monitoring was performed on the day of attendance. A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted in which we identified outcomes of all patients reviewed. Results A total of 201 patients were scheduled an appointment (10 did not attend). Mean age was 45.416.6 years of which 14% were shielding. In all, 85% of patients were referred following a previous TC in which assessment and/or treatment could not be done remotely. New referrals consisted primarily of possible new inflammatory arthritis (55%), new autoimmune rheumatic disease (6%) or polymyalgia rheumatica (4%) with 23% currently undergoing investigation to confirm diagnosis. All patients required physical examination and alteration in investigation and/or management. Of those who attended, blood tests (66%), radiographs (32%), MRI (14%), and ultrasound (8%) were the most common investigations requested. In total 14% were referred to another secondary care specialty, 14% to physiotherapy, and 13% for specialist nurse review. Regarding treatment, 25% required intra-articular joint injection (37 patients received a total of 45 joint injections on the day of the clinic with a further 10 patients referred for ultrasound-guided injection); 13% of patients received intramuscular steroids; and 16% were prescribed oral steroids. New disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy was initiated in 17% of cases with an additional 11% starting a new biologic agent. No patients had their treatment reduced or discontinued. We are not aware of any new cases of COVID-19 following attendance at this clinic. Conclusion This urgent clinical service was formed because virtual remote consultations alone were insufficient to address the clinical needs of our patients. We found this service to be safe and effective for assessment of patients, with escalation of treatment according to clinical need, in spite of the adverse impact of COVID-19 upon our services. However, for future service planning during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic this F2F service requires the availability and support of nursing, allied healthcare professionals, pharmacy and diagnostic services.

The new laws to update time-varying parameters, estimating disturbance and uncertainty bounds are proposed such that stability of system is guaranteed.

Methods After IRB approval, a retrospective cohort study was performed from existing clinical records at the shelter 2/2015-9/2019. Chart abstraction included variables such as demographics (including age, sex, and race/ethnicity), biopsychosocial factors (including childhood trauma/abuse history, substance abuse history, and sexual activity), and immunization history. Results A total of 440 charts were analyzed. When comparing demographics of patients that had complete vaccine regimens versus those who did not, the race was statistically significant (p=.006). The most prominent difference in race was seen for Black/African American patients; only 19.57% had a completed vaccine regimen documented. Regarding immunization history, vaccine schedules of hepatitis B, measles mumps rubella (MMR), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and varicella were most likely to be complete; pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 13, rotavirus, influenza, and human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) were least likely.

The initial treatment is with conservative measures. However, when this fails the next step treatment remains unclear. Minimal invasive treatment modalities have emerged. Needle aspiration of the calcific deposits (NACD) and extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) have both shown good clinical results. Nonetheless, in the current orthopedic literature there are not any studies available that compare both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of those two treatment modalities. Therefore, our primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of NACD to ESWT. A secondary objective is to compare the cost-effectiveness of both treatment modalities and workability. METHODS: Following a power calculation using the minimal clinical important difference of our primary outcome (Constant-Murley score, CMS) 140 patients will be included in the study. Enrolment is based upon strict inclusion/ exclusion criteria outlined in the Methods section. Participants will be randomized by computer in two groups (e.g. 70 patients will receive NACD and 70 patients will receive ESWT). The NACD treatment will consist of a sonographically guided removal of the calcific deposits and the ESWT treatment will be a focused ESWT. Both treatments will be conducted according to a standardized protocol, as part of care as usual in our hospital. The primary outcome will be the between group differences in functional outcome (measured with the CMS) between baseline and after 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be questionnaires regarding the clinical outcome (SST) and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Furthermore, NRS pain and cost related questionnaires (iPCQ and ProDisQ) will be collected during follow-up after two months, six months and at final follow-up after 12 months.

This study aims to expand the currently limited knowledge base for restoration techniques in the Maldives by testing the performance of mid-water rope nurseries in a lagoon and a reef habitat. We examined whether different coral farming habitats impacted fragment survival, health and growth of two coral genera and how the occurrence of mutualistic fauna, predation and disease influenced coral rearing success. Two nurseries were stocked with a total of 448 Pocillopora verrucosa and 96 Acropora spp. fragments, divided into different groups (four Pocillopora groups: lagoon nursery at 5 m; reef nursery at 5, 10 and 15 m; two Acropora groups: lagoon nursery at 5 m and reef nursery at 5 m). Eight fragment replicates from the same donor colony (Pocillopora genets: N = 14, Acropora genets N = 6) were used in each group and monitored for one year. Our results show that fragment survival was high in both farming habitats (>90%), with P. verrucosa surviving significantly better in the lagoon and Acropora spp. surviving and growing significantly faster in the reef nursery. P. verrucosa growth rates were similar between reef and lagoon habitat. Different rearing depths in the reef nursery had no impact on the survival of P. verrucosa but coral growth decreased considerably with depth, reducing fragments ecological volume augmentation and growth rates by almost half from 5 to 15 m depth. Further, higher fish predation rates on fragments were recorded on the reef, which did not impact overall nursery performance. Mutualistic fauna, which correlated positively with fragment survival, was more frequently observed in the lagoon nursery. The occurrence of disease was noted in both habitats, even though implications for fragment health were more severe in the lagoon. Overall, our study demonstrates that lagoon and reef nurseries are suitable for rearing large numbers of coral fragments for transplantation. Nevertheless, we recommend considering the specific environmental conditions of the farming habitat, in particular water quality and year-round accessibility, in each case and to adjust the coral farming strategy accordingly.

Trauma centers have reported decreases in trauma volume, paralleled by changes in injury mechanisms. We aimed to quantify changes in trauma epidemiology at an urban Level I trauma center in a county that instituted one of the earliest shelter-in-place orders to inform trauma care during future pandemic responses. METHODS: A single-center interrupted time-series analysis was performed to identify associations of shelter-in-place with trauma volume, injury mechanisms, and patient demographics in San Francisco, California. To control for short-term trends in trauma epidemiology, weekly level data were analyzed 6 months before shelter-in-place. To control for long-term trends, monthly level data were analyzed 5 years before shelter-in-place. RESULTS: Trauma volume decreased by 50% in the week following shelter-in-place (p < 0.01), followed by a linear increase each successive week (p < 0.01). Despite this, trauma volume for each month (MarchCJune 2020) remained lower compared with corresponding months for all previous 5 years (2015C2019). Pediatric trauma volume showed similar trends with initial decreases (p = 0.02) followed by steady increases (p = 0.05). Reductions in trauma volumes were due entirely to changes in nonviolent injury mechanisms, while violence-related injury mechanisms remained unchanged (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although the shelter-in-place order was associated with an overall decline in trauma volume, violence-related injuries persisted. Delineating and addressing underlying factors driving persistent violence-related injuries during shelter-in-place orders should be a focus of public health efforts in preparation for future pandemic responses.

Furthermore, patients with D-dimer >3,000 ng/mL had a trend of lower pH (7.24 vs. 7.33), higher pCO2 (61.33 vs. 50.69), and higher vasoactive inotropic score (7.23 vs. 3.97) at time of cannulation, however, these were not statistically significant. This cohort of patients also required a longer duration of ECMO support (51.44 vs. 31.25 days). However, 13 patients required at least one ECMO-circuit exchange and 16 patients did not require any exchanges. There was a consistent drop in D-dimer values after every circuit exchange, which was not observed in any of the other examined inflammatory markers, including ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, or C-reactive protein. We propose that elevated D-dimer levels (>3,000 ng/mL) reflect increased disease severity in COVID-19, and predict a longer ECMO course. Once on ECMO, however, the D-Dimer level consistently decreased with every circuit exchange, which may reflect thrombus within the oxygenator rather than just disease severity.","output":"Utility of D-dimers in COVID-19 Patients Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With very few adjuvants currently being used in marketed human vaccines, a critical need exists for novel immunopotentiators and delivery vehicles capable of eliciting humoral, cellular and mucosal immunity.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital in China between January 2016 and December 2018. Schizophrenia patients with normal thyroid tests at admission were included. Hypothyroidism, which was defined as TSH>4.20 mU/L and free T4<12.00 pmol/L, or on L- thyroxine prescriptions, was the outcome measure, and quetiapine treatment between admission and subsequent thyroid test was the exposure measure of this study. Adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the independent association of quetiapine treatment with risk of new onset hypothyroidism. The dose-response association was further analyzed by three quetiapine doses: low (<=0.2 g/d), medium (0.2-0.6 g/d), and high (>0.6 g/d). RESULTS: A total of 2,022 eligible patients were included in the final analysis. Sixty patients (15.0%) in the quetiapine group developed hypothyroidism, while 56 patients (3.5%) in non-quetiapine group developed hypothyroidism. Relative risk (95% confidence interval) of developing hypothyroidism for quetiapine use was 4.01 (2.86-5.64) after adjusting for a number of potential confounding factors. A strong dose-response association between quetiapine use and risk of developing hypothyroidism was observed: adjusted relative risks (95% confidence intervals) were 1.00 (0.25-2.59), 4.22 (2.80-6.25), and 5.62 (3.66-8.38), respectively, for low-, medium-, and high-dose quetiapine, as compared with no quetiapine.

Participants completed the study questionnaire between July and December 2020, throughout which time there were public health restrictions in place. RESULTS: 1054 people took part in the study (596 axSpA, 162 PsA, 296 regional pain). In comparison to their previous (pre-pandemic) assessment, there was an age-adjusted significant, small, decrease in quality of life measured by EQ-5D (-0.020 95% CI (-0.030, -0.009)) overall and across all population groups examined. This was primarily related to poorer mental health and pain. There was a small increase in fibromyalgia symptoms, but a small decrease in sleep problems. There was a small deterioration in axSpA disease activity, and disease-specific quality of life and anxiety in PsA participants. Predictors of poor quality of life were similar pre- and during the pandemic. The effect of lockdown on activity differed according to age, gender, and deprivation. CONCLUSION: Important lessons include focussing on addressing anxiety and providing enhanced support for self-management in the absence of normal health care being available, and awareness that all population groups are likely to be affected.","output":"The effect of COVID19 public health restrictions on the health of people with musculoskeletal conditions and symptoms: the CONTAIN study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we analyze the spread of COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) cases and deaths across the United States using county data at different levels of comparison.

Generally, quercetin can be found in aglycone and glycoside forms, mainly in leaves. The absorption of this compound occurs in the large and small intestine, where it suffers glucuronidation, sulfidation, and methylation to improve hydrophilicity. After metabolization, which occurs mainly in the gut, it is distributed throughout the whole organism and is excreted by feces, urine, and exhalation of carbon dioxide. Despite its in vitro cytotoxicity effects, in vivo studies with animal models ensure its safety. This compound can protect against cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases due to its radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its poor bioavailability dampens the potential beneficial effects of this flavonoid. In that sense, many types of nanocarriers have been developed to improve quercetin solubility, as well as to design tissue-specific delivery systems. All these studies manage to improve the bioavailability of quercetin, allowing it to increase its concentration in the desired places.

Concentration and sizes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) recently emerged as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with liver cancer, but no data on its prognostic relevance in the context of TACE exists. Here, we evaluate pre-interventional EVs as a potential biomarker in patients undergoing TACE for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. METHODS: Vesicle size distribution and concentration were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) in patient sera before and after TACE in 38 patients. RESULTS: Extracellular vesicle size distribution measured before TACE is of prognostic significance with respect to overall survival in patients after TACE. Overall survival is significantly reduced when initial vesicle size (X50) is in the upper quartile (>145.65nm). Median overall survival in patients in the upper quartile was only 314 days, compared to 799 days in patients with vesicle size in the first to third quartile (<145.65nm; p = 0.007). Vesicle size was also shown to be a significant prognostic marker for overall survival in Cox regression analysis [HR 1.089, 95% CI: 1.021C1.162, p = 0.010].

A 1:5 ratio electric micromotor handpiece which allows water coolant without compressed air (Ti-Max Z95L, NSK) was used at three speeds: 60,000 (60K), 120,000 (120K), and 200,000 (200K) revolutions per minute. Coolant solutions contained fluorescein sodium as a tracer (2.65 mmol L-1). High-speed air-turbine positive control, and negative control conditions were conducted. Aerosol production was evaluated at 3 locations (0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 1.7 m) using: (1) an optical particle counter (OPC; 3016-IAQ, Lighthouse) to detect all aerosol; and (2) a liquid cyclone air sampler (BioSampler, SKC Ltd.) to detect aerosolised fluorescein, which was quantified by spectrofluorometric analysis. Settled droplets were detected by spectrofluorometric analysis of filter papers placed onto a rig across the open-plan clinic. RESULTS Local (within treatment bay) settled droplet contamination was elevated above negative control for all conditions, with no difference between conditions. Settled droplet contamination was not detected above negative controls outside the treatment bay for any condition. Aerosol detection at 1.5 m and 1.7 m, was only increased for the air-turbine positive control condition. At 0.5 m, aerosol levels were highly elevated for the air-turbine, minimally elevated for 200K and 120K, and not elevated for 60K.

DISCUSSION: As for the methods of economic assessment in general, or methods for assessing the economic impact of regulations in particular, cost-effectiveness analysis is the most commonly used method for research and development, while internal rate of return is frequently used for the producers, and budget impact analysis is typically used for healthcare service providers. A non-financial indicator that is often discussed is the time demands associated with meeting compliance requirements. The time-to-market indicator is also often mentioned. Economic and financial topics are not discussed in depth, as the reviewed articles simply mention the generally high costs attendant on complying with regulations and obtaining certificates.","output":"Critical Factors and Economic Methods for Regulatory Impact Assessment in the Medical Device Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Kenya begin to rise, the number of severe and critical COVID-19 patients has the potential to quickly overload the local healthcare system beyond its capacity to treat people. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to gather information about the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services and to identify priority actions for use by policymakers and other stakeholders as a roadmap toward strengthening the COVID-19 response in the country. METHODS: This was a comprehensive review of the published and grey literature on emergency and critical care services in Kenya published in the last three years through April 2020. Screening of articles was conducted independently by the authors and the final decision for inclusion was made collaboratively. A total of 15 papers and documents were included in the review. Key recommendations. There is an urgent need to strengthen prehospital emergency care in Kenya by establishing a single toll-free ambulance access number and an integrated public Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to respond to severe and critical COVID-19 patients in the community and other emergency cases. Functional 24-h emergency departments (EDs) need to be established in all the level 4, 5 and 6 hospitals in the country to ensure these patients receive immediate lifesaving emergency care when they arrive at the hospitals. The EDs should be equipped with pulse oximeters and functioning oxygen systems and have the necessary resources and skills to perform endotracheal intubation to manage COVID-19-induced respiratory distress and hypoxia. Additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators are also needed to ensure continuity of care for the critically ill patients seen in the ED. Appropriate practical interventions should be instituted to limit the spread of COVID-19 to healthcare personnel and other patients within the healthcare system. Further research with individual facility levels of assessment around infrastructure and service provision is necessary to more narrowly define areas with significant shortfalls in emergency and critical care services as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country increase.","output":"A baseline review of the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of a Bi-needle technique and conventional transforaminal endoscopic spine system (TESSYS) technique for percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) in treating patients with intervertebral disc calcification (IDC). BACKGROUND PELD has gained acceptance for treating patients with IDC. The Bi-needle technique was designed to improve the efficiency and safety of PELD. METHOD Bi-needle and TESSYS group within each cohort were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching. Finally, 32 patients with IDC treated by Bi-needle technique from December 2015 to September 2017 were enrolled and 25 patients treated by TESSYS technique from the same spine surgery center between January 2013 and October 2017 were enrolled as controls. RESULTS Propensity score matching generated 22 Bi-needle and 22 TESSYS patients. There were no significant differences in visual analog scale and lumbar Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores between Bi-needle and TESSYS group. Operative time and rate of complications in the Bi-needle was significantly better than the TESSYS group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Both surgical methods achieved good clinical outcomes. However, compared with the TESSSY technique, operative time of the Bi-needle technique is shorter, and rate of complications is lower.","output":"Bi-needle technique versus transforaminal endoscopic spine system technique for percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy in treating intervertebral disc calcification: a propensity score matched cohort analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disasters are increasing around the world.

The new confirmed cases of infected individuals of COVID-19 are increasing day by day. Therefore, the prediction of infected individuals has become of utmost important for health care arrangements and to control the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model with intervention strategies such as lockdown, quarantine, and hospitalization. We compute the basic reproduction number (R0), which plays a vital role in mathematical epidemiology. Based on R0, it is revealed that the system has two equilibrium, namely disease-free and endemic. We also demonstrate the non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions, local and global stability of equilibria, transcritical bifurcation to analyze its epidemiological relevance. Furthermore, to validate our system, we fit the cumulative and new daily cases in India. We estimate the model parameters and predict the near future scenario of the disease. The global sensitivity analysis has also been performed to observe the impact of different parameters on R0. We also investigate the dynamics of disease in respect of different situations of lockdown, e.g., complete lockdown, partial lockdown, and no lockdown. Our analysis concludes that if there is partial or no lockdown case, then endemic level would be high. Along with this, the high transmission rate ensures higher level of endemicity. From the short time prediction, we predict that India may face a crucial phase (approx 6000000 infected individuals within 140 days) in near future due to COVID-19.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children with pneumonia from June 2009 to May 2014. All samples that tested positive for HAdV were typed by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes. From a total of 3089 samples, 208 (6.7 %) were positive for HAdV, identified as belonging to HAdV-B (186, 89.4 %), HAdV-C (9, 4.3 %) and HAdV-E (1, 0.5 %). HAdV-7 (104, 50.0 %) and HAdV-3 (78, 37.5 %) were the two major types, followed by HAdV-1, HAdV-55 and HAdV-14. There were 87 (41.8 %) single HAdV infections, of which 80 % were HAdV-7 infections.

Severe cases of the disease often result in respiratory distress due to cytokine storm, and mechanical ventilation is required. Although, the lungs are the primary organs affected by the disease, more evidence on damage to the heart, kidney, and liver is emerging. A common link in these connections is the cardiovascular network. Inner lining of the blood vessels, called endothelium, is formed by a single layer of endothelial cells. Several clinical manifestations involving the endothelium have been reported, such as its activation via immunomodulation, endotheliitis, thrombosis, vasoconstriction, and distinct intussusceptive angiogenesis (IA), a unique and rapid process of blood-vessel formation by splitting a vessel into two lumens. In fact, the virus directly infects the endothelium via TMPRSS2 spike glycoprotein priming to facilitate ACE-2-mediated viral entry. Recent studies have indicated a significant increase in remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed via intussusception in patients with COVID-19. However, the lack of circulatory biomarkers for IA limits its detection in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 23 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as 22 healthy volunteers. Lung involvement was determined using computed tomography. Serum soluble-RAGE (sRAGE) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The sRAGE levels were significantly higher in the asymptomatic group than in the control group. Age, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels were higher and the sRAGE level was lower in the patients with lung involvement than in the asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients with high sRAGE levels were younger and had asymptomatic COVID-19. Patients with low sRAGE levels were elderly patients with lung involvement, which indicates that the RAGE pathway plays an important role in the aggravation of COVID-19.","output":"The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) pathway in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Equitable access to high-quality higher education is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 4, 5, and 10, which indicate that it is crucial for a future sustainable society.

Creating equity in access to high-quality education requires teaching approaches that are considerate of each students individual sociocultural context as it affects their educational attainment. Building on discipline-based education research (DBER) principles in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, a modified holistic approach is proposed that primarily centres on students and tailors the teaching methods to the needs of the individuals and the dynamic of the whole class. This work demonstrates that educational attainment and student confidence was improved by applying an individual-centred teaching approach in a highly diverse undergraduate engineering classroom. Trials of this approach in a pilot classroom showed clear and consistent improvement over standard active learning approaches. Best practice guidelines for individual-centred teaching in STEM classrooms are provided. Further work is needed to examine the efficacy of this approach in a generalised setting, but the positive outcomes for student attainment are in line with existing research in the literature.

This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. Methods: Between 5th April and 28th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. Results: We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19; mistrust in the government; concern about taking a test; perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy; and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others; positive perceptions of tests; a desire to return to normal; and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. Conclusions: Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing; 2) provide information about the accuracy of tests; 3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and; 4) emphasise accessibility of testing.","output":"The social media response to twice-weekly mass asymptomatic testing in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine versus placebo increases time to contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in frontline healthcare workers.

We describe our experience in the endovascular recanalization of tandem vertebrobasilar occlusions using endovascular techniques. The BA was accessed through the normal VA (clean-road) or the occluded, thrombotic VA (dirty-road), and stentriever-based thrombectomy was performed using antegrade or reverse revascularization variants. Seven patients underwent successful stentriever-assisted mechanical thrombectomy of the BA and five sustained concomitant VA revascularization. Stroke onset to endovascular intervention initiation (time-to-treatment) ranged from 4.5-13hours (mean 8.6). In two of seven patients, the BA occlusion was approached with a 'clean-road' approach via the contralateral VA; in five of seven patients, a 'dirty-road' approach via the occluded VA was used. Mean time-to-recanalization was 66minutes (range 55-82). There were no perforations, iatrogenic vessel dissections, or other technical complications. Four patients presented mild-to-moderate disability (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3) at 3months, one remained with moderate-to-severe disability (mRS 4), and two patients died on days 9 and 23 after their strokes. Follow-up ranged from 6-45months (mean 24months). In selected patients with acute VA-BA occlusion, stentriever-based thrombectomy performed through either the patent or the occluded VA, may be feasible, effective, and safe. Clinical outcomes in these patients seem to equipoise the neurological outcome of patients with successful revascularization for isolated BA occlusion. This unique pair of occlusions confirms the role of VA ostium stenosis as a cause of vertebrobasilar stroke.","output":"Emergent revascularization of acute tandem vertebrobasilar occlusions: Endovascular approaches and technical considerations-Confirming the role of vertebral artery ostium stenosis as a cause of vertebrobasilar stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We identify two categories of potentially bad investors in TLAC-eligible bonds for the purpose of bail-in, i.e. households and hedge funds.

The authors present their initial experience with this novel technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 38 consecutive critically ill patients who underwent saline-filled cuff puncture PDT between October 2016 and December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The saline-filled ETT cuff was easily identified using ultrasound. Ultrasound-guided puncture into the cuff, followed by an inward-push of the ETT through the tube exchanger, facilitated accurate passage of the guidewire through the needle tip into the tracheal lumen. RESULTS Of 38 consecutive procedures, 37 (97.4%) were performed successfully, with only one converted to surgical tracheostomy due to guidewire displacement. The median procedure time was 8 min. There were no complications, such as accidental extubation, major bleeding, or posterior tracheal wall laceration or pneumothorax, and no procedure-related mortalities. CONCLUSIONS PDT performed using a saline-filled cuff as the ultrasound-guided puncture target and an endotracheal tube exchanger is feasible, and appeared to be easier to perform than standard PDT.

Global air travel offers an easy and fast opportunity not only for people but also for infectious diseases to spread around the world within a few days. Also, large public events facilitate increasing infection numbers. Therefore, rapid on-site screening for infected people is urgently needed. Due to the small size and easy handling, ion mobility spectrometry coupled with a multicapillary column (MCC-IMS) is a very promising, sensitive method for the on-site identification of infectious pathogens based on scents, representing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether identification of Influenza-A-infection based on VOCs by MCC-IMS is possible in breath. Nasal breath was investigated in 24 consecutive persons with and without Influenza-A-infection by MCC-IMS. In 14 Influenza-A-infected patients, infection was proven by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Four healthy staff members and six patients with negative PCR result served as controls. For picking up relevant VOCs in MCC-IMS spectra, software based on cluster analysis followed by multivariate statistical analysis was applied. With only four VOCs canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish Influenza-A-infected patients from those not infected with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

Ethnobiologists have recently focused on cross-cultural studies in order to record and measure the processes guiding the evolution of TEK within a specific society; both to preserve it and use it sustainably in the future. The current study documents the TEK of plant resources from five ethnic communities of the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region, Western Himalayas. Through semi-structured interviews and group discussions, we recorded a total of 127 plant species used by local ethnic groups for various provisioning services (i.e., medicine, food, fodder, fuelwood, herbal tea) and/or with spiritual significance. Across the ethnic groups, Gujjar reported the highest number of plants (25% species), followed by Pahari (24% species), and the lowest number of plants were reported by Dogra (12% species). Looking at plant uses among different cultural groups, we discovered that, especially, some ritual practices were associated with specific plants. We found a relatively high overlap in the use of specific plants among the ethnic groups, namely Gujjar, Bakarwal, and Pahari. Certain species were found to be common in all cultures due to their food value. The current study is a collaborative effort that includes not only documenting, but also cross-cultural comparisons of the documented species, in order to better understand the diverse traditional plant usage systems. This will not only increase regional understanding of cross-cultural ethnobotany, but it will also open opportunities for local people to be rewarded for promoting and celebrating their expertise and participating in future development activities. ABSTRACT: Plant resources have always been valuable in human life, and many plant species are used in medicine, food, and ritual, and resource utilization is closely related to cultural diversity. Our study was conducted from June 2019 to April 2021, during which we aimed to document the local knowledge of plant resources of five ethnic groups, i.e., the Gujjar, Bakarwal, Kashmiri, Pahari, and Dogra communities of the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region, Western Himalayas. Through semi-structured interviews (N = 342) and group discussions (N = 38), we collected data on the ethnobotanical uses of plant resources. The data was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and ordination techniques (Principal Component Analysis) via, R software of version 4.0.0. Traditional uses were classified into three groups, i.e., single-, double-, and multi-use groups. The study recorded a total of 127 plant species, belonging to 113 genera and distributed among 64 botanical families. The dominant plant families were the Asteraceae, with 8% of all species, followed by Lamiaceae (6%), Polygonaceae (5%) and Ranunculaceae (4%). The recorded plant taxa were frequently used for medicine (51.4% responses), followed by food (14.9%), and fodder (9.5%). Principal component analysis (PCA) separated three groups of provisioning services depending on plant consumption preference levels. Comparative analysis showed remarkable similarities in plant uses (food, medicinal) among the Gujjar and Bakarwal ethnic groups, as both groups share a common culture. Some plants like Azadirachta indica, Brassica campestris, Ulmus wallichiana, Amaranthus blitum, and Celtis australis were also used for magico-religious purposes. We also recorded some medicinal uses that are new to the ethnobotanical literature of the J&K Himalayas, such as for Betula utilis, Sambucus wightiana, and Dolomiaea macrocephala, in our case for example local medicinal recipe, which is derived from Dolomiaea macrocephala, often known as Nashasta, used to treat weakness, back pain, and joint pain. Similarly, we also recorded new food uses for Eremurus himalaicus. Moreover, we also observed some plants for instance, Fragaria nubicola, Betula utilis and Juniperus communis have spiritual significance (i.e., amulets and scrolls) for this part of the Himalayan region. The present study provides a useful tool for resource management and can help in developing scientifically informed strategies for the conservation of plant resources.","output":"A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Plant Resources among Five Ethnic Groups in the Western Himalayan Region of Jammu and Kashmir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are at a turning point in health policy.

To the authors' knowledge, no studies have validated this tool in UK general practice. AIM To evaluate the accuracy of this system for detecting serious illness in children presenting to general practice. DESIGN AND SETTING A retrospective diagnostic accuracy study was undertaken, using a cohort of acutely unwell children aged <5 years presenting to general practice in England and Wales. METHOD The traffic light categories of 6703 children were linked with hospital data to identify admissions and diagnoses. The sensitivity and specificity of these categories were calculated against the reference standard: a hospital-diagnosed serious illness within 7 days of GP consultation, measured using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes. RESULTS In total, 2116 (31.6%) children were categorised as 'red'; 4204 (62.7%) as 'amber'; and 383 (5.7%) as 'green'. There were 139 (2.1%) children who were admitted to hospital within 7 days of consultation, of whom 17 (12.2%; 0.3% overall) had a serious illness. The sensitivity of the red category (versus amber and green) was 58.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 32.9 to 81.6) and the specificity 68.5% (95% CI = 67.4 to 69.6). The sensitivity and specificity of red and amber combined (versus green) was 100% (95% CI = 80.5 to 100) and 5.7% (95% CI = 5.2 to 6.3), respectively.

Two different radiofrequency ablation (RFA) devices with internally cooled electrodes were used. Tumor diameters ranged from 0.5 to 10 cm (median 3.0 cm). A total of 23 SRFA sessions were performed. The efficacy of SRFA was evaluated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging 1 month after treatment and then every 3 months. RESULTS Primary technical effectiveness rate was 92%. Further follow-up every 3 months revealed three local recurrences (8%), two of which were successfully retreated, resulting in a secondary technical effectiveness rate of 98%. After a total of 23 RFA sessions, three major complications occurred (13%) that could be managed interventionally. Mean follow-up time was 35 months (range 12-81 months).

To clarify the mechanism of propranolol activity in colorectal cancer, the therapeutic activity of propranolol was then assessed in CT26WT tumors engrafted in BALB/C mice. Then the effect of propranolol treatment was also examined by randomizing patients undergoing surgical resection of a previously untreated colorectal cancer to propranolol or placebo group and treated for 1 week prior to surgery. CT26WT tumor size was smaller after propranolol than vehicle control. Propranolol downregulated the expression of p-AKT/p-ERK/p-MEK in tumor tissue.

The expression of GzmB/IFN-?3/T-bet in the CD8+ T-cell population was significantly increased in propranolol treated mice tumor tissue. In propranolol-treated surgical specimens, the expression of p-ERK was decreased and the frequency of CD8+ was significantly elevated.

Such knowledge is important to understand the survival of the virus at surfaces and for the development of antiviral materials. Here is reported a study of the interactions between glucoside monomers of the tip of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with dry and wet surfaces of CuO and Cu, performed with dispersion corrected density functional theoryDFT. The three glucoside monomers that constitute the tip of S1: 6VSB, 6VXX and 6X6P, were adsorbed onto dry and wet CuO(111) and Cu(110) with different orientations and surface alignments. There are large differencesof up to 1.3 eVin binding energies between these monomers and the surfaces. These differences depend on: the type of surface; if the surface is wet or dry; if the glucosidic O-atom points towards or away from the surfaces; and to a smaller extent on the surface alignment of the monomers. All monomers bind strongly to the surfaces via molecular adsorption that does not involve bond breaking in the monomers at this stage. 6VSB has the larger adsorption energiesthat reach 2.2 eVdue to its larger dipole moment. Both materials bind the monomers more strongly when their surfaces are dry. At Cu(110) the bonds are on average 1 eV stronger when the surface is dry when compared to wet. The difference between dry and wet CuO(111) is smaller, in the order of 0.2 eV. Overall, it is here shown that the stability of the monomers of the tip of the spike protein of the virus is very different at different surfaces.

There is a need to precisely estimate the specific risks for each age group to design health and education policies suitable for each population. Objective: This study aimed to describe the risk of death in SARS-COV2 infected subjects by age group and according to the presence of comorbidities. Methods: We analyzed data of confirmed SARS-COV2 infection cases where symptoms began between February 22th, 2020, and April 18th, 2021, as published by the General Epidemiology Direction (DGE) of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We calculated COVID-19 incidence and mortality by age group using population data from the Statistics and Population National Institute (INEGI), and estimated the association between risk of death and the presence of comorbidities. Results: Mortality in SARS-COV2 infected people varied considerably, between 7 and 155 deaths per million per year in the under-20 age groups compared to 441 to 15,929 in the older age groups. Mortality in pediatric populations is strongly associated with comorbidities (OR: 4.6-47.9) compared to the milder association for older age groups (OR: 3.16C1.23).

Obtaining an optimal projection that separates the outflow limb from the aneurysm is most critical. Each of the three techniques described enabled the distal access to giant intracranial aneurysms during treatment with flow diversion.

Unfortunately, the current monitoring gold standardbiopsy plus histopathologyhas several limitations. Plasma donor-derived cell-free DNA (-cfDNA) has emerged as a potentially valuable biomarker for rejection that addresses some of the limitations of biopsy. This review covers the current state of the evidence and future directions for the use of -cfDNA in the monitoring of acute rejection. RECENT FINDINGS: The results of several observational cohort studies demonstrate that levels of -cfDNA increase in the setting of acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection in both heart and lung transplant recipients. -cfDNA demonstrates acceptable performance characteristics, but low specificity for the detection of underlying injury from rejection or infection. In particular, the high negative predictive value of the test in both heart and lung transplant patients provides the potential for its use as a screening tool for the monitoring of allograft health rather than tissue biopsy alone. SUMMARY: Existing evidence shows that -cfDNA is a safe, convenient, and reliable method of acute rejection monitoring in heart and lung transplant recipients.

However, CPFs can be inefficient or difficult to apply with diffuse initial distributions, which are common in statistical applications. We propose a simple but generally applicable auxiliary variable method, which can be used together with the CPF in order to perform efficient inference with diffuse initial distributions. The method only requires simulatable Markov transitions that are reversible with respect to the initial distribution, which can be improper. We focus in particular on random-walk type transitions which are reversible with respect to a uniform initial distribution (on some domain), and autoregressive kernels for Gaussian initial distributions. We propose to use on-line adaptations within the methods. In the case of random-walk transition, our adaptations use the estimated covariance and acceptance rate adaptation, and we detail their theoretical validity. We tested our methods with a linear-Gaussian random-walk model, a stochastic volatility model, and a stochastic epidemic compartment model with time-varying transmission rate. The experimental findings demonstrate that our method works reliably with little user specification, and can be substantially better mixing than a direct particle Gibbs algorithm that treats initial states as parameters.","output":"Conditional particle filters with diffuse initial distributions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What determined how governments in the Middle East and North Africa reacted to the global covid-19 pandemic?

Training data is in particular scarce for segmenting infection regions of CT images of COVID-19 patients. Attention models help gather contextual information within deep networks and benefit semantic segmentation tasks. The recent criss-cross-attention module aims to approximate global self-attention while remaining memory and time efficient by separating horizontal and vertical self-similarity computations. However, capturing attention from all non-local locations can adversely impact the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new Dynamic Deformable Attention Network (DDANet) that enables a more accurate contextual information computation in a similarly efficient way. Our novel technique is based on a deformable criss-cross attention block that learns both attention coefficients and attention offsets in a continuous way. A deep U-Net (Schlemper et al., 2019) segmentation network that employs this attention mechanism is able to capture attention from pertinent non-local locations and also improves the performance on semantic segmentation tasks compared to criss-cross attention within a U-Net on a challenging COVID-19 lesion segmentation task. Our validation experiments show that the performance gain of the recursively applied dynamic deformable attention blocks comes from their ability to capture dynamic and precise attention context. Our DDANet achieves Dice scores of 73.4% and 61.3% for Ground-glass opacity and consolidation lesions for COVID-19 segmentation and improves the accuracy by 4.9% points compared to a baseline U-Net and 24.4% points compared to current state of art methods (Fan et al., 2020).","output":"Dynamic deformable attention network (DDANet) for COVID-19 lesions semantic segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Come on baby light my fire Non-adherence to treatment is a common cause of tension between patients and their clinical care teams and cystic fibrosis (with patients commonly spending around 2 hours per day on treatment) is a good example of this.

However, cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases, encompassing a spectrum of tumour subtypes. The aim of this study was to investigate COVID-19 risk according to tumour subtype and patient demographics in patients with cancer in the UK. METHODS: We compared adult patients with cancer enrolled in the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP) cohort between March 18 and May 8, 2020, with a parallel non-COVID-19 UK cancer control population from the UK Office for National Statistics (2017 data). The primary outcome of the study was the effect of primary tumour subtype, age, and sex and on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence and the caseCfatality rate during hospital admission. We analysed the effect of tumour subtype and patient demographics (age and sex) on prevalence and mortality from COVID-19 using univariable and multivariable models. FINDINGS: 319 (306%) of 1044 patients in the UKCCMP cohort died, 295 (925%) of whom had a cause of death recorded as due to COVID-19. The all-cause caseCfatality rate in patients with cancer after SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with increasing age, rising from 010 in patients aged 40C49 years to 048 in those aged 80 years and older. Patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemia, lymphoma, and myeloma) had a more severe COVID-19 trajectory compared with patients with solid organ tumours (odds ratio [OR] 157, 95% CI 115C215; p<00043). Compared with the rest of the UKCCMP cohort, patients with leukaemia showed a significantly increased caseCfatality rate (225, 113C457; p=0023). After correction for age and sex, patients with haematological malignancies who had recent chemotherapy had an increased risk of death during COVID-19-associated hospital admission (OR 209, 95% CI 109C408; p=0028). INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer with different tumour types have differing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 phenotypes.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with nAMD treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University whose treatment schedule was interrupted at least once between 1 February and 31 May 2020. The demographic and clinical characteristics, including the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) features, subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), interval between the last injection and the beginning of the pandemic, and the number of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 209 stable patients with nAMD (122 eyes received the T&E regimen; 87 eyes received the PRN regimen) were identified. Compared to those who received the PRN regimen, the patients who received the T&E regimen were more stable during the first visit after COVID-19 (53.3% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.004), the BCVA was significantly better (58.5 letters vs. 56 letters, P = 0.006), and the CRT fluctuated only slightly (15 m vs. 35 m, P = 0.001). Furthermore, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that stable patients with nAMD with type 1 choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (OR 2.493 [95% CI 1.179C5.272], compared with type 2 CNV; P = 0.017; OR 2.912 [95% CI 1.133C7.485], compared with retinal angiomatous proliferation; P = 0.026) or with pigment epithelial detachment (PED) were more likely to remain stable when treatment was interrupted (OR 0.392 [95% CI 0.181C0.852], compared with no PED; P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Compared to patients who received the PRN treatment regimen, stable patients with nAMD who received the T&E treatment regimen could better maintain stability when the treatments were suddenly interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the number of people infected with SARS-CoV2 escalates, the problem of surgical management of patients requiring urgent surgery is increasing. Patients infected with SARS-CoV2 virus but with negative test results will appear in general hospitals and may pose a risk to other patients and hospital staff. Health care workers constitutes nearly 17% of infected population in Poland, therefore early identification of infected people becomes a priority to protect human resources and to ensure continuity of the access to a surgical care. Both surgical operations, and endoscopic procedures are considered as interventions with an increased risk of infection. Therefore, determining the algorithm becomes crucial for qualifying patients for surgical treatment, but also to stratify the risk of personnel being infected during surgery and to adequately protect staff. Each hospital should be logistically prepared for the need to perform urgent surgery on a patient with suspected or confirmed infection, including personal protective equipment. Limited availability of the equipment, working under pressure and staff shortages in addition to a highly contagious pathogen necessitate a pragmatic management of human resources in health care. Instant synchronized action is needed, and clear uniform guidelines are essential for the healthcare system to provide citizens with the necessary surgical care while protecting both patients, and staff.

DESIGN: Mixed-methods. SETTING: Individual interviews in March-April 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Black adults (20-79 years) who attended a church in Boston, MA and identified as \\"vaccine hesitant\\" (n = 18). METHODS: Individual in-depth Zoom interviews to elicit participant views on vaccines in general, specific reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and trusted sources of information. Participants were also asked about possible motivators that could increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Transcripts were de-identified and analyzed for major themes using an inductive approach. RESULTS: Analysis included 18 complete interviews. Lack of trust in the government, healthcare, or pharmaceutical companies (n = 18), rushed development (n = 14), fear of side effects (n = 12), history of medical mistreatment (n = 12), and a perception of low risk of disease (n = 9) were the top-cited reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Motivators likely to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake included more data (n = 17), friends and family getting vaccinated (not celebrities) (n = 11), and increased opportunities that come along with being vaccinated (n = 8). CONCLUSION: There were many reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, as reported by participants who were all Black Americans in the Boston area. The public health challenge of increasing vaccine uptake in the Black community is nuanced and intervention efforts may be more successful if delivered by trusted members of the community and tailored to the needs of individuals.","output":"Exploring COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Amongst Black Americans: Contributing Factors and Motivators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jet fans are increasingly preferred over traditional ducted systems as a means of ventilating pollutants in large environments such as underground car parks The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-which causes the novel coronavirus disease-through the jet fans in underground car parks has been considered a matter of key concern A quantitative understanding of the propagation of respiratory droplets/particles/aerosols containing the virus is important However, to date, studies have yet to demonstrate viral (e g , SARS-CoV-2) transmission in underground car parks equipped with jet fans In this paper, numerical simulation has been performed to assess the effects of jet fans on the spreading of viruses inside underground car parks ? 2021 Author(s)","output":"Jet fans in the underground car parking areas and virus transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews the individual spend plans of U.S. states granted a funding allocation under Sec. 12005 of the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to identify consistency with legislative mandates to support Tribal commercial, subsistence, cultural, or ceremonial fisheries negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This pathogen has spread rapidly across the world, causing high numbers of deaths and significant social and economic impacts. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with a suggested zoonotic origin with the potential for cross-species transmission among animals. Antarctica can be considered the only continent free of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, concerns have been expressed regarding the potential human introduction of this virus to the continent through the activities of research or tourism to minimise the effects on human health, and the potential for virus transmission to Antarctic wildlife. We assess the reverse-zoonotic transmission risk to Antarctic wildlife by considering the available information on host susceptibility, dynamics of the infection in humans, and contact interactions between humans and Antarctic wildlife. The environmental conditions in Antarctica seem to be favourable for the virus stability. Indoor spaces such as those at research stations, research vessels or tourist cruise ships could allow for more transmission among humans and depending on their movements between different locations the virus could be spread across the continent. Among Antarctic wildlife previous in silico analyses suggested that cetaceans are at greater risk of infection whereas seals and birds appear to be at a low infection risk. However, caution needed until further research is carried out and consequently, the precautionary principle should be applied. Field researchers handling animals are identified as the human group posing the highest risk of transmission to animals while tourists and other personnel pose a significant risk only when in close proximity (< 5 m) to Antarctic fauna.

We aimed to perform the first network meta-analysis comparing and ranking different liver support systems and standard medical therapy (SMT) in patients with ACLF. METHODS: The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020155850). A systematic search was conducted in five databases. We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of artificial or bioartificial liver support systems on survival in patients with ACLF. Ranking was performed by calculating the surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve values. The RoB2 tool and a modified GRADE approach were used for the assessment of the risk of bias and quality of evidence (QE). RESULTS: In the quantitative synthesis 16 trials were included, using MARS?, Prometheus?, ELAD?, plasma exchange (PE) and BioLogic-DT?. Overall (OS) and transplant-free (TFS) survival were assessed at 1 and 3 months. PE significantly improved 3-month OS compared to SMT (RR 0.74, CrI: 0.6C0.94) and ranked first on the cumulative ranking curves for both OS outcomes (SUCRA: 86% at 3 months; 77% at 1 month) and 3-month TFS (SUCRA: 87%) and second after ELAD for 1-month TFS (SUCRA: 76%). Other comparisons did not reach statistical significance. QE was moderate for PE concerning 1-month OS and both TFS outcomes. Other results were of very low certainty. CONCLUSION: PE seems to be the best currently available liver support therapy in ACLF regarding 3-month OS. Based on the low QE, randomized trials are needed to confirm our findings for already existing options and to introduce new devices.","output":"Uncertainty in the impact of liver support systems in acute-on-chronic liver failure: a systematic review and network meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has emerged worldwide as an indispensable resource to improve the surveillance of patients, curb the spread of disease, facilitate timely identification and management of ill people, but, most importantly, guarantee the continuity of care of frail patients with multiple chronic diseases.

Analysis of these mutations is necessary for gaining knowledge regarding different aspects of therapeutic development. Previously, we have reported a Sanger method-based genome sequence of a viral isolate named SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1, circulating in Bangladesh. The genome has four novel non-synonymous mutations in V121D, V843F, A889V, and G1691C positions. RESULTS: Using different computational tools, we have found V121D substitution has the potential to destabilize the non-structural protein-1 (NSP-1). NSP-1 inactivates the type-1 interferon-induced antiviral system. Hence, this mutant could be a basis of attenuated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. V843F, A889V, and G1691C are all located in nonstructural protein-3 (NSP-3). G1691C can decrease the flexibility of the protein. V843F and A889V might change the binding pattern and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLPro) inhibitor GRL0617. V843F substitution in PLPro was the most prevalent mutation in the clinical samples. This mutation showed a reduced affinity for interferon-stimulated gene-15 protein (ISG-15) and might have an impact on innate immunity and viral spread. However, V843F+A889V double mutant exhibited the same binding affinity as wild type PLPro. A possible reason behind this phenomenon can be that V843F is a conserved residue of PLPro which damaged the protease structure, but A889V, a less conserved residue, presumably neutralized that damage. CONCLUSIONS: Mutants of NSP-1 could provide attenuated vaccines against coronavirus. Also, these mutations of PLPro might be targeted to develop better anti-SARS therapeutics. We hope our study will help to get better insides during the development of attenuated vaccine and PLPro inhibitors.

This study described the development of the Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation (FIVE) scales and validated the caregiver-report version. METHOD: After initial development, feedback was obtained from clinicians and researchers, who provided suggestions on item content/wording, reviewed edits, and provided support for the updated FIVEs content and face validity. Factor structure, measurement invariance, and psychometric properties were analyzed using data from a multi-site, longitudinal study of COVID-19-related effects on family functioning with 1,599 caregivers from the United States and Canada. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses indicated a hierarchical five-factor structure best fit the data, resulting in a 31-item measure with four lower-order subscales: (1) Fears about Contamination and Illness; (2) Fears about Social Distancing, (3) Avoidance Behaviors, and (4) Mitigation Behaviors, and a higher-order factor, (5) Total Fears, indicated by the two fear-related lower-order subscales. Measurement invariance by country of residence, child age, and child sex was found. All subscales demonstrated strong internal consistency, appropriate item-scale discrimination, and no floor or ceiling effects. The Total Fears subscale demonstrated appropriate test-retest reliability. Concurrent validity supported by strong correlation with a youth anxiety measure.

Efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines have focused on strategies to elicit such antibodies; however, the concern has been raised that previous influenza immunity may abrogate the induction of such broadly protective antibodies. We show here that prime-boost immunization can induce broadly neutralizing antibody responses in influenza-immune mice and ferrets that were previously infected or vaccinated. HA stem-directed antibodies were elicited in mice primed with a DNA vaccine and boosted with inactivated vaccine from H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (1999 NC) HA regardless of preexposure. Similarly, gene-based vaccination with replication-defective adenovirus 28 (rAd28) and 5 (rAd5) vectors encoding 1999 NC HA elicited stem-directed neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against unmatched 1934 and 2007 H1N1 virus challenge in influenza-immune ferrets. Indeed, previous exposure to certain strains could enhance immunogenicity: The strongest HA stem-directed immune response was observed in ferrets previously infected with a divergent 1934 H1N1 virus. These findings suggest that broadly neutralizing antibodies against the conserved stem region of HA can be elicited through vaccination despite previous influenza exposure, which supports the feasibility of developing stem-directed universal influenza vaccines for humans.","output":"Elicitation of broadly neutralizing influenza antibodies in animals with previous influenza exposure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Specialized multidisciplinary ALS care has been shown to extend survival and improve patient's and caregiver's quality of life.

Methods: A cross-sectional on-line survey was distributed to employees of a major health care institution located in S?o Paulo, Brazil between April 3 and April 10, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The sample comprised 2,646 respondents. Most participants (44.4%) reported excessive or almost excessive access to information about the novel coronavirus and 67.6% reported having increased their average time spent on social media. When asked how frequently they consider it was easy to determine the reliability of information, \\"sometimes\\" corresponded to 43.2% of the answers in contrast to 14.6% responding \\"always\\". Answers related to potential signs of information overload associated with the pandemic indicated that 31% of respondents felt stressed by the amount of information they had to keep up with almost every day or always. Overall, 80.0% of respondents reported having experienced at least one of the following symptoms: headache, eye twitching, restlessness or sleeping difficulty. The frequency of symptoms was higher among participants with a more negative information processing style regarding when dealing with large volumes of information relative to those with a positive information processing style. Likewise, symptoms were more frequently reported by participants who had increased their social media access relative to those reporting reduced access during the pandemic. Conclusion: Our survey provides a description of how health professionals consume COVID-19 related information during the pandemic, and suggests that excessive information exposure and high processing demands may impose psychological distress and affect mental health.","output":"COVID-19 information exposure in digital media and implications for employees in the health care sector: findings from an online survey/ Exposio s informaes sobre COVID-19 em mdias digitais e suas implicaes para funcionrios do setor de sade: resultados de uma pesquisa on-line"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UK government wants people to lose weight to reduce their risk of severe covid-19, but slimming down is no simple task, reports Clare Wilson","output":"Get fit to stay healthy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anthropogenic food sources, such as litter, are readily available to birds in urban areas.

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of ED healthcare workers (HCW) (subjects) required to use respirators at an academic, Level I trauma center. Subjects had been previously fit tested and assigned an appropriately sized N95 mask per hospital protocol. Per study protocol, subjects were fit tested periodically throughout their shifts and on multiple shifts over the eight-week study period. Data points collected included the age of the mask, subjective assessment of mask seal quality, and fit test results. We analyzed the data using Fishers exact test, and calculated odds ratios (OR) to determine the failure rate of disposable N95 masks following reuse. RESULTS: A total of 130 HCWs underwent fit testing and 127 were included for analysis. Mask failure rate climbed after day 2 of use, with 33.3% of masks failing at day 3, 42.9% at day 4, and 50% at  day 5. Categorizing the masks into those being used for two or fewer days vs those in use for three or more, failure was more common on day 3 of use or older compared to those in the first two days of use (41.8% vs 8.3%, P < 0.0001) with an OR of failure with an older mask of 7.9 (confidence interval [CI], 2.8C22.3). The healthcare workers assessment of poor seal was 33.3% sensitive (CI, 18.6C51.9) and 95.7% specific (CI, 88.8C98.6) for fit test failure.

Therefore, fast and accurate diagnosis of infection is key to timely treatment and elimination of the spread of the virus. Currently, the standard method for detecting coronavirus is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this method requires expensive equipment and trained personnel, which limits the conduct of mass testing and lengthens the time to obtain a research result. Serological tests for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the determination of protective immunity in various populations are used to retrospectively identify patients with asymptomatic and mild forms of infection, monitor the course of infection in hospitalized patients, and also track contacts and epidemiological surveillance. The use of standard methods for diagnosing COVID-19 in conditions of mass morbidity, especially in conditions of insufficient resources and lack of appropriate infrastructure, is associated with a number of limitations. Therefore, the search and development of new, fast, inexpensive, simple, device-free and no less sensitive and specific tests is an urgent task.

However, an obvious increase in ozone (O3) concentrations was found during the lockdown period in most urban areas of China. In this study, we conducted field measurements targeting ozone and its key precursors by utilizing a novel proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) in Changzhou, which is representative of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) city cluster of China. We further applied the integrated methodology including machine learning, an observation-based model (OBM) and sensitivity analysis to obtain insights into the reasons causing the obvious increase in ozone. Major findings include the following: (1) by deweathered calculation, we found changes in precursor emissions contributed 1.46 ppbv to the increase in the observed O3 during the full-lockdown period in 2020, while meteorology constrained 3.0 ppbv of O3 in the full-lockdown period of 2019. (2) By using an OBM, we found that although a significant reduction in O3 precursors was observed during the full-lockdown period, the photochemical formation of O3 was stronger than that during the pre-lockdown period. (3) The NOx/VOC ratio dropped dramatically from 1.84 during the pre-lockdown to 0.79 in the full-lockdown period, which switched O3 formation from a VOC-limited regime to the boundary of a NOx- and VOC-limited regime. Additionally, box model results suggested that the decrease in the NOx/VOC ratio during the full-lockdown period could increase the mean O3 by 2.4 ppbv. Results of this study give insights into the relationship between O3 and its precursors in urban area and demonstrate reasons for the obvious increase in O3 in most urban areas of China during the COVID-19 lockdown period.

The virus is spread via the fecal-oral route, most commonly from infected food and water, but several outbreaks have originated from contamination of surfaces with infectious virus. In this study, a close surrogate of human norovirus causing gastrointestinal disease in mice, murine norovirus type 1 (MNV-1), retained infectivity for more than 2 weeks following contact with a range of surface materials, including Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. Persistence was slightly prolonged on ceramic surfaces. A previous study in our laboratory observed that dry copper and copper alloy surfaces rapidly inactivated MNV-1 and destroyed the viral genome. In this new study, we have observed that a relatively small change in the percentage of copper, between 70 and 80% in copper nickels and 60 and 70% in brasses, had a significant influence on the ability of the alloy to inactivate norovirus. Nickel alone did not affect virus, but zinc did have some antiviral effect, which was synergistic with copper and resulted in an increased efficacy of brasses with lower percentages of copper. Electron microscopy of purified MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and stainless steel surfaces suggested that a massive breakdown of the viral capsid had occurred on copper. In addition, MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and treated with RNase demonstrated a reduction in viral gene copy number.

The collapse of the health system in many countries has demonstrated the need of developing tools to automatize the diagnosis of the disease from medical imaging. Previous studies have used deep learning for this purpose. However, the performance of this alternative highly depends on the size of the dataset employed for training the algorithm. In this work, we propose a classification framework based on sparse coding in order to identify the pneumonia patterns associated with different pathologies. Specifically, each chest X-ray (CXR) image is partitioned into different tiles. The most relevant features extracted from PCA are then used to build the dictionary within the sparse coding procedure. Once images are transformed and reconstructed from the elements of the dictionary, classification is performed from the reconstruction errors of individual patches associated with each image. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously differentiation between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19. The accuracy when identifying the presence of pneumonia is 93.85%, whereas 88.11% is obtained in the 4-class classification context.

In this work, we use additional concepts and insights from traditional teletraffic theory, including resource sharing, trunk reservation, and mutual overflow, to design a new patient referral policy to further improve ICU network efficiency. Numerical results based on the analytical model demonstrate that our proposed policy can achieve a higher acceptance level than the original policy with a smaller number of beds, resulting in improved service for all patients.

A striking observation is that the type of infection (acute or chronic) is invariably considered to be a constraint that model assumptions have to satisfy rather than as a potential outcome of the interaction of the parasite with its host's immune system. We argue that avoiding making assumptions about the type of infection will lead to a better understanding of infectious diseases, even though a number of fundamental and technical problems remain. Dynamical modeling of the immune system opens a wide range of perspectives: for understanding how the immune system eradicates a parasite (which it does for most pathogens but not for all, HIV being a notorious example of a virus that is not completely eliminated), for studying multiple infections through concomitant immunity, for understanding the emergence and evolution of the immune system in animals, and for evolutionary epidemiology in general (e.g., predicting evolutionary consequences of new therapies and public health policies).

This paper aims to identify how teleworking, through its dimensions (teleworking autonomy and interaction reduction) influences self-regulatory capacity, professional isolation, task performance, contextual performance, and counterproductive work behaviours. The data were collected from 641 respondents, namely Romanian employees, who operated by teleworking. The theoretical model and relation between the constructs were tested with the aid of structural equation modelling in SmartPLS. The interaction reduction in the context of teleworking significantly, positively, and strongly influences professional isolation, and to a lesser extent, but significantly nonetheless, counterproductive work behaviour and employee self-regulatory capacity. The research originality lies in expanding the theoretical contributions regarding teleworking theory by proposing a new teleworking scale based on teleworking autonomy and interaction reduction. It also contributes to the development of Self-regulatory Theory and Social Exchange Theory. From a managerial perspective, it highlights the importance of the dimensions of teleworking for the employer, as well as the effects of teleworking on task performance and contextual performance in the COVID-19 pandemic, offering helpful solutions to employers in the identification of viable solutions for the improvement of employee outcomes, and for the reduction of counterproductive work behaviour. ? 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

Conventionally, vaccines are applied parenterally to induce serotype-dependent humoral response but fail to drive adequate mucosal immune protection for viral infections such as influenza, HIV, and coronaviruses. Oral mucosa, however, provides a vast immune repertoire against specific microbial pathogens and yet is shaped by an ever-present microbiome community that has co-evolved with the host over thousands of years. Adjuvants targeting mucosal T-cells abundant in oral tissues can promote soluble-IgA (sIgA)-specific protection to confer increased vaccine efficacy. Th17 cells, for example, are at the center of cell-mediated immunity and evidence demonstrates that protection against heterologous pathogen serotypes is achieved with components from the oral microbiome. At the point of entry where pathogens are first encountered, typically the oral or nasal cavity, the mucosal surfaces are layered with bacterial cohabitants that continually shape the host immune profile. Constituents of the oral microbiome including their lipids, outer membrane vesicles, and specific proteins, have been found to modulate the Th17 response in the oral mucosa, playing important roles in vaccine and adjuvant designs. Currently, there are no approved adjuvants for the induction of Th17 protection, and it is critical that this research is included in the preparedness for the current and future pandemics. Here, we discuss the potential of oral commensals, and molecules derived thereof, to induce Th17 activity and provide safer and more predictable options in adjuvant engineering to prevent emerging infectious diseases.","output":"Is the oral microbiome a source to enhance mucosal immunity against infectious diseases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relaxed clock models enable estimation of molecular substitution rates across lineages and are widely used in phylogenetics for dating evolutionary divergence times. Under the (uncorrelated) relaxed clock model, tree branches are associated with molecular substitution rates which are independently and identically distributed. In this article we delved into the internal complexities of the relaxed clock model in order to develop efficient MCMC operators for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We compared three substitution rate parameterisations, introduced an adaptive operator which learns the weights of other operators during MCMC, and we explored how relaxed clock model estimation can benefit from two cutting-edge proposal kernels: the AVMVN and Bactrian kernels. This work has produced an operator scheme that is up to 65 times more efficient at exploring continuous relaxed clock parameters compared with previous setups, depending on the dataset. Finally, we explored variants of the standard narrow exchange operator which are specifically designed for the relaxed clock model. In the most extreme case, this new operator traversed tree space 40% more efficiently than narrow exchange. The methodologies introduced are adaptive and highly effective on short as well as long alignments.

The problem was modeled in terms of highly nonlinear coupled system of classical order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which was further generalized with the Atangana-Balaeanu (ABC) fractional derivative in Caputo sense with nonlocal kernel. Furthermore, some theoretical analyses have been done such as boundedness, positivity, existence and uniqueness of the considered. Disease-free and endemic equilibrium points were also assessed.

The reported cases were considered between 1(st) May 2021 and 31(st) July 2021 and on the basis of this data, the spread of infection is predicted for the next 200 days. The graphical solution of the considered nonlinear fractional model was obtained via numerical scheme by implementing the MATLAB software.

Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies.

While published research has shown clinical characteristics associated with severe illness from COVID-19, there is limited data focused on the emergency department (ED) discharge population. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all ED-discharged patients from Wake Forest Baptist Health and Wake Forest Baptist Health Davie Medical Center between April 25-August 9, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients who were discharged and had return visits within 30 days to those patients who did not return to the ED within 30 days. Results: Our study included 235 adult patients who had an ED-performed SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR positive test and were subsequently discharged on their first ED visit. Of these patients, 57 (24.3%) had return visits to the ED within 30 days for symptoms related to COVID-19. Of these 57 patients, on return ED visits 27 were admitted to the hospital and 30 were not admitted. Of the 235 adult patients who were discharged, 11.5% (27) eventually required admission for COVID-19-related symptoms. With 24.3% patients having a return ED visit after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and 11.5% requiring eventual admission, it is important to understand clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis of the clinical characteristics with independent association resulting in a return ED visit, which demonstrated the following: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.990, 95% confidence interval [CI, 1.21-7.40, P = 0.0179);transaminitis (OR 8.973, 95% CI, 2.65-30.33, P = 0.004);increased pulse at triage (OR 1.04, 95% CI, 1.02-1.07, P = 0.0002);and myalgia (OR 4.43, 95% CI, 2.03-9.66, P = 0.0002). Conclusion: As EDs across the country continue to treat COVID-19 patients, it is important to understand the clinical factors associated with ED return visits related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is limited data about patients with end-stage renal disease who also suffer from COVID-19. In this report, we discuss the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed COVID-19 pneumonia in the clinical course. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 79-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and was taking regular hemodialysis was admitted to hospital for a fever and dry cough. The patient, who also had cardiovascular disease, had no history of contact with COVID-2019 patients. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-2019 by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and his pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. INTERVENTION: The treatment was mainly supportive and the patient was intensively monitored. He was treated with oxygen, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and methylprednisolone. The patient took continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) every 2 days. OUTCOMES: After 19 days, an RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, and computed tomography (CT) of the patient's thorax indicated that the pulmonary inflammatory exudation was absorbed and pulmonary infection improved significantly. He was discharged on day 29 after recovering from COVID-2019 pneumonia. LESSONS: The courses of disease and treatment options for this individual were significantly more complicated than those for ordinary patients. Therefore, it was necessary to monitor the condition of the patient closely and to protect the dialysis unit staff from being infected. Compared with other severe COVID-2019 cases, this patient recovered more quickly following treatment, which was likely due to the removal of inflammatory mediators by CRRT. This implies that blood purification might be an important option for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in a hemodialysis patient: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world went suddenly into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sending individuals to their homes and shutting businesses and institutions, the closing of schools posed big problems. The majority of the worlds children were out of school, leading to the longest sustained period of school closures in history. We saw educators turning towards responses not aimed at collegial and community-engaged strategies for education in an emergency but at online learning cast as education/business as usual. This study explores the logic driving this global response through analyses of the documents released by three key global education actors: (1) the OECD and its paper A Framework to Guide Education Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020; (2) UNESCOs Global Education Coalition #LearningNeverStops; and (3) the World Banks Guidance Note on Education Systems Response to COVID-19; and Guidance Note: Remote Learning and COVID-19.

This article explores the World Bank, OECD and UNESCO responses using an analysis of knowledge harmonisation and difference among these institutions as well as their location as key norm-setters and governing actors in the field of education. The authors argue that all three responses privilege private-sector providers of digital technology. The consequence of these responses is that technologies of saving have centred on privatised, corporate edu-business and edu-tech aimed at online education delivery, bringing significant risks for the erasure of local knowledges.

METHODS: Subjects were recruited to participate in an internet-based survey. Data were collected from November 2020 to January 2021 using convenience sampling by a semi-structured questionnaire through online platforms. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine associations applying Bonferroni correction (p < 0.004). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) measured depression and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: Nine-hundred-and-seventy-one participants (50.1% male; mean age = 42.29  15.86 years; age range = 18-80 years) with medical conditions were included in final analyses. The most frequently reported conditions were diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, asthma, and anemia. Estimates of moderate to severe depression and anxiety were 38.9% and 35.2%, respectively. The mean depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher among participants who reported having hypertension, obesity, heart disease, asthma, anemia, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using Bonferroni correction (p < 0.004), depression was associated with being female and a student, having poorer quality of life, poorer health status and greater numbers of co-morbidities, not engaging in physical exercise and tobacco smoking. Anxiety was associated with being female and a student, having lower socioeconomic status, poorer quality of life, poorer health status and greater numbers of co-morbidities, less sleep and tobacco smoking.

The objective of this study was to determine whether recalled changes in sleep traits (e.g., sleep quality, refreshing sleep, sleep problems, and difficulty falling asleep) because of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with life space mobility in older adults. METHODS Data were obtained from a University of Florida-administered study conducted in May and June of 2020 (n=923). Linear regression models were used to assess the impact of COVID-related change in sleep traits summary scores from the Life Space Assessment. Analyses were adjusted for demographic, mental, and physical health characteristics, COVID-related avoidant behaviors, and pre-COVID sleep ratings. RESULTS In unadjusted models, reporting that any sleep trait got \\"a lot worse\\" or \\"a little worse\\" was associated with a decrease in life space mobility (all p<0.05). Results were attenuated when accounting for demographic, mental, and physical health characteristics.

Patients with hypertension appear to have a poor prognosis, but there is no direct evidence that hypertension increases the risk of new infection or adverse outcomes independent of age and other risk factors. There is also concern about use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors due to a key role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. However, there is little evidence that use of RAS inhibitors increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection or worsens the course of COVID-19. Therefore, antihypertensive therapy with these agents should be continued. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, patients with severe COVID-19 can develop myocardial injury and cytokine storm, resulting in heart failure, arteriovenous thrombosis, and kidney injury. Troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, and serum creatinine are biomarkers for these complications and can be used to monitor patients with COVID-19 and for risk stratification. Other factors that need to be incorporated into patient management strategies during the pandemic include regular exercise to maintain good health status and monitoring of psychological well-being. For the ongoing management of patients with hypertension, telemedicine-based home blood pressure monitoring strategies can facilitate maintenance of good blood pressure control while social distancing is maintained. Overall, multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 based on a rapidly growing body of evidence will help ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, including those with risk factors such as hypertension.","output":"COVID-19 and hypertension-evidence and practical management: Guidance from the HOPE Asia Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) have some of the highest rates of mortality from COVID-19 among healthcare workers. SARS-CoV-2 has unique properties that place GPs at particular risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to discuss the nose-related features of SARS-CoV-2 that place GPs at risk, and to make recommendations pertinent to the safety and protection of primary healthcare physicians. DISCUSSION: The highest viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is in the nose and nasopharynx. It is often highest early in the illness, before the development of symptoms. Further, SARS-CoV-2 replicates and continues to shed in the nasopharynx long after the virus is no longer detectable in the lower respiratory tract. This places any physician performing examinations on, or procedures involving, the upper respiratory tract at risk for contracting COVID-19.

The influences of curing conditions and isobornyl acrylate (IBOA) content on PSA performance were comprehensively investigated by measurement of their rheological, thermal, and adhesive properties. In particular, rheological characterization was accomplished by several analytical methods, such as in situ UV rheology, frequency sweep, stress relaxation, and temperature ramp tests, to understand the effect of the UV curing process and IBOA content on the viscoelastic behavior of acrylic PSAs. The slow-cured samples were observed to form more tightly crosslinked networks compared to the fast-cured. On the other hand, at high loading levels of IBOA, in the case of slow curing, the sample exhibited a contrasting trend, having the shortest stress relaxation time and the highest energy dissipation; this was due to molecular chain scission occurring in the crosslinked polymer during UV polymerization. Consequently, we successfully demonstrated the influence of monomer composition of acrylic PSAs, and that of curing conditions employed in UV polymerization. This study provides valuable insights for the development of crosslinked polymer networks of acrylic PSAs for flexible display applications.

The first NWS COVID-19 case was declared 9 July 2020, but impact estimations in this region are minimal. With the rollout of vaccination and emergence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, we aimed to estimate COVID-19 trajectory in NWS and potential effects of vaccine coverage and hospital occupancy. Methods We conducted a mixed-method study, primarily including modelling projections of COVID-19 transmission scenarios with vaccination strategies using an age-structured, compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, supported by data from 20 semi-structured interviews with frontline health-workers to help contextualise interpretation of modelling results. Results Modelling suggested that existing low stringency non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) minimally affected COVID-19 transmission. Maintaining existing NPIs after Delta variant introduction is predicted to result in a second COVID-19 wave overwhelming hospital capacity and resulting in a 4-fold increased death toll. Simulations with up to 60% vaccination coverage by June 2022 predict a second wave is not preventable with current NPIs. However, 60% vaccination coverage by June 2022 combined with 50% coverage of mask-wearing and handwashing should reduce the number of hospital beds and ventilators needed below current capacity levels. In the worst-case scenario of a more transmissible and lethal variant emerging by January 2022, a third wave is predicted. Conclusion Total COVID-19 attributable deaths are expected to remain relatively low, due largely to a young population. Given the negative socioeconomic consequences of restrictive NPIs, such as border or school-closures for an already deeply challenged population and their relative ineffectiveness in this context, policymakers and international partners should instead focus on increasing COVID-19 vaccination coverage as rapidly as possible and encouraging mask-wearing.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission in opposition-controlled Northwest Syria: modelling pandemic responses during political conflict"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims Here we present the case of a 47-year-old female with long COVID-19 syndrome presenting with four episodes of acute onset angioedema in the absence of urticaria or pruritis affecting the mucosal layer of the lips and tongue. Methods She had been taking lisinopril for the last 18 months. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in March 2020 presenting with fever, cough, shortness of breath and anosmia. She did not require hospital admission initially however has been readmitted twice with profound breathlessness and fever. She has subsequently developed a long COVID-19 syndrome with a daily, fluctuating fever of up to 39 C for the last six months, profound fatigue, persistent shortness of breath with bilateral ground glass changes seen on high resolution CT chest imaging and mild anaemia. During this time, she subsequently reported four episodes of acute onset of severe angioedema affecting the lips and tongue for which she self-medicated with anti-histamines. Results Following disclosure of these episodes her lisinopril was ceased and there have been no further episodes to date. There are two other case reports in the literature that propose a potential relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor induced angioedema and COVID-19. It is known that SAR-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors which are found in oral tissues, heart, kidneys and the lung. ACE inhibitors can be associated with angioedema in approximately 0.5% of patients prescribed an ACE inhibitor. It occurs most commonly in the first year following instigation of treatment but can occur years later. The proposed mechanism of action is via the degradation of bradykinin. Bradykinin is converted from Kallikrenin by C1 esterase, and ACE in turn metabolises bradykinin. Conclusion Bradykinin affects vascular permeability and results in vasodilatation, when patients take an ACE inhibitor there is a slower rate of bradykinin degradation and therefore this accumulation results in ACE inhibitor induced angioedema. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptors. ACE2 is thought to counterbalance ACE in the renin-angiotensin system, it is theorised that the potential downregulation of ACE2 by the presence of bound SARS-CoV-2 may therefore potentiate angioedema in susceptible individuals. At present we cannot confirm this proposed relationship and global current consensus supports the ongoing use of ACE inhibitors during the pandemic but clinicians should continue to be aware of emergent pathologies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, neither the regulatory mechanism controlling chlorogenic acids biosynthesis in L. macranthoides nor the molecular basis of effect of corolla dehiscence on the quality of medicinal materials is fully understood. In this study, metabolomics and transcriptomics were used to analyze the metabolic and transcriptional differences of two different cultivars closed bud type (Bt), and flowering type (Ft), as well as the effect of jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) on chlorogenic acids (CGAs) biosynthesis. In total, large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were filtered among three lines of samples. Gene metabolite correlation analyses revealed a core set of 30 genes and 54 genes that were strongly correlated with CGAs biosynthesis and regulating the flowering, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results proved the alterations in the expression levels of genes encoding the pathways involved in CGAs biosynthesis. The ion abundances of CGAs were most significantly increased, while some of the CGAs derived and Caffeoyl-CoA-derived substances showed the most largely reduced abundances in the closed bud type (Bt) compared to the flowering type (Ft). MeJA may leads to the activation of downstream genes in CGAs biosynthesis pathway. Overall, there were significant differences in the transcriptional and metabolic levels of CGAs biosynthesis pathway in flower buds of different flowering cultivars. The redirection of metabolic flux may contribute to increased accumulation of CGAs. However, whether MeJA and flowering have direct effects on the accumulation of CGAs needs further studied.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) POC test in a clinical setting and examine the prognostic value of cycle threshold (CT) on admission on the length of hospital stay (LOS) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients hospitalised between January and May 2021 were included in this prospective cohort study. Patients nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with Allplex?2019-nCoV (Seegene Inc.) real-time (RT) PCR assay as gold standard as well as a novel POC test (Bosch Vivalytic SARS-CoV-2 [Bosch]) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche) accordingly. Clinical sensitivity and specificity as well as inter- and intra-assay variability were analyzed. RESULTS: 120 patients met the inclusion criteria with 46 (38%) having a definite COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR. Bosch Vivalytic SARS-CoV-2 POC had a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 96%. The inter- and intra- assay variability was below 15%. The CT value at baseline was lower in patients with LOS  10 days when compared to patients with LOS < 10 days (27.82 ( 4.648) vs. 36.2 (25.9C39.18); p = 0.0191).

METHODS: We searched for original studies published between December 2019 and Jan 2021 in PubMed, Scopus and Medline databases using a specific search strategy. We also explored literature on websites of distinguished public health organisations and hand-searched reference lists of eligible studies. The studies were screened by two reviewers according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flowchart using pre-determined eligibility criteria. Data were synthesised, analysed descriptively and reported in line with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: In total, 1276 studies were identified through the search strategy. Of these, 77 studies were selected for full-text reading after screening the studies. After reading full-text, 12 eligible studies were included in this review. The majority of the studies used a generic HRQoL assessment tool; five studies used SF-36, five studies used EQ-5D-5L, and three used pulmonary disease-specific HRQoL tools (two studies used two tools each). The impact of Covid-19 on HRQoL was found to be considerable in both Acute Covid and Long Covid patients. Higher impact on HRQoL was reported in Acute Covid, females, older ages, patients with more severe disease and patients from low-income countries.

Despite numerous advantages, the dissimilarity of the mechanical properties between bone and implant has led to issues in periprosthetic bone adaptation. This study aims to address these issues by proposing fixations made of functionally graded materials (FGMs). The computational study of bone remodeling was performed by linking a bone remodeling algorithm to the finite element analysis. The 3D model of the femur was created by computerized tomography (CT) scan images, and a Titanium fixture, along with nine Titanium/Hydroxyapatite FGM fixtures, were modeled. The analyses revealed evident advantages for the FGM fixtures over the conventionally used Titanium fixtures. Furthermore, it was shown that the gradation direction considerably affects the bone adaptation procedure. The results showed that using a radial FGM with low-stiffness material in the outer layer and less metal composition significantly improves the bone remodeling behavior.","output":"The effect of functionally graded materials on bone remodeling around osseointegrated trans-femoral prostheses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 pandemic has unleashed unprecedented shocks across all aspects of society.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Pubmed, Embase, and the WHO Global Research Database from December 1,2019 to May 1, 2020 for relevant articles. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each of 27 laboratory markers. The impact of age and sex on WMDs was estimated using meta-regression techniques for 11 markers. RESULTS: In total, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria. The most marked WMDs were for neutrophils (ANC) at 3.82  109 /L (2.76, 4.87), lymphocytes (ALC) at -0.34  109 /L (-0.45, -0.23), interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 32.59 pg/mL (23.99, 41.19), ferritin at 814.14 ng/mL (551.48, 1076.81), C-reactive protein (CRP) at 66.11 mg/L (52.16, 80.06), D-dimer at 5.74 mg/L (3.91, 7.58), LDH at 232.41 U/L (178.31, 286.52), and high sensitivity troponin I at 90.47 pg/mL (47.79, 133.14) when comparing fatal to nonfatal cases. Similar trends were observed comparing severe to non-severe groups. There were no statistically significant associations between age or sex and WMD for any of the markers included in the meta-regression. CONCLUSION: The results highlight that hyper inflammation, blunted adaptive immune response, and intravascular coagulation play key roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Markers of these processes are good candidates to identify patients for early intervention and, importantly, are likely reliable regardless of age or sex in adult patients.","output":"Association between markers of immune response at hospital admission and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality: A meta-analysis and meta-regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores the development potential of the rubber industry in Malaysia and Thailand, which have been leaders in the production of natural rubber (NR) since the 20th century.

Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which appears to expand viral tropism to cells with suitable protease and receptor expression. Here, we utilize viral pseudoparticles and protease inhibitors to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 cleavage is essential for early pathway entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for late pathway entry into Vero E6 cells, a model cell line. The S1/S2 cleavage was found to be processed by other proteases beyond furin.

We hypothesized that RYGBP provides superior results. DESIGN Matched-pair study in patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 50. SETTING University hospital and regional community hospital with a common bariatric surgeon. PATIENTS Four hundred forty-two patients were matched according to sex, age, and BMI. INTERVENTIONS Laparoscopic GB or RYGBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Operative morbidity, weight loss, residual BMI, quality of life, food tolerance, lipid profile, and long-term morbidity. RESULTS Follow-up was 92.3% at the end of the study period (6 years postoperatively). Early morbidity was higher after RYGBP than after GB (17.2% vs 5.4%; P<.001), but major morbidity was similar. Weight loss was quicker, maximal weight loss was greater, and weight loss remained significantly better after RYGBP until the sixth postoperative year. At 6 years, there were more failures (BMI>35 or reversal of the procedure/conversion) after GB (48.3% vs 12.3%; P<.001). There were more long-term complications (41.6% vs 19%; P.001) and more reoperations (26.7% vs 12.7%; P<.001) after GB. Comorbidities improved more after RYGBP. CONCLUSIONS Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is associated with better weight loss, resulting in a better correction of some comorbidities than GB, at the price of a higher early complication rate. This difference, however, is largely compensated by the much higher long-term complication and reoperation rates seen after GB.","output":"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs gastric banding for morbid obesity: a case-matched study of 442 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most significant cause of cattle morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) is an established aetiological agent of BRD, but little is known regarding its pathogenesis. Here, a BRD PCR panel identified 18/153 (11.8 %) lung samples and 20/49 (40.8 %) nasal swabs collected from cattle with respiratory signs as positive for BRBV, which was the most prevalent virus in nasal swabs. Primary bovine tracheal epithelial cells were used to isolate BRBV that was phylogenetically related to contemporary sequences from the USA and Mexico and genetically divergent from the previous sole BRBV isolate. To investigate virus pathogenesis, 1-week-old colostrum-deprived dairy calves were inoculated intranasally with 7.0 log(10) TCID(50) BRBV. Virus was isolated from nasal swabs, nasal turbinates, trachea and the brain of the challenged animals. Neutralizing antibodies were detected beginning 7 days post-inoculation and peaked at day 14. In situ hybridization (ISH) localized BRBV infection in the upper respiratory ciliated epithelial and goblet cells, occasionally associated with small defects of the superficial cilia lining. Sporadically, pinpoint ISH signals were also detected in cells resembling glial cells in the cerebrum in one calf. Together, these results demonstrate the BRBV infection is highly prevalent in acute BRD samples and while the pathogenicity of BRBV is minimal with infection largely limited to the upper respiratory tract, further research is needed to elucidate a possible initiatory role in BRD.","output":"Bovine rhinitis B virus is highly prevalent in acute bovine respiratory disease and causes upper respiratory tract infection in calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of occupational exposure to the new pandemic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and are a source of nosocomial transmission in airborne infectious isolation rooms (AIIRs).

For this purpose, 586 Portuguese adults (73% females) ranging between 18 and 78 years old (M = 38.96, SD = 12.20) completed an online survey during the initial phase of the pandemic crisis in Portugal. Findings suggest that experiential avoidance was the strongest predictor of a negative response (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and negative emotions), whereas positivity was a better predictor of psychological well-being and lower levels of depression. Additionally, self-blame, behavioral disengagement, and emotional venting were strong risk factors for psychological distress, whereas positive reframing, planning, and acceptance were associated with more positive outcomes. These findings highlight the critical role of experiential avoidance on individuals psychological distress and the essential contribution of positive life orientation in promoting flourishing.

Cardiobundles were fabricated from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, exposed to 0-20 ng/ml of IFN?3 on culture days 7-14, and assessed for changes in tissue structure, viability, contractile force and calcium transient generation, action potential propagation, cytokine secretion, and expression of select genes and proteins. We found that application of IFN?3 induced a dose-dependent reduction in contractile force generation, deterioration of sarcomeric organization, and cardiomyocyte disarray, without significantly altering cell viability, action potential propagation, or calcium transient amplitude. At molecular level, the IFN?3-induced structural and functional deficits could be attributed to altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway (JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1), and reduced expression of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2v, and sarcomeric &#945;-actinin. Application of clinically used JAK/STAT inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, fully prevented IFN?3-induced cardiomyopathy, confirming the critical roles of this signaling pathway in inflammatory cardiac disease. Taken together, our in vitro studies in engineered myocardial tissues reveal direct adverse effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN?3 on human cardiomyocytes and establish the foundation for a potential use of cardiobundle platform in modeling of inflammatory myocardial disease and therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, lupus erythematosus, Chagas disease, and others, as well as viral infections including H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 show increased systemic levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-?3 (IFN?3) and are associated with high risk of heart disease. Here we explored for the first time if chronically elevated levels of IFN?3 can negatively affect structure and function of engineered human heart tissues in vitro. Our studies revealed IFN?3-induced deterioration of myofibrillar organization and contractile force production in human cardiomyocytes, attributed to decreased expression of multiple sarcomeric proteins and upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. FDA-approved JAK inhibitors fully blocked the adverse effects of IFN?3, suggesting a potentially effective strategy against human inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","output":"Loss of sarcomeric proteins via upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling underlies interferon-?3-induced contractile deficit in engineered human myocardium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a high-prevalence emergency department setting, chest CT showed a high probability of COVID-19 in 30% of patients with a negative or indeterminate initial RT-PCR result","output":"Added value of chest CT in suspected COVID-19: an analysis of 239 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the 21st century, the world has become a global village and a disease outbreak in one part of the world can spread rapidly to other countries far away.

The rapid spread of COVID-19 is having a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A chest X-ray of infected patients can be considered as a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. On retrospections, it is found that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This sparked the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies which have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Although there are certain shortcomings like deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data but the outbreak is recent, so it is large datasets of radiographic images of the COVID-19 infected patients are not available in such a short time. Here, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing a Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network-based model. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from DCGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. Although there are several models available, we chose MobileNet as it is a lightweight deep neural network, with fewer parameters and higher classification accuracy. Here we are using a deep neural network-based model to diagnose COVID-19 infected patients through radiological imaging of 5,859 Chest X-Ray images. We are using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network and a pre-trained model DenseNet 121 for two new label classes (COVID-19 and Normal). To improve the classification accuracy, in our work we have further reduced the number of network parameters by introducing dense blocks that are proposed in DenseNets into MobileNet. By adding synthetic images produced by DCGAN, the accuracy increased to 97%.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a number of user-based and general revenue generation mechanisms in reducing the transportation revenue shortfall or providing more stable revenue during a pandemic. State policies and pilot programs as well as public perception studies are reviewed to develop reasonable scenarios of tax and fee schemes, and price elasticity estimates are used to account for the effect of higher travel cost on demand for travel. We specifically focus on the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the transportation revenue in North Carolina (NC) using data from January to October 2020. The results indicate that monthly transportation revenue in NC could not have been sustained by increasing the state motor fuels tax up to 50% or motor vehicle fees up to 100%. On the other hand, increasing the highway use tax (state vehicle sales tax) from 3% to 8% would have eliminated the monthly shortfall in the state transportation revenue. Replacing the state fuels tax by mileage-based user fees could not bridge the gap between the monthly collected and projected state transportation revenue, even for high per-mile charges for passenger vehicles and trucks. Promising results are found for instituting an additional 0.75% state sales tax dedicated to general transportation use which could have provided adequate funding to eliminate the monthly shortfall in transportation revenue in NC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dependence on state sale and use tax for transportation revenue is preferred and would lead to a lower shortfall compared to the motor fuels tax in a pandemic.","output":"Exploring the efficacy of traditional and alternative funding mechanisms to provide transportation revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with high incidence of multiorgan dysfunction and death.

Many studies have been conducted to identify potent Glx-I inhibitors. Methods: Aiming to discover and develop novel Glx-I inhibitors, a series of 1,4-benzenesulfonamide derivatives were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated in vitro against human Glx-I enzyme. Seventeen compounds were designed based on the hit compound that was obtained from searching the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database. The synthesis of the target compounds (13-29) was accomplished utilizing an azo coupling reaction of aniline derivatives and activated substituted aromatic compounds. To understand the binding mode of the active compounds at the active site of Glx-I, docking studies were performed. Results: Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies were accomplished which led to the identification of several compounds that showed potent inhibitory activity with IC50 values below 10 M. Among the compounds tested, compounds (E)-2-hydroxy-5-((4-sulfamoylphenyl)diazenyl)benzoic acid (26) and (E)-4-((8-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl)diazenyl) benzenesulfonamide (28) displayed potent Glx-I inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.39 M and 1.36 M, respectively.

METHODS: A voluntary, online survey was distributed to RM and PC physicians via society newsletter mailing lists. RESULTS: 450 evaluable questionnaires (348 (77%) RM and 102 (23%) PC) were analysed. Significantly more PC physicians indicated routine use (often/always) of opioids across conditions (COPD: 92% vs. 39%, fILD: 83% vs. 36%, LC: 95% vs. 76%; all p < 0.001) and significantly more PC physicians indicated routine use of benzodiazepines for COPD (33% vs. 10%) and fILD (25% vs. 12%) (both p < 0.001). Significantly more RM physicians reported routine use of a breathlessness score (62% vs. 13%, p < 0.001) and prioritised exercise training/rehabilitation for COPD (49% vs. 7%) and fILD (30% vs. 18%) (both p < 0.001). Overall, 40% of all respondents reported reading non-cancer palliative care guidelines (either carefully or looked at them briefly). Respondents who reported reading these guidelines were more likely to: routinely use a breathlessness score ((2) = 13.8; p < 0.001), use opioids ((2) = 12.58, p < 0.001) and refer to pulmonary rehabilitation ((2) = 6.41, p = 0.011) in COPD; use antidepressants ((2) = 6.25; p = 0.044) and refer to PC ((2) = 5.83; p = 0.016) in fILD; and use a handheld fan in COPD ((2) = 8.75, p = 0.003), fILD ((2) = 4.85, p = 0.028) and LC ((2) = 5.63; p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a need for improved dissemination and uptake of jointly developed breathlessness management guidelines in order to encourage appropriate use of existing, evidence-based therapies. The lack of opioid use by RM, and continued benzodiazepine use in PC, suggest that a wider range of acceptable therapies need to be developed and trialled.

The virus crossed the species barrier and established in the human population due to its ability to exploit the ACE receptor for virus entry, which is present and abundant in several tissues, including the lung and respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and hearth. Virus interaction with the cellular receptor is mediated by the surface protein, known as Spike. Another structural protein of major importance in the Nucleocapsid, directly interacting with the viral RNA to form the ribonucleocapsid, considered a multifunctional protein, and being the target of the most molecular diagnostics assays. Objective: To describe the frequency of substitutions in spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Colombia and evaluate the frequency of these substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 sequences from other countries of South America. Materials and methods: Samples of 43 patients were included for viral RNA detection by real-time RT-PCR using the Charite-Berlin protocol for the amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 E and RdRp genes. Genome sequences were obtained through the Oxford Nanopore and Illumina MiSeq technologies, following the artic.network \\"nCoV-2019 sequencing protocol\\". Available genomes were consulted from GISAID, GenBank, and Genome sequence archive (GSA) and a total of 371 genomes sequences from South America were included. The genome sequences were aligned with the Muscle tool using the MEGA X software. Substitution matrices of the Colombian sequences respect to the reference genome (NC_045512) at the nucleotide and amino acid levels were generated for the spike and nucleocapsid gene. Results: substitution D614G in the amino acid sequence of spike protein was found in 86.7% of the Colombian sequences; substitutions G181V and D936Y in 2.3%, respectively. Five substitutions were found in the nucleocapsid protein, with substitution R203K and G204R being the most frequent (13.95 %) in Colombia. The substitutions D614G in Spike and R203K-G204R in nucleocapsid have a frequency of 83% and 28% respectively in sequences from South America. Conclusion: Non-synonymous substitutions were found in the spike and nucleocapsid proteins in Colombian genomes, the most frequent being D614G in Spike and R203K-G204R in nucleocapsid. These substitutions are frequent in the genomes reported for other South American countries. It is necessary to continue with genomic surveillance of the changes in Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Colombia and South America, even more considering that these proteins are the most commonly used antigen in serological tests.","output":"Substitutions in Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contribution analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the national health system with particular reference to the role of the health care professional in patient management during the emergency state and the possibility of limiting, in view of the scarcity of technical and human resources, access to treatment of sick patients The reflection takes into account, at the same time, the recommendations and opinions provided in this regard by institutional subjects and the role of the healthcare professional in the emergency management of the patient ? 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute All rights reserved","output":"The clinical decision in a pandemic situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We estimate the impact of mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on COVID-19 case growth in Canada, including regulations on businesses and gatherings, school closures, travel and self-isolation, and long-term care homes.

However, the role of HMGB1 in the anti-tumor immunity is unclear since inflammation in the tumor microenvironment also contributes to tumor promotion and progression. In the present study, we established HMGB1-knockout clones from B16F10 and CT26 murine tumors by genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and investigated the role of HMGB1 in anti-tumor immunity. We found that (1) knockout of HMGB1 in the tumor cells suppressed in vivo, but not in vitro, tumor growth, (2) the suppression of the in vivo tumor growth was mediated by CD8 T cells, and (3) infiltration of CD8 T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells into the tumor tissues was accelerated in HMGB1-knockout tumors. These results demonstrated that knockout of HMGB1 in tumor cells converted tumors from poor infiltration of immune cells called cold to immune-inflamed or hot and inhibited in vivo tumor growth mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Infiltration of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment is an important step in the series known as the cancer immunity cycle. Thus, manipulation of tumor-derived HMGB1 might be applicable to improve the clinical outcomes of cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockades and cancer vaccine therapies.

The findings were correlated with clinical outcomes. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, BAL from COVID-19 patients was characterized by significant lymphocytosis (p < 0.001), in contrast to peripheral blood lymphopenia commonly observed in COVID-19 patients and the presence of atypical lymphocytes with plasmacytoid/plasmablastic features (p < 0.001). Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that BAL lymphocytes, including plasmacytoid and plasmablastic cells, were composed predominantly of T cells with a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Both populations had increased expression of T-cell activation markers, suggesting important roles of helper and cytotoxic T-cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. More importantly, BAL lymphocytosis was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (p < 0.05) and longer requirement for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05), whereas the median atypical (activated) lymphocyte count was associated with shorter hospital stay (p < 0.05), shorter time on mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05) and improved survival.

This study aimed to determine the genetic variations in cytokines and their receptors in relation to COVID-19 pathogenesis using bioinformatic tools. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding the cytokines and cytokine receptors elevated in patients with COVID-19 were determined from the National Biotechnology Information Center website (using the dbSNP database). Missense variants were found in 3 cytokine genes and 10 cytokine receptor genes. Computational analyses were conducted to detect the effects of these missense SNPs via cloud-based software tools. Also, the miRSNP database was used to explore whether SNPs in the 3'-UTR altered the miRNA binding efficiency for genes of cytokines and their receptors. Our in silico studies revealed that one SNP in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) gene was predicted as deleterious using sorting intolerant from tolerant. Also, the stability of VEGFR2 decreased in the I-Mutant2.0 (biotool for predicting stability changes upon mutation from the protein sequence or structure) prediction. It was suggested that the decrease in VEGFR2 function (due to the rs1870377 polymorphism) may be correlated with the progression of COVID-19 or contribute to the pathogenesis. Moreover, 27 SNPs were determined to affect miRNA binding for the genes of cytokine receptors. CXCR2 rs1126579, TNFRSF1B rs1061624 and IL10RB rs8178562 SNPs were predicted to break the miRNA-mRNA binding sites for miR-516a-3, miR-720 and miR-328, respectively.

Blood collected on the Ser-Col device (Labonovum), was eluted using an automated system (SCAUT Ser-Col automation, Blok System Supply) and an automatized analyzer (Alinity i, Abbott). Ser-Col results were compared to serum considered as the reference, and dried blood spot samples processed manually. Results: Two participants tested positive for HIV (0.5%), eight tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), four tested low positive for anti-HCV antibodies (1%) but negative for HCV RNA, 47 tested positive for syphilis (12.4%). We observed a full concordance of Ser-Col and DBS results for HIV diagnosis compared to serum results. Ser-Col and DBS samples tested positive in seven HBsAg carriers and negative for one participants having a low HBsAg level in serum (0.5 IU/mL). Three hundred and sixty-eight participants uninfected by HBV tested negative for HBsAg (99.5%). Two Ser-Col samples and two other DBS samples positive tested positive in HBV uninfected participants (false positive results with low S/CO indexes). All participants tested negative for HCV in Ser-Col and DBS samples, including in dried blood samples from the four participants tested low positive for HCV antibodies and HCV RNA negative in serum. The threshold of the treponemal assay was optimized for dried blood sample testing.

However, sample-collection requires qualified personnel, protective equipement and may cause transmission. We assessed the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2-rtPCR applying three self-sampling techniques as compared to professional-collected oro-nasopharyngeal samples (cOP/NP). METHODS: From 62 COVID-19 outpatients, we obtained: (i) multi-swab, MS; (ii) saliva sponge combined with nasal vestibula, SN; (iii) gargled water, GW; (iv) professionally-collected cOP/NP (standard). We compared ct-values for E-gene and ORF1ab and analysed variables reducing sensitivity of self-collecting procedures. RESULTS: The median ct-values for E-gene and ORF1ab obtained in cOP/NP samples were 20.7 and 20.2, in MS samples 22.6 and 21.8, in SN samples 23.3 and 22.3, and in GW samples 30.3 and 29.8, respectively. MS and SN samples showed sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI, 86.5-99.0) and GW samples of 88.7% (78.1-95.3). Sensitivity was inversely correlated with ct-values, and became <90% for samples obtained more than 8 days after symptom onset. For MS and SN samples, false negativity was associated with language problems, sampling errors, and symptom duration. CONCLUSION: Conclusions from this study are limited to the sensitivity of self-sampling in mildly to moderately symptomatic patients. Still, self-collected oral/nasal/saliva samples can facilitate up-scaling of testing in early symptomatic COVID-19 patients if operational errors are minimized.","output":"Self-collected oral, nasal and saliva samples yield sensitivity comparable to professional-collected oro-nasopharyngeal swabs in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis among symptomatic outpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prenatal genetic screens, including carrier screening (CS) and aneuploidy screening (AS), comprise an important component of reproductive healthcare delivery. Clinical practice guidelines emphasize the importance of informed decision-making and patients preferences regarding the use of these screens. Yet, it is unclear how to achieve this ideal as prenatal genetic screening options rapidly become more complex and increasingly available to patients. With increased complexity and availability of reproductive testing options, decision-support strategies are critical to prepare patients to consider AS and/or CS. METHODS: A self-administered survey evaluated knowledge and decision-making preferences for expanded carrier (CS) and aneuploidy (AS) prenatal screening. The survey was administered to participants before their first prenatal visit to assess baseline decision-making needs and preference at the initiation of prenatal care. Analysis was approached as a descriptive process. RESULTS: Participants had similar familiarity with the concepts associated with AS compared to CS; mean knowledge scores for CS was 0.59 [possible range 0.00 to 1.00] and 0.55 for AS. Participants reported preferences to learn about a range of conditions, including those with severe or mild impact, childhood-onset, and adult-onset. Decision-making preference with respect to learning about the associated disease phenotypes for the contained on AS and CS panel shifted with the complexity of the panel, with a greater preference to learn about conditions post-test compared pre-test education as panels increased from 5 to 100 conditions. CONCLUSION: Patients baseline knowledge of prenatal genetic screens coupled with evolving decision-making preferences presents challenges for the delivery of prenatal genetic screens.

We collected sociodemographic characteristics, attitude, knowledge, and health beliefs on COVID-19 vaccination. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression analysis was used to assess the trends of vaccination acceptance. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors related to vaccination acceptance.Results: Among the 1392 pregnant women, the acceptance rate of a COVID-19 vaccine were 77.4% (95%CI 75.1-79.5%).

METHODS: The data used in this evaluation include disease counts from 2007 to 2017 in northern Nevada. The disease counts for chlamydia, salmonella, respiratory syncytial virus, gonorrhea, viral meningitis, and influenza A were predicted. RESULTS: Our results showed that autocorrelation could not guarantee the best performance for prediction of disease counts. However, the proposed method with the change-point analysis suggests a period of measurement that is operationally acceptable and performance that is not significantly different from the best prediction.

We now describe major developments in recent months and provide an outlook on the expected consequences. METHODS PubMed literature search, clinical survey. RESULTS To date, the course of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by several new but overall rare ocular manifestations, the ophthalmological shared management of COVID-19 patients on intensive care units, and a significant decrease in case numbers, associated with an increase in case severity and relative proportion of emergencies, as a result of delayed presentation of patients and reduced treatment adherence. With the introduction of hygiene measures and infection control procedures, ophthalmic patient care was maintained - including emergencies and urgent treatments. Due to the extensive postponement of elective surgeries, scarce therapeutic and health care professional resources, and the prioritisation of critically ill patients from other specialties, there is a reasonable likelihood that urgent treatments will be delayed as infection rates rise. CONCLUSION Outpatient and inpatient care in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic is primarily accompanied by additional organisational or medical challenges and a decline in case volume. Although to date emergency and urgent ophthalmic treatments have been maintained, long-term persistence of pandemic conditions will require additional strategies to provide continuation of ophthalmic care at the required level.","output":"Ophthalmic Outpatient and Inpatient Care Under Pandemic Conditions: Hygiene, Triage and New Challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PHEIC, which appears more and more frequently, has had a significant impact on the world economy, especially the economy of the affected countries For export-oriented countries, PHEIC also has an impact on the country's foreign trade development This paper takes COVID-19 as an example to explain the impact of PHEIC on China's cross-border e-commerce exports, and proposes countermeasures from the government, cross-border e-commerce platform and enterprises ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Influence and response of China's cross-border E-commerce exports under PHEIC-take COVID-19 as an example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) endemic is growing exponentially in the whole world.

Most of these networks built before the 1990s have a significant impact on the environment. While there is no doubt that humanity needs infrastructure to ensure safe, secure and sufficient access to food, water and energy, it is essential to prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems which are also at the basis of the provision of such fundamental services. Those complex, interconnected issues cannot be tackled without research and innovation, both in the fields of biodiversity and of infrastructure. IENE (Infrastructure Ecology Network Europe) was set up in 1996 to meet this need. Its mission is to promote the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practice in safe and sustainable pan-European transport infrastructure. With a status of an association today, this independent network has more than 400 members consisting of researchers, engineers, decision makers and infrastructure operators. IENE functions as an international and interdisciplinary forum. It supports cross-border cooperation in research, mitigation, planning, design, construction and maintenance in the field of biodiversity and transport infrastructure. Every two years, IENE organises an international conference to present cutting-edge research, identify pressing issues and problems, discuss effective solutions and map out future activities in the field of transport ecology and infrastructure. We are very glad to present you in this special issue some of the best scientific outcomes of the IENE 2020 conference, hoping that it will contribute to further breakthroughs in science and uptake in policy-making and practices on the ground.

Testing remains at a premium, and criteria for testing remains reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and/or a known high-risk exposure. The role of imaging in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving; however, few algorithms include imaging criteria, and it is unclear what should be done in low-suspicion patients with positive imaging findings. METHODS: From 03/01/2020C03/20/2020, a retrospective review of all patients with suspected COVID-19 on imaging was performed. Imaging was interpreted by a board-certified, fellowship-trained radiologist. Patients were excluded if COVID-19 infection was suspected at the time of presentation, was the reason for imaging, or if any lower respiratory symptoms were present. RESULTS: Eight patients with suspected COVID-19 infection on imaging were encountered. Seven patients received testing due to suspicious imaging findings with subsequent lab-confirmed COVID-19. No patients endorsed prior exposure to COVID-19 or recent international travel. COVID-19 was suggested in six patients incidentally on abdominal CT and two on chest radiography. At the time of presentation, no patients were febrile, and seven endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms. Five COVID-19 patients eventually developed respiratory symptoms and required intubation. Two patients expired during the admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19 warrant prompt reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing even in low clinical suspicion cases. The prevalence of disease in the population may be underestimated by the current paradigm of RT-PCR testing with the current clinical criteria of lower respiratory symptoms and exposure risk.","output":"Incidentally discovered COVID-19 in low-suspicion patientsa threat to front line health care workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the SRQR EQUATOR checklist, we review the gendered burdens and impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Although men are primarily detected to be slightly more vulnerable in succumbing to the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, many researchers have recognized that women are facing more of the devastating brunt in secondary terms. Aside gendered health and social impacts, women are more disproportionately disadvantaged than men in economic terms, as they are predominantly found in the part-time and informal occupations, which have been closed down for months now since the emergence of the current global crisis. Also, since women form the vast proportion of the caregivers within the health sector, their role in handling the pandemic as frontline respondents at the hospitals put them in higher risks of contracting the disease. Despite this higher risk of infection, the peculiar attentions to women's health in the planning and rolling out of actions to contain the virus have been overlooked. Additionally, their unpaid domestic care works have also increased due to closure of schools and businesses, which have forced family members to stay at home for as long as movement control orders remain in place. In this confined state, the domestic violence against women have been recorded to be on the increase. To recommend measures that consider gendered dimensions of the current crisis, we have reviewed the various sex-based burdens and impacts of the pandemic, and proceeded to suggest necessary response actions to handle the situation. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of the outbreak on women, and how the gendered flaws in the current response strategies could be avoided in managing future global crises.","output":"Gendered burdens and impacts of SARS-CoV-2: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real\\\\time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is the mainstay of COVID\\\\19 diagnosis, yet there are conflicting reports on its diagnostic performance.

METHODS: Kidney recipients with biopsy-proven cABMR were treated with allogeneic third-party BM-MSCs in this open-label, single-arm, single-center, two-dosing-regimen phase I/II clinical trial. In Regimen 1 (n=8), BM-MSCs were administered intravenously at a dose of 1.010(6) cells/kg monthly for four consecutive months, while in Regimen 2 (n=15), the BM-MSCs dose was 1.010(6) cells/kg weekly during four consecutive weeks. The primary endpoints were the absolute change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline (delta eGFR) and the incidence of adverse events associated with BM-MSCs administration 24 months after the treatment. Contemporaneous cABMR patients who did not receive BM-MSCs were retrospectively analyzed as the control group (n =30). RESULTS: Twenty-three recipients with cABMR received BM-MSCs. The median delta eGFR of the total BM-MSCs treated patients was -4.3 ml/min per 1.73m(2) (interquartile range, IQR -11.2 to 1.2) 2 years after BM-MSCs treatment (P=0.0233). The median delta maximum donor-specific antibody (maxDSA) was -4310 (IQR -9187 to 1129) at 2 years (P=0.0040). The median delta eGFR of the control group was -12.7 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR -22.2 to -3.5) 2 years after the diagnosis, which was greater than that of the BM-MSCs treated group (P=0.0342). The incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation, BK polyomaviruses (BKV) infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was 17.4%, 17.4%, 8.7%, respectively. There was no fever, anaphylaxis, phlebitis or venous thrombosis, cardiovascular complications, or malignancy after BM-MSCs administration. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significant decreasing trend of CD27(-)IgD(-) double negative B cells subsets and trend towards the increase of CD3(+)CD4(+)PD-1(+)/lymphocyte population after MSCs therapy. Multiplex analysis found TNF-, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL11 and RANTES decreased after MSCs treatment. CONCLUSION: Kidney allograft recipients with cABMR are tolerable to BM-MSCs.

The exact pathophysiology and the mechanism which links different factors related to the disease is still unknown. Due to unknown precise pathogenesis, the coexistence of other diseases, and overlapping clinical features, FMS diagnosis may be laborious. Various treatment strategies are used, only a few Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, still we are facing challenges regarding effective treatment. Recently, medicinal cannabis has proven to be effective in chronic pain conditions such as osteoarthritis, neuropathic pain, and other non-cancer chronic pain. However, further research is needed about how the cannabinoid system works with the pain pathway. Using the fact that medicinal cannabis is effective in the treatment of chronic pain and certain rheumatic diseases, in this review, we aim to analyze the role of the cannabinoid system in fibromyalgia syndrome. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines in searching PubMed, MEDLINE (through PubMed), PubMed Central, and Google Scholar using keywords \\"fibromyalgia, chronic pain, cannabis, cannabinoids, pharmacotherapy, alternative therapy\\" and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) words. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria and checking for the quality assessment, 22 articles were retrieved and used for the analysis of the role of cannabis in the treatment of fibromyalgia. The two main compounds of cannabis with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties are cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and their ratio determines the effect on various symptoms of FMS. We included studies regarding the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of fibromyalgia, investigating the use of nabilone, dronabinol (a synthetic analog of THC), Bedrocan (22.4 mg THC, <1 mg CBD), Bediol (13.4 mg THC, 17.8 mg CBD), and Bedrolite (18.4 mg CBD, <1 mg THC). In the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and opioid crisis, many adverse outcomes are observed in the patients suffering from FMS due to lack of any definitive treatment and promising outcomes from the known treatment options, which led to the need for effective and safer treatment alternatives. Although the studies reviewed in this article suggest that medical cannabis is a safe and effective treatment for fibromyalgia pain, several limitations regarding dosage, length of treatment, adverse effects, long-term follow-up, and dependence needs further investigation.","output":"A Systematic Review of Fibromyalgia and Recent Advancements in Treatment: Is Medicinal Cannabis a New Hope?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We implement a discrete choice experiment to examine the impact of COVID\\\\19 exposure risk, unemployment risk, enhanced and extended unemployment benefits, and job attributes on low\\\\skilled workers' willingness to accept (WTA) meatpacking jobs.

We studied the interference between seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses and five other common viruses that cause respiratory illnesses in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017. METHODS: The weekly laboratory-confirmed positive rates of each virus were analyzed from 2014 to 2017 in Hong Kong to describe the epidemiological trends and interference between influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus. A sinusoidal model was established to estimate the peak timing of each virus by phase angle parameters. RESULTS: Seasonal features of the influenza viruses, PIV, enterovirus and adenovirus were obvious, whereas annual peaks of RSV and rhinovirus were not observed. The incidence of the influenza viruses usually peaked in February and July, and the summer peaks in July were generally caused by the H3 subtype of influenza A alone. When influenza viruses were active, other viruses tended to have a low level of activity. The peaks of the influenza viruses were not synchronized. An epidemic of rhinovirus tended to shift the subsequent epidemics of the other viruses. CONCLUSION: The evidence from recent surveillance data in Hong Kong suggests that viral interference during the epidemics of influenza viruses and other common respiratory viruses might affect the timing and duration of subsequent epidemics of a certain or several viruses.","output":"Possible interference between seasonal epidemics of influenza and other respiratory viruses in Hong Kong, 2014C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Annals On Call - Surge Modeling for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the effect of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on lifestyle behaviors and mood changes in the Croatian general population.

By the beginning of March, WHO reported about 113,820,000 confirmed cases including more than 2,527,000 deaths all over the world. However, the true extent of virus circulation or its real infection/fatality ratio is not well-estimated due to the huge portion of asymptomatic infections. In this observational study, we have estimated the prevalence of specific immunoglobulin M and G directed towards SARS-CoV-2 antigen in a cohort of 1383 adult volunteers aged over 65 years old, living in the district of Benevento, in the South of Italy. Serological screening was carried out on capillary blood in September 2020, seven months after pandemic outbreak in Italy, to evaluate virus circulation and antibody response among elderly adults, in which severe symptoms due to viral infection are more common. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.70% (CI 3.70%-5.95%) with no statistically significant differences between sexes. Among these, 69.69% (CI 55.61%-77.80%) tested positive to IgM, 23.08% (CI 14.51%-34.64%) to IgG and 9.23% (CI 4.30%-18.71%) was positive for both. All patients that were positive to IgM underwent molecular testing through RT-qPCR on oral-rhino pharyngeal swabs and only one specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Instead, the presence of IgG from screened volunteers was confirmed by re-testing serum samples using both an ELISA assay validated for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD) and a recently published synthetic peptide-based ELISA assay. In conclusion, our report suggests that (1) early restrictions were successful in limiting COVID-19 diffusion in the district of Benevento; (2) rapid serological analysis is an ideal testing for both determining real seroprevalence and massive screening, whereas detection of viral RNA remains a gold standard for identification of infected patients; (3) even among people without COVID-19 related symptoms, the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 antigens has individual features.","output":"Seroprevalence of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM among Adults over 65 Years Old in the South of Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lower reported number of cases and deaths within the paediatric population, indirect impacts on the health of children in Sub-Saharan Africa such as malnutrition are evident. Data on the socioeconomic factors affecting malnutrition in the under-age population of Sub-Saharan Africa brought by the COVID-19 pandemic remain limited. This paper assesses socioeconomic factors of malnutrition in relation with COVID-19 and potential mitigating measures. MethodsA scoping review of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from March 11, 2020, to May 1, 2021, was conducted. The included studies focused on COVID-19, children malnutrition, and Sub-Saharan Africa and adhered to the PRISMA guideline. ResultsAmong 73 total screened articles, 15 studies filled the inclusion criteria. The identified socioeconomic factors leading to malnutrition in children were reduction in average income or increase in unemployment rate, access to healthcare and food supplements, disrupted food supply chains and increased prices of food products, pauses in humanitarian responses, and reduced access to school-based meals. Potential mitigation measures were food subsidies, food price control measures, the identification of new vulnerable groups and the implementation of financial interventions. ConclusionMalnutrition amongst Sub-Saharan African children due to COVID-19 is a result of a combination of multiple socioeconomic factors. To stabilize household purchasing power and eventually malnutrition in children in SSA, a combined strategy of initial detection of newly developing vulnerable groups and efficient, rapid financial assistance through mobile phone transfers was suggested.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 23rd March 2020, Northern Ireland was placed into 'lockdown' with the majority of the population advised to \\"stay at home\\". The objective of this paper is to identify what effect the lockdown restrictions had on the workload of the Major Trauma Service at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Method Patients were identified at the orthopaedic trauma meetings and from direct referral to the Major Trauma Service (MTS). Patients admitted and seen by the MTS from 23/03/20, the day lockdown was announced, to 29/05/20, when restrictions were partially lifted, were included in the analysis. Admissions data from this time period was then compared to admissions data from the same period in 2019 (23/03/19 - 29/05/19). Results When comparing pre-lockdown and lockdown groups there was an overall decrease of 26% in admissions to the MTS (n=57 vs n=42). Road Traffic Accidents were reduced by 53% (n=31 vs n=15) and falls from >2m were reduced by 29% (n=21 vs n=15). Conclusion Overall the number of admissions to the major trauma service was reduced during the lockdown period. A significant proportion of the reduction may be a result of social restrictions that reduced volume of traffic on Northern Irelands roads.

New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to deaths as well as social and economic disruptions, is an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Hence, only supportive care has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for now. Pharmacological agents used for the adjunctive treatment of COVID-19 following the current literature and clinical experiences include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malaria drugs, and other traditional or untraditional treatments. However, it has been reported that the use of these drugs may have some negative effects and comorbidities. Moreover, the current data have indicated that the risk of drug-drug interactions may also be high in polypharmacy cases, especially in elderly people, some comorbidity situations, and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is highly possible that these situations can not only increase the risk of drug-drug interactions but also increase the risk of food/nutrition-drug interactions and affect the nutritional status. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature.

Indeed, the first step in viral entry is the binding of the viral trimeric spike protein to ACE2. Abundantly present in human epithelial cells of many organs, ACE2 is also expressed in the human brain. ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular 44-residues segment. This C-terminal segment contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) targeting protein interacting domains called PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ). Here, we identified the human PDZ specificity profile of the ACE2 PBM using the high throughput holdup assay and measuring the binding intensities of the PBM of ACE2 against the full human PDZome. We discovered 14 human PDZ binders of ACE2 showing significant binding with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 to 81 M. NHERF, SHANK, and SNX27 proteins found in this study are involved in protein trafficking. The PDZ/PBM interactions with ACE2 could play a role on ACE2 internalization and recycling that could benefit for the virus entry. Interestingly, most of the ACE2 partners we identified are expressed in neuronal cells, such as SHANK and MAST families, and modifications of the interactions between ACE2 and these neuronal proteins may be involved in neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","output":"PDZ-containing proteins targeted by the ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(Global Health Promotion, 2021;28(2): 7C16) Les ressources dadaptation individuelles, sociales et nationales, et leurs relations avec la sant mentale et lanxit : une tude comparative mene en Isra?l, en Italie et aux Pays-Bas durant la pandmie de coronavirus Adi Mana, Sabina Super, Claudia Sardu, Dolors Juvinya Canal, Neuman Moran et Shifra Sagy En utilisant le modle salutogne, nous nous sommes demand comment les individus de diffrents pays faisaient face  la crise de la COVID-19 et restaient en bonne sant.

In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We compared the infection rate of 2,195 individuals who received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals between February 27th and April 14th 2021.

This study aimed to investigate possible risk factors for ER and provide further empirical data for prevention and clinical treatment strategies. METHODS A retrospective investigation of 116 concurrent ER cases was conducted. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between each potential risk (or protective) factor and ER. The clinical characteristics of the 71 hospitalized patients were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS After screening, the following variables significantly increased the risk of ER: shorter length of service (recruits, odds ratios [OR] 7.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.58-21.75), higher body mass index (BMI, OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.03-1.26), lack of physical exercise in the last half year (< once a month, OR 3.20, 95%CI 1.08-9.44), and prior heat injury (OR 2.94, 95%CI 1.26-6.89). Frequent fruit consumption (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.33-0.99), active hydration habit (OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.20-0.67), water replenishment 2 L on the training day (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.05-0.45), and water replenishment 500 mL within 1 h before training (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.88) significantly decreased the risk of ER. Of the 71 hospitalized patients, 41 (57.7%) were diagnosed with hypokalemia on admission. DISCUSSION In military training, emphasis should be placed on incremental adaptation training prior to more intense training, and close attention should be given to overweight and previously sedentary recruits. Fluid replenishment before exercise, increased fruit intake, and proper potassium supplementation may help prevent ER.","output":"Exertional rhabdomyolysis in newly enrolled cadets of a military academy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of social determinants of health in affecting health outcomes.

Research indicates that pretreatment psychological variables including patients' perceptions of their susceptibility to nausea, expectancies of treatment-related nausea and nausea history (i.e., motion sickness, morning sickness and baseline levels of nausea) may aid in predicting nausea severity during chemotherapy. However, this research is dated and limited in quantity. We investigated whether psychological variables could improve prediction of nausea severity to inform interventions targeting chemotherapy-induced nausea. METHODS: In this secondary analysis, a subgroup of women receiving chemotherapy (for the first time) for breast cancer completed pretreatment measures: perceived nausea susceptibility, nausea expectancies, nausea history and baseline nausea. They rated subsequent nausea severity across 4-days, during treatment and posttreatment in a self-report diary. Structural Equation Modelling was used to explore associations. RESULTS: Across the women (N = 481), perceived nausea susceptibility predicted subsequent nausea severity (? = 0.16), but nausea expectancies did not (? = 0.05). Nausea history variables demonstrated small-moderate associations with perceived susceptibility (? = 0.21-0.32) and negligible-small associations with nausea expectancies (? = 0.07-0.14). CONCLUSION: Perceived nausea susceptibility appears to capture patients' nausea history, to a degree, and is related to nausea severity during treatment.

Traditionally, in-person hands-on courses have been the most common means for surgeons to gain exposure to new techniques and procedures. The COVID19 pandemic caused a cessation in these courses and left surgeons with limited opportunities to continue their professional development. Thus, SAGES elected to create an innovative hands-on course that could be completed at home in order to provide surgeons with opportunities to learn new procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: This course was initially planned to be taught as an in-person hands-on course utilizing the Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer(ADOPT) method (1). We identified a virtual telementoring platform, Proximie Ltd(London, UK), and a company that could create a model of an abdominal wall in order to perform a Transversus Abdominis Release, KindHeart?(Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The course consisted of pre-course lectures and videos to be reviewed by participants, a pre-course call to set learning goals, the hands-on telementoring session from home, and monthly webinars for a year. RESULTS: The ADOPT hands-on hernia course at home was successfully completed on October 23rd of 2020. All participants and faculty were successfully able to set up their model and utilize the telementoring platform, but 15% required assistance. Post course-surveys showed that participants felt that the course was successful in meeting their educational goals and felt similar to prior in-person courses. CONCLUSIONS: SAGES was successfully able to transition and in-person hands-on course to a virtual at-home format. This innovative approach to continuing professional development will be necessary during the times of the COVID19 pandemic, but may be a helpful option for rural surgeons and others with travel restrictions in the future to continue their professional development without the need to travel away from their practice.","output":"At-home hands-on surgical training during COVID19: proof of concept using a virtual telementoring platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The current study aimed to investigate the impact of asymptomatic or mild severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on female fertility and laboratory and clinical outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments.

'Open Access' publishing is expected to become an increasingly important format for peer reviewed academic journals and that Globalization and Health is 'Open Access' is appropriate. The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold: Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health C be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods C have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of 'access' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing. Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve. And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic. A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific.

In this work, we applied transition path sampling (TPS) methods to study base flipping in a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule that is known to interact with RNA-editing enzymes through this mechanism. We obtained an ensemble of 1000 transition trajectories to describe the base-flipping process. We used the likelihood maximization method to determine the refined reaction coordinate (RC) consisting of two collective variables (CVs), a distance and a dihedral angle between nucleotides that form stacking interactions with the flipping base. The free energy profile projected along the refined RC revealed three minima, two corresponding to the initial and final states and one for a metastable state. We suggest that the metastable state likely represents a wobbled conformation of nucleobases observed in NMR studies that is often characterized as the flipped state.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ACE-2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19, but it is also critical for maintaining the correct functionality of lung epithelium and endothelium. Coronaviruses induce activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and shedding of ACE-2 from the cell surface resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, we hypothesized that ADAM17 inhibition ameliorates Covid-19-related lung inflammation. We employed a pre-clinical mouse model using intra-tracheal instillation of a combination of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly-I:C) and the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD-S) to mimic lung damage associated with Covid-19. Histological analysis of inflamed mice confirmed the expected signs of lung injury including edema, fibrosis, vascular congestion and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, inflamed mice also showed an increased NLR as observed in critically ill Covid-19 patients. Administration of the ADAM17 inhibitors apratastat and TMI-1 significantly improved lung histology and prevented leukocyte infiltration. Reduced leukocyte recruitment could be explained by reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower levels of the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Additionally, the NLR was significantly reduced by ADAM17 inhibition.

Moreover, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of HIV-related characteristics (e.g., viral suppression, treatment factors) on screening outcomes in these high HIV burden settings. METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between HIV status, HIV treatment, and viral suppression with cervical cancer screening outcomes. Data from a \\"screen and treat\\" program based at a large, free antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi was retrospectively analyzed to determine rates of abnormal VIA results and suspected cancer, and coverage of same-day treatment. Multivariate logistic regression assessed associations between screening outcomes and HIV status, and among women living with HIV, viremia, ART treatment duration and BMI. RESULTS: Of 1405 women receiving first-time VIA screening between 2017-2019, 13 (0.9%) had suspected cancer and 68 (4.8%) had pre-cancerous lesions, of whom 50 (73.5%) received same-day lesion treatment. There was no significant association found between HIV status and screening outcomes. Among HIV+ women, abnormal VIA was positively associated with viral load  1000 copies/mL (aOR 3.02, 95% CI: 1.22, 7.49) and negatively associated with ART treatment duration (aOR 0.88 per additional year, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98). CONCLUSION: In this population of women living with HIV with high rates of ART coverage and viral suppression, HIV status was not significantly associated with abnormal cervical cancer screening results.

The pandemic-related impacts on the health outcomes of people with dermatological conditions are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to study the association of COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts with health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with skin diseases. A self-administered web-based questionnaire was distributed through social media. Demographic and clinical data and pandemic-related impacts (isolation status, income changes, and employment status) were collected. The main outcomes included perceived stress (Visual Analog Scale), symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire), quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index), and health utility mapping based on the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with skin diseases completed the survey. The mean age of the patients was 33.5 years (SD 14.0), and 217/506 patients (42.9%) were male. Among the 506 respondents, 128 (25.3%) were quarantined, 102 (20.2%) reported unemployment, and 317 (62.6%) reported decrease or loss of income since the pandemic. The pandemic-related impacts were significantly associated with impaired mental well-being and quality of life with different effects. Unemployment and complete loss of income were associated with the highest risks of adverse outcomes, with increases of 110% to 162% in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and impaired quality of life.

The cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the status of dental caries and associated factors in Tibetan adults. METHODS: Participants aged 35-44, 55-64 and 65-74 years were selected. Decayed, missing, and filled tooth (DMFT), decayed and filled root (DF-Root) and root canal index (RCI) were used to evaluate dental caries. Questionnaire survey on demographic information, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, and oral health knowledge and behavior was conducted. Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression were used for the statistical analyses. RESULTS: A total of 446 participants were enrolled in the survey. Of these: 222 (49.8%) were females, 224 (50.2%) were males; 149 (33.4%), 151 (33.9%), 146 (32.7%) were aged 35-44, 55-64 and 65-74 years respectively. The mean DMFT (SD) was 7.62 (4.84), 12.46 (8.16), and 21.38 (8.93). The filling rate was very low in all age groups (1.77%, 0.98%, 0.45%). The mean DF-Root (SD) was 0.50 (1.04), 1.04 (2.02), 1.32 (2.14), respectively. Root caries index was 42.27, 44.78 and 57.60%. Older age (65-74 age group) was positively associated with crown caries (odds ratio = 31.20, 95% confidence interval: 10.70-90.96).

Limitations on social gathering have called the wisdom of a conventional trauma meeting into question. We have initiated our virtual trauma meeting and report our early results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Daily morning trauma meetings are now conducted online. Following instigation, we collated the results of a feedback form completed online to assess the relative merits of a virtual trauma meeting. RESULTS: There were 27 responses received to the electronically administered virtual trauma meeting evaluation survey, from a range of trauma and orthopaedic department personnel. There were no concerns regarding patient safety or decision making and, apart from the quality of the audio (63% dissatisfied or very dissatisfied) positive feedback outweighed negative feedback in every category. At 74%, the majority of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied overall with the virtual trauma meeting. CONCLUSION: Trauma meetings can be safely conducted in a virtual environment with high standards of patient care maintained. Virtual trauma meeting offers service enhancements such as early subspecialty input and enhanced cross-site communication and rapid solution development to logistical difficulties.

Current research indicates a possible relationship between BD and musculoskeletal conditions including alterations in thoracic mechanics, respiratory muscle strength and spirometry, however, there is a lack of evidence regarding the most appropriate BD assessment and management strategies. Therefore, this study investigated physiotherapists use of BD assessment and management strategies for patients with musculoskeletal conditions and explored relationships between professional characteristics and current practice variation. Methods: An observational cross-sectional online survey was utilised. UK-based musculoskeletal physiotherapists were invited to participate via social media, professional networks and email. The survey consisted of 28 closed and 16 open questions informed by similar surveys and relevant BD literature. The survey was piloted by five musculoskeletal physiotherapists and was open for eight weeks between 22/05/2020 - 17/07/2020 with a half-way reminder. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and Fishers exact test. Results: 257 questionnaires were completed. 81% (n = 208) of participants worked within the NHS and 31.1% (n = 80) in private practice, with the majority working at an equivalent band 6 (23%, n = 58), band 7 (33%, n = 84) and band 8a (31%, n = 79). 13.2% (n = 34) reported a special interest in BD. 72% (n = 185) of participants did not assess or manage BD, 28% (n = 72) did. In this latter group 100% (n = 72) assessed using subjective indicators and patient observation, while muscle-length testing (69%, n = 50), physical assessment (68%, n = 49), respiratory parameters (26%, n = 19) and BD specific questionnaires (14%, n = 10) were less commonly reported. BD management consistently included breathing retraining (94%, n = 68), general exercise and BD education (89%, n = 64). The inclusion of BD assessment and management in musculoskeletal conditions was statistically significantly associated with BD special interest (p < 0.001), NHS equivalent banding (p = 0.034) and post-graduate BD training including self-directed learning, in-service training, online training, formal lectures, short courses and PhD level study (p < 0.001-0.049). Conclusion(s): This is the first survey of BD assessment and management in musculoskeletal conditions and indicates infrequent assessment and management of BD. For physiotherapists who do assess and manage BD, subjective indicators and observation were the most commonly assessed, while breathing retraining was the most frequent management strategy. BD special interest, relevant post-graduate training and NHS equivalent banding were statistically significantly associated with use of BD assessment and management. Impact: Findings will inform future survey design including international surveys comparing findings across a more diverse sample. Qualitative work or use of vignettes could explore rationales regarding the inclusion of BD assessment and management in musculoskeletal practice. Due to the potentially detrimental clinically important reduced respiratory muscle function associated with mechanical ventilation (Lu et al., 2016;Nassar et al., 2018) and COVID-19 illness (Brosnahan et al., 2020), future quantitative research could investigate whether there is an association between COVID-19 and BD or the effect of long COVID on breathing mechanics.

However, official inequality statistics are only available at low frequency and with considerable delay, which challenges policymakers in their objective to mitigate inequality and fine-tune public policies. We show that using data from bank records it is possible to measure economic inequality at high frequency. The approach proposed in this paper allows measuring, timely and accurately, the impact on inequality of fast-unfolding crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying this approach to data from a representative sample of over three million residents of Spain we find that, absent government intervention, inequality would have increased by almost 30% in just one month. The granularity of the data allows analyzing with great detail the sources of the increases in inequality. In the Spanish case we find that it is primarily driven by job losses and wage cuts experienced by low-wage earners. Government support, in particular extended unemployment insurance and benefits for furloughed workers, were generally effective at mitigating the increase in inequality, though less so among young people and foreign-born workers. Therefore, our approach provides knowledge on the evolution of inequality at high frequency, the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the increase of inequality and the subgroups of the population most affected by the changes in inequality.

Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, but relatively little is understood regarding host intrinsic mechanisms that guard against ZIKV. Here, we show that host tripartite motif-containing protein 56 (TRIM56) poses a barrier to ZIKV infection in cells of neural, epithelial and fibroblast origins. Overexpression of TRIM56, but not an E3 ligase-dead mutant or one lacking a short C-terminal portion, inhibited ZIKV RNA replication. Conversely, depletion of TRIM56 increased viral RNA levels. Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology to NHL repeat of TRIM-NHL proteins that regulate miRNA activity, knockout of Dicer, which abolishes production of miRNAs, had no demonstrable effect on ZIKV restriction imposed by TRIM56. Rather, we found that TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with ZIKV RNA in infected cells. Moreover, a recombinant TRIM56 fragment comprising the C-terminal 392 residues captured ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, indicative of direct interaction. Remarkably, deletion of a short C-terminal tail portion abrogated the TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Altogether, our study reveals TRIM56 is an RNA binding protein that acts as a ZIKV restriction factor and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism by which this E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections.","output":"The E3 ligase TRIM56 is a host restriction factor of Zika virus and depends on its RNA-binding activity but not miRNA regulation, for antiviral function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our goal was to summarize recent evidence regarding recurrent urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in different adult populations.

Furthermore, we use a set of complex Benchmark Functions of the Congress on Evolutionary Computation Competition 2017 to compare the results between the original algorithm and the proposed improvement of the algorithm. The fuzzy system is utilized for the dynamic parameter adaptation of the C1 and C2 parameters of the Bird Swarm Algorithm. As a result, the Fuzzy Bird Swarm Algorithm has enhanced exploration and exploitation abilities that help in achieving better results than the Bird Swarm Algorithm. We additionally test the algorithms performance in a real problem in the medical area, using the optimization of a neural network to obtain the risk of developing hypertension. This neural network uses information, such as age, gender, body mass index, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, if the patient smokes and if the patient has parents with hypertension. Hypertension is one of the leading causes of heart problems, which in turn are also one of the top causes of death. Moreover, these days it causes more complications and deaths in people infected with COVID-19, the virus of the ongoing pandemic.

In our work, we present an integrated machine learning framework to efficiently address these hurdles. Methods: First, our framework automatically ranks the importance of features to predict the risk of cardiovascular complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients through ANOVA F-value and Chi-Squared statistics. Second, we benchmark a list of machine learning models, where each model's hyper-parameters are fine-tuned through Grid Search, and the outcome of each model was shown through the average of 5-fold cross-validation. Results: Our study included 683 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Age, history of coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, end-stage renal disease, and heart surgery were ranked to be the top 5 features to predict the risk assessment among 78 features. After benchmarking, Linear Support Vector model showed the best performance with F1 score of 0.78 and AUROC of 0.79. Conclusion: Our automated machine learning framework not only minimizes the manual work of identifying and interpreting clinical correlation amongst numerous features in EMR database, but also delivers a pipeline that preprocesses the data, optimizes, and benchmarks multiple ML models of choice in a single framework.

We performed a retrospective study of COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed at a single academic medical center between March 10, 2020 and October 13, 2020. A total of 835 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction were included (median age 64 years; 52% female). Of these, 46 (5.5%) had a prescription for an immunosuppressive therapy prior to diagnosis, most commonly oral steroids (20, 43%), mycophenolate (12, 26%), or tacrolimus (11, 24%). Patients on immunosuppressive therapy with COVID-19 had increased mortality (30% versus 17%, p=0.036; OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.11-4.04), which remained significant (p=0.040) after performing multivariate logistic regression controlling for gender, age, race, and comorbidity status. Laboratory markers of inflammation were uniformly elevated in both patients on or not on immunosuppressive therapies who died, but lymphocytes and neutrophils were decreased in both COVID-19 patients on immunosuppressive therapies who died and who remained alive.

Methods: A total of 6 059 respiratory specimens, including pharyngeal swab, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates and alveolar lavage fluid, as well as relative clinical data were collected from patients with acute respiratory infections from seven sentinel hospitals during November, 2009 to April, 2016 in Shanghai. Respiratory specimens were tested by RT-PCR with HCoV-conserved primers and subsequently genotyped by DNA sequencing. Using specific primers to amplify and sequence full-length Spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and nucleocapsid (N) gene from HCoV-OC43 positive samples. Further genotype and phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-OC43 were performed by conducting phylogenetic trees. Results: Among 6 059 patients, the total frequency of HCoV was 63 (1.04%), in which HCoV-OC43 was the most frequently detected species with 34 positive samples, followed by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) with 18 and 10 positive sample respectively. However, other HCoV like human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were not been detected, which illustrated that HCoV-OC43 was the dominant subtype. The full-length of S, RDRP and N gene were obtained from 29 HCoV-OC43 positive samples. According to the sequence-analysis, 27 of which was genotype D, 2 of which was genotype B and others genotype, including genotype E, F and G, were not detected. The result indicated that the genotype D may be the dominant genotype. Further analysis of S protein that help HCoV-OC43 to entry host cell and stimulate the host immune system to produce neutralizing antibody found that two important functional domains in S protein, N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) contained more amino acid substitution and positive selection sites, accompanied with amino acid insertion/deletion. 13 positive selection sites were all located in the NTD or RBD, 10 of which were located in the NTD and 3 in the RBD.

We aimed to determine the incidence of chest tube clogging and the role of bedside assessment in identifying the potential for failure to drain. METHODS Data from 150 patients undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass from March to October 2011 were prospectively entered into a database. Chest tubes were visually inspected and functionally assessed at four time intervals (Hours 0, 2-4, 6-8 and at removal), defining need for clearance and presence of partial or complete obstruction. RESULTS Complete data were available for 100 patients. We assessed 234 chest tubes: pericardial (n = 158); pleural (n = 76). The incidence of chest tube clogging for the entire group was 36% (any tube completely clogged at any time), with increased prevalence of clogging observed in urgent and reoperative cases and in those with increased intraoperative blood use. Among 51 tubes resulted to have a thrombus formation observed inside the chest tube at removal, 44 were clogged primarily in the internal portion of the tube, meaning that clogging could not be confirmed by simple bedside inspection of the indwelling tube. CONCLUSIONS The chest tubes can become clogged at any time after their placement. The status of urgency, reoperations and use of blood products can be contributing factors increasing the incidence of chest tube clogging. Clinicians likely underestimate the prevalence of this failure to drain, as most clogging occurs in the internal portion of the tube.","output":"Incidence of chest tube clogging after cardiac surgery: a single-centre prospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Remdesivir is an antiviral drug initially designed against the Ebola virus. The results obtained with it both in biochemical studies in vitro and in cell line assays in vivo were very promising, but it proved to be ineffective in clinical trials. Remdesivir exhibited far better efficacy when repurposed against SARS-CoV-2. The chemistry that accounts for this difference is the subject of this study. Here, we examine the hypothesis that remdesivir monophosphate (RMP)-containing RNA functions as a template at the polymerase site for the second run of RNA synthesis, and as mRNA at the decoding center for protein synthesis. Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that RMP can be incorporated into RNA by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of both viruses, although some of the incorporated RMPs are subsequently removed by exoribonucleases. Furthermore, our hypothesis is consistent with the fact that RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 selects RMP for incorporation over AMP by 3-fold in vitro, and that RMP-added RNA can be rapidly extended, even though primer extension is often paused when the added RMP is translocated at the i + 3 position (with i the nascent base pair at an initial insertion site of RMP) or when the concentrations of the subsequent nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are below their physiological concentrations. These observations have led to the hypothesis that remdesivir might be a delayed chain terminator. However, that hypothesis is challenged under physiological concentrations of NTPs by the observation that approximately three-quarters of RNA products efficiently overrun the pause.","output":"Mechanism of Inhibition of the Reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola Viruses by Remdesivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leaf thickness is an important trait in rice (Oryza sativa L.). It affects both photosynthesis and sink-resource efficiency. However, compared to leaf length and length width, reports seldom focused on leaf thickness due to the complicated measurement and minor difference. To identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) and explore the genetic mechanism regulating the natural variation of leaf thickness, we crossed a high leaf thickness variety Aixiuzhan (AXZ) to a thin leaf thickness variety Yangdao No.6 (YD 6) and evaluated 585 F(2) individuals. We further use bulked sergeant analysis with whole-genome resequencing (BSA-seq) to identify five genomic regions, including chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 10, and 12. These regions represented significant allele frequency differentiation between thick and thin leaf thickness among the mixed pool offspring. Moreover, we conducted a linkage mapping using 276 individuals derived from the F(2) population. We fine-mapped and confirmed that chromosome 9 contributed the primary explanation of phenotypic variance. We fine-mapped the candidate regions and confirmed that the chromosome 9 region contributed to flag leaf thickness in rice. We observed the virtual cellular slices and found that the bundle sheath cells in YD 6 flag leaf veins are fewer than AXZ. We analyzed the potential regions on chromosome 9 and narrowed the QTL candidate intervals in the 928-kb region. Candidate genes of this major QTL were listed as potentially controlled leaf thickness.

There are major concerns that as the total travel demand rises back toward prepandemic levels, the overall transport system capacity with transit constraints will be insufficient for the increasing demand. This paper uses city-level scenario analysis to examine the potential increase in post-COVID-19 car use and the feasibility of shifting to active transportation, based on prepandemic mode shares and varying levels of reduction in transit capacity.

Paralleling the HUT, an online auction determined consumers willingness to pay. The study also explored how the social environment may impact the liking of the meals when a partner of the participants joined the sensory evaluation of the meals. Consumers (n = 50) evaluated microwave-processed jambalaya stored at 2 C and a control (cooked frozen jambalaya stored at ?31 C) after 2, 8 and 12 weeks of storage. Consumer liking of different sensory attributes was measured. Participants could choose to share the meals with a partner as a way to enhance ecological validity. The responses from 21 partners to the sensory-related questions were collected. After the sensory evaluation, the participants bid on the meal they had just sampled. Results showed that processing method (microwave vs. control) did not significantly influence the measured sensory attributes. Only flavor liking decreased over storage time (p < 0.05).

The answer lies in how infected individuals invest into controlling pathogen proliferation and mitigating damage, two strategies respectively called resistance and disease tolerance. Pathogen within-host dynamics (WHD), influenced by resistance, and its connection to host survival, determined by tolerance, decide the infection outcome. To grasp these intricate effects of resistance and tolerance, we used a deterministic theoretical model where pathogens interact with the immune system of a host. The model describes the positive and negative regulation of the immune response, consider the way damage accumulate during the infection and predicts WHD. When chronic, infections stabilize at a Set-Point Pathogen Load (SPPL). Our model predicts that this situation can be transient, the SPPL being then a predictor of life span which depends on initial condition (e.g. inoculum). When stable, the SPPL is rather diagnostic of non lethal chronic infections. In lethal infections, hosts die at a Pathogen Load Upon Death (PLUD) which is almost independent from the initial conditions. As the SPPL, the PLUD is affected by both resistance and tolerance but we demonstrate that it can be used in conjunction with mortality measurement to distinguish the effect of disease tolerance from that of resistance.

We quantitatively and qualitatively examined newspaper advertisements for dietary supplements before and after the COVID-19 spread. DESIGN: Content analysis. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed advertisements for dietary supplements in two major Japanese newspapers in FebruaryCJuly 2019 and FebruaryCJuly 2020. Our analysis covered 2167 advertisements. RESULTS: The number of advertisements for dietary supplements that claimed to be effective in infection prevention (p=0.009) and improving joint (p=0.002) and digestive functions (p=0.002) significantly increased after the spread of COVID-19 compared with before. Dietary supplements that claimed to be effective in preventing infection were advertised in combination with recommendations for gargling and handwashing. Such terms as defence and prevent were used to promote the preventive effect.

In this work we explore their effect on the epidemic growth by investigating an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model in which individual mobility is taken into account. In the model individual agents move on a chessboard with a Lvy walk and, within each square, epidemic spreading follows the standard SIR model. These simple rules allow to reproduce the sub-exponential growth of the epidemic evolution observed during the Covid-19 epidemic waves in several countries and which cannot be captured by the standard SIR model. We show that we can tune the slowing-down of the epidemic spreading by changing the dynamics of the agents from Lvy to Brownian and we investigate how the interplay among different containment strategies mitigate the epidemic spreading. Finally we demonstrate that we can reproduce the epidemic evolution of the first and second COVID-19 waves in Italy using only 3 parameters, i.e , the infection rate, the removing rate, and the mobility in the country. We provide an estimate of the peak reduction due to imposed mobility restrictions, i. e., the so-called flattening the curve effect. Although based on few ingredients, the model captures the kinetic of the epidemic waves, returning mobility values that are consistent with a lock-down intervention during the first wave and milder limitations, associated to a weaker peak reduction, during the second wave.","output":"A single-agent extension of the SIR model describes the impact of mobility restrictions on the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the work was to develop a non-invasive laboratory method for local control of the severity of osteo-destructive processes in the bone tissue of the jaws after dental implantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 75 individuals aged 18 to 65. The main group included 40 patients with a diagnosis of dental periimplantitis (ICD K 10.2). A comparison group (n=20) included patients after dental implantation without postoperative complications. The control group (n=25) consisted of individuals without dental pathology. Cathepsin K (CTSK) (Human) ELISA Kit (Cloud-Clone Corp., USA) was used to determine the concentration of cathepsin K by the enzyme immunoassay in the gingival or peri-implant fluid. RESULTS: The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid in the patients of the control group was 1.70.3 pmol/l, in the comparison group the concentration of the studied biomarker corresponded to 2.30.4 pmol/l. In the main group, the concentration of cathepsin K in the exudate of peri-implantation pockets increased 2.8 times (p<0.05) and corresponded to 4.90.5 pmol/l. The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid normally did not depend on age and gender, which increased the independence of the osteomarker for characterizing the osteoresorbent process in the peri-implantation area. After dental implantation, an excess of cathepsin K concentration above the level of 2.7 pmol/l with a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 83.7% suggests a high risk of developing peri-implantitis.

The framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN feature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused representation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature vectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote regions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states of each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as an input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future timepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the previous temporal CXRs.

We are also interested in how and why the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 could vary across different professional activities, company sites and regions with different epidemiological activity or infection control measures in Germany. We expect the results of this study to contribute to the development of working conditions protecting the health of employees during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An explorative multimodal mixed methods approach will be applied. Module 1 comprises a document analysis of prevailing federal and regional laws and regulations at the respective location of the participating company.

One solution is multiplex ventilation, where a single ventilator supports two patients. Previously proposed scenarios sacrifice volume control for pressure control in the name of safety. However, volume control ventilation, low tidal volumes, high positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) and high respiratory rate are key for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) ventilator management. We offer a proof of concept for an accessible multiplex ventilation model with volume protective settings. METHODS: Using one parent ventilator, two daughter circuits were improved with a 3D-printed splitter fitted with laser-cut mechanical flowmeters. Resistance valves connected to each flowmeter outflow port attach to the inspiratory limb of the daughter circuit. At the patient wye, a Luer lock attaches a dry arterial line transducer and an end-tidal CO2 monitor. A one-way check valve connects each daughter circuit expiratory limb to a T-piece at the expiratory port of the ventilator. Test lungs were used to assess whether lung-protective settings can be maintained and adjusted by measuring plateau and driving pressures with varying lung compliance. RESULTS: The improved sub-circuit flowmeters and valves allowed monitoring and manipulation of flow to correct tidal volume shifts with changes in patient lung compliance. Dry arterial line transducers reliably measured peak pressure, PEEP, stress index and plateau pressure on a GE monitor. One-way valves prevented expiratory gas rebreathing by the more compliant lungs. CONCLUSIONS: We concede that two patients on one ventilator is not a good idea, but as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, resource-poor facilities will run out of good ideas quickly. With our solution, volume control ventilation can be employed, pressures measured, alarms set, and volumes calculated and adjusted for each patient. In the spirit of Roosevelt's call to do what you can, with what you've got, where you are, we submit that this is a relatively low-tech, inexpensive model that allows ARDS settings with just a few simple parts, anywhere in the world.","output":"Desperate measures: An acute respiratory distress syndrome approach to multiplex ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate factors affecting the job search channels (newspapers, agency, informal network, direct contact, internet) of unemployed individuals in Italy using a multivariate probit model. We separately analyse unemployed individuals who lost their job or who are entering the labour market for the first time (i.e., with or without previous job experience, respectively). We use cross-sectional microdata covering the 2014-2018 period. We do not find important differences in the determinants in common between unemployed individuals with and without previous job experience (such as, age, education, and citizenship). The main difference between the two samples is in the composition, with more young people in the latter group (mainly individuals in the school-to-work transition) than in the first one. We find that better-educated unemployed people have more of a multichannel attitude when searching for jobs than their counterparts. Moreover, for unemployed individuals with previous job experience, the characteristics of their last job play a crucial role in influencing the choice of search channel(s). For example, unemployed individuals from high-skilled professions (that typically require the employment of better-educated individuals) choose the internet with a higher probability than other channels, while those from low-skilled professions and with experience in manufacturing have a higher probability of considering employment agencies than those in qualified professions in commercial activities and services. We have assumed that the unobservable factors affecting the decision process of a multichannel job search (estimated through the pairwise correlation coefficients across the residuals of the models) are represented by personality features of an individual, such as motivation, self-control, and preferences.

We used a broad range PCR approach to investigate the presence and diversity of astroviruses in healthy pigs of different ages on 20 farms and in 3 slaughterhouses situated in the province of Quebec, Canada between 2005 and 2007. Our study unexpectedly revealed remarkable levels of genetic diversity and high prevalence of astroviruses in pigs of this province. Astroviruses were detected on every farm investigated and in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to adults. In addition, we found that nearly 80% of healthy finisher pigs harbour astroviruses in their intestine at slaughter. Phylogenetic evidence based on partial polymerase and complete capsid sequences, suggests that porcine astroviruses do not form a monophyletic group but are rather found on separate branches across the mamastrovirus tree. In addition to type species strains, we found highly divergent strains that form two additional lineages, one of which falls outside existing taxonomic groups. The presence of diverse astroviruses in a majority of healthy pigs likely represents a continuous source of infection to piglets and possibly to other animal species including humans. Porcine astrovirus strains appeared phylogenetically related not only to prototypical human astroviruses, as was already known, but also to novel human strains recently discovered suggesting multiple cross species transmission events between these hosts and other animal species.

METHODS A systematic literature review was done for free-text and the MeSH-terms: anorexia nervosa, feeding and eating disorders, and oxytocin. Six publications, reporting from 4 unique clinical trials, were included in this review. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effects of IN-OT on AB towards food images and ER on healthy controls (HC) and patients with AN. RESULTS Overall, IN-OT did not influence AB towards food images (effect size = 0.20 [- 0.16, 0.57], p = 0.28) and had no effect on ER (effect size = - 0.01 [- 0.27, 0.26], p = 0.97) in patients with AN and healthy control (HC) subjects collectively. Assessing HC and AN separately in subgroup analyses did not show any significant effect on AB and ER in neither of the subgroups. All tests were done between 15 and 55 min post-administration of IN-OT, while peak concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid has been determined to be at 75 min. CONCLUSION The current level of evidence is moderate showing no effect of IN-OT on AB or ER in AN.

Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platforms have the potential to overcome these limitations, especially in low-resource countries where ZIKV is endemic. With this in mind, here we optimized and validated our RT-LAMP assay for rapid detection of ZIKV from patient samples. We found that the assay detected ZIKV from diverse sample types (serum, urine, saliva, and semen) in as little as 20 min, without RNA extraction. The RT-LAMP assay was highly specific and up to 100 times more sensitive than RT-qPCR. We then validated the assay using 100 patient serum samples collected from suspected cases of arbovirus infection in the state of Pernambuco, which was at the epicenter of the last Zika epidemic. Analysis of the results, in comparison to RT-qPCR, found that the ZIKV RT-LAMP assay provided sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.75%, and an overall accuracy of 95.00%.

Laboratory tests, including troponin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), are important biomarkers of ASCVD risk. The objective of this study was to investigate patterns of testing for troponin and LDL-C test volumes among Alberta residents during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS A repeated cross-sectional study design captured population-level laboratory test volumes between March 15, 2019 and December 14, 2020. Three-month cross-sections were derived to report laboratory test volumes by different COVID-19 restriction periods during 2020-2021 and using 2019-2020 as a preceding control period. Percent change for troponin and LDL-C test volumes were calculated for both control and COVID-19 periods among adult (18 years of age) Alberta residents, and stratified by age (18-49, 50-65, 66-79, and 80 years), sex, and geographic zones (urban, rural). This preliminary data is part of an ongoing study for which further troponin and LDL-C test volumes will be available up until March 14, 2021 (representing one year of data throughout the COVID-19 pandemic). Among the Alberta population, 292,836 troponin and 794,789 LDL-C tests were captured between March 15, 2020 and December 14, 2020 (Figure 1). Testing patterns during the COVID-19 restriction period showed marked reduction in test volumes from the previous year. The initial cross-section of the COVID-19 period (March-June 2020) was characterized by the largest overall reduction with troponin test volumes decreasing 18% and LDL-C test volumes decreasing 63%, compared to the year prior. As restrictions eased in the summer months of 2020, testing volumes rebounded to near pre-pandemic volumes for both tests. However, in the fall of 2020, troponin tests decreased again (-15%). Within these drops in utilization, slightly larger relative declines were observed for troponin test volumes in women (-20%) and patients 80 years-old (-25%) and for LDL-C test volumes among urban residents (-64%), women (-67%) and patients aged 18-49 (-66%) and 50-65 (-65%) years (Table 1). CONCLUSION This study describes declines in troponin and LDL-C test volumes in the initial and second COVID-19 lockdown periods. Women had overall smaller total troponin and LDL-C test volumes and larger relative declines during the pandemic compared to men. The decrease in these ASCVD-related laboratory test volumes during the pandemic may have been accompanied by other important changes in indicators of healthcare utilization and associated clinical outcomes.

Both acute and chronic cardiovascular impacts have so far been attributed to particulate-mediated oxidative stress in the lung and/or via secondary pathways, including endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. However, increasing evidence indicates the translocation of inhaled nanoparticles to major organs via the circulation. It is essential to identify the composition and intracellular targets of such particles, since these are likely to determine their toxicity and consequent health impacts. Of potential major concern is the abundant presence of iron-rich air pollution nanoparticles, emitted from a range of industry and traffic-related sources. Bioreactive iron can catalyse formation of damaging reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and cell damage or death. Here, we identify for the first time, in situ, that exogenous nanoparticles (15 C 40 nm diameter) within myocardial mitochondria of young, highly-exposed subjects are dominantly iron-rich, and co-associated with other reactive metals including aluminium and titanium. These rounded, electrodense nanoparticles (up to  10 x more abundant than in lower-pollution controls) are located within abnormal myocardial mitochondria (e.g. deformed cristae; ruptured membranes). Measurements of an oxidative stress marker, PrP(C) and an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, GRP78, identify significant ventricular up-regulation in the highly-exposed vs lower-pollution controls. In shape/size/composition, the within-mitochondrial particles are indistinguishable from the iron-rich, combustion- and friction-derived nanoparticles prolific in roadside/urban environments, emitted from traffic/industrial sources. Incursion of myocardial mitochondria by inhaled iron-rich air pollution nanoparticles thus appears associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, and excess formation of reactive oxygen species through the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction. Ventricular oxidative stress, as indicated by PrP(C) and GRP78 up-regulation, is evident even in children/young adults with minimal risk factors and no co-morbidities. These new findings indicate that myocardial iron overload resulting from inhalation of airborne, metal-rich nanoparticles is a plausible and modifiable environmental risk factor for cardiac oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease, on an international scale.","output":"Iron-rich air pollution nanoparticles: an unrecognised environmental risk factor for myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac oxidative stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This infection usually presents with upper respiratory symptoms; however, it can also present with a wide variety of other multisystem and neurological symptoms, including seizures. There are several proposed mechanisms by which COVID-19 can cause systemic signs of infections, including neurological complications and seizures. This case report describes a pediatric patient without a previously documented history of epilepsy who was admitted for new-onset focal seizures with impaired consciousness. No other cause and triggers of seizures were found, and the child was tested positive for COVID-19 infection. The patient had six electroclinical seizures during EEG. Video EEG findings showed atypical features of onset of intermittent rhythmic delta activity (IRDA) slowing over the left hemisphere with evolution/generalization of rhythmic delta/theta activity and without clear typical generalized epileptiform discharges. These EEG findings correlated with a clinical change of behavior arrest, staring, and yawning. Similar spells were reported multiple times a day prior to the admission, and past EEG was normal. A review of current literature on COVID-19 and neurological manifestations in children, including new seizures and prior diagnosis of epilepsy, is also provided in this case report. The clinical experience in children with newly diagnosed or chronic epilepsy suggests that exacerbation of seizures, especially from systemic effects such as those caused by severe COVID-19 infection, will be a major concern.","output":"New-Onset Seizures as an Acute Presentation With Atypical EEG Findings in a Previously Healthy Child With Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has dramatically changed medical practices worldwide.

Here, we report seven cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the perioperative period of lung resection. Retrospective analysis suggested that one patient had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 infection before the surgery and the other six patients contracted the infection after the lung resection. Fever, lymphopenia, and ground-glass opacities revealed on computed tomography are the most common clinical manifestations of the patients who contracted COVID-19 after the lung resection. Pathologic studies of the specimens of these seven patients were performed. Pathologic examination of patient 1, who was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 infection before the surgery, revealed that apart from the tumor, there was a wide range of interstitial inflammation with plasma cell and macrophage infiltration. High density of macrophages and foam cells in the alveolar cavities, but no obvious proliferation of pneumocyte, was found.

All 44 samples were confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test was performed for all patients and all patients developed neutralizing antibodies with altered range. MAIN OUTCOMES: IgG level and its correlation with disease severity, demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, and treatment comparison between mild and severe disease groups. RESULTS: Quantitative SARS COV-2 IgG was significantly higher in moderate and severe disease groups compared with those in the mild disease group. COVID-19 infection was more prevalent in male, Saudi nationals and smokers with comorbidities and higher inflammatory markers are more in the severe group than in the mild group which necessitates more management options to be taken for severe group patients.

Between June and October 2020, the Behavioural Activation in Social IsoLation (BASIL) pilot study investigated the acceptability and feasibility of a remotely delivered brief psychological intervention (Behavioural Activation, BA) to prevent and reduce loneliness and depression in older people with long term conditions (LTCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design An embedded qualitative study was conducted with semi-structured interviews to generate data that was first analysed inductively using thematic analysis and then deductively using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). Setting National Health Service and third sector organisations in England. Participants Sixteen older adults and 9 Support Workers (BSWs) participating in the BASIL pilot trial. Results Older adults and BSWs described a positive affective attitude towards the intervention linked to altruism, however the activity planning aspect of the intervention was limited due to COVID-19 restrictions. The intervention was understood by older adults & BSWs, although less understanding in older adults without low mood. A manageable burden was involved with delivering and participating in the intervention. For ethicality, older adults valued social contact and making changes, BSWs valued being able to observe those changes. Opportunity cost was low for BSWs & older adults. BA was perceived to be useful in the pandemic and likely to achieve its aims, (Perceived Effectiveness) especially if tailored to people with both low mood and LTCs. Self-efficacy developed over time and with experience for both BSWs and older adults. Conclusions Overall, the BASIL pilot study processes and BA intervention were found to be acceptable. Use of the TFA provided valuable insights into how the intervention was experienced and how the acceptability of study processes and the BA intervention could be enhanced ahead of the larger definitive trial (BASIL+).","output":"Acceptability of a behavioural intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 restrictions in older people with long-term conditions: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) following proctocolectomy is the preferred option for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, and familial adenomatous polyposis. However, it remains a procedure associated with morbidity and mortality. Pelvic sepsis, pouch fistulae, and anastomotic dehiscence predispose to pouch failure. We report our experience with an adaptation for the formation of the stapled ileal J pouch using the GIA? 100 stapling device (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts, USA). When creating the J pouch, we remove the bevelled plastic protector from the thin fork of the stapling device, allowing the staple line to be completed to the tip of the stapled efferent limb of the pouch, thereby minimizing potential blind ending in the efferent limb and injury to the transverse staple line. METHODS Patients undergoing elective IPAA at our institution over a 5-year period using this adapted stapling technique for creation of the ileal J pouch were reviewed. Data were collected from a prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease database, theater records, and patient chart review. RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent IPAA using this technique at our institution during the study period. Postoperative morbidity was encountered in 11 of 41 patients including pelvic sepsis, pouch fistulae, anastomotic stricture, or leak. There was no morbidity observed related to a blind efferent limb or transverse staple line disruption. No mortality was observed in this series. CONCLUSION Maximizing the length of the efferent fork of the GIA stapling device can reduce the length of redundant efferent J limb of the ileal J pouch. This may reduce the incidence of torsion, volvulus, distension, fistulae/sinuses, and pelvic sepsis/anastomotic leak following IPAA.","output":"How I do it: the stapled ileal J pouch at restorative proctocolectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immune system is the bodys defense against pathogens, which are complex living organisms found in many parts in the body including organs, tissues, cells, molecules, and proteins. When the immune system works properly, it can recognize and kill the abnormal cells and the infected cells. Otherwise, it can attack the bodys healthy cells even if there is no invader. Many researchers have developed immunotherapy (or cancer vaccines) and have used chemotherapy for cancer treatment that can kill fast-growing cancer cells or at least slow down tumor growth. However, chemotherapy drugs travel throughout the body and tend to kill both healthy cells and cancer cells. In this study, we consider the fact that chemotherapy can kill tumor cells and that the loss of the immune cells may at the same time stir up cancer growth. We present a dynamic time-delay tumor-immune model with the effects of chemotherapy drugs and autoimmune disease. The modeling results can be used to determine the progression of tumor cells in the human body with the effect of chemotherapy, autoimmune diseases, and time delays based on partial differential equations. It can also be used to predict when the tumor viruses free state can be reached as time progresses, as well as the state of the bodys healthy cells as time progresses. We also present a few numerical cases that illustrate that the model can be used to monitor the effects of chemotherapy drug treatment and the growth rate of tumor virus-infected cells and the autoimmune disease.","output":"Mathematical Modeling the Time-Delay Interactions between Tumor Viruses and the Immune System with the Effects of Chemotherapy and Autoimmune Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To compare the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a simulation-based learning (SBL) programme for Junior Doctors virtually versus face to face. METHOD: The Nottinghamshire Healthcare Simulation Centre has been delivering a SBL programme for Foundation Year 2 doctors on behalf of Health Education East Midlands for the past three years. Since face to face teaching was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic the programme was delivered online using the same content and format as for prior cohorts. Feedback questionnaires from 128 face to face participants (F2F) and 133 virtual participants (V) were compared. RESULT: There was a decrease in Likert scale ratings across all domains in the virtual group. This was most apparent when examining the strongly agreed responses: the venue/remote format was suitable for the session 34% decrease, the course length was appropriate 24% decrease, the pace of the course was appropriate 20% decrease, the simulation was helpful and relevant 15% decrease, the content of the course was organised and easy to follow 13% decrease, the learning objectives were met 10% decrease, the presenters were engaging 6% decrease, the trainers were well prepared 3% decrease. The virtual group included responses in the strongly disagree and disagree categories relating to the virtual format, length and pace, which did not occur in any domain for the F2F group. Combining the strongly agree and agree statements also showed a decrease in satisfaction with 72.5% of responses falling into this category for the V group and 88.3% for the F2F group. Fewer participants in the V group would recommend the course to a colleague (98% V vs 99% F2F). CONCLUSION: Providing the SBL programme using an online format was feasible while also being acceptable to most participants. However, participants did not rate this experience as highly as face to face teaching. The largest decreases in satisfaction were in areas related to the virtual format. An interesting finding is that participants rated the pace and length of the online course as less agreeable, despite the content and scheduling being the same as for the face to face group. Based on these findings face to face teaching should resume when practicable. In the meantime, the virtual delivery may be improved if the course length was reduced. Analysis of qualitative feedback may provide insights into why participants did not rate the virtual simulation as highly as the face to face equivalent.","output":"Junior doctors rate online simulation as good enough but not as good as face to face sessions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this essay, the authors analyze the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of inequalities and socio-economic vulnerabilities.

Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute's Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care - conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures.

We describe the integration of small group anatomy and clinical skills sessions to accomplish this. Objective Albany Medical College switched to a completely virtual curriculum during March 2020. However, learning anatomy requires more than just lectures and small group conversations. Both clinical skills and anatomy courses require a hands-on curriculum. Although the lecture portion of these courses can be delivered virtually, the hands-on sessions contribute to the students? ability to see and experience three-dimensional integration. Materials 1). Lectures in both Anatomy and Clinical Skills, 2). 3-D Anatomy modules using the Toltec Virtual Human Dissector platform, 3). Anatomical prosections, 4). Virtual cases, using the SECTRA Table platform, and 5). Clinical Skills sessions with ultrasound demonstrations. Methods In the fall semester of 2020, the first-year class of 145 was randomly divided into 6 groups of about 24 students. During the musculoskeletal theme, there were 8 anatomy lab sessions and 4 clinical skills sessions. On days with corresponding clinical skills sessions, a group of 24 students came to the lab for a one-hour review of the anatomy on prosected specimens and Sectra Table cases. Several structures were tagged in each cadaver and students were provided with a key. This allowed for self-assessment and a chance to apply knowledge gained from lectures and 3-D anatomy directly to real anatomy. Faculty rotated to address questions and to quiz the students on the anatomy topics. Each group spent one hour in the anatomy lab and then immediately rotated to the clinical skills session. The emphasis in the clinical skills portion was the connection between musculoskeletal anatomy and function, along with physical exam maneuvers. Each session began with a demonstration highlighting an aspect of musculoskeletal ultrasound to correlate anatomy with 2-D imaging. Faculty rotated to address questions and provide demonstrations of maneuvers when indicated. Results There were no differences in exam scores when compared to previous classes for either anatomy or physical diagnosis topics. Conclusion Student feedback revealed the correlation of anatomy followed by clinical skills helped them better understand the anatomy and connection to the physical exam without the risks of exposure to large groups of students. Significance The new curriculum demonstrates that we can still teach the material and deliver the content in an effective manner despite the limitations of the COVID pandemic.

We examined whether there is a group of young people who die by suicide without explicit warning signs, and if they indicate risk indirectly, through other suicide risk factors. METHODS Using national mortality data, we identified a three-year UK national case series of deaths by suicide in people aged 10-19. We extracted information on the antecedents of suicide from coroner inquests and other official investigations into these deaths. RESULTS There were 595 suicides by young people between 2014 and 2016. We obtained data for 544 (91%). Around a third (n = 161, 30%) had no known history of suicidal ideas or self-harm. This group also had low rates of other risk factors for suicide, including substance misuse, a mental health diagnosis, recent adverse life events, and of contact with services. LIMITATIONS We relied on information provided to inquests and other investigations: under-reporting, especially on sensitive issues, is likely. Families and other witnesses may have under-reported warning signs that suggest they could have intervened. CONCLUSION Suicide after minimal warning appears to be relatively common in young people.

Patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 showed a higher incidence of anosmia (21/54 [38.9%] vs 28/45 [62.2%], P = .021) and pneumonia (10/54 [18.5%] vs 18/45 [40%], P = .018), headache at onset (32/54 [59.3%] vs 39/45 [86.7%], P = .002), and hospital admission (0/54 [0%] vs 2/45 [11.1%], P = .017). In most cases, the headache appeared simultaneously with other COVID\\\\19 symptoms (57/99, 57.6%). It was bilateral (86/99, 86.9%), frontal or holocranial (34/99, 34.3% each) in location and intense (60/99, 60.6%, reported a visual analog scale [VAS] score 7). A total of 39/99 (39.4%) identified triggers, most commonly fever. The most frequent aggravating factors were physical activity (45/99, 45.5%) and coughing (43/99, 43.4%). Patients showed a propensity toward prostration (41/99, 41.4%), photophobia (29/99, 29.3%), and phonophobia (27/99, 27.3%).

Saudi Arabia is one of the numerous countries that have been economically affected by this pandemic. The objective of this study was to provide real-world data on the health economic burden of COVID-19 on the Saudi health sector and assess the direct medical costs associated with the management of COVID-19. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted based on data collected from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across ten institutions in eight different regions in Saudi Arabia. The study calculated the estimated costs of all cases during the study period by using direct medical costs. These costs included costs directly related to medical services, such as the health care treatment, hospital stays, laboratory investigations, treatment, outcome, and other related care. ResultsA total of 5,286 adult patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study period were included in the study. The average age of the patients was 54 years, and the majority were male. Among the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a general ward, the median hospital length of stay was 5.5 days (mean: 9.18 days), while the ICU stay was 4.26 days (mean: 7.94 days). The total medical costs for general ward and ICU patients were 14,585,640 SAR and 90,776,250 SAR, respectively. The total laboratory investigations ranked as the highest-cost services (22,086,296 SAR), followed by treatment (14,574,233.1 SAR). Overall, the total cost of all medical services for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was 193,394,103.1 SAR.

To our knowledge, this work represents the first centrifugal microdevice for comprehensive preparation of high-purity NAs from raw buccal swab samples. Direct-from-swab cellular lysis was integrated upstream of NA extraction, and automatable laser-controlled on-board microvalving strategies provided the strict spatiotemporal fluidic control required for practical point-of-need use. Solid-phase manipulation during extraction leveraged the application of a bidirectional rotating magnetic field to promote thorough interaction with the sample (e.g., NA capture). We illustrate the broad utility of this technology by establishing downstream compatibility of extracted nucleic acids with three noteworthy assays, namely, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The PCR-readiness of the extracted DNA was confirmed by generating short tandem repeat (STR) profiles following multiplexed amplification. With no changes to assay workflow, viral RNA was successfully extracted from contrived (spiked) SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, confirmed by RT-qPCR. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of the extracted DNA with LAMP-a technique well suited for point-of-need genetic analysis due to minimal hardware requirements and compatibility with colorimetric readout.

The goal for schistosomiasis is to achieve elimination as a public health problem (EPHP) and elimination of transmission (EOT) in 78 and 25 countries (by 2030), respectively. Mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel continues to be the main strategy for control and elimination. However, as there is limited availability of praziquantel, it is important to determine what volume of treatments are required, who should be targeted and how frequently treatment must be administered to eliminate either transmission or morbidity caused by infection in different endemic settings with varied transmission intensities. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this paper, we employ two individual-based stochastic models of schistosomiasis transmission developed independently by the Imperial College London (ICL) and University of Oxford (SCHISTOX) to determine the optimal treatment strategies to achieve EOT. We find that treating school-age children (SAC) only is not sufficient to achieve EOT within a feasible time frame, regardless of the transmission setting and observed ageCintensity of infection profile. Both models show that community-wide treatment is necessary to interrupt transmission in all endemic settings with low, medium and high pristine transmission intensities. CONCLUSIONS: The required MDA coverage level to achieve either transmission or morbidity elimination depends on the prevalence prior to the start of treatment and the burden of infection in adults. The higher the worm burden in adults, the higher the coverage levels required for this age category through community-wide treatment programmes. Therefore, it is important that intensity and prevalence data are collected in each age category, particularly from SAC and adults, so that the correct coverage level can be calculated and administered.

Concern has been raised that single-incision laparoscopy is technically more challenging than conventional laparoscopy. This study researched the performance curves of novice trainees for single-incision laparoscopy (SILS) versus conventional laparoscopy for performing two basic tasks on a box trainer. METHODS In this study, 20 novice participants performed two tasks (peg transfer and a dissection task) on a standard box trainer. All the participants practiced each task 11 times and were randomized in two groups. The first group performed the tasks on a box trainer through three incisions. The second group used a single-incision access with the same box trainer. The assessment scores for errors and time were recorded. The 2nd, 8th, and 11th runs of both tasks in both settings were assessed to objectify the gain in basic laparoscopic skills. RESULTS The performance curves for both groups improved significantly in terms of both time and errors in performing the two tasks [P < 0.01, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. For the first task, no significant difference in time between the two groups was observed at the top of the performance curve (mean, 212  64 vs. 182  48 s), but the SILS group performed with fewer errors (1.3  1.5 vs. 2.7  2.11). However, the difference was not significant (P = 0.10). The dissection task was performed faster in the SILS group (mean, 205  78 vs. 243  40 s; P = 0, 18) with fewer errors (0.7  1.05 vs. 1.9  2.1; P = 0. 12), but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION This study showed a significant improvement in basic skills for both the SILS and conventional laparoscopy settings after 11 repetitions. These data suggest that box training shows no significant difference between conventional laparoscopic and single-incision laparoscopic settings in terms of error or time in performing basic tasks at a low complexity level for the novice.

Dendrogram analysis of yeast ICT1, CGI-58, and At4g24160 placed these three polypeptides in the same group. Here, we describe and characterize At4g24160 as, to our knowledge, the first soluble lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase in plants. A lipidomics approach revealed that At4g24160 has additional triacylglycerol lipase and phosphatidylcholine hydrolyzing enzymatic activities. These data establish At4g24160, a protein with a previously unknown function, as an enzyme that might play a pivotal role in maintaining the lipid homeostasis in plants by regulating both phospholipid and neutral lipid levels.","output":"At4g24160, a soluble acyl-coenzyme A-dependent lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 inflammation is a complex immune response and primary mechanism for several common allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. It is the predominant type of immune response against helminths to prevent their tissue infiltration and induce their expulsion. Recent studies suggest that epithelial barrier dysfunction contributes to the development of type 2 inflammation in asthma, which may partly explain the increasing prevalence of asthma in China and around the globe. The epithelial barrier hypothesis has recently been proposed and has received great interest from the scientific community. The development of leaky epithelial barriers leads to microbial dysbiosis and the translocation of bacteria to inter- and sub-epithelial areas and the development of epithelial tissue inflammation. Accordingly, preventing the impairment and promoting the restoration of a deteriorated airway epithelial barrier represents a promising strategy for the treatment of asthma. This review introduces the interaction between type 2 inflammation and the airway epithelial barrier in asthma, the structure and molecular composition of the airway epithelial barrier, and the assessment of epithelial barrier integrity. The role of airway epithelial barrier disruption in the pathogenesis of asthma will be discussed. In addition, the possible mechanisms underlying the airway epithelial barrier dysfunction induced by allergens and environmental pollutants, and current treatments to restore the airway epithelial barrier are reviewed.","output":"Involvement and therapeutic implications of airway epithelial barrier dysfunction in type 2 inflammation of asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracting information and discovering patterns from a massive dataset is a hard task.

The aim of this paper is to analyze how coronavirus contamination has evolved in Brazil applying unsupervised analysis algorithms to extract information and find characteristics between them. To achieve this goal we describe an implementation that uses data about Covid-19 spread in Brazilian states (26 states and the federal district), applying a Time Series Clustering technique based on a K-Means variation, using Dynamic Time Warping as a similarity metric. We used data reported by the Ministry of Health in Brazil, referring to deaths per 100k inhabitants, during 452 days from the first reported death in each state. Two analyzes were performed, one considering 3 clusters and the other with 6 clusters. Through these analysis, 3 patterns of responses to the pandemic can be observed, ranging from one of greater to lesser control of the pandemic, although in recent months all clusters showed a highly increase in the number of deaths. The identification of these patterns is important to highlight possible actions and events, as well as other characteristics that determine the correct or incorrect public decision-making in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Unsupervised analysis of COVID-19 pandemic evolution in brazilian states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Low intelligence has been shown to be associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease in observational studies.

The possibility of using miRNA (mRNA-inhibiting RNA) to inhibit infections caused by the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV has been shown. Methods: : The MirTarget program determines the following characteristics of interaction between miRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs): the start of the miRNA binding site on the mRNA;the locations of the miRNA binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR), 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), or coding sequence (CDS);the interaction free energy (?G, kJ/mole);and nucleotide interaction schemes between miRNAs and mRNAs. Results: : Using bioinformatics approaches, completely complementary miRNA (cc-miRNA) complexes were predicted to be able to bind and inhibit the translation of coronavirus proteins and the replication of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV genomes. For complexes of seven completely complementary miRNA of SARS-CoV-2 (cc-miRc), seven completely complementary miRNA of SARS-CoV (cc-miRs), and eight completely complementary miRNA of MERS-CoV (cc-miRm), the interactions with the RNA genomes (gRNAs) of the corresponding coronaviruses was evaluated. The free energy of the interactions of cc-miRNAs with binding sites was significantly higher than the free energy of the interactions with other regions in gRNA, which ensures high selectivity of the binding of cc-miRNAs. Weak binding of cc-miRNAs to the mRNAs of 17508 human genes was shown, which suggests the absence of side effects of the cc-miRNAs in humans. A feature of this method is the simultaneous inhibition of translation and replication by several cc-miRNAs binding from the 5' end to the 3' end of gRNA. Conclusion: The use of several cc-miRNAs to suppress infections allows each of them to be used at a lower concentration to avoid side effects when one cc-miRNA is introduced into humans at a high concentration.","output":"The miRNA COMPLEXES AGAINST CORONAVIRUSES SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, COVID-19 spread around the world and a number of epidemic protection robot products have emerged with outstanding applications.

However, data on hospitalized pregnant women show that the symptom profile and risk factors for severe disease are similar to those among women who are not pregnant, although preterm birth, Cesarean delivery, and stillbirth may be more frequent and vertical transmission is possible. Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18C44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America. STUDY DESIGN: This observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community. Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects. RESULTS: Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity. Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, comorbidities such as lung disease and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Pregnant women with pre-existing conditions require careful monitoring for the evolution of their symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in pregnant women: characterization of symptoms and syndromes predictive of disease and severity through real-time, remote participatory epidemiology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports of a cluster of people with pneumonia of unknown etiology surfaced in Wuhan City, China, on December 31, 2019.

METHODS We enrolled patients having major non-cardiac surgery who were 40 yr old and had an ASA physical status IV. In a three-way factorial design, patients were randomized to perioperative i.v. dexamethasone (a total of 14 mg tapered over 3 days) vs placebo, intensive vs conventional glucose control 80-110 vs 180-200 mg dl(-1), and lighter vs deeper anaesthesia (bispectral index target of 55 vs 35). The primary outcome was a collapsed composite of 15 major complications and 30 day mortality. Plasma high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was measured before operation and on the first and second postoperative days. RESULTS The overall incidence of the primary outcome was about 20%.

We propose four key focuses to understand the reasons for COVID-19 responses: social policies to crisis management as well as recovery, regime type (democracy or autocracy), formal political institutions (federalism, presidentialism), and state capacity (control over health care systems and public administration). A research agenda to address the COVID-19 pandemic that takes politics as a serious focus can enable the development of more realistic, sustainable interventions in policies and shape our broader understanding of the politics of public health.","output":"The comparative politics of COVID-19: The need to understand government responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been particularly severe on older people. Past coronavirus epidemics namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have also been severe on older people. These epidemics lasted for only a limited period, however, and have proven short lived in the memories of both the public and public health systems. No lessons were learnt to mitigate the impact of future epidemics of such nature, on older people. This complacency we feel has claimed the lives of many older people during the current COVID-19 global epidemic. The nature of risks associated with acquiring infections and associated mortality among older people in respiratory epidemic situations are varied and of serious concern. Our commentary identifies demographic, biological, behavioural, social and healthcare-related determinants, which increase the vulnerability of older people to respiratory epidemics. We acknowledge that these determinants will likely vary between older people in high- and low-middle income countries. Notwithstanding these variations, we call for urgent action to mitigate the impact of epidemics on older people and preserve their health and dignity. Intersectoral programmes that recognise the special needs of older people and in unique contexts such as care homes must be developed and implemented, with the full participation and agreement of older people. COVID-19 has created upheaval, challenging humanity and threatening the lives, rights, and well-being of older people.

Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) are the primary pathogens. We compared otitis media outcomes in infants randomised to either a combination of Synflorix? (PHiD-CV10, with protein D of NTHi) and Prevenar13? (PCV13, with 3, 6A, and 19A), with recommended schedules for each vaccine alone. We previously reported superior broader overall immunogenicity of the combination schedule at 7 months, and early superiority of PHiD-CV10 compared to PCV13 at 4 months. METHODS: In an open-label superiority trial, we randomised (1:1:1) Aboriginal infants at 28 to 38 days of age, to either Prevenar13? (P) at 2C4-6 months (_PPP), Synflorix? (S) at 2C4-6 months (_SSS), or Synflorix? at 1C2-4 months plus Prevenar13? at 6 months (SSSP). Ears were assessed using tympanometry at 1 and 2 months, combined with otoscopy at 4, 6, and 7 months. A worst ear diagnosis was made for each child visit according to a severity hierarchy of normal, otitis media with effusion (OME), acute otitis media without perforation (AOMwoP), AOM with perforation (AOMwiP), and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). RESULTS: Between September 2011 and September 2017, 425 infants were allocated to _PPP(143), _SSS(141) or SSSP(141). Ear assessments were successful in 96% scheduled visits. At 7 months prevalence of any OM was 91, 86, and 90% in the _PPP, _SSS, and SSSP groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in prevalence of any form of otitis media between vaccine groups at any age. Combined group prevalence of any OM was 43, 57, 82, 87, and 89% at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 months of age, respectively. Of 388 infants with ear assessments at 4, 6 and 7 months, 277 (71.4%) had OM that met criteria for specialist referral; rAOM, pOME, or CSOM. CONCLUSIONS: Despite superior broader overall immunogenicity of the combination schedule at 7 months, and early superiority of PHiD-CV10 compared to PCV13 at 4 months, there were no significant differences in prevalence of otitis media nor healthy ears throughout the first months of life.

The edge-vial-effect has been attributed to radiation coming from the chamber wall. We could show that the neighbor vial has a dominant impact on product temperature during lyophilization. Depending on the number of neighbors as well as the distance to a neighbor vial, the neighbor vial exerts a remarkable cooling effect. Energy transfer by gas conduction enables the cooling effect of a neighboring vial over a distance up to 10 mm. This not only leads to prolonged primary drying but also impacts cake appearance.

Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that accelerates carbonic acid formation. We hypothesized that preoperative administration of acetazolamide would decrease postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent laparoscopic preperitoneal inguinal herniorrhaphy at the Medical College of Wisconsin between October 2012 and September 2014. Beginning in January 2014, patients began receiving 250 mg of acetazolamide preoperatively; patients prior to that time did not. The visual analog scale (range 0-10) was used to assess both preoperative pain and postoperative pain. RESULTS A total of 66 patients underwent laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy during the study interval. Of these, 22 (33 %) patients received acetazolamide preoperatively, and 44 (67 %) were included as controls. Overall mean pain scores were lower in the acetazolamide group (1.9  1.45 vs 2.9  1.5, p = 0.04). Specifically, patients who received acetazolamide reported lower pain scores immediately after surgery (0.6  1.2 vs 1.9  2.3, p = 0.01) and on post-op day one (2.3  0.9 vs 4.0  2.1, p = 0.04). Total morphine equivalents administered to manage postoperative pain were significantly less for the acetazolamide group (4.3  4.8 mg) when compared to the control group (8.9  8.4 mg), p = 0.04. Perioperative complications did not differ between the groups (p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS Acetazolamide appears to reduce pain in the immediate postoperative setting.

METHODS Dural defects 1.5 cm in diameter were created in 12 canines and repaired with one of two commercially available duraplasty onlay products. In six animals, hydrogel was applied onto the dural onlays, and the other six animals underwent duraplasty only. Before bone flap replacement, watertight closure was assessed. Before the animals were killed, the craniotomy was reopened, adhesions were rated by a neurosurgeon blinded to the treatment groups, and dural integrity was assessed using pressure testing. RESULTS The animals that received the hydrogel sealant in addition to the duraplasty withstood intraoperative Valsalva maneuvers up to 20 cm H2O without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. The duraplasty-only animals leaked CSF at spontaneous pressures (p = 0.0022). Postoperatively, all six duraplasty-only dogs developed CSF subcutaneous accumulations, compared with only one (16.7%) dog who underwent hydrogel application (p = 0.0152). At the time of harvesting (8 weeks after implantation), duraplasty-only dogs had extensive scarring between the bone flap and the dura mater (median adhesion score 4, range 3-4). The animals receiving hydrogel showed minimal scarring (median adhesion score 0.5, range 0-2). In hydrogel-treated dogs, the mean adhesion score was 82.6% lower than the scores in duraplasty-only animals (p = 0.0043). In animals receiving hydrogel, the mean dural leak pressure was 56.8 +/- 2.5 cm H2O compared with 9.8 +/- 3.8 cm H2O in duraplasty-only dogs (p = 0.0392). Application of the hydrogel was not associated with neurotoxicity, delayed healing, degenerative changes, or increased dura-cortex adhesions. CONCLUSIONS The hydrogel sealant applied to collagen-based dural grafts significantly reduced CSF leakage and functioned as an adhesion barrier. Such technology could be an important tool for cranial surgery.","output":"Application of a hydrogel sealant improves watertight closures of duraplasty onlay grafts in a canine craniotomy model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of infectious diseases generate outbreaks of scientific evidence. In 2016 epidemics of Zika virus emerged, and in 2020, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared patterns of scientific publications for the two infections to analyse the evolution of the evidence. METHODS: We annotated publications on Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 that we collected using living evidence databases according to study design. We used descriptive statistics to categorise and compare study designs over time. RESULTS: We found 2286 publications about Zika virus in 2016 and 21,990 about SARS-CoV-2 up to 24 May 2020, of which we analysed a random sample of 5294 (24%). For both infections, there were more epidemiological than laboratory science studies. Amongst epidemiological studies for both infections, case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies emerged first, cohort and case-control studies were published later. Trials were the last to emerge. The number of preprints was much higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus.

Evidence for decision frameworks may be of particular value in a pandemic setting where time frames are restricted, uncertainties are ubiquitous and the evidence base is changing rapidly. The objective was to develop a framework to evaluate the utility of COVID-19 online forward triage tools. The development of the online forward triage tool utility framework was conducted in three phases. The process was guided by the socio-ecological framework for adherence that states that patient (individual), societal and broader structural factors affect adherence to the tool. In a further step, pragmatic incorporation of themes on the utility of online forward triage tools that emerged from our study as well as from the literature was performed. Seven criteria emerged; tool accessibility, reliability as an information source, medical decision-making aid, allaying fear and anxiety, health system burden reduction, onward forward transmission reduction and systems thinking (usefulness in capacity building, planning and resource allocation, e.g., tests and personal protective equipment). This framework is intended to be a starting point and a generic tool that can be adapted to other online forward triage tools beyond COVID-19.

Why should individuals of two different species cooperate? In this case, as in all others, cooperation is not automatic, but rather requires the mediation of evolutionary conflicts. In chemiosmosis, redox reactions produce a trans-membrane \\"proton-motive force\\" that powers energy-requiring reactions in most organisms. Chemiosmosis may also have a role in conflict mediation. Chemiosmosis rapidly produces considerable amounts of products, increasing the risk of end-product inhibition and the formation of dangerous by-products, such as reactive oxygen species. While several mechanisms can modulate chemiosmosis, potential negative effects can also be ameliorated by simply dispersing excess product into the environment. This \\"free lunch you are forced to make\\" can attract individuals of other species leading to groups, in which other organisms share the products that are released into the environment by the chemiosmotic cell or organism. Since the time of Darwin, evolutionary biology has recognized that groups are the key to the evolution of cooperation. With many small groups, chance associations of cooperators can arise, even if cooperation is selected against at the individual level. Groups of cooperators can then outcompete groups of defectors, which do not cooperate. Indeed, numerous symbioses may have arisen in this way, perhaps most notably the symbioses of host cells and chemiosmotic bacteria that gave rise to the eukaryotic cell. Other examples in which one partner relies on chemiosmotic products supplied by the other include lichens, corals or other metazoans and dinoflagellates, sap-feeding insects, and plant-rhizobia and plant-mycorrhiza interactions. More problematic are cases of gut microbiomes-for instance, those of termites, ruminants, and even human beings. Under some but not all circumstances, chemiosmosis can be co-opted into punishing defectors and enforcing cooperation, thus leading to mutualistic symbioses.","output":"Chemiosmosis, Evolutionary Conflict, and Eukaryotic Symbiosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 research datasets are crucial for analyzing research dynamics.

In this study, we presented a new network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14 selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic similarity (i.e., SARS), comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular diseases), or for their association to drugs tentatively repurposed to treat COVID-19 (e.g., malaria, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis). Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19 treatments (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, heparin), as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir), actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-IFN?3, anti-TNF&#945;, anti-IL12, anti-IL1?, anti-IL6), and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect against human coronavirus infections.","output":"SAveRUNNER: A network-based algorithm for drug repurposing and its application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report key epidemiologic parameter estimates for coronavirus disease identified in peer-reviewed publications, preprint articles, and online reports.

The ability of coronaviruses to rapidly evolve, adapt, and cross species barriers makes the development of effective and durable therapeutic strategies a challenging and urgent need. As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of functionally conserved structural elements within coronavirus RNA genomes have been identified to date. Here, we performed RNA structure probing by SHAPE-MaP to obtain a single-base resolution secondary structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome. The SHAPE-MaP probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5 UTR, ribosomal frameshifting element, and 3 UTR), and reveal new structures. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of highly-structured regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowed for the identification of several putative druggable pockets. Furthermore, 8% of the identified structure elements show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role. In addition, we identify a set of persistently single-stranded regions having high sequence conservation, suitable for the development of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.

This retrospective cohort study aims to evaluate the clinical and virologic outcomes associated with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use in COVID-19 patients during a pandemic wave dominated by the Omicron BA.2 variant. Methods We analyzed data from a territory-wide retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 26th February 2022 to 26th April 2022 in Hong Kong. Oral antiviral users were matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a ratio of 1:4. Study outcomes were a composite outcome of disease progression (all-cause mortality, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], or intensive care unit admission) and their individual outcomes, and lower viral load of cycle threshold (Ct) value []30 cycles. Hazard ratios (HR) of event outcomes were estimated using Cox regression models. Results Among 40,776 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection over a mean follow-up of 41.3 days with 925,713 person-days, 2,359 and 1,000 patients not initially requiring oxygen therapy were initiated with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, respectively. The crude incidence rates of all-cause mortality and IMV were 22.24 and 1.06 events per 10,000 person-days among molnupiravir users, 11.04 and 1.75 events per 10,000 person-days among nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users. Oral antiviral use was associated with a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome of disease progression (molnupiravir: HR=0.53, 95%CI=0.46-0.62, p<0.001; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir: HR=0.33, 95%CI=0.24-0.46, p<0.001) than non-use, which was consistently observed for all-cause mortality (molnupiravir: HR=0.55, 95%CI=0.47-0.63, p<0.001; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir: HR=0.32, 95%CI=0.23-0.45, p<0.001). Molnupiravir users had lower risks of IMV (HR=0.31, 95%CI=0.16-0.61, p<0.001). Time to achieving lower viral load was significantly shorter among oral antiviral users than matched controls (molnupiravir: HR=1.21, 95%CI=1.07-1.37, p=0.002; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir: HR=1.25, 95%CI=1.04-1.50, p=0.015). Amongst survivors, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had shorter length of hospital stay (-0.70 days, 95%CI=-1.37 to -0.04, p=0.039) than matched controls. Head-to-head comparison of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reported higher risk of mortality (HR=1.53 95%CI=1.01-2.31, p=0.047) and longer length of hospital stay (0.83 days, 95%CI=0.07-1.58, p=0.032) for molnupiravir users.

This study aimed to determine the association between skeletal muscle depletion and clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients with severe COVID-19 who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scan on admission were included in this multicentre, retrospective study. Paraspinal muscle index (PMI) and radiodensity (PMD) were measured using CT images. The primary composite outcome was the occurrence of critical illness (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or intensive care unit admission) or death, and the secondary outcomes were the duration of viral shedding and pulmonary fibrosis in the early rehabilitation phase. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the associations. RESULTS: The primary composite outcome occurred in 48 (41.4%) patients, who were older and had lower PMD (both P < 0.05). Higher PMD was associated with reduced risk of critical illness or death in a fully adjusted model overall (OR per SD increment: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95; P = 0.002) and in female patients (OR per SD increment: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56-0.91; P = 0.006), although the effect was not statistically significant in male patients (P = 0.202). Higher PMD (HR per SD increment: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14; P = 0.008) was associated with shorter duration of viral shedding among female survivors. However, no significant association was found between PMD and pulmonary fibrosis in the early rehabilitation phase, or between PMI and any outcome in both men and women. CONCLUSION: Higher PMD, a proxy measure of lower muscle fat deposition, was associated with a reduced risk of disease deterioration and decreased likelihood of prolonged viral shedding among female patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Association of Paraspinal Muscle Measurements on Chest Computed Tomography with Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the genomic diversity and geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in South America.

Current guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for VTE prophylaxis in orthopaedic trauma patients. However, emerging literature in total joint arthroplasty patients suggests the potential clinical benefits of VTE prophylaxis with aspirin. The primary aim of this trial is to compare aspirin with LMWH as a thromboprophylaxis in fracture patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PREVENT CLOT is a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic trial that aims to enrol 12 200 adult patients admitted to 1 of 21 participating centres with an operative extremity fracture, or any pelvis or acetabular fracture. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality. We will evaluate non-inferiority by testing whether the intention-to-treat difference in the probability of dying within 90 days of randomisation between aspirin and LMWH is less than our non-inferiority margin of 0.75%. Secondary efficacy outcomes include cause-specific mortality, non-fatal PE and deep vein thrombosis. Safety outcomes include bleeding complications, wound complications and deep surgical site infections. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The PREVENT CLOT trial has been approved by the ethics board at the coordinating centre (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) and all participating sites. Recruitment began in April 2017 and will continue through 2021. As both study medications are currently in clinical use for VTE prophylaxis for orthopaedic trauma patients, the findings of this trial can be easily adopted into clinical practice.

Indeed, critically ill patients show an impaired type I IFN response accompanied by elevated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, responsible for cell and tissue damage and associated multi-organ failure. Here, the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells was investigated by interrogating an in vitro human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based experimental model. We found that, even in absence of a productive viral replication, the virus mediates a vigorous TLR7/8-dependent production of both type I and III IFNs and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, known to contribute to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Interestingly, we observed how virus-induced type I IFN secreted by PBMC enhances anti-viral response in infected lung epithelial cells, thus, inhibiting viral replication. This type I IFN was released by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) via an ACE-2-indipendent but Neuropilin-1-dependent mechanism. Viral sensing regulates pDC phenotype by inducing cell surface expression of PD-L1 marker, a feature of type I IFN producing cells. Coherently to what observed in vitro, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects displayed a similar pDC phenotype associated to a very high serum type I IFN level and induction of anti-viral IFN-stimulated genes in PBMC. Conversely, hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 display very low frequency of circulating pDC with an inflammatory phenotype and high levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. This study further shed light on the early events resulting from the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells occurring in vitro and confirmed ex vivo. These observations can improve our understanding on the contribution of pDC/type I IFN axis in the regulation of the anti-viral state in asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Differential plasmacytoid dendritic cell phenotype and type I Interferon response in asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The \\"bench to bedside\\" (BTB) paradigm of translational medicine (TM) assumes that medical progress emanates from basic science discoveries transforming clinical therapeutic models.

DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with asthma, rhinitis, and several viruses. We examined associations of asthma/rhinitis with DNAm at CpGs located on coronavirus related genes, and if these associations were sex-specific. METHODS: In total, n = 242 subjects aged 26 years from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort were included in the study. Linear regressions were used to examine sex specific and non-specific associations of DNAm at CpGs on coronavirus related genes with asthma/rhinitis status. Associations of DNAm with gene expression in blood were assessed for functional relevance of identified CpGs. RESULTS: Statistically significant interaction effects of asthma or rhinitis with sex were identified at 40 CpGs for asthma and 27 CpGs for rhinitis. At 21 CpGs, DNAm was associated with asthma, and at 45 CpGs with rhinitis, regardless of sex. Assessment of functional relevance of the identified CpGs indicated a potential of epigenetic regulatory functionality on gene activity at 14 CpGs for asthma and 17 CpGs for rhinitis, and of those 6 CpGs for asthma and 7 CpGs for rhinitis were likely to be sex-specific. CONCLUSION: Subjects with asthma/rhinitis may have altered susceptibility to COVID-19 due to changes in their DNAm associated with these conditions.

It is the comparative analysis of information management during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, the United Kingdom and Italy. From the theoretical approach, the crisis management usually deals with two main models. The first one is defined as the post-reactive model, which is based on reacting to events after the first symptoms of the crisis and the communication model remains the top-down process. The second one is described as the pro-reactive model, which is based on building a dialogue space with the participatory community and it is the bottom-up communication process. In this case, the community becomes an active partner in bridging the crisis. The main goal of the proposed article is to examine the ways in which digital media influences the quality of strategic communication management in local public spaces and what type of crisis management strategy is applied to each political culture. The article discusses the pros and cons of information distributed through digital platforms by both the media and public institutions in terms of community awareness and crisis governance. The article applies a mixed method approach, which includes content analysis (media and governmental digital services), interviews (with the authorities members and media representatives) and social media network analysis (mainly Facebook). The analysis has been ongoing since the beginning of the pandemic in Europe (MarchCSeptember 2020). The research has demonstrated that the shape and distribution of information during the pandemic were of great importance for the quality of information strategy activities. The problem was noticeable disinformation at all levels, which was the result of a lack of control over the message and the pursuit of sensation or conspiracy. It was clearly observed that without the support of crisis communication during the pandemic by the media, mainly digital platforms, it would be impossible to implement it. In all three countries, social media was the information management centre in the COVID-19 era, but the activity of individual municipalities was slightly different. As far as the urbanized and semi-urbanized level is concerned, some consistency can be observed. In all three cases, communication on social media platforms was conducted very intensively and with the use of various tools (texts, statistics, instructional videos, scientific articles, infographics, etc.).

Self-efficacy in caring is an essential attribute of care workers to develop a positive attitude towards their clients, improve work performance, and enhance job satisfaction. Care workers' self-efficacy may vary according to the context in which the care is being provided. Aged care is a multidimensional and challenging setting, and characteristics of aged care services are different from those of acute care services. The objective of this review is to give an overview of the self-efficacy of residential aged care workers in caring for older people and factors influencing their self-efficacy. METHODS The protocol for this review is based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual for Scoping Review. A systematic search of the literature on electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AgeLine, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global will be carried out using predefined search terms to identify relevant studies. This review will include studies that examined the self-efficacy of direct care workers in caring for older people living in residential aged care facilities. All primary studies irrespective of the study design will be included. Studies conducted to develop measures or studies with informal care workers or students as study participants will not be considered. Two reviewers will independently conduct title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data charting.

Wastewater-based surveillance for COVID-19 is still in its infancy. In particular, the quantitative link between clinical cases observed through traditional surveillance and the signals from viral concentrations in wastewater is still developing and hampers interpretation of the data and actionable public-health decisions. We present a modelling framework that includes both SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles in the sewage system after faecal shedding by infected persons in the population. Using our mechanistic representation of the combined clinical/wastewater system, we perform exploratory simulations to quantify the effect of surveillance effectiveness, public-health interventions and vaccination on the discordance between clinical and wastewater signals. We also apply our model to surveillance data from three Canadian cities to provide wastewater-informed estimates for the actual prevalence, the effective reproduction number and incidence forecasts. We find that wastewater-based surveillance, paired with this model, can complement clinical surveillance by supporting the estimation of key epidemiological metrics and hence better triangulate the state of an epidemic using this alternative data source.","output":"A Wastewater-Based Epidemic Model for SARS-CoV-2 with Application to Three Canadian Cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan turned into a public health emergency of international concern.

Grocery shopping presents increased potential for COVID-19 infection because customers and store employees are in proximity to each other. This study investigated shoppers perceptions of COVID-19 infection risks and put them in context by comparing grocery shopping to other activities outside home, and examined whether a proactive preventive action by grocery stores influence shoppers perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Our data were obtained via an anonymous online survey distributed between April 2 and 10, 2020 to grocery shoppers in New York State (the most affected by the pandemic at the time of the study) and Washington State (the first affected by the pandemic). We found significant factors associated with high levels of risk perception on grocery shoppers. We identified some effective preventive actions that grocery stores implement to alleviate anxiety and risk perception. We found that people are generally more concerned about in-store grocery shopping relative to other out-of-home activities. Findings suggest that a strict policy requiring grocery store employees to use facemasks and gloves greatly reduced shoppers perceived risk rating of infection of themselves by 37.5% and store employees by 51.2%.

However, there is limited experience in Asia, where the hospital is traditionally seen as a safe and trusted space for healing. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore attitudes and perceptions among patients and caregivers in Singapore toward this care model. Methods: A quantitative study design was adopted to collect data among patients and their caregivers from medical wards within two acute hospitals in Singapore. Using a series of closed-ended and open-ended questions, the investigator-administered survey aimed to explore barriers and facilitators determining patients' and caregivers' responses. The study questionnaire was pretested and validated. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression was performed to determine key factors influencing patients' decisions to enrol in such programmes. Results: Survey responses were collected from 120 participants (101 patients, 19 caregivers; response rate: 76%), of which 87 respondents (72.5%) expressed willingness to try HaH if offered. Many respondents valued non-quantifiable programme benefits, including perceived gains in quality of life. Among them, reasons cited for acceptance included preference for the comfort of their home environment, presence of family members, and confidence toward remote monitoring modalities. Among respondents who were unwilling to accept HaH, a common reason indicated was stronger confidence toward hospital care. Discussion: Most patients surveyed were open to having acute care delivered in their home environment, and concerns expressed may largely be addressed by operational considerations.

In this cross-sectional and representative study of the adult population of Norway, findings suggest that information gathered through newspapers and social media are the information pathways with the strongest association to symptoms of anxiety, depression and health anxiety with small to medium effect sizes. However, avoiding information about the pandemic had larger effect sizes related to symptoms of psychopathology than acquiring information about the pandemic from any source. The results suggest that to reach those who avoid pandemic news is an important goal, both to ensure the population as a whole gets relevant information regarding current viral mitigation protocols, that may in turn alleviate stress, and thus reduce the likelihood of viral transmission.

From a 1-min questionnaire in 5 locations in Lisbons existing cycling lanes, we aimed to collect (n = 493) revealed preferences on cycling frequency before and after the lockdown, which we used to calibrate a weighted multinomial logit model to analyze respondents probability of increasing, maintaining, or decreasing their cycling frequency. Results suggest that people tended to cycle more often after the lockdown than before. For every five cyclists, two cycled more frequently while two others maintained their cycling frequency. Most cycling trips were recreational or to exercise, and these increased after the lockdown, while trips for work and school decreased, as expected. Moreover, the lower the individuals cycling frequency levels before the lockdown, the more they cycled after it. Our study diagnoses the impact of the lockdown on cycling habits, indicating an overall propensity to cycling more by the Lisbon citizens. Hence, authorities need to act and make quick infrastructural changes (e.g., pop-up cycling lanes) and encourage the population to use more bikes (e.g., financial incentives for bike purchases).","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the behavior change of cyclists in Lisbon, using multinomial logit regression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Display omitted] ?

At present, there are many ways to prevent fogging by adjusting surface wettability. However, the mechanical properties of most super-hydrophilic antifogging coatings are poor, easy to lose their antifogging properties when encountering fingers or cloth friction. To address this issue, the Konjac Glucomannan was cross-linked with water-soluble silicone fluid to form a binder, then being combined with the modified Ecokimera to prepare an eco-friendly super-hydrophilic coating that possessed excellent super-hydrophilicity, and the water contact angle (WCA) was 2.51  1. In addition, the WCA is still about 5 after 180 times of antifogging tests. The friction resistance of the coating was as high as 24 m. Moreover, the light transmittance was only reduced by 3%. Besides, they also had the excellent self-cleaning property. After being stored in the laboratory environment for 90 days, it can still maintain the hydrophilic property (WCA is about 5).

The highest proportion of E. coli isolation was obtained from chicken cloacal swabs with 71.05% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.69-75.05%) followed by the proportions of 38.15% (95% CI 35.41-40.97%) and 38.11% (95% CI 34.15-42.24%) from wild animals or environment, respectively. Distribution of O-antigen serotypes of the E. coli isolates, including O1, O2, O18, and O78, was determined by PCR. The most predominant serotype was O18 (10.56%) followed by O2 (9.44%), O1 (7.79%), and O78 (6.56%). Of note, serotype O18 was more likely distributed in the examined wild animals, especially in geckos.

Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus (DENV) infection. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses. However, it is unknown whether Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, affects DENV infection. Here, we found that the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in DENV\\\\permissive cells, while the viral RNA and viral protein synthesis were not affected. Moreover, results from time\\\\of\\\\addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV was exhibited by targeting the virus itself, not the host cells.

Taken together, these data indicate that the antiviral activity of CBX against DENV may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself.

Three closure techniques (Figure-of-eight; simple interrupted; pulley) were compared with no fascial closure and to native fascia at five randomly allocated abdominal wall midline locations. Necropsy was performed on the fourth postoperative d. Statistical comparisons of tensile strength and breaking strength based on closure type and trocar location were made using ANOVA with Tukey's tests. RESULTS The mean (SD) force (Newtons) required for fascial disruption varied significantly with closure type [Native Fascia 170 (39), Figure-of-eight 169 (31), Pulley 167 (59), Simple Interrupted 151 (27), No Closure 108 (28)]; P = 0.007. The mean force required for fascial disruption was significantly increased for Native Fascia, Figure-of-eight, and Pulley relative to No Closure (P = 0.013, P = 0.015, P = 0.023, respectively).

Despite its high prevalence and the availability of international management guidelines, nearly half of patients do not receive recommended treatments. OA Management Programs (OAMPs) are an alternative care model to reduce barriers and enhance the receipt of evidence-based care. This study was designed to evaluate the fidelity and feasibility of an OAMP in a United States academic medical center and understand its patients' baseline characteristics. Methods: The OAMP, which opened on July 1, 2017, is focused on knee and hip osteoarthritis. A multi-disciplinary group, including patients with OA, designed the clinic model and operations based on international OAMP implementation recommendations considering local factors. The intended treatment dose was 1-6 appointments over 4-12 months with no more than two months between visits. At each appointment, patients had the opportunity to meet with a care team comprised of a medical provider (physician or advanced practice provider), registered dietitian, physical therapist, and mental health counselor. All providers had completed OA clinical competency training. Telemedicine video visits were also available after June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are asked to complete the patient questionnaires before their visit through a patient portal in the electronic health record. They are also provided with a tablet computer to complete the VR-12 and the HOOS and/or KOOS while in the clinic waiting room. For this study, a database was created for all adult patients who had at least one clinic visit from July 1, 2017, to January 15, 2021. Data was collected by an electronic health record data pull and a manual audit of visit notes. Primary outcomes related to clinic feasibility and fidelity included clinic operations and expansion, treatment duration, and number and type of appointments attended. Secondary outcomes included patients' baseline characteristics. Results: The 938 eligible patients attended an average of 2.7 visits over a mean of 114.4 days (5.9). Patients utilized the OAMP differently: 371 (39.5%) of patients attended 1 visit, 348 (37.1%) attended 2-3, and 232 (24.7%) attended 4 or more. A total of 175 (18.66%) completed at least one telemedicine visit. Patient referrals came predominantly from primary care (61%%) and orthopedics (20.3%);8.6% were self-referred. The average time between seeking care and the first appointment is just over six weeks. Due to patient demand, the program has expanded from seeing six patients per week to seeing more than 40 patients per week. The expansion has required hiring and training an increased number of clinicians, starting with four clinicians in different specialties to 11 clinicians. The average patient was 62.2 years (10.2), and most were female (72%). Nearly all were Caucasian (91.3%). Medicare (51.4%) was the most common type of insurance, followed by commercial insurance (38.3%). Half of the patients were employed (49%), while 32% were retired. At the initial visit, the average BMI was 40.9 (10). The average Charlson Comorbidity Index score (CCI) was 2.1 (1.3), indicating moderate severity of comorbid conditions. The baseline pain rating was moderate at 4.44 (2.37) on a 1-10 pain scale. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Hip Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) pain scores were 47.9 (18) and 44.9 (23.6), respectively showing moderate baseline levels of pain. Veterans-Rand 12 scores were low at the initial visit. The VR-12 physical and mental subscales were 25.66 (7.35) and 48.15 (10.76) lower than expected for an adult population. The average number of repetitions obtained from the 30-second chair rise test was 10.65 (3.49), which is lower than age and gender norms. The completion rate of self-administered patient questionnaires was low, with less than half of patients completing all questionnaires at the initial visit. Conclusions: Baseline data reveals patie ts with high levels of pain, low function, and multiple comorbid conditions who are willing to attend multiple visits. The program has continued to expand to meet increased patient demand. Patient utilization of the clinic varied, with some patients attending only one appointment and others returning numerous times. Despite being invited back within two months, a subset of patients returned for a second appointment more than six months after their initial appointment. Completion rates of the self-questionnaires (HOOS/KOOS, VR-12) were low despite having options of how to complete these.

Early detection of AIV through surveillance of wild waterfowl is one measure to prevent future disease outbreaks. Surveillance efforts that are designed to account for host and environmental determinants of susceptibility to infection are likely to be most effective. However, these determinants have not been clearly delineated and may vary with location. Because some regions are at greater risk for AIV outbreaks, the factors that contribute to AIV infection of waterfowl in these areas are of interest. We investigated the prevalence of AIVs in hunter-killed waterfowl at wintering sites in California's Central Valley. Overall, AIV prevalence was 10.5% and, after controlling for age and sex, was greatest in northern shovelers (Spatula clypeata) and lowest in wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Overall, AIV prevalence was higher in females than in males, but this trend was driven by one sampling year and one waterfowl species (green-winged teal, Anas crecca). AIV prevalence in waterfowl was lower in samples collected from brackish wetlands compared with those collected from freshwater wetlands, suggesting that wetland type or other environmental factors contribute to AIV prevalence. This study adds to our understanding of the ecology of AIV infection in waterfowl and may assist in developing more efficient, targeted surveillance efforts for the detection of potentially harmful viruses circulating in North American waterfowl.","output":"Host Correlates of Avian Influenza Virus Infection in Wild Waterfowl of the Sacramento Valley, California."},{"instruction":"Please

After the femoral head suffers avascular necrosis, the transplanted MSCs undergo a great deal of stress-induced apoptosis and senescence in this microenvironment. So, survival and differentiation of MSCs in osteonecrotic areas are especially important in ONFH. Although MSCs and endothelial cells (ECs) co-culture enhancing proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and form more mature vasculature in vivo, it remains unknown whether the co-culture cells are able to repair ONFH. In this study, we explored the roles and mechanisms of co-transplantation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-MSCs and ECs in repairing early ONFH. In vitro, when MSCs and ECs were co-cultured in a ratio of 5:1, both types of cells managed to proliferate and induce both osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Then, we established a rabbit model of steroid-induced ONFH and co-transplantation of Ang II-MSCs and ECs through the tunnel of core decompression. Four weeks later, histological and Western blot analyses revealed that ONFH treated with Ang II-MSCs and ECs may promote ossification and revascularization by increasing the expression of collagen type I, runt-related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the femoral head.

The idea that I(2) is responsible for topical iodine staining and irritation remains widely held [1, 2]. However, there are no controlled studies that characterize the cytotoxicity and staining of the hydrophobic I(2) species as compared to the other hydrophilic iodine species that comprise over 99.9% of the total iodine in topical iodine disinfectants. AIM: The aims of investigation are to compare (a) the staining properties of the I(2) species versus other topical iodine disinfectants (b) to evaluate if the concentrations of I(2) in diluted PVP-I used to reduce SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal cavity are potentially cytotoxic and (c) determine if high concentrations of I(2) can be delivered beyond the stratum corneum into the hypodermis which could provide a mechanistic rationale for I(2) out-gassing first reported by Gottardi [3]. METHODS: Five liquid compositions that contained complexed and uncomplexed (free) I(2) in aqueous and non-aqueous carriers were used to evaluate the interaction of I(2) with mammalian cells in culture as well as human and pig skin. FINDINGS: Concentrations of I(2) (7800 ppm) that are 1500 times higher than that found in PVP-I can be applied to skin without irritation and staining. I(2) is not cytotoxic at concentrations more than 100 times higher than that found in PVP-I and does not materially contribute to staining of skin at concentrations found in Lugols solution (ca 170 ppm). I(2) can partition into hypodermis tissue, remains there for hours and out-gases from skin. PVP-I and Lugols solution are highly effective topical disinfectants but do not facilitate diffusion of I(2) through the stratum corneum. CONCLUSION: The maximum concentration of I(2) found in diluted PVP, about 25 ppm, is not cytotoxic or irritating. The potential clinical utility of I(2) has been limited by incorporating this broad-spectrum biocide in acidic aqueous formulations that contain numerous chemical species that contribute toxicity but not biocidal activity.

We examine how pleiotropic mutations that have antagonistic effects (i.e., antibody evasion vs. receptor binding) on viral replication within hosts can impact viral immune escape in the host population. When the host population is vaccinated, the virus escapes from passive immunity by mutations in the antibody-binding region on the surface of the target protein. However, the reduced ability of the antibody to bind the virus is often accompanied by a reduced ability of the virus to bind the cell receptor because the antibody-binding region overlaps with the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The types of permitted mutations are limited. To investigate the causal relation between a mutation in a viral genome and adaptive evolution of a viral population, we developed a mathematical model that describes the population dynamics of viruses, antibodies, and normal/infected cells within a host. The coefficients describe the binding affinity between the virus and the induced antibody and that between the virus and its receptor. Our knowledge-based index enables us to estimate the effect of a mutation in a binding region on the binding affinity. Using population genetic theory, we evaluated the probability that a mutant is fixed in a host population. The mutations that can be fixed with high probabilities may determine how long a vaccine remains effective. We simulate the adaptive evolution of coronavirus, the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and show that some of mutations in the RBD may have high fixation probabilities in the vaccinated host population.","output":"Structural Considerations in the Fitness Landscape of a Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the commercialization of the first liposomes used for drug delivery, Doxil/Caelyx? and Myocet, tremendous progress has been made in understanding interactions between nanomedicines and biological systems.

Multiple countries and cities are implementing different mitigation strategies to reduce their transmission (e.g., physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, avoiding large gatherings). Such interventions have been related to positive and negative health externalities. Currently, the selection of mitigation strategies has not been systematically considering a long-term vision for urban health equity. This review presents evidence and a framework linking COVID-19 mitigation strategies, the built environment, and transport to health determinants and outcomes. In addition, the paper provides a set of urban interventions aimed at supporting COVID-19 mitigation strategies and promoting a long-term health equity vision. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, in addition to helping reduce disease transmission, have also decreased urban road transport, resulting in indirect benefits on air quality, traffic noise, and traffic incidents. On the other hand, the same mitigation strategies have had negative impacts on physical activity, mental health, home isolation, and access to transport options, among others. COVID-19 mitigation strategies are an opportunity to test and implement built environment and transport interventions aimed to maximize health equity and minimize health risks. National and local authorities should systematically integrate a long-term urban health equity vision when designing and implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

Molecular characterization was carried out by NMR spectroscopy and GPC analysis, confirming the chemical structure and high polymerization degree. Thermal analyses evidenced a reduction of both glass-to-rubber transition and melting temperatures, as well as a detriment of crystallization capability, for 2,4-PBF with respect to 2,5-PBF. Nevertheless, it was possible to induce crystal phase formation by annealing treatment. Wide-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the crystal lattices developed in the two isomers are distinct from each other. The different isomerism affects also the thermal stability, being 2,4-PBF more thermally inert than 2,5-PBF. Functional properties, such as wettability, mechanical response, and gas barrier capability, were tested on both amorphous and semicrystalline 2,4-PBF films and compared with those of 2,5-PBF. Reduced hydrophilicity was determined for 2,4-isomer, in line with its lower average dipole moment, suggesting better chemical resistance to hydrolysis. Stress-strain tests have evidenced the higher flexibility and toughness of 2,4-PBF with respect to those of 2,5-PBF and the possibility of improving its mechanical resistance by annealing. Finally, the different isomerism deeply affects the gas barrier performance, being the O2- and CO2-transmission rates of 2,4-PBF 50 and 110 times lower, respectively, than those of 2,5-PBF. The gas barrier properties turned out to be outstanding under a dry atmosphere as well as in humid conditions, suggesting the presence of interchain hydrogen bonds. The gas blocking capability decreases after annealing because of the presence of disclination associated with the formation of crystals.","output":"Poly(butylene 2,4-furanoate), an Added Member to the Class of Smart Furan-Based Polyesters for Sustainable Packaging: Structural Isomerism as a Key to Tune the Final Properties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) poses a tremendous challenge to healthcare systems across the globe. Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) may quantify the rate of clinically significant exposure in an institutional setting and identify those HCWs who are at greatest risk. METHODS: We conducted a survey and SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among a convenience sample of HCWs from 79 non-COVID and 3 dedicated COVID hospitals in District Srinagar of Kashmir, India. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history. RESULTS: Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Healthcare Workers by Workplace Exposure Risk in Kashmir, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an instructional strategy that embraces the concept of a flipped classroom. At our institution, the Clerkship in Pediatrics utilizes TBL sessions to deliver curricular content rather than lecture format. In 2016, matriculating medical students were given iPads for the purpose of transitioning to electronic delivery of curricular materials in the pre-clinical phase of their study. In 2017, the Clerkship in Pediatrics was tasked with investigating methods to integrate iPad use into clinical education. ACTIVITY: We employed the web-based platform Examplify to deliver test questions for TBL sessions over the span of 1 academic year (2018-2019). Curricular content was converted to Examplify for half of the TBL sessions and team performance for the sessions was compared to those administered traditionally. Students participating in the course were surveyed regarding their satisfaction with the 2 formats using a 15-item survey with a 4-point rating scale and open-ended questions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Integration of technology into TBL sessions was met with mixed results. Performance on the eTBL sessions was significantly higher for 2 of the 6 sessions: the Abdominal Pain (90.2% vs 84.1%, P = .04) and the Toxicology (85.6% vs 79.4%, P = .03) sessions. A majority of students felt that the eTBL sessions facilitated multiple learning styles, promoted discussions, and nurtured different learning styles. However, students also felt that the electronic sessions were more cumbersome and difficult to navigate.

Therefore, multiple individual systems must be deployed in a smart community to have a set of functions, which could lead to hardware waste, high energy consumption and high deployment cost. More importantly, current smart community systems mainly focus on the technologies involved, while the effects of human activity are neglected. In this paper, a fourth-order tensor model representing object, time, location and human activity is proposed for human-centered smart communities, based on which a unified smart community system is designed. Thanks to the powerful data management abilities of a high-order tensor, multiple functions can be integrated into our system.

In order to achieve a high concentration of viable cells, is requirement to have not only optimal process conditions, but also an active metabolism capable of intracellular synthesis of viral components. Experimental metabolic data collected in such processes are complex and difficult to interpret, for which mathematical models are an appropriate way to simulate and analyze the complex and dynamic interaction between the virus and its host cell. A dynamic model with 35 states was developed in this study to describe growth, metabolism, and influenza A virus production in shake flask cultivations of suspension Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. It considers cell growth (concentration of viable cells, mean cell diameters, volume of viable cells), concentrations of key metabolites both at the intracellular and extracellular level and virus titers. Using one set of parameters, the model accurately simulates the dynamics of mock-infected cells and correctly predicts the overall dynamics of virus-infected cells for up to 60 h post infection (hpi). The model clearly suggests that most changes observed after infection are related to cessation of cell growth and the subsequent transition to apoptosis and cell death. However, predictions do not cover late phases of infection, particularly for the extracellular concentrations of glutamate and ammonium after about 12 hpi. Results obtained from additional in silico studies performed indicated that amino acid degradation by extracellular enzymes resulting from cell lysis during late infection stages may contribute to this observed discrepancy.","output":"Impact of Influenza A Virus Infection on Growth and Metabolism of Suspension MDCK Cells Using a Dynamic Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with CKD requires special pharmacotherapy considerations that are reviewed here Literature review was done for several pharmacotherapy aspects in CKD patients including selection and modification of COVID-19 treatment, drug interactions, nephrotoxicity of drugs that are used for treatment of COVID-19 and potential risks/benefits of routine medications of CKD patients during COVID-19 pandemic CKD patients should be treated according to local or national COVID-19 protocols as other patients But, there is no data on using remdesivir in patients with severe CKD Oseltamivir and ribavirin require dose modification in patients with moderate to severe CKD Nephrolithiasis, CKD, and acute interstitial nephritis have been reported with protease inhibitors Acute kidney injury has been reported with remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19 Pharmacokinetic-enhanced protease inhibitors increase the concentration of some drugs such as statins, cinacalcet, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) Some hypothetical benefits and harms have been suggested for statins and renin-angiotensinaldosterone system inhibitors in COVID-19 patients Continuing guideline-directed administration of these drugs is recommended Among different immunomodulating/immunosuppressive drugs, hydroxychloroquine and CNIs are the safest ones during COVID-19 Antimetabolites are suggested to be withheld during moderate to severe COVID-19 Fluid therapy and anticoagulant prophylaxis/ treatment need special attention in CKD patients with COVID-19 CKD patients with COVID-19 are treated as other patients, with some dose modifications if needed Be mindful for management of drug interactions as well as modification of immunosuppressive drugs in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19","output":"Pharmacotherapy Considerations in CKD Patients With COVID-19, A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work is intended to show that past epidemic scenarios are not suitable to estimate the macroeconomic impact of the new 2019 coronavirus.

Data from studies in large cohorts on the efficacy and safety of multiple immediate endovascular interventions are sparse. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of multiple repeat instant endovascular interventions in patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to medical, hemodynamic, and initial endovascular interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-center retrospective study of prospectively collected data on patients with cerebral vasospasm refractory to therapies requiring 3 endovascular interventions during the course of treatment following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The primary end point was functional outcome at last follow-up (mRS 2). The secondary end point was angiographic response to endovascular therapies and the appearance of cerebral infarctions. RESULTS During a 4-year period, 365 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated at our institution. Thirty-one (8.5%) met the inclusion criteria. In 52 (14%) patients, 2 endovascular interventions were performed as rescue therapy for refractory cerebral vasospasm. At last follow-up, a good outcome was noted in 18 (58%) patients with 3 interventions compared with 31 (61%) of those with 2 interventions (P = .82). The initial Hunt and Hess score of 2 was a significant independent predictor of good outcome (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.2-18.5; P = .03), whereas infarcts in eloquent brain areas were significantly associated with a poor outcome (mRS 3-6; OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 2.3-81.2; P = .004).

Comparisons were made using the incidence rate ratio (IRR), comparing outcomes by vaccination status, and estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE: 1-[1/IRR]). Results: From December 13, 2021 to January 30, 2022, among 852,384 fully-vaccinated children 12-17 years and 365,502 children 5-11 years, VE against cases declined from 66% (95% CI: 64%, 67%) to 51% (95% CI: 48%, 54%) for those 12-17 years and from 68% (95% CI: 63%, 72%) to 12% (95% CI: 6%, 16%) for those 5-11 years. During the January 24-30 week, VE for children 11 years was 11% (95%CI -3%, 23%) and for those age 12 was 67% (95% CI: 62%, 71%).

Methods: Death certificates of persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 provided to the National Surveillance system were coded according to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Deaths due to COVID-19 were defined as those in which COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Complications were defined as those conditions reported as originating from COVID-19, and comorbidities were conditions independent of COVID-19. Results: A total of 5311 death certificates of persons dying in March through May 2020 were analysed (16.7% of total deaths). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 88% of cases. Pneumonia and respiratory failure were the most common complications, being identified in 78% and 54% of certificates, respectively. Other complications, including shock, respiratory distress and pulmonary oedema, and heart complications demonstrated a low prevalence, but they were more commonly observed in the 30C59 years age group. Comorbidities were reported in 72% of certificates, with little variation by age and gender. The most common comorbidities were hypertensive heart disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, and neoplasms. Neoplasms and obesity were the main comorbidities among younger people.

This study was conducted to further investigate the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on the severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized hypertensive patients. Methods: The study was a retrospective observational study. The medical records of all adult hypertensive patients who were hospitalized at Dammam Medical Complex (DMC) between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19 were reviewed. The hypertensive patients who were receiving ACEIs or ARBs were compared with the other hypertensive patients who were not on ACEIs or ARBs. Results: A total of 148 hypertensive patients were included in the analysis. They consisted of 106 male and 42 female patients (72% and 28%, respectively). Nearly half of the patients were Saudi (75 patients, 50%). A total of 81 patients were in the ACEI/ARB group, and 67 patients were in the control group. There were no differences between the two groups in age, diabetic status, history of chronic kidney disease, initial blood pressure measurements, and initial oxygen requirements, but the control group contained fewer female patients (18% versus 37%) and Saudi patients (36% versus 63%) than the ACEI/ARB group (p-values = 0.017 and 0.002, respectively). The use of ACEIs or ARBs was associated with significant reductions in ICU admission (9% versus 31%, p-value = 0.001), need for intubation (7% versus 28%, p-value = 0.002), and death (2% versus 24%, p-value = 0.000).

Conclusions: ACEIs and ARBs have no adverse effects on the clinical prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Their use might be even beneficial and protective, but future larger studies are needed to confirm these effects.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the methods and results of the first year of structured implementation of a colorectal ERAS program in two surgical units of the Azienda Sanitaria Unica Regionale (ASUR) Marche in Italy. A two-center observational study on a prospectively maintained database was performed on 196 consecutive colorectal resections (excluding emergencies and American Society of Anesthesiologists class > III cases) over a 1-year period. More than 50 variables including adherence to the individual items of the ERAS program were considered. Primary outcomes were overall morbidity, major morbidity, mortality and anastomotic leakage rates; secondary outcomes were LOS, re-admission and re-operation. The results were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses through logistic regression. After a median follow-up of 39.5 days, we recorded complications in 72 patients (overall morbidity 36.7%), major complications in 14 patients (major morbidity 7.1%), 6 deaths (mortality 3.1%), anastomotic dehiscence in 9 cases (4.9%), mean overall LOS of 6.6 days, 10 readmissions (5.1%) and 13 reoperations (6.7%). The mean adherence rate to the items of the ERAS program was 85.4%, showing a significant dose-effect curve for overall and major morbidity rates, anastomotic leakage rates and LOS. The implementation methods of a colorectal ERAS program in this study led to a high adherence (> 80%) to the program items. High adherence had significant effects also on major morbidity and anastomotic leakage rates.","output":"ERAS pathway in colorectal surgery: structured implementation program and high adherence for improved outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reviews the literature on the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) across disciplines using systematic literature review (SLR).

Few information, dated back to almost two decades ago, exist as to whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) could reduce the islet-specific autoimmunity detected in patients at CD diagnosis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of GFD on 31 patients who presented islet-specific autoimmunity at CD diagnosis. METHODS CD patient sera collected at diagnosis and throughout the GFD were analyzed for the main humoral autoantibodies so far identified in T1D, directed against one or more among insulin, glutamic-acid decarboxylase, tyrosine-phosphatase 2 and zinc cation-efflux transporter autoantigens. RESULTS GFD (median duration 39 months) was associated to a decrease or disappearance of the islet-specific autoantibodies in 71% of CD patients. Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for 2 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis. These factors include the number of diabetes autoantibodies found at CD diagnosis, the adherence to the GFD, its duration and an asymptomatic clinical presentation of CD.

Log anomaly detection is efficient for business management and system maintenance. Most existing log-based anomaly detection methods use log parser to get log event indexes or event templates and then utilize machine learning methods to detect anomalies. However, these methods cannot handle unknown log types and do not take advantage of the log semantic information. In this article, we propose ConAnomaly, a log-based anomaly detection model composed of a log sequence encoder (log2vec) and multi-layer Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). We designed log2vec based on the Word2vec model, which first vectorized the words in the log content, then deleted the invalid words through part of speech tagging, and finally obtained the sequence vector by the weighted average method. In this way, ConAnomaly not only captures semantic information in the log but also leverages log sequential relationships. We evaluate our proposed approach on two log datasets. Our experimental results show that ConAnomaly has good stability and can deal with unseen log types to a certain extent, and it provides better performance than most log-based anomaly detection methods.","output":"ConAnomaly: Content-Based Anomaly Detection for System Logs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the extent to which hotspots of shooting violence changed following the emergence of COVID-19.

Long COVID may affect any organ/system and manifest in a broad range of symptoms such as shortness of breath, post-exercise malaise, cognitive decline, chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal pain and deterioration of mental health. In this context, health institutions struggle with resources to keep up with the prolonged rehabilitation for the increasing number of individuals affected by long COVID. Tai Chi is a multicomponent rehabilitation approach comprising correct breathing technique, balance and neuromuscular training as well as stress- and emotional management. In addition, practicing Tai Chi elicits the relaxation response and balances the autonomic nervous system thus regulating respiration, heart rate, blood pressure and vitality in general. Moreover, Tai Chi has been shown to increase lung capacity, improve cognitive status and mental health, and thereby even the quality of life in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

SARS-CoV-2 infects varieties of tissues where the known receptor ACE2 is low or almost absent, suggesting the existence of alternative viral entry pathways. Here, we performed a genome-wide barcoded-CRISPRa screen to identify novel host factors that enable SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond known host proteins, i.e., ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP1, we identified multiple host components, among which LDLRAD3, TMEM30A, and CLEC4G were confirmed as functional receptors for SARS-CoV-2. All these membrane proteins bind directly to spikes N-terminal domain (NTD). Their essential and physiological roles have been confirmed in either neuron or liver cells. In particular, LDLRAD3 and CLEC4G mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in an ACE2-independent fashion. The identification of the novel receptors and entry mechanisms could advance our understanding of the multiorgan tropism of SARS-CoV-2, and may shed light on the development of COVID-19 countermeasures.

Machine learning methods can assist clinicians by providing tissue outcome predictions for different treatment approaches based on acute multi-parametric imaging. To produce such clinically viable machine learning models, factors such as classifier choice, data normalization, and data balancing must be considered. This study gives comprehensive consideration to these factors by comparing the agreement of voxel-based tissue outcome predictions using acute imaging and clinical parameters with manual lesion segmentations derived from follow-up imaging. This study considers random decision forest, generalized linear model, and k-nearest-neighbor machine learning classifiers in conjunction with three data normalization approaches (non-normalized, relative to contralateral hemisphere, and relative to contralateral VOI), and two data balancing strategies (full dataset and stratified subsampling). These classifier settings were evaluated based on 90 MRI datasets from acute ischemic stroke patients. Distinction was made between patients recanalized using intraarterial and intravenous methods, as well as those without successful recanalization. For primary quantitative comparison, the Dice metric was computed for each voxel-based tissue outcome prediction and its corresponding follow-up lesion segmentation. It was found that the random forest classifier outperformed the generalized linear model and the k-nearest-neighbor classifier, that normalization did not improve the Dice score of the lesion outcome predictions, and that the models generated lesion outcome predictions with higher Dice scores when trained with balanced datasets. No significant difference was found between the treatment groups (intraarterial vs intravenous) regarding the Dice score of the tissue outcome predictions.","output":"Technical considerations of multi-parametric tissue outcome prediction methods in acute ischemic stroke patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To create and validate a citywide pediatric Asthma Registry to improve the care and outcomes of children and adolescents in Washington, DC through data-driven quality improvement (QI).Methods: All available electronic health record data from inpatient and outpatient domains of Children's National Hospital were aggregated from an existing enterprise data warehouse. Inclusion criteria included asthma relevant ICD-10 codes over the prior 24 months. Available Asthma Registry measures include patient demographics, ambulatory visits, hospital admissions, persistent asthma diagnoses, and prescription of controller medications. Data capture was validated using US Census data and current asthma prevalence estimate of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).Results: The registry identified 15,991 DC children and adolescents with asthma aged 0-17 years, inclusive, at the end of 2020.

Little is known about the factors associated with household transmission, at the level of the case, contact or household, or how these have varied over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: The Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset (HOSTED) is a passive surveillance system linking laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to individuals living in the same household in England. We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model. RESULTS: In the period studied, on average, 5.5% of household contacts in England were diagnosed as cases. Household transmission was most common between adult cases and contacts of a similar age. There was some evidence of lower transmission rates to under-16s [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.74). There were clear regional differences, with higher rates of household transmission in the north of England and the Midlands. Less deprived areas had a lower risk of household transmission. After controlling for region, there was no effect of deprivation, but houses of multiple occupancy had lower rates of household transmission [aOR 0.74 (0.66-0.83)]. CONCLUSIONS: Children are less likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 via household transmission, and consequently there was no difference in the risk of transmission in households with children. Households in which cases could isolate effectively, such as houses of multiple occupancy, had lower rates of household transmission. Policies to support the effective isolation of cases from their household contacts could lower the level of household transmission.","output":"HOSTED-England's Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset: preliminary findings from a novel passive surveillance system of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have examined associations between moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sitting time with quality of life in cancer survivors compared with a cancer-free group.

METHODS Cancer Prevention Study II participants (59.9% of whom were female with an age of 77.8  5.8 years) were grouped as: 1) survivors who were 1 to 5 years after diagnosis (3718 participants); 2) survivors who were 6 to 10 years after diagnosis (4248 participants); and 3) cancer-free participants (ie, no history of cancer; 69,860 participants).

Mean differences in GMH and GPH T scores across MVPA (none, 0 to <7.5, 7.5 to <15, 15 to <22.5, and 22.5 metabolic equivalent [MET]-hours/week) and sitting (0 to <3, 3 to <6, and 6 hours/day) were assessed using multivariate generalized linear models. RESULTS The mean GMH and GPH scores were statistically significantly higher in cancer-free participants compared with cancer survivor groups, although the differences were not clinically meaningful (mean difference of 0.52 for GMH and 0.88 for GPH). More MVPA was associated with higher GMH and GPH scores for all 3 groups (P for trend <.001), and differences between the least and most active participants were found to be clinically meaningful (mean differences of 4.34 for GMH and 6.39 for GPH).

The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed that every country implement a comprehensive set of measures to prevent infection, detect cases, interrupt transmission, control clusters, suppress outbreaks and reduce mortality.

First: understand the pattern of infection locally and act on it effectively: assess the status of the outbreak; act rapidly and robustly to interrupt transmission. Second: enable people to be active participants in their own responses. Third: focus on the places where people are most at risk of infection. Fourth: assess the performance of responses to COVID-19 infection: detecting cases, interrupting chains of transmission, minimizing adverse consequences, protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and well-being for all, leaving no-one behind. These four capabilities are being woven together within societies: successful weaving can be helped through focusing on three interlinked elements: making information available; assessing and reducing risk; and being able to suppress outbreaks rapidly.

Although progress has been made in TB control, still about 10 million people worldwide develop TB annually and 1.5 million die of the disease. The rapid emergence of aggressive, drug-resistant strains and latent infections have caused TB to remain a global health challenge. TB treatments are lengthy and their side effects lead to poor patient compliance, which in turn has contributed to the drug resistance and exacerbated the TB epidemic. The relatively low output of newly approved antibiotics has spurred research interest toward alternative antibacterial molecules such as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). In the present study, we use the natural biopolymer alginate to serve as a stabilizer and/or reductant to green synthesize AgNPs, which improves their biocompatibility and avoids the use of toxic chemicals. The average size of the alginate-capped AgNPs (ALG-AgNPs) was characterized as nanoscale, and the particles were round in shape. Drug susceptibility tests showed that these ALG-AgNPs are effective against both drug-resistant Mtb strains and dormant Mtb. A bacterial cell-wall permeability assay showed that the anti-mycobacterial action of ALG-AgNPs is mediated through an increase in cell-wall permeability. Notably, the anti-mycobacterial potential of ALG-AgNPs was effective in both zebrafish and mouse TB animal models in vivo. These results suggest that ALG-AgNPs could provide a new therapeutic option to overcome the difficulties of current TB treatments.","output":"Alginate-Capped Silver Nanoparticles as a Potent Anti-mycobacterial Agent Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019 on 11th March 2020 a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China and World Health Organisation declared it to have developed pandemic status.

METHODS: Retrospective study from January 2003 through December 2009 was carried out. Every child in the PICU with a laboratory-confirmed influenza or parainfluenza infection was included. RESULTS: 18 influenza (influenza A = 13 and influenza B = 5) and 17 parainfluenza admissions were identified over the 7-year period. Parainfluenza type 3 (n = 9) was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection. The median age of children admitted with influenza was higher than parainfluenza (4.5 vs 1.7 years, p = 0.044). Admissions associated with proven influenza and parainfluenza infections accounted for 2% of PICU annual admissions. There was only one death in 2003. 51% of these patients required ventilatory support, 45% received systemic corticosteroids, and 91% received initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. Bacterial co-infections were identified in 25% of these patients. The incidence of influenza admissions had not increased significantly in 2009 (H1N1 pandemic) when compared with 2003 (SARS epidemic) (p = 0.3). There were only two PICU cases of pandemic H1N1 in 2009 and both survived.

METHODS Inclusion criteria were: (1) clinical and molecular diagnosis of SMA2 or SMA3; (2) nusinersen treatment started in adult age (>18 years); (3) clinical data available at least at baseline (T0-beginning of treatment) and 6 months (T6). RESULTS We included 116 patients (13 SMA2 and 103 SMA3) with median age at first administration of 34 years (range 18-72). The Hammersmith Functional Rating Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in patients with SMA3 increased significantly from baseline to T6 (median change +1 point, p<0.0001), T10 (+2, p<0.0001) and T14 (+3, p<0.0001). HFMSE changes were independently significant in SMA3 sitter and walker subgroups. The Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) in SMA3 significantly improved between T0 and T14 (median +0.5, p=0.012), with most of the benefit observed in sitters (+2, p=0.018). Conversely, patients with SMA2 had no significant changes of median HFMSE and RULM between T0 and the following time points, although a trend for improvement of RULM was observed in those with some residual baseline function. The rate of patients showing clinically meaningful improvements (as defined during clinical trials) increased from 53% to 69% from T6 to T14.

Intuitively, the supplier is more likely to choose trade credit financing, except in the case where both the potential online market, substitution degree, and production cost are small; under these conditions, bank credit financing may be an equilibrium strategy.

The clinical characteristics, treatment regimen and duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients remain unclear in Ghana. Methods: we retrospectively reviewed the secondary data of 307 discharged COVID-19 patients to characterize their demographics, clinical symptoms, treatment regimen given and duration of hospitalization. Results: the mean age and temperature of the patients were 37.9 years and 36.3C, respectively. The majority (85.7%) of the cases reviewed were asymptomatic; for those presenting with symptoms, the main ones were cough (50%), fever (29.6%), headache (27.3%), and sore throat (22.7%). Comorbidities were present in 25.1% of the patients; the popularly reported comorbidities were hypertension (71.4%), asthma (7.8%) and diabetes (6.5%). The average duration of hospitalization was 13.8 days, and the duration of hospitalization for patients managed with azithromycin + chloroquine (AZ+CQ) was 10.4 days, followed closely by those managed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) only, 11.0 days. There was longer duration of hospitalization among patients who received AZ only compared to patients receiving AZ + CQ (3.24  1.10 days, p=0.037; 95% CI 0.11, 6.37).

Methods: : Cross-sectional anonymous, online survey of parents of children 5-13 years old. Questions elicited information about sleep timing and quality, screen time, and schooling at three distinct periods: before the pandemic, when schools first closed and then re-opened in the fall. Results: Respondents described 101 children who were an average of 8.5 years old and 51% male. In lockdown, children slept 25 minutes more (95%CI 00:13-00:38) due to later wake times (75 minutes, 95% CI 0:57-1:34) with later bedtimes (29 minutes, 95%CI 0:00-0:58). When schools re-opened, sleep duration returned to pre-pandemic levels, but sleep onset and offset times remained later. Despite more sleep, sleep quality and habits (e.g. bedtime refusal) worsened during lockdown and did not normalize in fall 2020. During lockdown, screen time increased in 65% of all children, and 96% of those in private schools. When schools reopened, 78% of children in hybrid/virtual learning had more than 4 hours of screen exposure daily. Less screen time was associated with 2-fold higher odds of better sleep (OR 2.66, 95%CI 1.15-6.14). Conclusions: : Although school-aged children had more total sleep when schools were closed, sleep quality and habits worsened.

The implementation of new mitigation and resilience measures in cities would serve to lessen the effects of heat waves and the economic cost they entail. In this research, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the SUHI were determined through Sentinel-3A and 3B images of the eight capitals of Andalusia (southern Spain) during the months of July and August of years 2019 and 2020. The objective was to determine possible synergies or interaction between the LST and SUHI, as well as between SUHI and heat waves, in a region classified as highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For each Andalusian city, the atmospheric variables of ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and direction were obtained from stations of the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET); the data were quantified and classified both in periods of normal environmental conditions and during heat waves. By means of Data Panel statistical analysis, the multivariate relationships were derived, determining which ones statistically influence the SUHI during heat wave periods. The results indicate that the LST and the mean SUHI obtained are statistically interacted and intensify under heat wave conditions. The greatest increases in daytime temperatures were seen for Sentinel-3A in cities by the coast (LST = 3.90 C, SUHI = 1.44 C) and for Sentinel-3B in cities located inland (LST = 2.85 C, SUHI = 0.52 C). The existence of statistically significant positive relationships above 99% (p < 0.000) between the SUHI and solar radiation, and between the SUHI and the direction of the wind, intensified in periods of heat wave, could be verified. An increase in the urban area affected by the SUHI under heat wave conditions is reported.

At the same time, they implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to curtail local spread. We assess the risk of importation of COVID-19 in locations that are at that point without infection or where local chains of transmission have extinguished, and evaluate the role of quarantine in this risk. ## Methods A stochastic $SLIAR$ epidemic model is used. The effect of the rate, size, and nature of importations is studied and compared to that of NPI on the risk of importation-induced local transmission chains. The effect of quarantine on the rate of importations is assessed, as well as its efficacy as a function of its duration. ## Results The rate of importations plays a critical role in determining the risk that case importations lead to local transmission chains, more so than local transmission characteristics, i.e., strength of NPI. The latter influences the severity of the outbreaks. Quarantine after arrival in a location is an efficacious way to reduce the rate of importations. ## Conclusions Locations that see no or low level local transmission should ensure that the rate of importations remains low.

Objective: To determine whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), an age-associated condition with excess cardiovascular risk defined as the presence of an expanded, mutated somatic blood cell clone in persons without other hematological abnormalities, may be associated with an inflammatory gene expression sensitizing monocytes to aggravated immune responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This hypothesis-generating diagnostic study examined a cohort of patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure, as well as age-matched healthy control participants. Single-cell RNA sequencing and analyses of circulating peripheral monocytes was done between 2017 and 2019 to assess the transcriptome of circulating monocytes. Exposures: Severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure. Main Outcomes and Measures: CHIP-driver sequence variations in monocytes with a proinflammatory signature of genes involved in cytokine release syndrome. Results: The study included 8 patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis, 6 with chronic postinfarction heart failure, and 3 healthy control participants.

In recent decades, medical educators have developed and implemented curricula for teaching spiritual and religious (S&R) competencies to psychiatry residents. The authors reviewed the literature to understand the scope and effectiveness of these educational initiatives. METHOD The authors searched eight databases to identify studies for a scoping review and a systematic review. The scoping review explored educational approaches (topics, methods) used in psychiatry residency training programs to teach S&R competencies. The systematic review examined changes in psychiatry trainees' competencies and/or in patient outcomes following exposure to these educational interventions. RESULTS Twelve studies met criteria for inclusion in the scoping review. All reported providing residents with both (1) a general overview of the intersections between mental health and S&R and (2) training in relevant interviewing and assessment skills. Seven of these studies - representing an estimated 218 postgraduate psychiatry trainees and at least 84 patients - were included in the systematic review. Residents generally rated themselves as being more competent in addressing patients' spirituality or religious concerns following the trainings. One randomized controlled trial found that patients with severe mental illness who were treated by residents trained in S&R competencies attended more appointments than control patients. CONCLUSIONS S&R educational interventions appeared generally well-tolerated and appreciated by psychiatry trainees and their patients; however, some topics (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous) received infrequent emphasis, and some experiential teaching methodologies (e.g., attending chaplaincy rounds) were less frequently used for psychiatry residents than for medical students. The positive association between teaching S&R competencies to psychiatry residents and patient appointment attendance merits further study. Future trainings should supplement classroom learning with experiential approaches and incorporate objective measures of resident competence.","output":"Teaching Spiritual and Religious Competencies to Psychiatry Residents: A Scoping and Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the world has witnessed an unprecedented global pandemic with COVID-19.

We collected information on emergency dispatches in Okayama City and Kibichuo from March to August in 2018, 2019 and 2020 (n = 47,770 cases). We compared emergency dispatches and their demographic characteristics, especially focusing on suicide attempts, during these 3 years.

Both the pandemic itself and the restrictions were thought to create some psychological problems especially in patients with chronic illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on daily lives of children with MS, and the anxiety status of these patients and anxiety - depression status of their parents. METHODS: This study was performed on a group of pediatric MS patients aged 8-18 years in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, and Child Neurology Department. Thirty patients with MS and their 30 parents were enrolled to the study. The control group consisted of 49 healthy, age- and sex-matched children and their 49 parents. The patients (and their parents) were asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating access to health care and other changes in daily life between March 11th, 2020 and June 1st, 2020. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [which is composed of two parts; S-anxiety (STAI-S) and T-anxiety (STAI-T)] was administrated to the patients and healthy controls and the results were compared between the two groups to assess their anxiety levels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) [which is composed of two parts; HAD-anxiety (HAD-A) and HAD-depression (HAD-D)] was also given to all parents. The results of the HAD tests were compared between the two groups statistically. RESULTS: The results of the web-based survey showed that 4 of 9 (44.4%) patients, who had a regular workout program, left the program and 13 (43.3%) patients put on weight during the pandemic. Twenty-two patients (73.3%) could not get direct exposure to sunlight because of the curfew. Therefore, approximately half of the patients started to take vitamin D supplement. Most of the patients (80%) thought that they had higher risk and believed that they would have severe symptoms compared to healthy people. Twenty one (70%) patients disrupted their regular health checks and the most frequent causes were identified as closure of policlinics to routine patient care (33%) and concerns of getting SARS-CoV2 infection (26,6%). Two of 3 patients who had an MS attack did not go to the doctor during this period. The mean STAI-S scores in MS patients were significantly higher compared to the healthy controls (p=<0.001). The level of S-anxiety in all patients was higher compared to the cut off value.The mean HAD A score was found to be significantly higher in them compared to the parents of healthy individuals (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that children with MS had negative changes in daily life and high anxiety levels during the pandemic. Since MS patients have also psychiatric comorbidities, they may need psychosocial support especially in this period. Besides, establishment of separate health centers to be used during pandemics for children with chronic illnesses such as MS may be recommended to facilitate access to health care.","output":"The impact of SARS-CoV2 on the anxiety levels of subjects and on the anxiety and depression levels of their parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronaviruses encode a helicase that is essential for viral replication and represents an excellent antiviral target.

Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, the lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID-19, a prompt diagnosis can improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In this context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage at ER could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams. Methods: In this Case-control quantitative study, we developed a strategy backed by artificial intelligence to perform an initial screening of suspect COVID-19 cases. We developed a machine learning classifier that takes widely available simple blood exams as input and predicts if that suspect case is likely to be positive (having SARS-CoV-2) or negative(not having SARS-CoV-2). Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focussing on using simple blood exams, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, only 81 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (determined by RT-PCR). Based on this data, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER-CoV, aiming at determining which patients were more likely to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 when visiting an ER and that were categorized as a suspect case by medical professionals. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity. Findings: We identified that our framework achieved an average specificity of 92.16% [95% CI 91.73 - 92.59] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.29% [95% CI 94.65% - 95.90%]. Those values are completely aligned with our goal of providing an effective low-cost system to triage suspected patients at ERs. As for sensitivity, our model achieved an average of 63.98% [95% CI 59.82% - 67.50%] and positive predictive value (PPV) of 48.00% [95% CI 44.88% - 51.56%]. An error analysis identified that, on average, 45% of the false negative results would have been hospitalized anyway, thus the model is making mistakes for severe cases that would not be overlooked, partially mitigating the fact that the test is not high-sensitive. All code for our AI model, called ER-CoV is publicly available at https://github.com/soares-f/ER-CoV. Interpretation: Based on the capacity of our model to accurately predict which cases are negative from suspected patients arriving at emergency rooms, we envision that this framework can play an important role in patient triage. Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we would reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at emergency rooms, with the chance of getting a false negative at around 5%. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from the other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate inside hospitals since in many hospitals all suspected cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread, the lead time of a SARS-CoV-2 can be up to 2 weeks.

The disease has become one of the most important causes of economic losses in the swine industry. Despite efforts to design an effective vaccine, the available ones allow only partial protection. In the last years, VLPs have become good vaccine alternatives because of safety issues and their potential to activate both branches of the immunological response. The characteristics of recombinant baculoviruses as heterologous expression system have been exploited for the production of VLPs of a wide variety of viruses. In this work, two multiple baculovirus expression vectors (BEVs) with PRRS virus envelope proteins were engineered in order to generate PRRS VLPs: on the one hand, Gp5 and M cDNAs were cloned to generate the pBAC-Gp5M vector; on the other hand, Gp2, Gp3, Gp4 and E cDNAs have been cloned to generate the pBAC-Gp234E vector. The corresponding recombinant baculoviruses BAC-Gp5M and BAC-Gp234E were employed to produce two types of VLPs: basic Gp5M VLPs, by the simultaneous expression of Gp5 and M proteins; and complete VLPs, by the co-expression of the six PRRS proteins after co-infection. The characterization of VLPs by Western blot confirmed the presence of the recombinant proteins using the available specific antibodies (Abs). The analysis by Electron microscopy showed that the two types of VLPs were indistinguishable between them, being similar in shape and size to the native PRRS virus.

Anammox bacteria convert ammonium (NH4+) to dinitrogen gas (N2) using nitrite (NO2?) or nitric oxide (NO) as the electron acceptor. In the absence of NO2? or NO, anammox bacteria can couple formate oxidation to the reduction of metal oxides such as Fe(III) or Mn(IV). Their genomes contain homologs of Geobacter and Shewanella cytochromes involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET). However, it is still unknown whether anammox bacteria have EET capability and can couple the oxidation of NH4+ with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors. Here we show using complementary approaches that in the absence of NO2?, freshwater and marine anammox bacteria couple the oxidation of NH4+ with transfer of electrons to carbon-based insoluble extracellular electron acceptors such as graphene oxide (GO) or electrodes poised at a certain potential in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Metagenomics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization and electrochemical analyses coupled with MEC performance confirmed that anammox electrode biofilms were responsible for current generation through EET-dependent oxidation of NH4+. 15N-labelling experiments revealed the molecular mechanism of the EET-dependent anammox process. NH4+ was oxidized to N2 via hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as intermediate when electrode was the terminal electron acceptor. Comparative transcriptomics analysis supported isotope labelling experiments and revealed an alternative pathway for NH4+ oxidation coupled to EET when electrode is used as electron acceptor compared to NO2?as electron acceptor. To our knowledge, our results provide the first experimental evidence that marine and freshwater anammox bacteria can couple NH4+ oxidation with EET, which is a significant finding, and challenges our perception of a key player of anaerobic oxidation of NH4+ in natural environments and engineered systems.","output":"Extracellular electron transfer-dependent anaerobic oxidation of ammonium by anammox bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A large global effort is ongoing to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 While there is accumulating information on the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, less is known about the SARS-CoV-2 antigens that are targeted by CD8 T cells Such knowledge will be of high value to gain fundamental insights into the antigenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 recognized by CD8 T cells, to develop tool allowing focused analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses directly ex vivo, and to understand whether current vaccine designs are covering the CD8 T cell recognized antigens Methods: To address this issue, we have analyzed samples from 18 COVID-19 patients for CD8 T cell recognition of 500 predicted SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes restricted to 10 common HLA-A and HLA-B alleles For each HLA allele, the top 50 epitopes were selected based on predicted binding affinity and likelihood of successful proteasomal processing To probe for CD8 T cell recognition of the selected epitope-HLA complexes, we made use of our in-house technology based on multiplexing of peptide HLA (pHLA) multimers conjugated to fluorescent dyes Results: In addition to previous studies showing CD8 T cell reactivity towards epitopes derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we have identified several CD8 T cell recognized epitopes derived from the ORF1ab, including one epitope displaying clear immunodominant properties across patients positive for HLA-A*01:01 Investigation of the functional status of part of the identified responses (including 4 responses specific for the immunodominant epitope) revealed that the T cell responses were highly dysfunctional In addition the SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cell responses displayed an increased expression of NKG2A in comparison with bulk CD8 T cells, which may explain their dysfunctional state Conclusions: Our data suggest that part of the ORF1ab encodes multiple CD8 T cell antigens including one immunodominant epitope Noteworthy these epitopes were derived from a part of the viral genome that is not included in the majority of vaccine candidates in development, and this may potentially influence their clinical activity and safety profile Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"The ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 encodes an immunodominant epitope restricted by HLA-A*01:01"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of Anemoside B4 (AB4), Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), Notoginsenoside R1 (SR1), Saikosaponin A (SSA) and Saikosaponin D (SSD) on piglets infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).

Simultaneously, appropriate government incentives, consolidated interdisciplinary research, and active participation by industry are required to foster and facilitate smart hospitals.","output":"Review of Smart Hospital Services in Real Healthcare Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) first hit the Philippines in January 2020 and by March, more suspected cases were reported, compelling the national government to create measures to secure public health and fight the pandemic. In order to mitigate the spread of the virus, a community quarantine in the Philippines National Capital Region began on March 15, 2020. This study utilized Foucauldian Discourse Analysis in understanding President Rodrigo RoaCDutertes discourses about community quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Two of his press conferences served as texts for discourse analysis: (1) on March 12, 2020 when he announced measures against COVID-19 threat, and (2) on March 16, 2020 when enhanced community quarantine was imposed. Results showed four wider discourses: (1) Community Quarantine as a Political Device, (2) Community Quarantine as a Protection of Public Health, (3) Community Quarantine as an Act against Resistance, and (4) Community Quarantine as an Opportunity for Bayanihan (spirit of Communal Unity) and an Expression of Damayan (Giving Compassion and Support). Results showed how the discourses transitioned from community quarantine to enhanced community quarantine. The results are discussed in relation to power and social change.

The investigators of the international Collaborative on Fatigue Following Infection (COFFI) conducted a systematic review of post-COVID fatigue and a narrative review on fatigue after other infections, and made recommendations for clinical and research approaches to assessing fatigue after COVID-19. In the majority of COVID-19 cohort studies, persistent fatigue was reported by a significant minority of patients, ranging from 13% to 33% at 16C20 weeks post-symptom onset. Data from the prospective cohort studies in COFFI and others indicate that fatigue is also a prevalent outcome from many acute systemic infections, notably infectious mononucleosis, with a case rate for clinically significant Post-infective fatigue after exclusion of recognized medical and psychiatric causes, ranging from 10%C35% at 6 months. To better characterize post-COVID fatigue, the COFFI investigators recommend the following: application of validated screening questionnaires for case detection; standardized interviews encompassing fatigue, mood, and other symptoms; and investigative approaches to identify end-organ damage and mental health conditions.","output":"Long COVID and Post-infective Fatigue Syndrome: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the discovery of circulating tumor cells in 1869, technological advances in studying circulating biomarkers from patients' blood have made the diagnosis of nonhematologic cancers less invasive. Technological advances in the detection and analysis of biomarkers provide new opportunities for the characterization of other disease types. When compared with traditional biopsies, liquid biopsy markers, such as exfoliated bladder cancer cells, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and extracellular vesicles (EV), are considered more convenient than conventional biopsies. Liquid biopsy markers undoubtedly have the potential to influence disease management and treatment dynamics. Our main focuses of this review will be the cell-based, gene-based, and protein-based key liquid biopsy markers (including EV and cfDNA) in disease detection, and discuss the research progress of these biomarkers used in conjunction with liquid biopsy. First, we highlighted the key technologies that have been broadly adopted used in hematological diseases. Second, we introduced the latest technological developments for the specific detection of cardiovascular disease, leukemia, and coronavirus disease. Finally, we concluded with perspectives on these research areas, focusing on the role of microfluidic technology and artificial intelligence in point-of-care medical applications. We believe that the noninvasive capabilities of these technologies have great potential in the development of diagnostics and can influence treatment options, thereby advancing precision disease management.","output":"Liquid biopsy technologies for hematological diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteolytic activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein is indispensable for influenza virus infectivity, and the tissue expression of the responsible cellular proteases impacts viral tropism and pathogenicity. The HA protein critically contributes to the exceptionally high pathogenicity of the 1918 influenza virus, but the mechanisms underlying cleavage activation of the 1918 HA have not been characterized. The neuraminidase (NA) protein of the 1918 influenza virus allows trypsin-independent growth in canine kidney cells (MDCK). However, it is at present unknown if the 1918 NA, like the NA of the closely related strain A/WSN/33, facilitates HA cleavage activation by recruiting the proprotease plasminogen. Moreover, it is not known which pulmonary proteases activate the 1918 HA. We provide evidence that NA-dependent, trypsin-independent cleavage activation of the 1918 HA is cell line dependent and most likely plasminogen independent since the 1918 NA failed to recruit plasminogen and neither exogenous plasminogen nor the presence of the A/WSN/33 NA promoted efficient cleavage of the 1918 HA. The transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS4 was found to be expressed in lung tissue and was shown to cleave the 1918 HA. Accordingly, coexpression of the 1918 HA with TMPRSS4 or the previously identified HA-processing protease TMPRSS2 allowed trypsin-independent infection by pseudotypes bearing the 1918 HA, indicating that these proteases might support 1918 influenza virus spread in the lung. In summary, we show that the previously reported 1918 NA-dependent spread of the 1918 influenza virus is a cell line-dependent phenomenon and is not due to plasminogen recruitment by the 1918 NA. Moreover, we provide evidence that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 activate the 1918 HA by cleavage and therefore may promote viral spread in lung tissue.","output":"Proteolytic activation of the 1918 influenza virus hemagglutinin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and Aim: In Kyrgyzstan, there are still no studies on the prevalence of chemical burns of the esophagus in children, and there are also few studies aimed at studying the causative agents.

Objective: To evaluate the rates of cesarean delivery for nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) births in California in the context of a statewide multifaceted intervention designed to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational study of cesarean delivery rates from 2014 to 2019 among 7a?574a?889 NTSV births in the US and at 238 nonmilitary hospitals providing maternity services in California. From 2016 to 2019, California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative partnered with Smart Care California to implement multiple approaches to decrease the rates of cesarean delivery. Hospitals with rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births were invited to join 1 of 3 cohorts for an 18-month quality improvement collaborative between July 2016 and June 2019. Exposures: Within the collaborative, multidisciplinary teams implemented multiple strategies supported by mentorship, shared learning, and rapid-cycle data feedback. Partnerships among nonprofit organizations, state governmental agencies, purchasers, and health plans addressed the external environment through transparency, award programs, and incentives. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the change in cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California and a difference-in-differences analysis was performed to compare cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California vs the rates in the rest of the US. A mixed multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for patient-level and hospital-level confounders also was used to assess the collaborative and the external statewide actions. The cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births at hospitals participating in the collaborative were compared with the rates from the nonparticipating hospitals and the rates in the participating hospitals prior to participation in the collaborative. Results: A total of 7a?574a?889 NTSV births occurred in the US from 2014 to 2019, of which 914a?283 were at 238 hospitals in California. All California hospitals were exposed to the statewide actions to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery, including the 149 hospitals that had baseline rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births, of which 91 (61%) participated in the quality improvement collaborative. The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California decreased from 26.0% (95% CI, 25.8%-26.2%) in 2014 to 22.8% (95% CI, 22.6%-23.1%) in 2019 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.89). The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in the US (excluding California births) was 26.0% in both 2014 and 2019 (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.996-1.005). The difference-in-differences analysis revealed that the reduction in the rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.5%) higher than in the US (excluding California). Compared with the hospitals and the periods not exposed to the collaborative activities, and after adjusting for patient characteristics and time using a modified stepped-wedge analysis, exposure to collaborative activities was associated with a lower odds of cesarean delivery for NTSV births (24.4% vs 24.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.85-0.89]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this observational study of NTSV births in California from 2014 to 2019, the rates of cesarean delivery decreased over time in the setting of the implementation of a coordinated hospital-level collaborative and statewide initiatives designed to support vaginal birth.","output":"Hospital Quality Improvement Interventions, Statewide Policy Initiatives, and Rates of Cesarean Delivery for Nulliparous, Term, Singleton, Vertex Births in California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Frailty, loneliness, and social isolation are all associated with adverse outcomes in older adults, but little is known about their combined impact on mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. PARTICIPANTS: Community\\\\dwelling older adults aged 65 and older (n = 1,427). MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was measured with the frailty phenotype (Fried criteria). Loneliness was assessed with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Social isolation was operationalized using information on partner status, social support, and network size. Two categorical variables were created, for each possible combination regarding frailty and loneliness (FL) and frailty and social isolation (FS), respectively. Mortality was monitored over a period of 22 years (1995C2017). Survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the effects of the FL and FS combinations on mortality. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, depression, chronic diseases, and smoking. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 13%, and 5.9% of the sample were frail and lonely, and 6.2% frail and socially isolated. In fully adjusted models, older adults who were only frail had a higher risk of mortality compared with people without any of the conditions (hazard ratio [HR] range = 1.40C1.48; P < .01). However, the highest risk of mortality was observed in people with a combined presence of frailty and loneliness or social isolation (HR(FL) = 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42C2.37; HR(FS) = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.36C2.30). Sensitivity analyses using a frailty index based on the deficit accumulation approach instead of the frailty phenotype showed similar results, confirming the robustness of our findings.

METHODS: Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2020 were reviewed, including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for specialty drugs, biosimilars, and diabetes medications. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2020 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS: In 2019, overall US pharmaceutical expenditures grew 5.4% compared to 2018, for a total of $507.9 billion. This increase was driven to similar degrees by prices, utilization, and new drugs. Adalimumab was the top drug in US expenditures in 2019, followed by apixaban and insulin glargine. Drug expenditures were $36.9 billion (a 1.5% increase from 2018) and $90.3 billion (an 11.8% increase from 2018) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, growth was driven by new products and increased utilization, whereas in hospitals growth was driven by new products and price increases. Several new drugs that will likely influence spending are expected to be approved in 2020. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures. CONCLUSION: For 2020 we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4.0% to 6.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 9.0% to 11.0% and 2.0% to 4.0%, respectively, compared to 2019.

The purpose of this study was to assess in vitro the anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic potential of an autologous blood product as a possible treatment for COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. MATERIAL/METHODS: Blood samples from healthy donors and donors who had recovered from COVID-19 were incubated using different techniques and analyzed for the presence of anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic, regenerative, pro-inflammatory, and procatabolic molecules. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of therapeutic molecules for targeting inflammatory pathways were found in the blood that had been incubated for 24 h at 37C, whereas a significant increase was observed after 6 h of incubation in blood from COVID-19-recovered donors. Beneficially, the 6-h incubation process did not downregulate anti-COVID-19 immunoglobulin G concentrations.

During the preweaning period, calves are susceptible to diarrhea that can lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality. Diarrhea has been related with a decrease of beneficial microbiota and an increase of coliform counts in feces. Prebiotic supplements are believed to decrease diarrhea and positively affect some parameters of the immune system. In calves, these supplements have shown some promising effects on intestinal microbial populations but there is limited information about effects on immunity. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of a prebiotic supplement containing fermentation products of lactic acid bacteria on the mucosal immune system by measuring fecal and salivary IgA and to evaluate calf health and growth performance. In this trial 40 Holstein calves were randomly assigned to receive milk replacer with a prebiotic supplement (20 g/day Prebio Support?; Meiji Feed Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) or the same milk replacer with no prebiotic (control). Fecal and salivary IgA, calf health, plasma IgG, and lymphocyte counts were not affected by treatment. Lactobacilli count in feces was higher (P = 0.05) and Bifidobacteria tended to be higher (P = 0.07) in calves fed prebiotic. Prebiotic supplement increased beneficial bacteria in calves, but did not decrease overall incidence of diarrhea in this trial. Calves in this study were all affected by cryptosporidiosis and some were treated with antibiotics, so it is possible that this limited some of the effects of the prebiotic product. Fecal IgA seemed to be a good measure of mucosal immunity, and more studies are needed to develop methods to measure this type of immunity in calves.","output":"The effects of a prebiotic supplement (Prebio Support) on fecal and salivary IgA in neonatal dairy calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Child and adolescent mental health indicators were trending in the wrong direction pre-COVID-19 and have worsened with the exacerbation of life stressors during a pandemic, especially among youth of color and girls (Racine et al. in JAMA Pediatr 175:1142C1150, 2021). Hip Hop integrated group work with adolescents has increased in the literature, with an emphasis on being more culturally responsive and engaging compared to traditional therapeutic approaches. Levy and Travis (J Spec Group Work 45:307C330, 2020) found in their research that while all Hip Hop integrated groups were effective, the semi-structured group had the most significant reduction in symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety, compared to the highly structured and minimally structured groups. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a Hip Hop integrated intervention, that is multi-modal and interdisciplinary (i.e., blending two distinct models [HHE/CCMC] and facilitated by a social worker and school counselor). could effectively promote positive social and emotional development, across three leadership styles. Three groups of six high school students (total n = 18), identifying predominantly as Latinx and Black, were selected from a high school summer enrichment program. Results suggest social and emotional benefits for youth across all groups, regardless of facilitation style. Benefits included increased confidence, a strong sense of community, experiencing joy, and a willingness to step outside of their comfort zones to collaborate and create something personally meaningful.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made such examination formats impossible, and medical educators have explored the use of online assessments as a potential replacement. This shift has in turn led to fears that the change in format or academic malpractice might lead to considerably higher attainment scores on online assessment with no underlying improvement in student competence. METHOD: Here, we present an analysis of 8092 sittings of the Prescribing Safety Assessment (PSA), an assessment designed to test the prescribing skills of final year medical students in the UK. In-person assessments for the PSA were cancelled partway through the academic year 2020, with 6048 sittings delivered in an offline, traditionally invigilated format, and then 2044 sittings delivered in an online, webcam invigilated format. RESULTS: A comparison (able to detect very small effects) showed no attainment gap between online (M = 0.762, SD = 0.34) and offline (M = 0.761, SD = 0.34) performance.

METHODS This analysis used data from the Healthy Minds Study Survey administered between 2007 and 2019, yielding a sample of 320,817 university students. Survey data was examined via descriptive analyses. RESULTS Over the last decade from 2007 to 2018-2019, there was an increase in use of nearly all classes of psychiatric medications, with reported antidepressant medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), etc.) use increasing from 8.0% to 15.3%, anti-anxiety medication (benzodiazepines, buspirone, etc.) from 3.0% to 7.6%, psychostimulants from 2.1% to 6.3%, antipsychotics from 0.38% to 0.92%, and mood stabilizers from 0.8% to 2.0% (all p<0.0001), respectively. In addition, the use of more than one category of medication at a time has increased, from 28.2% in 2007 to 40.8% in 2018-2019 (p<0.0001). The proportion of students who received their most recent prescription for psychiatric medication from primary care providers has risen from 49.1% in 2007 to 58.8% in 2018-2019 (p<0.0001), while the proportion receiving these prescriptions from psychiatric providers did not increase significantly and stands at 36.1% in 2018-2019. The percentage of students taking psychiatric medication without a prescription varied from year to year, starting at 11.9% in 2007 and ending at 7.7% in 2018-2019 (p<.0001). The proportion of students who discussed their use of psychiatric medication with their doctor or other health professional three or more times in the previous year has increased from 39.2% in 2007 to 49.5% in 2018-2019 (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of college students who have taken psychiatric medications of all categories has risen in the last decade; these students are increasingly likely to be on more than one kind of psychiatric medication and be treated by health care providers at a greater frequency.

Due to Covid-19s severe economic impacts, the establishment of reliable determining factors can help to alleviate future pandemics. While a population density is often cited as a major determinant of infectious cases and mortality rates, there are both proponents and opponents to this claim. In this framework, the study seeks to assess the role of population density as a predictor of Covid-19 cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia and China during the Covid-19 pandemic. With high infectivity and mortality being a definitive characteristic of overpopulated regions, the authors propose that Henry Kissingers population reduction theory can be applied as a control measure to control future pandemics and alleviate social concerns. If high-density Chinese regions are more susceptible to Covid-19 than low-density Saudi cities, the authors argue that Neo-Malthusian models can be used as a basis for reducing the impacts of the coronavirus disease on the economic growth in countries with low population density. However, the performed correlation analysis and simple linear regression produced controversial results with no clear connection between the three studied variables. By assessing population density as a determinant of health crises associated with multiple socio-economic threats and epidemiological concerns, the authors seek to reinvigorate the scholarly interest in Neo-Malthusian models as a long-term solution intended to mitigate future disasters.

The observed response was species-specific, dependent on the prior growth conditions, and was inhibited by oxygen. We observed attraction toward nitrate when Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB and Azospira suillum strain PS were grown with nitrate. When D. aromatica and Dechloromonas agitata strain CKB were grown with perchlorate, both responded to nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate. When A. suillum was grown with perchlorate, the organism responded to chlorate and perchlorate but not nitrate. A gene replacement mutant in the perchlorate reductase subunit (pcrA) of D. aromatica resulted in a loss of the attraction response toward perchlorate but had no impact on the nitrate response. Washed-cell suspension studies revealed that the perchlorate grown cells of D. aromatica reduced both perchlorate and nitrate, while A. suillum cells reduced perchlorate only. Based on these observations, energy taxis was proposed as the underlying mechanism for the responses to (per)chlorate by D. aromatica. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of the response behavior of perchlorate-reducing bacteria to environmental stimuli.

The New Zealand Army Nursing Service (NZANS) during WWI has previously had little attention as a key actor in the Australia and New Zealand Army Corp (ANZAC), Today ANZAC is held as pivotal in the birth of New Zealands perception of nationhood and as an iconic heritage cultural brand. The history and legend of the ANZAC plays an important role in New Zealand culture and is fundamental to the Anzac Spirit, a signifier of what it means to be a New Zealander.Design/methodology/approachA historical case study method is used. The primary source of data is 1914C1918, and includes contemporaneous articles, and personal writings: diaries, letters and published memoirs. More contemporary works form the basis for discussion of marketization as it relates to the NZANS. The article first presents conceptual framing, then the development of the Anzac brand and the history of the NZANS and its role in WWI before turning to discussion on the marketization of this nursing service to todays audiences and as part of the ANZAC/Anzac brand.FindingsToday the story of the WWI NZANS nurse, previously seldom heard, has been co-opted and is becoming increasingly merged as an integral part of the Anzac story. The history of the NZANS during WWI has a great deal of agency today as part of that story, serving many functions within it and providing a valuable lever for marketization.Originality/valueTo date, there is a scarcity of marketing analysis that examines the marketization of history.

This study was to investigate the effect of AV treatment on depressive behaviors. Herein, we show that AV treatment had antidepressant-like effect in physiological conditions and antidepressant effect in depressive state which depended on 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) expression in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), but not 42 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (42nAchR) expression in vHPC, nor the 7nAChR and 42nAchR expression in dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). By using MLA, a selective 7nAChR antagonist, we investigated the role of 7nAChR in AV treatment. Behavior tests demonstrated that MLA abolished the antidepressant effect of AV. Besides, our data showed that AV treatment increased Akt phosphorylation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic related protein synapsin and spinophilin expression. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 reversed AV-induced increase of BDNF expression, newborn neurons and antidepressant behavior effects. Our study suggests that AV plays an antidepressant role by regulating synaptic plasticity of vHPC through PI3K/Akt-BDNF signaling pathway, which may be a good choice for depression treatment.","output":"Atorvastatin ameliorates depressive behaviors via regulation of 7nAChR expression by PI3K/Akt-BDNF pathway in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the Tunisian healthcare system. To reduce the risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended deferral of elective cardiac procedures, including coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Purpose However anecdotal reports suggest also a decline in the number of patients consulting for an unstable CAD and therefore in the activity of the catheterization laboratory. Methods To confirm this finding, we conducted a study comparing the number of patients who consulted for an unstable CAD and who benefited from a CA associated or not with a PCI during the confinement period (CP) (from March 15, 2020 to April 30, 2020) and just 6 weeks before (from February 1, 2020 to March 15, 2020) in Mongi Slim La Marsa University Hospital Center.

Conclusion Potential etiologies for the decrease in unstable patients with CAD may be related to the avoidance of medical care due to social distancing or concerns of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital and ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction misdiagnosis.

Prolonged periods of air conditioner use in enclosed classrooms may result in poor air quality.

This study investigated CO2 and PM2.5 concentrations in 86 classrooms installed with air conditioners in elementary and middle schools in southern Taiwan, each additionally installed with a fresh air ventilation system equipped with an E11-class filter. Enclosed air-conditioned classrooms generally have a CO2 concentration greater than 2500 ppm;occasionally, this figure reaches 3500 ppm. With the installed air ventilation system operating, mean classroom CO2 concentration decreased to 1084  203 ppm, and the median CO2 concentration decreased to 1120 ppm. However, the CO2 concentrations of over half the classrooms remained higher than the concentration advised by the World Health Organization (1000 ppm). This high CO2 concentration was a result of the short distance (1.5C2 m) between the indoor air outlet and the recirculated air inlet resulting in a shortened circuit of air travel. Also, the initial filter installed over the indoor air outlet of the system reduced air penetration into the classroom. When the ventilation system was manually activated without activating the air conditioners, the median PM2.5 concentration measured at the indoor air outlet and the median classroom PM2.5 concentration were 2 g/m3 and 20 g/m3, respectively. This implied the presence of other sources of PM2.5 in classrooms, particularly ceiling and wall-mounted fans. The activation of these fans spread dust onto classroom furniture. Overall, fresh air ventilation systems providing filtered air improve classroom ventilation efficiency and indoor air quality by reducing CO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, but the cleanliness of fans and furniture must be maintained.","output":"A comprehensive analysis of the intervention of a fresh air ventilation system on indoor air quality in classrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective is to investigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated neurological and psychiatric effects and explore possible pathogenic mechanisms. This study included 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Neurological manifestations were evaluated by well-trained neurologists, psychologists, psychiatric presentations and biochemical changes were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and electronic medical records. Eighteen (23.4%) patients presented with neurological symptoms. Patients with neurological presentations had higher urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and lower basophil counts. Among them, patients with muscle involvement had higher urea nitrogen and cystatin C levels but lower basophil counts. In addition, patients with psychiatric presentations were older and had higher interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels and higher alkaline phosphatase, R-glutamate transferase, and urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, patients with anxiety had higher IL-6 and IL-10 levels than those without, and patients with moderate depression had higher CD8 + T cell counts and lower CD4 + /CD8 + ratios than other patients. This study indicates that the central nervous system may be influenced in patients with COVID-19, and the pathological mechanisms may be related to direct virus invasion of the central nervous system, infection-mediated overreaction of the immune system, and aberrant serum pro-inflammatory factors.

RESULTS Scientific advancements will continue to drive improvements in MCH, but to unleash its full potential for improving population health future MCH research must become more transdisciplinary, translational, and precise. Technological innovations could dramatically transform our work in MCH while big data could enhance predictive analytics and precision health; our challenge will be to assure equitable access. The greatest gains in MCH will continue to come from improving social conditions, which will require advancing MCH in all policies. Climate change, infectious outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance pose increasing threats to MCH, which can be averted by reducing global warming, implementing global early warning systems, and instituting responsible antimicrobial stewardship. The growing burden of chronic diseases in children and adults need to be addressed from an ecological and life course perspective. The water crisis in Flint shined a spotlight on the growing health threats from America's decaying infrastructure. DISCUSSION We can lead the future of MCH by starting a national conversation, improving MCH research, and preparing future MCH workforce, but the future of MCH will depend on our effectiveness in bringing about social and political change in the coming decades.","output":"The Future of Maternal and Child Health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence.

A multitude of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays with disparate gene targets, including automated high-throughput platforms, are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays, leading to suboptimal disease management. This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated. Further, a retrospective analysis was carried out using Viroselect on samples reported as 'inconclusive' between April and October 2020. RESULTS: In total, 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect with both manual (87.6%) and automated (84.7%) assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as 'inconclusive', Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) of samples which had inconclusive results on manual and automated high-throughput platforms, respectively. CONCLUSION: Viroselect had high concordance with conventional assays, both manual and automated, and has potential to resolve inconclusive samples.","output":"A novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay to resolve inconclusive samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating effects not only on healthcare systems worldwide but also on different aspects of the care provided to nursing home residents.

Resultados: de los 81 pacientes estudiados, 64(79,01%) varones, identificamos TEP agudo en 22(27,16%), en 13(59,09%) bilateral y en 13(59,09%) con reas de hipoperfusin. De los 59(72,83%) pacientes sin TEP en 41(69,49%) se observ hipoperfusin (en un caso atribuible a enfisema pulmonar). En 18(22,2%) del total de pacientes no se vio ni TEP ni hipoperfusin.

Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic capacity of pulmonary angiography with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and iodine mapping in the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with Covid-19 disease. Methods: Retrospective observational study of 81 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 respiratory infection who underwent MDCT for clinical suspicion of PTE (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, severe respiratory failure (SRF) not corrected with high O2 flow) and/or raised D-dimer. Results: Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81). Patients with O2-refractory SRF showed a 6.36-fold higher risk for hypoperfusion on the iodine map. Conclusion: By adding the functional image to the anatomical image, pulmonary angiography with MDCT and iodine mapping can demonstrate not only PTE in main, lobar and segmental arteries, but also the presence of hypoperfusion in distal vessels. This makes it a highly useful tool for the accurate diagnosis and therapeutic orientation of patients with Covid-19 lung involvement.","output":"Pulmones azules en pacientes COVID-19: un paso ms all del diagnstico de tromboembolismo pulmonar mediante TCMD con mapa de yodo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Even though the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged during Indias second wave of infections, Delta variants have grown dominant internationally and are still evolving. On November 26, 2021, WHO identified the variant B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern, naming it Omicron, based on evidence that Omicron contains numerous mutations that may influence its behaviour. However, the mode of transmission and severity of the Omicron variant remains unknown. We used computational studies to examine the Delta and Omicron variants in this work and found that the Omicron variant had a higher affinity for human ACE2 than the Delta variant due to a significant number of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, indicating a higher potential for transmission. Based on docking studies, the Q493R, N501Y, S371L, S373P, S375F, Q498R, and T478K mutations contribute significantly to high binding affinity with human ACE2. In comparison to the Delta variant, both the entire spike protein and the RBD in Omicron include a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. These amino acids are located within the proteins core and are required for structural stability. Omicron has a higher percentage of alpha-helix structure than the Delta variant in both whole spike protein and RBD, indicating that it has a more stable structure. We observed a disorder-order transition in the Omicron variant between spike protein RBD regions 468-473, and it may be significant in the influence of disordered residues/regions on spike protein stability and binding to ACE2.

SIRT2's catalytic domain has a hydrophobic tunnel where its substrate acyl groups bind. Here, we report that the fluorescent probe 1-aminoanthracene (AMA) binds within SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel in a substrate-dependent manner. AMA's interaction with SIRT2 was characterized by its enhanced fluorescence upon protein binding (>10-fold). AMA interacted weakly with SIRT2 alone in solution (Kd = 37 M). However, when SIRT2 was equilibrated with a decanoylated peptide substrate, AMA's affinity for SIRT2 was enhanced a10-fold (Kd = 4 M). The peptide's decanoyl chain and AMA co-occupied SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel when bound to the protein. In contrast, binding of AMA to SIRT2 was competitive with a myristoylated substrate whose longer acyl chain occluded the entire tunnel. AMA competitively inhibited SIRT2 demyristoylase activity with an IC50 of 21 M, which was significantly more potent than its inhibition of other deacylase activities. Finally, binding and structural analysis suggests that the AMA binding site in SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel was structurally stabilized when SIRT2 interacted with a decanoylated or 4-oxononanoylated substrate, but AMA's binding site was less stable when SIRT2 was bound to an acetylated substrate.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing surgical resection with endovascular treatment in terms of success of treatment, rate of recurrence and complications. A literature search was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group system. Surgical outcomes such as initial treatment failure, late recurrence, neurological improvement and complications were compared between the two approaches. We included 57 studies with 2029 patients, of which 32 studies with 1341 patients directly compared surgery (n=590) and embolisation (n=751). Surgery was found to be associated with significantly lower odds of initial treatment failure (OR: 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24, I2 0%, p<0.001) and late recurrence (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.39, I2 0%, p<0.001). The odds of neurological improvement following surgery were also significantly higher compared with embolisation alone (OR: 2.73, CI:1.67 to 4.48, I2 :49.5%, p<0.001). No difference in complication rates was observed between the two approaches (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.26, I2 0%, p=0.063).

National Health Service (NHS) staff have reported higher levels of burnout, stress, and other mental health issues that they relate directly to the impact of the pandemic. Burnout is often used as a \\"catch-all\\" term for psychological distress in the workplace, and it has been suggested that, during the pandemic, experience of \\"burnout\\" may be influenced by \\"moral injury\\": the distress that can arise from actions, or lack of action, that are seen to violate one's ethical code. This study investigates NHS staff experiences of burnout and betrayal-based moral injury, in which a trusted authority betrays \\"what is right.\\" METHOD Sixteen NHS staff members were interviewed in relation to their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, and data were thematically analyzed. RESULTS Three themes were identified: abandonment as betrayal; dishonesty and lack of accountability; and fractured relationship to management or the NHS. CONCLUSIONS This analysis concludes that self-identified \\"burnout\\" in NHS staff may include a significant moral component, and that failure to engage in moral repair following betrayal-based moral injury may relate to a long-term loss of trust or fractured relationship with the organization. In addition to traditional trauma-informed psychological support, leadership at all levels should be trained to be aware of betrayal-based moral injury and to engage in moral repair to reduce staff intent to leave and encourage mutual trust.

We sought to better characterise Omicron severity relative to Delta by assessing the relative risk of hospital attendance, hospital admission or death in a large national cohort. Methods: Individual-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases resident in England between 22 November 2021 and 9 January 2022 were linked to routine datasets on vaccination status, hospitalisation and mortality. The relative risk of attendance at hospital within 14 days, or death within 28 days following confirmed infection, was estimated using proportional hazards regression. Analyses were stratified by test date, 10-year age band, ethnicity, region and vaccination status and further adjusted for sex, index of multiple deprivation decile, evidence of a prior infection and year of age within each age band. A secondary analysis estimated variant- and vaccine-specific vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic relative severity of Omicron infection compared with Delta;i.e. the relative risk in unvaccinated cases. Findings: We found that the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospital attendance (not necessarily resulting in admission) with Omicron compared with Delta was 0.56 (95%CI: 0.54-0.58);for hospital admission and death the estimates were 0.41 (95%CI: 0.39-0.43) and 0.31 (95%CI: 0.26-0.37), respectively. Omicron vs Delta HR estimates varied with age for all endpoints examined: the adjusted HR for hospital admission was 1.07 (95%CI: 0.83-1.38) in <10 year-olds, falling to 0.25 (95%CI: 0.21-0.30) in 60-69 year-olds, and rising to 0.48 (95%CI: 0.40-0.57) in 80 year-olds. For both variants, past infection gave some protection against death both in vaccinated (HR: 0.45 [95%CI: 0.30-0.68]) and unvaccinated (0.14 [95%CI: 0.04-0.45]) cases. In vaccinated cases, past infection offered no additional protection against hospital admission beyond that provided by vaccination (HR: 0.99 [95%CI: 0.9-1.08]), whilst for unvaccinated cases moderate protection remained (HR: 0.53 [95%CI: 0.46-0.61]). Estimation of variant-specific vaccine effectiveness gave lower Omicron vs Delta HR estimates for hospital admission (0.29 [95%CI: 0.28-0.31]) in unvaccinated cases than estimated for all cases in the primary analysis. Booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was highly protective against hospitalisation and death in Omicron cases (HR for hospital admission 8-11 weeks post booster, compared with unvaccinated: 0.22 [95%CI: 0.19-0.24]), with the protection afforded after a booster not being significantly affected by the vaccine used for doses 1 and 2. Interpretation: The risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for Omicron compared with Delta cases, with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. The (low) risk of hospital admission in children <10 years of age did not differ significantly by variant, while 60-69 year-olds had an approximately 75% reduced risk of hospital admission with Omicron compared with Delta. Underlying the observed HRs is a larger reduction in intrinsic severity (in unvaccinated individuals) counterbalanced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness.

METHODS: We applied an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach to elicit the impact of NPIs on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate R(0) in Germany. Effectiveness was defined as the product of efficacy and compliance. A discrete, deterministic SEIR model with time step of 1 day, a latency period of 1.8 days, duration of infectiousness of 5 days, and a share of the total population of 15% assumed to be protected by immunity was developed in order to estimate the impact of selected NPI measures on the course of the pandemic. The model was populated with the Delphi-panel results and varied in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Efficacy and compliance estimates for the three most effective NPIs were as follows: test and isolate 49% (efficacy)/78% (compliance), keeping distance 42%/74%, personal protection masks (cloth masks or other face masks) 33%/79%. Applying all NPI effectiveness estimates to the SEIR model resulted in a valid replication of reported occurrence of the German SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A combination of four NPIs at consented compliance rates might curb the CoViD-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Employing an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach can support SARS-CoV-2 modelling. Future curbing scenarios require a combination of NPIs. A Delphi-panel-based NPI assessment and modelling might support public health policy decision making by informing sequence and number of needed public health measures.

However, if children continue mixing with others outside the home during closures, the effect of these measures may be limited.AimThis review aimed to summarise existing literature on children's activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures.MethodsIn February 2020, we searched four databases, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase and Web of Science, from inception to 5 February 2020 for papers published in English or Italian in peer-reviewed journals reporting on primary research exploring children's social activities during unplanned school closures. Main findings were extracted.ResultsA total of 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures, but contact remained common. All studies reported children leaving the home or being cared for by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age (two studies) and parental disagreement (two studies) with closure were predictive of children leaving the home, and mixed evidence regarding the relationship between infection status and such. Parental agreement with closure was generally high, but some disagreed because of perceived low risk of infection and issues regarding childcare and financial impact.ConclusionEvidence suggests that many children continue to leave home and mix with others during school closures despite public health recommendations to avoid social contact.

The purpose of this document is to provide a temporary guide for GDM screening, replacing the current guidelines when it is not possible to implement standard GDM screening because of an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio for pregnant women or when usual laboratory facilities are not available. DATA SYNTHESIS: At the first visit during pregnancy, we must exclude the presence of \\"Overt diabetes\\" in all women. The criteria for the diagnosis of overt diabetes are either fasting plasma glucose &#8805;126 mg/dL, or random plasma glucose &#8805;200 mg/dL, or glycated hemoglobin &#8805;6.5%. When the screening procedure (OGTT) cannot be safely performed, the diagnosis of GDM is acceptable if fasting plasma glucose is &#8805; 92 mg/dL.

The spleen poses specific problems for techniques, such as SILS, due to its volume and texture, and little clinical information is available on the topic. We describe our initial experience using SILS for the management of splenic diseases. METHODS Between December 2008 and September 2009, we attempted SILS in eight patients: four men and four women with a median age of 44 (range, 26-73) years, and body mass index of 24.5 (range, 18-31). Preoperative diagnosis was malignancy (n = 3), ITP (n = 1), HIV-related hypersplenism (n = 1), spherocytosis (n = 1), and splenic cyst (n = 2). SILS was attempted transumbilically in four cases and through a 15-mm subcostal single incision in the other four. As entry port we used either three trocars (one of 12 mm and two of 5 mm) inserted through the single-site incision or the umbilicus, or a multiport (Triport, Olympus) device. Instrumentation used consisted of curved instruments, a flexible-tip 10-mm scope, and the harmonic scalpel. Visualization of the spleen and standard dissection of attachments was accomplished, and splenectomy was completed by stapling of the splenic hilum. The spleen was extracted through the single-site incision. In two cases, unroofing of a splenic cyst was performed transumbilically. RESULTS The SILS procedure was successful in six of the eight patients (75%). Conversion to conventional laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) was required in two patients due to adhesions and spleen size. Median operative time was 97 (range, 60-150) min. There were no postoperative complications, and median stay was 4 (range, 2-5) days. Median spleen weight was 485 (range, 340-590) g. CONCLUSIONS SILS access can be safely used for operative visualization, hilum transection, and spleen removal, further reducing parietal wall trauma.

Re-examining this association using up-to-date data reflecting current and real-world practices, across different global regions and in both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, is important. METHODS We describe the association between serum phosphate and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident dialysis patients between 2008 and 2018 using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. Time-dependent Cox proportionate hazards models were used. Models were adjusted for available covariates and fitted for the overall cohort, and also each dialysis modality. RESULTS 31,989 patients were followed over 97,122 person-years at risk (mean age at first dialysis 61 years, 38% female, 67% haemodialysis). We observed a U-shaped association between serum phosphate and all-cause mortality. In the fully adjusted model, categories of serum phosphate above and below 1.25 - 1.99 mmol/L were associated with progressively higher risk, reaching a hazard ratio of 2.13 (95% CI 1.93 - 2.36, p<0.001) for serum phosphate 2.75mmol/L, and 1.56 (95% CI 1.44 - 1.69, p<0.001) for serum phosphate <1.00mmol/L. Low and high levels of serum phosphate were also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, however the association with high serum phosphate was more pronounced (\\"J-shaped relationship\\"). The associations were consistent across sub-analyses of patients receiving haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatment. CONCLUSIONS In this large contemporary dialysis cohort, both high and low levels of serum phosphate were independently associated with increased risk of mortality. Future studies are required to determine whether treatment of abnormal serum phosphate levels improves mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

The clinical features, severity, duration, and outcome of the disease were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 284 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 48 years (range, 18-80), and 33.80% were female. Common symptoms included fever (85.56%), shortness of breath (49.65%), cough (45.42%), and headache (40.86%). Patients with more than one comorbidity (diabetes and smoking) presented as severe-critical cases compared to healthy patients, diabetics, and smokers. Smokers presented with a lower rate of death in comparison to diabetic patients and diabetic + smoking, furthermore, smoking was less risky than diabetes. Although the mortality rate was high in patients with smokers compared to healthy patients (4.22%, the hazard ratio [HR], 1.358; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.542-1.100; p = .014), it was less than in diabetics (7.04%, HR 1.531, 95% CI: 1.668-1.337, p = .000), and diabetic plus smoker (10.00%, HR, 1.659; 95% CI, 1.763-1.510; p = .000). CONCLUSION: Multiple comorbidities are closely related to the severity of COVID-19 disease progression and the higher mortality rate. Smokers presented as mild cases compared to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients, who presented as severe to critical cases. Although a higher death rate in smokers was seen compared with healthy patients, this was smaller when compared to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients.","output":"Presenting the characteristics, smoking versus diabetes, and outcome among patients hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical models are powerful tools to investigate, simulate, and evaluate potential interventions for infectious diseases dynamics. Much effort has focused on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-type compartment models. These models consider host populations and measure change of each compartment. In this study, we propose an alternative patch dynamic modeling framework from pathogens perspective. Each patch, the basic module of this modeling framework, has four standard mechanisms of pathogen population size change: birth (replication), death, inflow, and outflow. This framework naturally distinguishes between-host transmission process (inflow and outflow) and within-host infection process (replication) during the entire transmission-infection cycle. We demonstrate that the SIR-type model is actually a special cross-sectional and discretized case of our patch dynamics model in pathogens viewpoint. In addition, this patch dynamics modeling framework is also an agent-based model from hosts perspective by incorporating individual hosts specific traits. We provide an operational standard to formulate this modular-designed patch dynamics model. Model parameterization is feasible with a wide range of sources, including genomics data, surveillance data, electronic health record, and from other emerging technologies such as multiomics. We then provide two proof-of-concept case studies to tackle some of the existing challenges of SIR-type models: sexually transmitted disease and healthcare acquired infections. This patch dynamics modeling framework not only provides theoretical explanations to known phenomena, but also generates novel insights of disease dynamics from a more holistic viewpoint. It is also able to simulate and handle more complicated scenarios across biological scales such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Patch dynamics modeling framework from pathogens perspective: Unified and standardized approach for complicated epidemic systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) spike protein with Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cells is a crucial step for the viral entry and infection.

Recently, an association of these autoantibodies with severe COVID-19 was reported in the general population. We assessed whether having pre-existing anti-IFN autoantibodies was associated with COVID-19 infection in SLE patients. METHODS: Patients with SLE who developed COVID-19 between April 1(st) to October 1(st), 2020 were studied. Biobanked pre-COVID-19 plasma from these SLE subjects and healthy controls were tested for anti-IFN IgG autoantibodies by ELISA. The ability of plasma anti-IFN autoantibodies to block signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation by recombinant human IFN in vitro was assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Ten SLE subjects with COVID-19 were identified. A 40% of these subjects had stable autoantibodies against IFN for up to three years preceding COVID-19 diagnosis. A 50% of the subjects with these autoantibodies neutralized IFN induced STAT1 phosphorylation. None of the other SLE samples blocked IFN signaling. CONCLUSIONS: We noted an increased prevalence of pre-existing anti-IFN autoantibodies in SLE patients with COVID-19 compared to the reported prevalence in lupus patients and the general population with severe COVID-19.

Over the years, this simple molecule appears to drive more and more scientific attention perhaps due to a dualism of H2 affirmative features demonstrated in numerous in vitro, animal and human studies on one side, and stillpuzzling mechanism(s) of its biological activity on the other. Up to this point, H2 was scrutinized for more than 170 different disease models and pathologies, and many research groups across the world have lately started to dynamically investigate its conceivable performance-enhancing potential. METHODS: We outlined here the studies indexed in leading research databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, JSTORE) that explored the effects of hydrogen on exercise performance, and also addressed important restraints, open questions, and windows of opportunities for forthcoming research and possible H2 enactment in exercise physiology. About two dozen trials have been identified in this domain, with most published during the past 5 years, while drinking hydrogen-rich water recognized as the most convenient method to deliver H2 in both animal and human studies. RESULTS: Either administered as an inhalational gas, enteral hydrogen-rich water, or intravenous hydrogen-rich saline, H2 seems to favorably affect various exercise performance outcomes and biomarkers of exercise-associated fatigue, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Not all studies have shown corroborative effects, and it appears that the gold-standard protocol for applying H2 in the field of exercise science does not exist at the moment, with studies markedly differ in the dose of H2 administered, the duration of a treatment, and the source of hydrogen. CONCLUSION: H2 is a newfangled and rather effective performance-enhancing agent yet its promising ergogenic potency has to be further validated and characterized in more well-controlled, appropriately sampled and long-term mechanistic trials.

A strategy of in situ-generated coreactant H2O2 and O2 was proposed to enhance luminol ECL intensity. CaO2, possessing a high capacity of self-supplying H2O2 and O2, was encapsulated by ZIF-67, glucose oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase (GOD/HRP-loaded ZIF-67@CaO2). In the presence of glucose, gluconic acid and H2O2 were generated via the catalytic effect of GOD; then, gluconic acid induced the degradation of ZIF-67, leading to the hydrolysis of the unprotected CaO2 to produce both O2 and H2O2. Therefore, the generated coreactants O2 and H2O2, via the oxidation of glucose and the hydrolysis of CaO2, can effectively enhance the luminol ECL behavior. According to the luminol ECL reaction occurring on the anode surface of the ITO BPE, a sandwich immunosensor was fabricated on the anodic ITO BPE and GOD/HRP-loaded ZIF-67@CaO2 as labels incubated with secondary antibodies. Owing to the cathodic reaction rate influencing the anodic reaction rate, Au nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the cathode surface of the ITO BPE, which not only meliorated oxygen reduction but also further enhanced the ECL intensity of luminol.

Few studies, however, have characterized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections in households. METHODS: We conducted a case-ascertained study of household transmission in Nashville, TN starting in April 2020, after recommendations to stay at home were enacted. Index cases were ambulatory patients identified through clinical RT-PCR testing at Vanderbilt walk-in-clinics dispersed across the Nashville metropolitan area. For this study, the index case was the first person presenting with respiratory or compatible symptoms in a household and who lived with at least one other household member. After informed consent was obtained, household members were remotely trained in the self-collection of nasal swabs and use of REDCap electronic questionnaires. Household members completed daily symptom diaries and collected daily nasal swabs for 14 days. Contact patterns within households before and after disease onset were ascertained. Nasal swab samples were tested using RT-PCR at an academic research laboratory. RESULTS: At the time of writing, 18 families were enrolled (including 18 index cases and 34 household members) with at least 1 follow-up nasal swab tested. The median age of index cases and household members was 37 years (IQR: 26C46) and 27 years (15C39), respectively. The median number of days from index patient onset of symptoms to first sample collected in the household was 4 (2C5). Before onset of symptoms, 83% of index cases spent >4 hours in the same room with at least one other household member, whereas after disease onset and diagnosis, 44% did. Among 34 non-index household members, 18 (53%) had a positive test during follow-up; the median number of days from index cases symptoms onset to first positive detection in a household member was 4.5 (3C5) days. Interestingly, 13 (72%) of 18 secondary infections were detected within the first 3 days of follow-up, whereas 5 (28%) were detected during subsequent days. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households is high, with many infections detected during the initial days of study follow-up. DISCLOSURES: Carlos G.

The virus thereby exploits structural disadvantages, rooted partly in historical and contemporary anti-Black sentiments, working against African Americans. These include higher rates of comorbid illness and more limited health care access, higher rates of disadvantageous labor market positioning and community and housing conditions, greater exposure to long-term care residence, and higher incarceration rates. COVID-19 also exposes African Americans greater vulnerability to recession, and possibly greater susceptibility to accompanying behavioral health problems. If they are left unaddressed, the very vulnerabilities COVID-19 exploits may perpetuate themselves. However, continuing and supplementing health and economic COVID mitigation policies can disproportionately benefit African Americans and reduce short- and long-term adverse effects. The greater impact of COVID-19 on African Americans demonstrates the consequences of pervasive social and economic inequality and marks this as a critical time to prevent further compounding of adverse effects.","output":"COVID-19, Social Determinants Past, Present, and Future, and African Americans Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Back pain is a common condition that starts early in life and seems to increase markedly during puberty. A systematic review was performed in order to investigate the link between puberty and back pain, using some Bradford Hill criteria for causality. OBJECTIVES: We sought to obtain answers to the following questions: 1) Is there an association between puberty and back pain? If so, how strong is this association? And do the results remain unchanged also when controlling for age and sex? 2) Are the results of the studies consistent? 3) Is there a doseCresponse, showing a link between the increasing stages of puberty and the subsequent prevalence of back pain? 4) Is there a temporal link between puberty and back pain? DESIGN: A systematic critical literature review. METHODS: Systematic searches were made in March 2014 in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO including longitudinal or cross-sectional studies on back pain for subjects <19 years, written in French or English. The review process followed the AMSTAR recommendations. Interpretation was made using some of the Bradford-Hill criteria for causality. RESULTS: Four articles reporting five studies were included, two of which were longitudinal. 1) Some studies show a weak and others a strong positive association between puberty and back pain, which remains after controlling for age and sex; 2) Results were consistent across the studies; 3) There was a linear increase of back pain according to the stage of puberty 4) Temporality has not been sufficiently studied. CONCLUSION: All our criteria for causality were fulfilled or somewhat fulfilled indicating the possibility of a causal link between puberty and back pain. Future research should focus on specific hypotheses, for example investigating if there could be a hormonal or a biomechanical aspect to the development of back pain at this time of life.

The objective of this study was to explore the e-learning experience of the students of the colleges of health sciences with regard to the technical preparedness, academic achievements, e-learning advantages and limitations. A well-structured and validated questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale and open-ended questions about their e-learning experience was distributed to a heterogeneous purposive sample of the health sciences students in Saudi Arabian universities. RESULTS: Of the 1288 respondents, of various demographical features a relatively higher proportion of 58.2 % agreed that they had enough information about the online learning. However, the proportion who reported receiving adequate guidance, technical support, and having satisfactory hardware and internet access to online learning were 48.1 %, 42, and 35.4 %, respectively. Of all participants, 40.8 % agreed that they had gained a good understanding of their courses learning outcomes. Only 30.0 % agreed that the quality of the online teaching was similar to traditional classes and 56.1 % agreed that the online learning is unsuitable for the medical sciences studies. E-learning advantages mentioned were the flexible accessibility of the learning materials, time, effort, and money saving, acquiring and improving technical and self-learning skills, health safety, interaction without shyness, and better academic accomplishment. On the other hand, disadvantages and difficulties included inadequate tools to facilitate online learning, poor internet connection, lack of technological skills by the educators and students. In addition, there was inadequate or lack of practical classes, lack of a unified clear policy for the conduct of online classes and exams and grade distribution, limited online exam time. CONCLUSIONS: The sudden shift to e-learning without prior preparedness has revealed some pitfalls that need to be adjusted.

This study aims to understand the impact on the initial management of patients with brain tumours by measuring changes to normal multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision making. DESIGN: A prospective survey performed in UK neurosurgical units performed from 23 March 2020 until 24 April 2020. SETTING: Regional neurosurgical units outside London (as the pandemic was more advanced at time of study). PARTICIPANTS: Representatives from all units were invited to collect data on new patients discussed at their MDT meetings during the study period. Each unit decided if management decision for each patient had changed due to COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included number of patients where the decision to undergo surgery changed compared with standard management usually offered by that MDT. Secondary outcome measures included changes in surgical extent, numbers referred to MDT, number of patients denied surgery not receiving any treatment and reasons for any variation across the UK. RESULTS: 18 units (75%) provided information from 80 MDT meetings that discussed 1221 patients. 10.7% of patients had their management changed-the majority (68%) did not undergo surgery and more than half of this group not undergoing surgery had no active treatment. There was marked variation across the UK (0%-28% change in management). Units that did not change management could maintain capacity with dedicated oncology lists. Low volume units were less affected. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had an impact on patients requiring surgery for malignant brain tumours, with patients receiving different treatments-most commonly not receiving surgery or any treatment at all. The variations show dedicated cancer operating lists may mitigate these pressures.

That paradox has important practical implications for the use of the drug Tocilizumab in Covid-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) orchestrates the so-called cytokine storm leading to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the life-threatening condition that is responsible for Covid-19 deaths. However, IL-6 has a paradoxical effect in many viral infections. For pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B for example, mild elevations of IL-6 show a protective effect whereas high elevations show a toxic effect and are associated with higher mortality (e.g. they promote progression to AIDS in HIV patients). IL-6 can be therefore considered as being both a pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Several studies have shown that severe COPD is associated with extremely-high levels of IL-6, whereas mild COPD is associated with mild elevations of IL-6. It is plausible that the chronic, mildly-elevated concentrations of IL-6 found in mild COPD patients is protective against the deterioration of Covid-19, as it is the case for other viral diseases. That may explain why COPD is surprisingly an uncommon comorbidity in Covid-19 intensive care units. This may have an important practical implication for the treatment of Covid-19 patients: our hypothesis is that Tocilizumab must be used exclusively in patients with an ongoing cytokine storm. Otherwise, an early use of Tocilizumab can be harmful, especially in patients affected by COPD or other conditions with mildly-elevated IL-6.","output":"The paradoxical effect of IL-6 and implications for the use of Tocilizumab in Covid-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, long-term nursing care facilities are faced with general and pandemic-specific demands.

Given the pleiotropic downstream function of (h)C5a, it is logical to consider the (h)C5a or its precursors as potential drug targets, and thus, we have been rationally pursuing the idea of neutralizing the harmful effect of excessive (h)C5a, by implementing the repurposing strategies for FDA-approved drugs.

During the pandemic, many construction projects continued because of the need for a priority building that was under construction, such as for a healthcare project. To promote safety under unprecedented circumstances, this paper proposes an intelligent robotic surveillance system that can locate workers and identify whether they are properly wearing masks. The system leverages autonomous terrestrial robots equipped with wide-angle cameras to capture images of their surroundings and a two-dimensional laser scanner for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In this system, the robot is equipped with precise image processing in a well-trained convolutional neural network (VGG16) to recognize workplace entities, particularly workers and their masks, with 83.3% accuracy. Simultaneously, the mounted laser scanner enables the robot to generate the map of the surrounding environment based on the near-real-time Hector SLAM algorithm. In situ recognition would help track workers who improperly use masks and trigger interventions that would diminish the spread of the virus at the construction site. The proposed robotic system will non-intrusively and privately inform workers to use proper protocol to protect them from COVID-19 and other deadly viruses, thereby improving health and safety.","output":"Smart Robotic System to Fight the Spread of COVID-19 at Construction Sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the provision of essential and potentially life-saving procedural treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We surveyed ECT providers across Canada to understand how the first wave of the pandemic affected ECT delivery between mid-March 2020 and mid-May 2020. METHODS: The survey was administered to ECT team members and decision makers at 107 Canadian health care centers with a focus on 5 domains: operations, decision-making, hospital resources, ECT procedure, and patient impact. Responses were obtained from 72 institutions, and collected answers were used to derive representative responses reflecting the situation at each ECT center. For specific domains, responses were split into 2 databases representing the perspective of psychiatrists (n = 67 centers) and anesthesiologists (n = 24 centers). RESULTS: Provision of ECT decreased in 64% centers and was completely suspended in 27% of centers after the onset of the pandemic. Outpatient and maintenance ECT were more affected than inpatient and acute ECT. Programs reported a high level of collaboration between psychiatry and hospital leadership (59%) but a limited input from clinical ethicists (18%). Decisions were mostly made ad hoc leading to variability across institutions in adopted resource allocation, physical location of ECT delivery, and triaging frameworks. The majority of centers considered ECT to be aerosol-generating and incorporated changes to airway management. CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy services in Canada were markedly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The variability in decision-making across centers warrants the development of a rational approach toward offering ECT in pandemic contexts.","output":"Electroconvulsive Therapy in Canada During the First Wave of COVID-19: Results of the What Happened National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to analyze social networks information about the anti-vaccine movement.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 starts with the bonding of the virus to ACE2 receptors expressed in many tissues, and the triggered excessive immune response plays a critical role in the course of the disease. The cytokine storm that occurs upon excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered responsible for the severe progression of the disease and the organ damage. However, the accurate pathophysiological mechanism of the disease, which progresses with various clinical presentations, is still substantially unknown. While various studies have been conducted on the effect of genetic polymorphism on the course and severity of the disease, the presence of a significant effect has not been proven yet. The clinical course of the disease is variable, with clinical representation ranging from 81% mild course to 14% severe course along with 5% critical course in patients. Asymptomatic course is considered to be higher than expected, although its frequency is not known exactly. Older adults and those with comorbidities are exposed to a more severe disease course. The disease progress with various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgia, taste and smell dysfunctions, diarrhea, and headache. A range of complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic conditions, arrhythmia and cardiac events, secondary infections) could be seen during the course of the disease.

Gatekeeper training (GKT) programs are a generally recommended suicide prevention intervention in Japan. For suicide countermeasures, an online program tailored to students may enhance self-efficacy as a gatekeeper. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe a research protocol to investigate the effect of a newly developed internet-delivered online peer GKT program to improve postsecondary student self-efficacy as gatekeepers for suicide countermeasures in Japan. METHODS: This study is a 2-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 (intervention: waiting list) allocation. Participants (n=320) will be recruited, and those who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to the intervention or waiting list control group. An approximately 85-minute, 6-section, internet-based gatekeeper program for postsecondary students has been developed that includes videos to help participants acquire skills as gatekeepers. The intervention group will complete the program within 10 days. The primary outcome, self-efficacy as a gatekeeper, is measured using the Gatekeeper Self-Efficacy Scale at baseline, immediately after taking the program, and 2 months after the survey after completing the program follow-up. To compare the primary outcomes, a t test, where the significance level is 5% (2-sided), will be used to test the intervention effect on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: The study was at the stage of data collection at the time of submission. We recruited participants for this study during August and September 2021, and data collection will continue until December 2021. The data analysis related to the primary outcome will start in December 2021, and we hope to publish the results in 2022 or 2023.

In several animal models of human diseases, MSC-EVs mimic the beneficial effects of MSCs. Influenza viruses cause annual outbreaks of acute respiratory illness resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. Influenza viruses constantly evolve, thus generating drug-resistant strains and rendering current vaccines less effective against the newly generated strains. Therefore, new therapies that can control virus replication and the inflammatory response of the host are needed. The objective of this study was to examine if MSC-EV treatment can attenuate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in a preclinical model. METHODS: We isolated EVs from swine bone marrow-derived MSCs. Morphology of MSC-EVs was determined by electron microscopy and expression of mesenchymal markers was examined by flow cytometry. Next, we examined the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs in vitro in lung epithelial cells and anti-viral and immunomodulatory properties in vivo in a pig model of influenza virus. RESULTS: MSC-EVs were isolated from MSC-conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation. MSC-EVs were round-shaped and, similarly to MSCs, expressed mesenchymal markers and lacked the expression of swine leukocyte antigens I and II. Incubation of PKH-26-labeled EVs with lung epithelial cells revealed that MSC-EVs incorporated into the epithelial cells. Next, we examined the anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties of MSC-EVs. MSC-EVs inhibited the hemagglutination activity of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses at concentrations of 1.25C5 g/ml. MSC-EVs inhibited influenza virus replication and virus-induced apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. The anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs was due to transfer of RNAs from EVs to epithelial cells since pre-incubation of MSC-EVs with RNase enzyme abrogated the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs. In a pig model of influenza virus, intratracheal administration of MSC-EVs 12 h after influenza virus infection significantly reduced virus shedding in the nasal swabs, influenza virus replication in the lungs, and virus-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs of influenza-infected pigs. The histopathological findings revealed that MSC-EVs alleviated influenza virus-induced lung lesions in pigs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated in a relevant preclinical large animal model of influenza virus that MSC-EVs possessed anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties and that EVs may be used as cell-free therapy for influenza in humans.","output":"Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles attenuate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in a pig model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use a regression discontinuity design to study the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on traffic accidents.

Methods We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152. A total of 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each) prepared with 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel, and an Algel only control arm (n=75). Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on day 0 (baseline) and day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity based on the anti-IgG S1 response (detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and wild-type virus neutralization [microneutralization and plaque reduction neutralization assays]). Cell-mediated responses were also evaluated. Results: Reactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events. The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved. One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-g and 6-g Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype. Conclusions BBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2{degrees}C and 8{degrees}C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements.

MK-1654 is a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) under development to prevent RSV infection in infants. Development and validation of methods to predict efficacious doses of neutralizing antibodies across patient populations exposed to a time-varying force of infection (i.e., seasonal variation) are necessary. METHODS: Five decades of clinical trial literature were leveraged to build a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) describing the relationship between RSV serum neutralizing activity (SNA) and clinical endpoints. The MBMA was validated by backward translation to animal challenge experiments and forward translation to predict results of a recent RSV mAb trial. MBMA predictions were evaluated against a human trial of 70 participants who received either placebo or one of four dose-levels of MK-1654 and were challenged with RSV [NCT04086472]. The MBMA was used to perform clinical trial simulations and predict efficacy of MK-1654 in the infant target population. FINDINGS: The MBMA established a quantitative relationship between RSV SNA and clinical endpoints. This relationship was quantitatively consistent with animal model challenge experiments and results of a recently published clinical trial. Additionally, SNA elicited by increasing doses of MK-1654 in humans reduced RSV symptomatic infection rates with a quantitative relationship that approximated the MBMA. The MBMA indicated a high probability that a single dose of  75 mg of MK-1654 will result in prophylactic efficacy (> 75% for 5 months) in infants.

We developed a dynamic photosynthesis model, which incorporates C3 and C4 photosynthesis models that consider stomatal dynamics, to evaluate the contribution of rapid stomatal opening and closing to photosynthesis and WUE. C4 crops showed more rapid stomatal opening and closure than C3 crops, which could be explained by smaller stomatal size and higher stomatal density in plants grown at high nitrogen conditions. Our model analysis indicated that accelerating the speed of stomatal closure in C3 crops to the level of C4 crops could enhance WUE up to 16% by reducing unnecessary water loss during low light periods, whereas accelerating stomatal opening only minimally enhanced photosynthesis.

The spectrum and attributable outcomes of these infections are unknown. METHODS: Using a matched historical cohort design, HARVI cases identified between July 2013 and June 2018 at a large pediatric referral hospital in Dallas, Texas were defined as patients who tested positive for one of eight respiratory viruses during their hospitalization, had new respiratory symptoms develop during hospitalization, and had symptom onset on a hospitalization day that was greater than the maximum incubation period for the specific respiratory virus. Controls were matched 1:1 for index time, meaning that the control had a hospital length of stay that was at least as long as the length of stay in the matched case prior to viral testing. Controls were also matched for year and month of infection as well as hospital unit and/or age. The primary outcome was additional length of stay following infection or index time. Additional outcomes included transfer to intensive care, need for intubation, hospital charges, and all cause in-hospital mortality.

We studied the viral transcriptome in Vero cell-derived SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability of the FCS. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI.

Several relationship dynamic themes emerged from the data, including (1) no change;(2) general relationship changes;(3) emotional changes;(4) decreases in sexuality or sex drive;(5) increases in sexuality or sex drive. Negative effects on relationships stemmed primarily from time demands, stress, and social distancing;these may be positively affected by reductions in the COVID-19 pandemic rates. We also found positive results with increased amounts of time with partners and self-exploration, and uses of technology to bridge distance. Clinicians in both primary care and therapeutic settings may incorporate intimacy into their practice to support the integral nature of intimate relationships for many individuals.

Most healthcare facilities must rely on surrogates of infectivity such as illness duration or nucleic acid amplification (NA). The availability of NA remains limited in many locations, requiring laboratories to alternate platforms to provide uninterrupted support. Regulatory-driven repeat testing further stresses scarce resources. A target gene cycle threshold (Ct) of 24 has been shown to correlate with culture negativity. We sought to evaluate temporal, spatial, and demographic relationships of SARS-COV-2 Ct that could inform local infection control efforts and testing policy. METHODS: From 03-14-20 to 06-01-20, nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients were prospectively tested weekly on an emergency-use authorized laboratory developed assay, or 1 of 3 commercial platforms targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, N, ORF1ab, S, and/or PanSARS-E genes. A regional COVID-19 registry was also queried. RESULTS: 70 inpatients were prospectively evaluated (Table). Mean time to negative was 28.5 days from symptom onset (SO) and 24.1 days from initial test. Initial Ct values were significantly lower compared to those on week 3 (Figure 1). 3.3%, 8.9%, 31.3% and 50.0% tested negative at weeks 1,2,3, and 4 respectively. Trajectories did not differ by race, gender or comorbidity. 13% had isolation precautions (IP) discontinued during admission (mean time to discontinuation 15.8 days; range 12C40). None were linked to new transmissions. 20% reverted to positive after being negative. 0% of a growing number of patients across our health system (27 at time of submission), who have had IP discontinued, were linked to new infections. Data from 180 consecutive patients were available for retrospective evaluation. Mean Ct did not differ between treated-and-released (23.0) and admitted patients (22.6), nor between ward (23.1) and intensive care unit patients (20.2) (all p > 0.4). Table [Image: see text] Figure 1 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Linear regression revealed that a Ct of 24 and negative Ct value will occur 8.8 and 36 days after SO (Figure 2). These findings are consistent with smaller cohorts, and they add to the growing body of evidence that test-driven approaches for maintenance of IP or patient disposition should be reconsidered.

A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.","output":"Hemogram Data as a Tool for Decision-making in COVID-19 Management: Applications to Resource Scarcity Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: elderly frequently present a poly-pathology recurring polypharmacy. Therefore, strict medication adherence is essential to avoid poor health outcomes especially during health crises like the current COVID-19 pandemic. The aims of our study were to identify the predictors of medication non-adherence in elderly and to expose the role of the emergency department (ED) to improve the therapeutic adherence during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: it was a two steps study. Primary, an observational, prospective survey over one month, including 100 elderly patients consulting to the emergency department. Medication adherence was assessed by Morisky's 4-questions scale; predictors of non-adherence have been identified. Secondary, a report of elderly medication management by the emergency physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic confinement. Results: first step: 100 patients, mean age of 738 years. The average number of drugs was 42. Medication non-adherence was reported in 39%, predictors of therapeutic non-adherence were: polypharmacy (OR=2.41; CI95% [1.60;3.61]), rural origin (OR=6.72; CI95% [1.47;30.63]) and metabolic diseases history (OR=5.24; CI95% [1.48;18.53]). In the second step, 816 elder lies were enrolled, mean age: 737 years. The therapeutic attitude in the emergency department was to prescribe the same treatment (60%) to adjust the doses of the drugs prescribed (14%) to stop one or more drugs (13%) or to indicate new treatments (13%). Thirty-five percent of patients were admitted for short-term hospitalization. Conclusion: medication non-adherence is common in elderly, due to several factors.

In a previous study conducted over a 6-year long period (2007-2012), we found that patients with declared -lactam allergy had a higher risk of ESBL bacterial carriage at admission in intensive care unit (ICU), but they had not a higher risk of ESBL bacterial acquisition. We present the final results of the study which was eventually conducted over a 12-year long period (2007-2018). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included all patients admitted in ICU and receiving antibiotic treatment from January 2007 to December 2018. ESBL bacterial acquisition was the main clinical outcome. Mortality in ICU, multidrug resistant bacterial carriage at admission and discharge were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 3332 patients were included, 132/3332 (3.9%) were labelled -lactam allergic, while 3200/3332 (96.1%) did not presented -lactam allergy. No significant difference in rates of ESBL acquisition was detected (4/132, 3% vs. 78/3200, 2.4%; p = 0.17). Patients with -lactam allergy had higher rates of ESBL bacterial carriage at admission (19/132, 14.4% vs. 248/3200, 7.8%, p = 0.01) and at discharge (22/132, 16.7% vs. 351/3200, 11%, p = 0.04) than nonallergic patients. No differences in mortality, duration of hospitalization, and carriage of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus were reported. Female gender was the only factor associated with -lactam allergy at the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that patients with declared -lactam allergy had not a higher risk of ESBL bacterial acquisition during hospitalization in ICU. However, they had a higher ESBL bacterial carriage at admission.","output":"Risk of Multidrug Resistant Bacteria Acquisition in Patients with Declared -Lactam Allergy during Hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit: A Retrospective Cohort Study (2007-2018)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective states govern by some combination of enforcement and voluntary compliance. To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical decision is the extent to which policy makers rely on voluntary as opposed to enforced compliance, and nations vary along this dimension. While enforcement may secure higher compliance, there is experimental and other evidence that it may also crowd out voluntary motivation. How does enforcement affect citizens' support for anti-COVID-19 policies? A survey conducted with 4,799 respondents toward the end of the first lockdown in Germany suggests that a substantial share of the population will support measures more under voluntary than under enforced implementation. Negative responses to enforcement-termed control aversion-vary across the nature of the policy intervention (e.g., they are rare for masks and frequent for vaccination and a cell-phone tracing app). Control aversion is less common among those with greater trust in the government and the information it provides, and among those who were brought up under the coercive regime of East Germany. Taking account of the likely effectiveness of enforcement and the extent to which near-universal compliance is crucial, the differing degrees of opposition to enforcement across policies suggest that for some anti-COVID-19 policies an enforced mandate would be unwise, while for others it would be essential. Similar reasoning may also be relevant for policies to address future pandemics and other societal challenges like climate change.","output":"Enforcement may crowd out voluntary support for COVID-19 policies, especially where trust in government is weak and in a liberal society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a rapidly developing country composed of a multinational population with varying educational backgrounds, religious beliefs, and cultural practices, which pose a challenge for population-based public health strategies. A number of public health issues significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in the UAE. This article summarises the findings of a panel of medical and public health specialists from UAE University and various government health agencies commissioned to report on the health status of the UAE population. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed articles on health in the UAE, and unpublished data were provided by government health authorities and local hospitals. RESULTS: The panel reviewed and evaluated all available evidence to list and rank (1=highest priority) the top four main public health issues: 1) Cardiovascular disease accounted for more than 25% of deaths in 2010; 2) Injury caused 17% of mortality for all age groups in 2010; 3) Cancer accounted for 10% of all deaths in 2010, and the incidence of all cancers is projected to double by 2020; and 4) Respiratory disorders were the second most common non-fatal condition in 2010. CONCLUSION: The major public health challenges posed by certain personal (e.g. ethnicity, family history), lifestyle, occupational, and environmental factors associated with the development of chronic disease are not isolated to the UAE; rather, they form part of a global health problem, which requires international collaboration and action.

METHODS: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2446 chest CTs from 16 institutions (including 1161 COVID-19 patients). Training/validation/testing cohorts included 1011/50/100 COVID-19, 388/16/33 ILD, 189/16/33 other pneumonias, and 559/17/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for the classification of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of airspace opacities. RESULTS: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are the percentage of airspace opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC = 0.83, sensitivity = 0.74, and specificity = 0.79 versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and 0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for other pneumonias, and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness of our method against different compositions of control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia, ILD, and CTs with no pathologies, using quantitative imaging features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and classification performance and, therefore, may be useful to facilitate diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: a? Unsupervised clustering reveals the key tomographic features including percent airspace opacity and peripheral and basal opacities most typical of COVID-19 relative to control groups. a? COVID-19-positive CTs were compared with COVID-19-negative chest CTs (including a balanced distribution of non-COVID-19 pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies). Classification accuracies for COVID-19, pneumonia, ILD, and CT scans with no pathologies are respectively 90%, 64%, 91%, and 94%. a? Our deep learning (DL)-based classification method demonstrates an AUC of 0.93 (sensitivity 90%, specificity 83%).

The impact of locally produced disinfectant with operational training as a means to improve hygiene in resource-limited healthcare facilities and prevent HAI was evaluated. METHOD: In Burkina Faso, 4 types of electro-chlorinator devices that convert salt and water into sodium hypochlorite through electrolysis were installed in 26 healthcare facilities distributed across 3 sanitary districts. The program was evaluated at 4 months and 11 months and performance compared with a control group. RESULTS: After 11 months, over 90% of the facilities applied 8 of the 11 essential hygiene practices defined by the Ministry of Health, compared to 20% in the control group. 61.5% of the healthcare facilities improved the chlorine concentration of their sodium hypochlorite solutions, reaching an average concentration of 5.1 g/L compared to an average of 2.1 g/L in the control group. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that locally produced sodium hypochlorite led to daily savings ranging between 2.7 and 53 euros depending on the device compared with the purchase of chlorine tablets. CONCLUSION: Results, therefore, suggest that electro-chlorinator devices in addition to hygiene sensitization can be a simple, cost-effective and tailored intervention to reduce the prevalence of HAI in low-resource settings.","output":"Preventing nosocomial infections in resource-limited settings: An interventional approach in healthcare facilities in Burkina Faso"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patients persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.","output":"What do surgeons need to know about the digestive disorders and paraclinical abnormalities induced by COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used to treat patients with advanced prostate cancer but is associated with functional decline.

Secondarily, the report highlights the importance of assessing cognitive and emotional health in patients with post-COVID syndrome. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A 37-year-old woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed mild COVID-19 disease but did not require supplemental oxygen or hospitalization. The patient experienced persistent symptoms, including dyspnea, headaches, and cognitive fog. On day 62, they participated in an outpatient physical therapist evaluation that revealed deficits in exercise capacity, obtaining 50% of their age-predicted 6-minute walk distance. They had minor reductions in muscle strength and cognitive function. Self-reported quality of life was 50, and they scored above established cut-off scores for provisional diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: The patient participated in biweekly physical therapist sessions for 8 weeks, which included aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and mindfulness training. Metabolic equivalent for task levels increased with variability over the course of the program. The patient's muscle strength, physical function, and exercise capacity improved. 6-Minute walk distance increased by 199 m, equating to 80% of their age-predicted distance. Quality of life and PTSD scores did not improve. At evaluation after physical therapy, the patient was still experiencing migraines, dyspnea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This case report described the clinical presentation and physical therapist management of a person with post-COVID syndrome, a novel health condition for which little evidence exists to guide rehabilitation examination and interventions. Physical therapists should consider cognitive function and emotional health in their plan of care for patients with post-COVID syndromes.

Compared to other methods of drying plant extracts, lyophilization is costlier due to equipment, material and operational expenses. An alternative method is post-extraction oven-drying, but the effects of this process on extract quality are unknown. In this study, crude extracts from Arthrocnemum macrostachyum shoots were compared using three post-extraction drying methods (lyophilization and oven drying at 40 and 60 C) and two extraction solvents (water and aqueous 50% ethanol). Untargeted metabolomics coupled with chemometrics analysis revealed that post extraction oven-drying resulted in the loss of up to 27% of molecular features when compared to lyophilization in water extracts only. In contrast, only 3% of molecular features were lost in aqueous 50% ethanol extracts when subjected to oven drying. That is to say, ethanol used as a solvent has a stabilizing effect on metabolites and enhances their resistance to thermal transformation in the oven. Collectively, oven-drying of extracts was as effective as lyophilization in preserving metabolites in extracts only when 50% ethanol was used as a solvent.

All participants enrolled in the UMBRELLA cohort between October 2013 and April 2020 were sent a COVID-19-specific survey, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 1051 (66.0%) participants completed the survey. During COVID-19, 284 (27.0%) participants reported clinically relevant increased levels of anxiety and/or depression, i.e., total HADS score &#8805; 12. Participants with anxiety and/or depression reported statistically significant higher barriers to contact their general practitioner (47.5% vs. 25.0%, resp.) and breast cancer physicians (26.8% vs. 11.2%, resp.) compared to participants without these symptoms. In addition, a higher proportion of participants with anxiety and/or depression reported that their current treatment or (after)care was affected by COVID-19 compared to those without these symptoms (32.7% vs. 20.5%, resp.).

Reporting the reduction of in person horse shows and an early assessment of its impact on the economy was the objective of this study. The survey instrument was disseminated to horse show participants through web-based modes and email. A Qualtrics survey was posted on numerous social media pages, including extension, horse shows, and breed associations and was also emailed to the APHA listserv of show participants (n = 251). Most survey respondents were female (n = 240;95.6%) representing a cross-section of US states (n = 42;84.0%). Participants reported planning to attend an average of 9.7 (SD = 7.15) in person horse shows in 2020, and had to miss an average of 4.17 (SD = 3.11) shows due to COVID-19 restrictions as of June 15, 2020. Horse show participants reported spending a mean of $991 (SD = $648.26;Range = $0.00 to $4,000.00) per show and therefore $9,612 annually on horse show-related expenses. Specific expenditures that were collected included lodging (either hotel or RV), fuel, meals, entry fees, stalls/boarding, and miscellaneous. The American Horse Council (2018) reported 1,227,986 horses make up the competition sector. On average, each horse owner shows 1.57 horses (US Equestrian Federation) and therefore horse show participation generates $7.5 billion annually when utilizing this survey's responses of average show expenditures of $991 per show. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the decreased attendance of in person shows from 9.7 to 5.53, resulted in a decrease in annual expenditures with an early estimation of potential economic loss to be $3.23 billion. In this study, the quantified direct effects were then used in the IMPLAN input-output model to estimate the total economic impact of expenditures within the economy. A reduction in economic output of $7.2 billion and a reduction in approximately 50,000 jobs that are directly or indirectly connected to the horse show industry, was the result of decreased attendance of in person horse shows.

METHODS: 119 serum samples were randomly selected by convenience and distributed in the groups: (1) Group with SARS-CoV-2 infection [n=82; RT-qPCR positive (definite, n=70), and probable (n=12)]; (2) other diseases [n= 27; other viruses identified (n=8), SARS of other etiologies (n=19)]; (3) healthy control group (n=10). LFA essays of four manufacturers were compared: MedTest Coronavrus (COVID-19) IgG/IgM (MedLevensohn, Brazil); COVID-19 IgG/IgM ECO Test (Ecodiagnstica, Brazil); Camtech COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test Kit (Camtech Diagnostics Pte Ltd, Singapore); and one Step COVID-19 Test for total antibodies (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech Co, China). RESULTS: The four tests studied showed high diagnostic performance characteristics for the diagnoses of definite or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection. The best measures were for the Wondfo test: sensitivity (86.59%; 95%CI, 77.26-93.11%); specificity (100%; 90.51-100%); DOR (257; 60-1008); LR+ (33.43; 4.82-231.85); LR- (0.13; 0.08 - 0.23); accuracy (90.76%; 84.06- 95.29%); Matthews Correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.82. Although considering only the probable SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR-) cases, all the kits studied showed limited values. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the excellent performance of LFA for the diagnoses of definite or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgM and IgG antibodies among the manufacturers.

AMP modification efficiently delivers CpG to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, immunization with AMP-CpG induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells that produced multiple T helper 1 (TH1) cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma. Antibody responses favored TH1 isotypes (IgG2c and IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than natural convalescent patient COVID-19 responses; T cell and antibody responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose reduction in Spike antigen.

In this work, a health care provider wants to detect infected people as well as people who have recovered from the disease as quickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking process, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection status of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider based on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression for this average difference for given test rates, infection rates and recovery rates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based algorithm to find the test rates that minimize the average difference. We observe that if the total test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally, only a portion of the population may be tested in unequal rates calculated based on their infection and recovery rates. Next, we characterize the average difference when the test measurements are erroneous (i.e., noisy). Further, we consider the case where the infection status of individuals may be dependent, which happens when an infected person spreads the disease to another person if they are not detected and isolated by the health care provider. Then, we consider an age of incorrect information based error metric where the staleness metric increases linearly over time as long as the health care provider does not detect the changes in the infection status of the people. In numerical results, we observe that an increased population size increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently.

Such controversy was also locally and globally generated, especially after being heavily used in COVID-19 treatment protocol. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of three different doses of OP on the liver and kidneys of male adult albino rats through histological approaches, measuring their DNA integrity and biochemical analyses. Different doses of Tamiflu applied to humans were converted to rats, then observed their effects on the liver and kidneys. Rats were divided into four groups. G1: considered as control group. The rest of the three treated groups were received the same calculated dose of Tamiflu (6.75 mg/kg b.w.) in three different durations. G2, G3 and G4 represented the animals orally received OP, in which the rats received OP twice for 5 consecutive days, once for 10 and 45 days, respectively. RESULTS: Our data showed numerous deleterious necrotic and fibrotic histopathological changes in the liver, and kidneys; as well as necrotic DNA smears, by using electrophoresis, in OP-treated rats of G2 and G4. In addition, OP significantly increased the serum cellular hepatic/renal toxicity markers (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, indirect bilirubin, urea, creatinine, uric acid, & Na(+)). Also, it showed a reduction in the levels of serum total protein, albumin and K(+) ions in rats of G2 and G4 compared with G1. In G3, OP treatment did not significantly alter hepatic/renal histological, DNA integrity and biochemical analyses in rats. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic and long-term prophylactic doses of OP most likely cause structural and functional hepato- and nephrotoxicity in experimentally subjected rats. So, caution must be taken during Tamiflu treatment, and not used for long durations and/or with repetitive doses (time- and/or accumulative-dose-dependent); especially with patients suffer from liver and/or kidney dysfunction, while the short-term prophylactic dose of OP appears to be relatively safe and could be explored for oral medications.

Thus, there is a gap regarding what factors would contribute to accentuate the differences in the incidence of COVID-19 among Brazilian cities. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of altitude on the incidence of COVID-19 in Brazilian cities. We analyzed the relative incidence (RI), the relative death rate (RDR) of COVID-19, and air relative humidity (RH) in all 154 cities in Brazil with a population above 200 thousand inhabitants, located between 5 and 1135 m in altitude. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to compare a relationship between altitude with RI and RDR, and between RH with RI and RDR. Altitudes were classified into three classes [low (altitude &#8804; 97 m a. s. l), middle (97 < altitude &#8804; 795 m a. s. l), high (795 < altitude &#8804; 1135 m a. s. l)] for the RI, RDR, and RH variables. To compare the three classes of altitude, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test were used to compare averages (p < 0.05). Our epidemiological analysis found that the RI, RDR, and RH were lower in cities located in high altitudes (795 < altitude &#8804; 1135 m a. s. l) when compared to the middle (97 < altitude &#8804; 795 m a. s. l) and low (altitude &#8804; 97 m a. s. l) cities altitudes. Furthermore, our study shows that there is a negative correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 with altitude and a positive correlation with RH in the cities analyzed. Brazilian cities with high altitude and low RH have lower RI and RDR from COVID-19. Thus, high altitude cities may be favorable to shelter people at risk.

Going beyond BMI, our objective was to study several anthropometric characteristics in relation to the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large population-based sample. Methods 21,376 participants from the French NutriNet-Sant cohort study were included in the main analyses. An ELISA assay was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 1027 participants were positive and 20,349, negative. Associations between a wide range of anthropometric characteristics (body mass index but also waist and hip circumference and body composition) and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were investigated using multi-adjusted logistic regressions. Results A positive yet unclear association was observed between BMI and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in women (positive linear trend (P = 0.07) that was significant using restricted cubic splines (P = 0.04), but no association with standard categories of BMI). No association was observed in men. Waist circumference (P = 0.04) and waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.01) associated with a higher seroprevalence in women while opposite trends were observed in men (P = 0.08 and 0.03 respectively).

Quantifying variants in wastewater offers a cost-effective means to augment these sequencing efforts. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 N1 RNA concentrations and daily loadings were determined and compared to case-based data collected as part of a national surveillance programme to determine the validity of wastewater surveillance to monitor infection spread in the greater Dublin area. Further, sequencing of clinical samples was conducted to determine the primary SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Dublin. Finally, digital PCR was employed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, Alpha and Delta, were quantifiable from wastewater. No lead or lag time was observed between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater and case-based data and SARS-CoV-2 trends in Dublin wastewater significantly correlated with the notification of confirmed cases through case-based surveillance preceding collection with a 5-day average. This demonstrates that viral RNA in Dublin's wastewater mirrors the spread of infection in the community. Clinical sequence data demonstrated that increased COVID-19 cases during Ireland's third wave coincided with the introduction of the Alpha variant, while the fourth wave coincided with increased prevalence of the Delta variant. Interestingly, the Alpha variant was detected in Dublin wastewater prior to the first genome being sequenced from clinical samples, while the Delta variant was identified at the same time in clinical and wastewater samples.

significant number of reported COVID-19 cases can be traced back to superspreader events (SSEs), where a disproportionally large number of secondary cases relative to the standard reproductive rate, R0, are initiated. Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: 'societal' and 'isolated' SSEs. METHODS: We summarise SSEs that have occurred using multiple databases that have been cross referenced to ensure numbers are as reliable as we can ascertain. This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 'Societal' SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, 'isolated' SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) superspreader events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, arisen in Wuhan, China It is very series disease Started with pneumonia of unknown etiology whichhave been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified and isolated by Chinese health authorities on 7 January 2020, and it was sharing the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV,ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lung and ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells This study highlights important questions regarding the pathophysiology, and treatment options of COVID-2019;firstly, is the dry cough associated with the course of illness of COVID-2019 due to the overproduction of bradykinin?

We show that oral application of broad-spectrum antibiotics in mice changed not only diversity, but composition and sharing of gut and vaginal microbiomes in mice and influenced cervical cancer development in an orthotopic tumor model. Antibiotics decreased richness and diversity indexes in the gut but increased them in the vagina. Some beneficial taxa, such as Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae increased their abundance in the vagina while other pathogenic species, such as Proteobacteria, were decreased. As a result of the changes, mice with greater richness and diversity of the vaginal microbiome after antibiotics exposure were less likely developed tumors.

This study systematically reviews the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in COVID-19, especially for diagnosis, estimation of epidemic trends, prognosis, and exploration of effective and safe drugs and vaccines; and discusses the potential limitations. Methods: We report this systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library from inception to 19 September 2020 for published studies of AI applications in COVID-19. We used PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) to assess the quality of literature related to the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. We registered the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020211555). Results: We included 78 studies: 46 articles discussed AI-assisted diagnosis for COVID-19 with total accuracy of 70.00 to 99.92%, sensitivity of 73.00 to 100.00%, specificity of 25 to 100.00%, and area under the curve of 0.732 to 1.000. Fourteen articles evaluated prognosis based on clinical characteristics at hospital admission, such as clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, reaching accuracy of 74.4 to 95.20%, sensitivity of 72.8 to 98.00%, specificity of 55 to 96.87% and AUC of 0.66 to 0.997 in predicting critical COVID-19. Nine articles used AI models to predict the epidemic of the COVID-19, such as epidemic peak, infection rate, number of infected cases, transmission laws, and development trend. Eight articles used AI to explore potential effective drugs, primarily through drug repurposing and drug development. Finally, 1 article predicted vaccine targets that have the potential to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: In this review, we have shown that AI achieved high performance in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, epidemic prediction and drug discovery for COVID-19. AI has the potential to enhance significantly existing medical and healthcare system efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Abdominal wall defects and incisional hernias represent a challenging problem.

In this preliminary study, we evaluated whether there was a relationship between clinical severity of CF siblings and their susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Method: In our preliminary study, we used a targeted transcriptomic approach (CF Profiler Array) obtained from nasal samples of three families who had CF siblings harbouring same mutation but showing different severity of CF phenotype. The siblings were classified as severe or mild CF according to recurrent lung infection, hepatic involvement, and FEV1. Results: In severe CF patients (n = 4) compared to mild patients (n = 3) CXCL1 (FC:-3.53), CXCL2 (FC:-2,16), CXCL8 (FC:-5.41), IL1B (FC:-2.61), SERPINA1 (FC:-2.54), TNFSF10 (FC:-1.73) were found to be downregulated. CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8 play critical role during infection control in neutrophiles that release other chemotactic mediators and recruit leukocytes. Additionally IL1B and TNFSF10 also affect activation of leukocytes. In the case of COVID-19 infection, the expression of these genes increases and leads to a cytokine storm. However our results show that CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, IL1B genes which have a function in IL-17, NFKB, NLRP3 signaling pathways are downregulated in severe CF patients. Significant evidence supports the role of IL-1B, NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation which is a central mediator of severe COVID-19 in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. However, downregulation of inflammatory pathways is detected in severe forms of CF. Conclusion: The results of our preliminary study strengthens the hypothesis that severe forms of CF may constitute an advantage to mild forms of CF in susceptibility to COVID-19 and CXC inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic option for COVID-19 in the future. Further analyses should be performed with larger sample sizes.","output":"P136 Relationship between cystic fibrosis disease severity and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The increased frequency of laparoscopic hepatic resection as a principal or adjunct component of patient care has driven the need for and development of efficient and safe hepatic parenchymal transection technologies. At present, various devices are available for pre-coagulation transection (PCT) of hepatic parenchyma with the intent of minimizing procedure-associated postoperative haemorrhage and bile leak. This report presents the evaluation of a novel bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy device for PCT used for laparoscopic hepatic resection. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatic resection using the Enseal device (SurgRx Inc.) were identified from the prospectively maintained hepatobiliary database. Information on patient demographics, procedures and postoperative complications was collected and analysed; complications were grouped into early (at <30 days) and late (at > or = 30 days) events. RESULTS A total of 18 patients, of whom 13 had malignant tumours (12 colorectal metastases and one hepatocellular carcinoma) and five had benign tumours (two hepatic adenomas and three haemangiomas) underwent 18 hepatic procedures, including two formal hemi-hepatectomies, four left lateral sections, three posterior sections and nine atypical non-anatomic resections. Estimated blood loss did not differ from institutional historical control data; no postoperative haemorrhage, bile leaks or hepatic abscess or necrosis were identified (n = 18).

In this context, this paper determines the main driving forces of renewable energy consumption in European countries during 2000C2018. The annual data for panel regression analysis are retrieved from the OECD. Stat and World Bank Open Data. This empirical analysis employed a set of estimation procedures such as the panel unit root test (Levin, Lin & Chu;Im, Pesaran, Shin W-Stat;ADF-Fisher Chi-square;and PP-Fisher Chi-square methods), the Pearson correlation, fixed- and random-effects models, generalized method of moments (GMM), Hausman and the robustness tests. The results from the Hausman test ratified that the fixed-effects regression model is more suitable for involved panel balanced data. The results of fixed-effects regression and GMM identified the statistically significant and positive relationship between the share of renewable energy consumption of total final energy consumption, GDP per capita, and CO2 emissions per capita for the overall sample. In turn, the total labor force, the gross capital formation, and production-based CO2 intensity are inversely related to renewable energy consumption.

Vegetable trade flows in Romania have become a major concern due to constant trade balance deficits despite the countrys agricultural potential. Taking into account the paradox between what could be considered an abundance of factor endowments and poor trade balance results, the objective of this research was to study the linkage between vegetable trade flows and chain competitiveness. Spatial panel econometric methods were used to study the impact of the international vegetable market on the demand in Romania, while the Balassa index and Porters diamond modelling techniques were used to study the competitiveness of the vegetable chain at both county and national levels. By applying the spatial regression method to the international trade and national production panel data, it was found that an increase in the quantity of vegetables imported into Romania would cause an even greater decrease in national vegetable production. The results show that Romanian vegetable production is highly and negatively influenced by the growing appetite for importstherefore leading to a national dependence on the global vegetable chain. Porters diamond model results confirm that: (a) growing vegetables is profitable in Romania and the average profit margin is higher in this economic sector than in many others;(b) there is a lack of competitiveness caused by the post-communist excessively fragmented agrarian land structure and poor performance of the irrigation, warehousing, and transportation sectors;(c) the national production of vegetables is generally self-sufficient with the exception of three counties that resort to importing and account for more than 70% of Romanias total vegetable imports;(d) factor endowments cannot be fully harnessed, and this contributes to the deepening of the trade balance deficits. Improvement is possible by fostering competitiveness through increasing the performance of supporting industries and the logistics infrastructure, as well as removing market access barriers for the many small farmers.","output":"Vegetable Trade Flows and Chain Competitiveness Linkage Analysis Based on Spatial Panel Econometric Modelling and Porters Diamond Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relevance of the European Union (EU) for health has been widely recognised within the health community for some time, and is increasingly apparent to European policy-makers and publics.

Abstract Introduction And Objectives: We aimed to evaluate how the corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19)* outbreak influenced emergency department (ED)** admissions for urolithiasis, hospitalizations and clinical management of the hospitalized Patients. Patients And Methods: We conducted a multicentric retrospective analysis of ED admissions in three high volume urology departments (one directly involved in COVID-19 patients management and two not involved) in Rome - Italy between March and April 2020 and in the same period of 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted on the number of admissions for urolithiasis, rate of complications, hospitalization and the type of treatment received. Results: 304 patients were included in the analysis. A significant reduction in the global number of patients admitted to ED for urolithiasis between 2019 and 2020 (48.8 %) was noted. Moreover, regarding the choice of treatment of hospitalized patients, a statistically significant increase of stone removal procedures versus urinary drainage was reported in 2020 (p: 0.015). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Rome there has been a significant reduction of emergency admissions for urolithiasis. Patients admitted to ED had more complications, more frequently need hospitalization and regarding clinical management early stone removal was preferred over urinary drainage only. All the urologists should be aware that in the next months they could face an increased number of admissions for urolithiasis and manage more complicated cases.","output":"El impacto del covid-19 en las admisiones al servicio de urgencias, hospitalizaciones y manejo clnico de la urolitiasis en el centro de italia: anlisis multicntrico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias currently represent the fifth most common cause of death in the world, according to the World Health Organization, with a projected future increase as the proportion of the elderly in the population is growing. Air pollution has emerged as a plausible risk factor for AD, but studies estimating dementia cases attributable to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and resulting monetary estimates are lacking. METHODS: We used data on average population-weighted exposure to ambient PM2.5 for the entire population of Sweden above 30 years of age. To estimate the annual number of dementia cases attributable to air pollution in the Swedish population above 60 years of age, we used the latest concentration response functions (CRF) between PM2.5 exposure and dementia incidence, based on ten longitudinal cohort studies, for the population above 60 years of age. To estimate the monetary burden of attributable cases, we calculated total costs related to dementia, including direct and indirect lifetime costs and intangible costs by including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost. Two different monetary valuations of QALYs in Sweden were used to estimate the monetary value of reduced quality-of-life from two different payer perspectives. RESULTS: The annual number of dementia cases attributable to PM2.5 exposure was estimated to be 820, which represents 5% of the annual dementia cases in Sweden. Direct and indirect lifetime average cost per dementia case was estimated to correspond ? 213,000. A reduction of PM2.5 by 1 g/m3 was estimated to yield 101 fewer cases of dementia incidences annually, resulting in an estimated monetary benefit ranging up to 0.01% of the Swedish GDP in 2019. CONCLUSION: This study estimated that 5% of annual dementia cases could be attributed to PM2.5 exposure, and that the resulting monetary burden is substantial. These findings suggest the need to consider airborne toxic pollutants associated with dementia incidence in public health policy decisions.","output":"Annual dementia incidence and monetary burden attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: If the narrative of \\"coronavirus\\" has an underlying theme, it may perhaps for some be one of survival, whilst for others, the theme might be suffering The recurring motif of survival has continued throughout history, yet for the first time the sum of all fears has amounted to a run on the bare essentials This paper seeks to offer an alternative formulation of \\"panic buying,\\" with references to literature, philosophy, and contemporary neurobiology CONCLUSION: The bare essentials disappeared perhaps as part of some self-fulfilling prophecy: the supermarkets became bare because others inadvertently lead us to believe they would become bare The contagion model of emotional propagation provides a psychological model of how \\"panic buying\\" by an individual might lead to the replication of panic in an observer The Polyvagal Theory further informs us of how the threat posed by the pandemic primes our limbic system to perceive danger, and explains how witnessing others engaging in fight-flight responses might evoke a fearful affect in an observer In the end, it is perhaps through Nietzsche's study of classical tragedy that we may find some meaning to the pandemic, allowing our collective lived experience to serve as a template for growth","output":"Gone with the Wind"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who return to hospital after discharge are scarce. Characterization of these patients may inform post-hospitalization care. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who returned to the emergency department (ED) or required readmission within 14 days of discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of SARS-COV-2-positive patients with index hospitalization between February 27 and April 12, 2020, with &#8805; 14-day follow-up. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 discharged alive from five New York City hospitals. MAIN MEASURES: Readmission or return to ED following discharge. RESULTS: Of 2864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared with patients who did not return, there were higher proportions of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%) among those who returned. Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; Padjusted = 0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; Padjusted = 0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, Padjusted = 0.06). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Return to hospital after admission for COVID-19 was infrequent within 14 days of discharge. The most common cause for return was respiratory distress. Patients who returned more likely had COPD and hypertension, shorter LOS on index-hospitalization, and lower rates of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation. Future studies should focus on whether these comorbid conditions, longer LOS, and anticoagulation are associated with reduced readmissions.","output":"Characterization of Patients Who Return to Hospital Following Discharge from Hospitalization for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper offers a contribution to the authors understanding of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on living conditions of Italian households A large part of the research, analysis, comments focused on the relation between the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and income of the Italian households does not capture the extent of the current changes The focus on the highly differentiated impacts of the pandemic on three core dimensions of social integration (the sphere of work, that of welfare and that of the family) could help the authors to grasp the current transformations Design/methodology/approach: The research draws on Castel's distinction between three zones of post-Fordist employment societies with the aim to identify the processes and the conditions that carry individuals from one zones to the other Theoretical considerations are supported by the findings of several qualitative and quantitative research carried out during the pandemic mainly by government agencies and international organizations as OECD and WHO The analysis of healthcare expenditure, labour market and economic conditions of households is based on data of system of health accounts C SHA and from consumer studies undertaken by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) The data on the financial situation and expectations of households during the crisis used in the article were drawn from special surveys carried out by the Bank of Italy Findings: What the authors observe in Italian society is not a collapse of the three pillars of social and system integration of contemporary societies: work, family and welfare The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed two social and institutional trends, that in last two decades had damaged these spheres of life and that seemed relentless First, what has been reversed are: the progressive privatization of welfare and the enhancement of the politics of retrenchment;second, values and styles of life, radical processes of individualization, that undermined mutual relations of support and care, and households' ability to cope with old and new risks At the same time, the pandemic is radicalizing the long-lasting tendency towards job insecurity, a high incidence of low-paid workers and a high proportion of undeclared work The highly differentiated impacts of the pandemic on these three spheres of life are creating a wider plurality of living conditions and risks Social implications: The findings suggest that what the authors need is to reopen the debate on welfare priorities, programmes and areas of intervention, on public-private relationship that have been established in many sectors of welfare in the last decades in many European countries The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance welfare programmes capable of recognising the autonomous capacities of the family and informal relations to produce well-being, to cope with the crisis and to produce supportive relationships Originality/value: The pandemic highlighted that a progressive reduction of expenditure and politics of retrenchment produced welfare not able to face the needs of a large part of households The pandemic highlighted that the changes that have taken place in the sphere of work, welfare and of the family in the last years have produced less and less governable effects ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: economic insecurity and coping strategies of Italian households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak forced hospitals to postpone or cancel surgeries so staff and equipment could be reallocated to intensive care units. However, few studies have measured the impact of the pandemic on surgical activities. This study aimed at quantifying the impact of COVID-19 and lockdowns on surgical activity in a French university teaching hospital. Methods: All surgeries for the period between 01/2017 and 04/2021 were extracted. Seven specific surgeries were selected and classified as urgent (appendectomy, osteosynthesis [hip]) or non-urgent (forefoot & cataract surgery, cholecystectomy, arteriovenous fistula creation and total hip arthroplasty) based on expert opinion. We undertook time-series analyses of the weekly count of surgeries using negative binomial and Poisson regression models to measure the effect of COVID-19-related lockdowns (three lockdown periods: March-May 2020, October-December 2020 and April-May 2021). The effects of all lockdown periods combined were analyzed and we controlled for seasonality and year-related factors. Results: We observed a significant decrease by -24% (p<0.01) in overall surgical activity during lockdown periods. Significant reductions were also noticed for non-urgent surgeries such as total hip arthroplasty, forefoot surgery and cataract surgery, with -38% (p<0.05), -48% (p<0.01) and -64% (p<0.001) respectively. Inversely, a significant increase in urgent osteosynthesis [hip] activity was observed (+46%;p<0.05), while a non-significant augmentation in appendectomies was noted (+24%). Conclusions: Significant decreases in activity were observed for non-urgent surgeries, suggesting those operations were postponed or cancelled so that resources could be reallocated internally. Furthermore, ambulatory surgeries such as forefoot & cataract surgeries were considerably impacted. Conversely, surgeries labelled as urgent seemed unaffected, indicating emergencies were still carried on during lockdowns. Our results highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on surgical activities, but the consequences on patient opportunity losses should also be explored.","output":"POSA401 Impact of COVID-19 on Surgical Activity: Experience from a French University Teaching Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 31 January 2020, World announced COVID-19 as an Emergency Public Health of International Concern The number of patients in Indonesia continues to grow Anti-viral in the COVID-19 Drug Information Laboratory in Indonesia are Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Favipiravir, Remdemsivir, Oseltamivir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxychloroquine Phosphate Therefore, it is necessary to know the basis and management of its use An online systematic search was performed on articles published until 30 March 2020 We use search keywords that are tailored to the purpose of writing All six antivirals were used for the treatment of RNA virus Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir effectively control the SARS-CoV2 virus invitro Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Hydroxychloroquine and Oseltamivir have been used clinically for the treatment of SARS-CoV2 virus In 2020, there are 42 clinical trials of six antivirals Guidance of the antivirus are from China, Belgium and Indonesia Its differences are based on the patient?s condition There is a lack of evidence of six antiviral effectiveness against the SARS-CoV2 virus It has been used for other RNA viruses It is supported by a safety profile In a pandemic situation and the absence of a specific antivirus, the use of the six antiviruses can be done and be useful","output":"Review the Use of Antivirus for COVID-19 Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antiviral strategies for viruses that utilize proteoglycan core proteins (syndecans and glypicans) as receptors should focus on heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis rather than on inhibition of these sugar chains.

Results: Five hundred and eighty-seven studies were yielded, 10 RCTs met criteria. Of the total patient pool, 1001 of 1089 had Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Six studies tested home-based SM exercise, two studies SM education, and one each for diary utilisation and symptom reporting. Fatigue was the most targeted function. Other functions targeted included exercise capacity, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), sleep quality, and symptom burden. Six studies met their primary endpoints (five SM exercise, one SM education). Positive outcomes are described for fatigue, anxiety/depression, sleep quality, self-efficacy, and exercise capacity. With exception to fatigue, early-stage NSCLC, younger age, female, never smokers, partnered patients experienced increased treatment effect. Conclusions: SM interventions improve outcomes among some lung cancer patients. Interventions targeting fatigue yield benefit despite histology, stage or gender and could encourage broader cohort engagement. Consideration of patient characteristics may predict SM effect.

Our approach builds on the direct estimator method of Schneider (1998). In this paper, to test and validate the methodology, we focus on the aperture mass dispersion. After computing the signal and noise for a weighted set of measured ellipticites we show how the direct estimator can be made into a linear order algorithm that enables a fast and efficient computation. We then investigate the applicability of the direct estimator approach in the presence of a real survey mask with holes and chip gaps. For this we use a large ensemble of full ray-tracing mock simulations. By using various weighting schemes for combining information from different apertures we find that inverse variance weighting the individual aperture estimates with an aperture completeness greater than 70 per cent coverage yields an answer that is in close agreement with the standard correlation function approach. We then apply this approach to the CFHTLenS as pilot scheme and find that our method recovers to high accuracy the Kilbinger (2013) result for the variance of both the E and B mode signal, after we correct the catalogue for the shear bias in the lensfit algorithm for pairs closer than 9\\". We then explore the cosmological information content of the direct estimator using the Fisher information approach. We show that there is a only modest loss in cosmological information from the rejection of apertures that are of low completeness.

Obesity also increases pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause chronic tissue damage to vital organs. The standard-of-care does not sufficiently attenuate these inflammatory sequelae. Angiotensin II receptor AT2R is an anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective molecule; however, AT2R agonists are not used in the clinic to treat heart disease. NP-6A4 is a new AT2R peptide agonist with an FDA orphan drug designation for pediatric cardiomyopathy. NP-6A4 increases AT2R expression (mRNA and protein) and nitric oxide generation in human cardiovascular cells. AT2R-antagonist PD123319 and AT2RSiRNA suppress NP-6A4-effects indicating that NP-6A4 acts through AT2R. To determine whether NP-6A4 would mitigate cardiac damage from chronic inflammation induced by untreated obesity, we investigated the effects of 2-weeks NP-6A4 treatment (1.8 mg/kg delivered subcutaneously) on cardiac pathology of male Zucker obese (ZO) rats that display obesity, pre-diabetes and cardiac dysfunction. NP-6A4 attenuated cardiac diastolic and systolic dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but increased myocardial capillary density. NP-6A4 treatment suppressed tubulointerstitial injury marker urinary -NAG, and liver injury marker alkaline phosphatase in serum. These protective effects of NP-6A4 occurred in the presence of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, and without modulating blood pressure. NP-6A4 increased expression of AT2R (consistent with human cells) and cardioprotective erythropoietin (EPO) and Notch1 in ZO rat heart, but suppressed nineteen inflammatory cytokines. Cardiac miRNA profiling and in silico analysis showed that NP-6A4 activated a unique miRNA network that may regulate expression of AT2R, EPO, Notch1 and inflammatory cytokines, and mitigate cardiac pathology. Seventeen pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines that increase during lethal cytokine storms caused by infections such as COVID-19 were among the cytokines suppressed by NP-6A4 treatment in ZO rat heart. Thus, NP-6A4 activates a novel anti-inflammatory network comprised of 21 proteins in the heart that was not reported previously. Since NP-6A4s unique mode of action suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine network and attenuates myocardial damage, it can be an ideal adjuvant drug with other anti-glycemic, anti-hypertensive, standard-of-care drugs to protect the heart tissues from pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine attack induced by obesity.","output":"Suppression of Inflammatory Cardiac Cytokine Network in Rats with Untreated Obesity and Pre-Diabetes by AT2 Receptor Agonist NP-6A4"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We test for the existence of volatility spillovers and co-movements among energy-focused corporations during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, inclusive of the April 2020 events where West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil future prices became negative.

Patient data showed a large variability in radioactivity increment in liver metastases after IA administration compared with IV administration. Renal radioactivity was not significantly lower after IA administration; (177)Lu dosimetry simulations in 1 patient using a maximum kidney radiation dose of 23 Gy showed IA administration resulted in a mean increase in tumor radiation dose of 2.9-fold. CONCLUSION Preclinical and clinical data both indicate that IA administration of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs via the hepatic artery can significantly increase radionuclide uptake in GEPNET, sst2-positive, liver metastases up to 72 hours postinjection, although the effect of IA administration can differ between patients.","output":"[(111)In-DTPA]octreotide tumor uptake in GEPNET liver metastases after intra-arterial administration: an overview of preclinical and clinical observations and implications for tumor radiation dose after peptide radionuclide therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical symptoms, blood laboratory data, O2 saturation and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings are critical factors in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this study, 105 hospitalized patients suspected of having COVID-19 were evaluated. Finally, the laboratory and HRCT and related factors data of 83 confirmed cases by HRCT and RT-PCR were analyzed. To compare the median of quantitative variables in the two groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Also, to determine the factors associated with the positiveness of the HRCT result, a univariate logistic model was fitted. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to test the ability of the final model to predict the positiveness of HRCT result. RESULTS: 61.40% of the patients had a comorbidity disease. 89.20% had fever, 92.00% cough, 91.40% dyspnea. Abnormal CRP was seen in 77.80% of the patients, followed by 66.70% lymphopenia, and 60.30% neutrophilia. Also, ALP (abnormal vs. normal) and score of HRCT assessment variables had a significant effect on the positiveness of HRCT findings. 87.95% had abnormal HRCT with 41% bilateral multi lobar patchy ground glass opacity (GGO). Moreover, there was a statistically significant association between the level of O2 saturation and HRCT results.

Methods: 120 male and female participants working in Ain-Shams University and Ministry of health and population hospitals who had been infected with COVID-19 virus at least 3 months ago were recruited. Presenting symptoms, staging, medications, symptoms 1 month and more than 3 months after infection were recorded. Results: The study participants aged between 23 and 62 years. fever was the most common presentation 57.5% followed by body aches in 44.2% and then anosmia in 41.7% of participants. Cough, dyspnea, fatigue and diarrhea were present in 37.5%, 33.3%, 35% and 19.2% respectively. Facial palsy and transient ischemic attack were presented each in one participant. Five participants experienced myocardial and pulmonary infarctions. Still 26.7% and 33.3% had dyspnea and fatigue after 3 months, 3 participants received antidepressants, 4 had memory problems. Parosmia, hair loss, oral ulcers and syncopal attacks emerged months after recovery. Odds ratio for symptoms after 3 months was 2.4 higher in participants aged  35 years.

Rodent research studies have shown promising results with cell transplantation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSC) in a bioengineered conduit, as an alternative strategy for nerve regeneration. To achieve meaningful clinical translation, cell therapy must comply with biosafety. Cell extraction and expansion methods that use animal-derived products, including enzymatic adipose tissue dissociation and the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a culture medium supplement, have the potential for transmission of zoonotic infectious and immunogenicity. Human-platelet-lysate (hPL) serum has been used in recent years in human cell expansion, showing reliability in clinical applications. METHODS: We investigated whether hADSC can be routinely isolated and cultured in a completely xenogeneic-free way (using hPL culture medium supplement and avoiding collagenase digestion) without altering their physiology and stem properties. Outcomes in terms of stem marker expression (CD105, CD90, CD73) and the osteocyte/adipocyte differentiation capacity were compared with classical collagenase digestion and FBS-supplemented hADSC expansion. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between the two examined extraction and culture protocols in terms of cluster differentiation (CD) marker expression and stem cell plasticity, while hADSC in hPL showed a significantly higher proliferation rate when compared with the usual FBS-added medium. Considering the important key growth factors (particularly brain-derived growth factor (BDNF)) present in hPL, we investigated a possible neurogenic commitment of hADSC when cultured with hPL. Interestingly, hADSC cultured in hPL showed a statistically higher secretion of neurotrophic factors BDNF, glial cell-derived growth factor (GDNF), and nerve-derived growth factor (NFG) than FBS-cultured cells. When cocultured in the presence of primary neurons, hADSC which had been grown under hPL supplementation, showed significantly enhanced neurotrophic properties. CONCLUSIONS: The hPL-supplement medium could improve cell proliferation and neurotropism while maintaining stable cell properties, showing effectiveness in clinical translation and significant potential in peripheral nerve research.","output":"Human platelet lysate as a potential clinical-translatable supplement to support the neurotrophic properties of human adipose-derived stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with several short- and long-term negative impacts on the well-being of older adults.

Objectives were to determine (1) psychological distress before and throughout the pandemic; (2) changes in day-to-day functioning; and (3) the percentage of adults with congenital heart disease who experienced COVID-19 related symptoms, underwent testing, and tested positive. Methods and Results This was a cross-sectional study paired with retrospective chart review. A web-based survey was distributed to patients between December 2020 and January 2021. Patients reported on psychological distress across 5 categories (Screening Tool for Psychological Distress; depression, anxiety, stress, anger, and lack of social support), whether they experienced symptoms of COVID-19 and/or sought testing, and changes to their work and social behavior. Five hundred seventy-nine survey responses were received, of which 555 were linked to clinical data. Patients were aged 4515 years. The proportion of patients reporting above-threshold values for all Screening Tool for Psychological Distress items significantly increased during the early pandemic compared with before the pandemic. Stress returned to baseline in December 2020/January 2021, whereas all others remained elevated. Psychological distress decreased with age, and women reported persistently elevated stress and anxiety compared with men during the pandemic.

Purpose To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of MRI LME in MS and other neurological diseases. Materials and Methods In a comprehensive literature search in Medline, Scopus, and Embase, out of 2292 publications, 459 records assessing LME in neurological diseases were eligible for qualitative synthesis. Of these, 135 were included in a random-effects model meta-analysis with subgroup analyses for MS. Results Of eligible publications, 161 investigated LME in neoplastic neurological (n=2392), 91 in neuroinfectious (n=1890), and 75 in primary neuroinflammatory diseases (n=4038). The LME-proportions for these disease classes were 0.47 [95%-CI: 0.37C0.57], 0.59 [95%-CI: 0.47C0.69], and 0.26 [95%-CI: 0.20C0.35], respectively. In a subgroup analysis comprising 1605 MS cases, LME proportion was 0.30 [95%-CI 0.21C0.42] with lower proportions in relapsing-remitting (0.19 [95%-CI 0.13C0.27]) compared to progressive MS (0.39 [95%-CI 0.30C0.49], p=0.002) and higher proportions in studies imaging at 7T (0.79 [95%-CI 0.64C0.89]) compared to lower field strengths (0.21 [95%-CI 0.15C0.29], p<0.001). LME in MS was associated with longer disease duration (mean difference 2.2 years [95%-CI 0.2C4.2], p=0.03), higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (mean difference 0.6 points [95%-CI 0.2C1.0], p=0.006), higher T1 (mean difference 1.6ml [95%-CI 0.1C3.0], p=0.04) and T2 lesion load (mean difference 5.9ml [95%-CI 3.2C8.6], p<0.001), and lower cortical volume (mean difference ?21.3ml [95%-CI ?34.7C-7.9], p=0.002). Conclusions Our study provides high-grade evidence for the substantial presence of LME in MS and a comprehensive panel of other neurological diseases. Our data could facilitate differential diagnosis of LME in clinical settings. Additionally, our meta-analysis corroborates that LME is associated with key clinical and imaging features of MS.

Summary statement Our systematic review and meta-analysis synthesize leptomeningeal enhancement proportions across a comprehensive panel of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, and assesses its prognostic value in multiple sclerosis. Summary data Leptomeningeal enhancement (LME) is a nonspecific imaging feature present across many neurological disorders, including neoplasm, infection, and primary neuroinflammation. The presence of LME is associated with worse clinical and imaging outcomes in multiple sclerosis, justifying its ascertainment in clinical practice. Neuroinflammatory animal models can be used to further investigate the pathophysiology of LME, including its pathological tissue signature and/or its association with cortical pathology.","output":"Leptomeningeal Enhancement in Multiple Sclerosis and Other Neurological Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world remains cautiously optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine that is relatively safe and efficacious and that offers sufficient long-lasting protection/immunity by neutralizing the virus infectivity.

The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.

Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through an online questionnaire administered to 75 Grade 1C12 science/STEM teachers in a Canadian province in MayCJuly 2020. Through the TPACK framework and self-efficacy theory, the authors explore i) curriculum planning and implementation in online settings, ii) assessment practices and their effectiveness, and iii) student outcomes, as observed by the teachers. Results indicate that teachers used a variety of platforms, and choice of platform was mainly due to user-friendliness and interactivity, or administrative decision making. Despite teachers organizing online lessons during ERT, gaps were identified in teachers TPACK framework and self-efficacy, thus impacting their curriculum development, pedagogical approaches, and assessment practices. In general, teaching strategies included pre-recorded videos and self-directed learning in which teachers assigned specific tasks for students to perform independently. Teachers prioritized subject content and covering curriculum objectives over creative and student-centered pedagogical approaches. Assessment techniques employed were viewed by teachers as unauthentic and generally ineffective. Moreover, teachers reported difficulties addressing student needs and abilities, resulting in challenges providing equitable and inclusive online teaching.

CPET can distinguish between a normal and an abnormal exercise response and usually identifies which of multiple pathophysiological conditions alone or in combination is the leading cause of exercise intolerance. Therefore, it improves diagnostic accuracy and patient health care by directing more targeted diagnostics and facilitating treatment decisions.

The mechanochemical cycle of kinesins is well described, but how they establish cargo specificity is not fully understood. Transport of oskar mRNA to the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte is mediated by Drosophila kinesin-1, also called kinesin heavy chain (Khc), and a putative cargo adaptor, the atypical tropomyosin, aTm1. How the proteins cooperate in mRNA transport is unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of a Khc-aTm1 complex. The proteins form a tripartite coiled coil comprising two in-register Khc chains and one aTm1 chain, in antiparallel orientation. We show that aTm1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved cargo binding site on Khc, and mutational analysis confirms the importance of this interaction for mRNA transport in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Khc binds RNA directly and that it does so via its alternative cargo binding domain, which forms a positively charged joint surface with aTm1, as well as through its adjacent auxiliary microtubule binding domain. Finally, we show that aTm1 plays a stabilizing role in the interaction of Khc with RNA, which distinguishes aTm1 from classical motor adaptors.","output":"Molecular basis of mRNA transport by a kinesin-1-atypical tropomyosin complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In SARS-CoV-2 infection there is an urgent need to identify patients that will progress to severe COVID-19 and may benefit from targeted treatment.

However, the multidimensional nature of structural racism is not captured by existing measures used by population health scholars to study health inequities. Multidimensional measures can be made using complex analytical techniques. Whether or not the multidimensional measure of structural racism provides more insight than the existing unidimensional measures is unknown. METHODS: We derived measures of Black-White residential segregation, inequities in education, employment, income, and homeownership, evaluated for 2,338 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) in the United States (US), and consolidated them into a multidimensional measure of structural racism using a latent class model. We compared the median COVID-19 vaccination rates observed across 54 New York City (NYC) PUMAs by levels (high/low) of structural racism and the multidimensional class using the Kruskal-Wallis test. This study was conducted in March 2021. FINDINGS: Our latent class model identified three structural racism classes in the US, all of which can be found in NYC. We observed intricate interactions between the five dimensions of structural racism of interest that cannot be simply classified as high (i.e., high on all dimensions of structural racism), medium, or low. Compared to Class A PUMAs with the median rate of two-dose completion of 69%, significantly lower rates were observed for Class B PUMAs (55%, p = 004) and Class C PUMAs (52%, p = 001). When the vaccination rates were evaluated based on each dimension of structural racism, significant differences were observed between PUMAs with high and low Black-White income inequity only (72% vs. 53%, p = 0001).

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident.

METHOD: All patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT performed within 10 days of symptom onset between March 1 st and April 15th 2020 were retrospectively identified from two tertiary care hospitals. 12 CT features, their distribution in the lung and the global extent of opacifications were evaluated. For analysis of prognosis two compound outcomes were defined: positive outcome was defined as either discharge or regular ward care; negative outcome was defined as need for mechanical ventilation, treatment on intensive care unit, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or death. Follow-up was performed until June 19th. For statistical analysis uni- und multivariable logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS: 64 patients were included in the study. By univariable analysis the following parameters predicted a negative outcome: consolidation (p = 0.034), crazy paving (p = 0.004), geographic shape of opacification (p = 0.022), dilatation of bronchi (p = 0.002), air bronchogram (p = 0.013), vessel enlargement (p = 0.014), pleural effusion (p = 0.05), bilateral disease (p = 0.004), involvement of the upper lobes (p = 0.004, p = 0.015) or the right middle lobe (p < 0.001) and severe extent of opacifications (p = 0.002).

Available evidence suggests school-based interventions reduce bullying prevalence rates. This study aims to test the efficacy of a web-enabled, school-based, multicomponent anti-bullying intervention to prevent school bullying and to assess its effects on mental health and quality of life. Methods and analysis: Cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in 20 publicly funded primary and secondary schools in Madrid, Spain. Schools are randomly allocated to either the intervention arm (n = 10) or conventional practices arm (n = 10). The web-enabled intervention (LINKlusive) lasts ~12 weeks and consists of three main components: (i) an online training program for teachers and parents, (ii) a web-guided educational program for students, focusing on promoting respect for diversity, empathy, and social skill development, and (iii) a web-guided, teacher-delivered, targeted intervention program for bullying situations identified based on peer-support strategies and individual intervention for those involved (i.e., bullying victims and perpetrators). The primary objective is to compare differences between peer-reported bullying victimization in the intervention and control arms at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures are additional measures of bullying victimization and perpetration, mental health symptoms, self-esteem, and quality of life. A follow-up assessment is conducted 1 year after the end of the intervention. Treatment effects will be tested using multilevel mixed models, adjusting for school-, classroom-, and student-related covariates. Considering the increased bullying rates in children with special educational needs, a specific subgroup analysis will test the efficacy of the intervention on bullying prevalence, mental health, and quality of life in this particularly vulnerable population.

The incidence of MetS often parallels the incidence of obesity and it is even worst among people living with comorbidities like; HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and mental illness. Therefore, there was an urgent need to summarize the extent and risk factors of MetS in Ethiopia. Methodology This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guideline to investigate the prevalence of MetS and contributing factors. English language-based databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) were exhaustively searched to identify studies related to the prevalence of MetS. A random-effects model was employed to estimate the pooled prevalence of MetS, and it was computed using STATA 16.0 software. Heterogeneity analysis was reported using I2. Result A total of 25 studies with 21,431 study participants were included for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MetS was 30.0% (95% CI: 24.0-36.0%, I2 = 99.19%, p < 0.001) with a high degree of heterogeneity across studies. Subgroup analysis with the target population showed that metabolic syndrome was most prevalent among type II diabetic 56% (95% CI: 47 - 64) and hypertensive patients 44% (95% CI: 35 - 53). Increased age, female gender, being overweight and obese, having a high educational level and income, physical inactivity, and being on treatment of chronic diseases like, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and HIV/AIDS were the most frequently reported risk factors of MetS regardless of the study population. Conclusion The prevalence of the MetS is high and rising in Ethiopia.

Diseases in individuals which offer some commercial value are often well documented and subsequently well studied in comparison to those wild groups offering little commercial gain. This is particularly the case with those associated with mariculture or the commercial fisheries. Specifically, these include many Holothuroidea, and numerous crustacea and mollusca species. Pathogens/parasites consisting of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes from all groups have been associated with diseases from such organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Viral pathogens in particular, appear to be an increasingly important group and research into this group will likely highlight a larger number of diseases and pathogens being described in the near future. Interestingly, although there are countless examples of the spread of disease usually associated with transportation of specific infected hosts for development of aquaculture practices, this process appears to be continuing with no real sign of effective management and mitigation strategies being implicated. Notably, even in well developed countries such as the UK and the US, even though live animal trade may be well managed, the transport of frozen food appears to be less well so and as evidence suggests, even these to have the potential to transmit pathogens when used as a food source for example.","output":"Diseases in marine invertebrates associated with mariculture and commercial fisheries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Hospice utilization metrics are essential for any serious effort to improve end-of-life care in oncology. However, oncologists do not routinely receive these personalized reports. We evaluated whether a behavioral science intervention, using peer comparisons coupled with social norms, was associated with improvements in hospice use. METHODS Oncologists at two academic practices of Johns Hopkins Medicine were randomly assigned to receive a peer comparison report by e-mail displaying individual hospice utilization metrics compared with top-performing peers or to receive no report. The data accrued for the intervention represented hospice utilization for the previous calendar year. The intervention period was from June 1, 2020, to December 30, 2020, and included oncologists from both the solid and hematologic malignancies programs. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients between groups with short hospice length of stay (LOS; defined as  7 days) after 6 months. Secondary outcomes included hospice referral rate, enrollment rate, and median LOS. RESULTS Forty-seven oncologists participated. The percent of patients with a short hospice stay in the intervention group was lower (17.4%) compared with patients treated by physicians in the usual care group (46.3%, difference = 21.8%; 95% CI, 16.0 to 41.6; P < .001). Receipt of peer comparisons was associated with a greater likelihood of enrolling in hospice (73.7% v 42.8%; difference = 31.1%; 95% CI, 20.4 to 41.7; P < .001) and a longer hospice LOS (37.2 v 18.3 days; difference = 17.2; 95% CI, 8.8 to 25.7 days; P < .001).

Two young men were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which was inexplicable at that time, as these health outcomes were rare among their age, race/ethnicity, and individuals not living in nursing homes. Subsequently, it was found that after infection with HIV, individuals were asymptomatic up to 4 weeks and if symptoms developed, they appeared as a simple type of flu. The progression and global proliferation of the HIV pandemic is mirrored by the spread of Zika virus (ZikaV). Humans were probably first infected with HIV in the Kinshasa region in the 1940s and ZikaV was first detected in humans in the Zika forest in the 1950s. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes transmit ZikaV, an arbovirus, as well as other related arboviruses. In addition to mosquito transmission, ZikaV transmission occurs through sexual risk and blood transfusions. The latter two risk factors were prominent modes of transmission during the early stages of HIV/AIDS epidemic and sexual transmission risk remains prominent. In addition, injection drug use is a risk factor to become HIV infected. For HIV, blood transfusion risk was reduced after appropriate testing of blood supplies. Unlike HIV, ZikaV does not produce significant symptoms that require medical attention among four-fifths of infected individuals. Indeed, initially considered a relatively benign virus, the unexpected emergence of ZikaV in the Americas since 2015, and continuing as a virulent and pathological virus for children and adults, created a sense of fear and distress. These emotional responses parallel the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

We previously showed that a single inducible phospholipase, PLA2G2D, is associated with a proresolving/antiinflammatory response in the lungs, and increases with age. Survival was increased in naive Pla2g2d-/- mice infected with SARS-CoV resulting from augmented respiratory dendritic cell (rDC) activation and enhanced priming of virus-specific T cells. Here, in contrast, we show that intranasal immunization provided no additional protection in middle-aged Pla2g2d-/- mice infected with any of the 3 pathogenic human coronaviruses because virtually no virus-specific antibodies or follicular helper CD4+ T (Tfh) cells were produced. Using MERS-CoV-infected mice, we found that these effects did not result from T or B cell intrinsic factors. Rather, they resulted from enhanced, and ultimately, pathogenic rDC activation, as manifested most prominently by enhanced IL-1? expression. Wild-type rDC transfer to Pla2g2d-/- mice in conjunction with partial IL-1? blockade reversed this defect and resulted in increased virus-specific antibody and Tfh responses.

Success with this method requires a high affinity interaction between the antibody and the target. We now show that reduction in the affinity (dematuration) of the anti-active RAS antibody facilitates the screening of a chemical library using an in vitro AlphaScreen method. This identified active RAS specific-binding Abd compounds that inhibit the RAS-antibody interaction. One compound is shown to be a pan-RAS binder to KRAS, HRAS and NRAS-GTP proteins with a Kd of average 37 mM, offering the possibility of a new chemical series that interacts with RAS in the switch region where the intracellular antibody binds. This simple approach shows the druggability of RAS and is generally applicable to antibody-derived chemical library screening by affording flexibility through simple antibody affinity variation.

The objective of this study is to identify the clinical and laboratory variables as predictors of in-hospital death at the time of admission in a tertiary care hospital in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic profile, clinical, and laboratory variables of 425 patients admitted from April to June 2020 with symptoms and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were studied. Descriptive statistics, an association of these variables, logistic regression, and CART models were developed to identify early predictors of in-hospital death. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (5.17%) had expired in course of their hospital stay. The median age [interquartile range (IQR)] of the patients admitted was 49 years (21C77 years). Gender distribution was male  73.38% (mortality rate 5.83%) and female26.62% (mortality rate 3.34%). The study shows higher association for age (>47 years) [odds ratio (OR) 4.52], male gender (OR 1.78), shortness of breath (OR 2.02), oxygen saturation <93% (OR 9.32), respiratory rate >24 (OR 5.31), comorbidities like diabetes (OR 2.70), hypertension (OR 2.12), and coronary artery disease (OR 3.18) toward overall mortality. The significant associations in laboratory variables include lymphopenia (<12%) (OR 8.74), C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.99), ferritin (OR 3.18), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 3.37). Using this statistically significant 16 clinical and laboratory variables, the logistic regression model had an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.86 (train) and 0.75 (test).

However, there is a lack of authoritative data to define a fever when an NCIT is used and previous studies have shown that NCIT readings fluctuate widely depending on ambient temperatures and the body surface site screened. The aim of this study was to establish cut-off points for normal temperatures of different body sites (neck, forehead, temples, and wrist) and investigate the accuracy of NCITs at various ambient temperatures to improve the standardization and accuracy of fever screening. Patients and Methods A prospective investigation was conducted among 904 participants in the outpatient and emergency departments of Chengdu Womens and Childrens Central Hospital. Body temperature was measured using NCITs and mercury axillary thermometers. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the accuracy of body temperature detection at the four body surface sites. Data on participant characteristics were also collected. Results Among the four surface sites, the neck temperature detection group had the highest accuracy. When the neck temperature was 37.35C as the optimum fever diagnostic threshold, the sensitivity was 0.866. The optimum fever diagnostic thresholds for forehead, temporal, and wrist temperature were 36.65C, 36.65C, and 36.75C, respectively. Moreover, triple neck temperature detection had the highest sensitivity, up to 0.998, whereas the sensitivity of triple wrist temperature detections was 0.949. Notably, the accuracy of NCITs significantly reduced when the temperature was lower than 18C. Conclusion Neck temperature had the highest accuracy among the four NCIT temperature measurement sites, with an optimum fever diagnostic threshold of 37.35C.

N = 96 teachers from both special schools and inclusive schools were involved in the study and were asked to complete a self-report online questionnaire. The study follows an exploratory design to give a first overview of the experiences of teachers of students with SEN and their TSE during the school closures and distance learning. Results showed that no major difference in overall teaching experiences could be found between teachers teaching at special schools or inclusive schools. The identification of difficulties in reading at distance and the support of students with difficulties in reading at distance was perceived by the teachers as most difficult. Difficulties in writing was being rated significantly less easy to identify at distance than difficulties in mathematics. Further, the support of students with difficulties in mathematics was perceived as being significant more challenging than the identification of difficulties in mathematics. TSE in distance learning was rather low, regardless if the teachers taught at a special school or inclusive school in this time period. TSE correlated positively with the perceived goodness of identification of difficulties and support of students with difficulties in reading, writing, and mathematics. Possible reasons and implications are discussed as well as implications of the overall results for distance learning of students with SEN.","output":"Experiences and Perceived Self-Efficacy in Distance Learning Among Teachers of Students With Special Educational Needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives. To quantify the relationship between the segregation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx communities and COVID-19 testing sites in populous US cities. Methods. We mapped testing sites as of June 2020 in New York City; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Houston, Texas; we applied Bayesian methods to estimate the association between testing site location and the proportion of the population that is Black, Latinx, or Indigenous per block group, the smallest unit for which the US Census collects sociodemographic data. Results. In New York City, Chicago, and Houston, the expected number of testing sites decreased by 1.29%, 3.05%, and 1.06%, respectively, for each percentage point increase in the Black population. In Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles, testing sites decreased by 5.64%, 1.95%, and 1.69%, respectively, for each percentage point increase in the Latinx population. Conclusions. In the largest highly segregated US cities, neighborhoods with more Black and Latinx residents had fewer COVID-19 testing sites, likely limiting these communities' participation in the early response to COVID-19.

A process in which CD3(+) T cells carry PEDV plays a key role. However, the modes through which PEDV bridles CD3(+) T cells as a vehicle for migration to the intestinal epithelium have not been clarified. In this study, we first demonstrated that PEDV could survive in blood-derived CD3(+) T cells for several hours, depending on the multiplicity of infection. In addition, PEDV preferentially survived in CD4(+) T cells over CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, viral transmission was mediated by cell-to-cell contact between mesenteric lymph-node-derived CD3(+) T cells, but did not occur in blood-derived CD3(+) T cells. Following an increase in gut-homing integrin 47, blood-derived CD3(+) T cells carrying PEDV migrated to the intestines via blood circulation and transferred the virus to intestinal epithelial cells through cell-to-cell contact in neonatal piglets. Our findings have significant implications for understanding PEDV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets, which is essential for developing innovative therapies to prevent PEDV infection.","output":"The Mechanism of PEDV-Carrying CD3(+) T Cells Migrate into the Intestinal Mucosa of Neonatal Piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Early detection and monitoring of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients are key to tackling dementia and providing benefits to patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and society. We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA); a 5-min, language independent computerised cognitive test that employs an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to improve its accuracy in detecting cognitive impairment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the generalisability of the ICA in detecting cognitive impairment in MCI and mild AD patients. Methods: We studied the ICA in 230 participants. 95 healthy volunteers, 80 MCI, and 55 mild AD participants completed the ICA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) cognitive tests. Results: The ICA demonstrated convergent validity with MoCA (Pearson r=0.58, p<0.0001) and ACE (r=0.62, p<0.0001). The ICA AI model was able to detect cognitive impairment with an AUC of 81% for MCI patients, and 88% for mild AD patients. The AI model demonstrated improved performance with increased training data and showed generalisability in performance from one population to another. The ICA correlation of 0.17 (p = 0.01) with education years is considerably smaller than that of MoCA (r = 0.34, p < 0.0001) and ACE (r = 0.41, p < 0.0001) which displayed significant correlations. In a separate study the ICA demonstrated no significant practise effect over the duration of the study. Discussion: The ICA can support clinicians by aiding accurate diagnosis of MCI and AD and is appropriate for large-scale screening of cognitive impairment.

Due to unprecedented shortages in N95 respirators, many healthcare systems have explored reprocessing of N95 respirators. Data supporting these approaches are lacking in real hospital settings. In particular, published studies have not yet reported an evaluation of multiple viruses, bacteria, and fungi along with respirator filtration and fit in a single, full-scale study. Objective: We initiated a full-scale study to evaluate different N95 FFR decontamination strategies and their impact on respirator integrity and inactivating multiple microorganisms, with experimental conditions informed by the needs and constraints of the hospital. Methods: We explored several reprocessing methods using new 3MTM 1860 N95 respirators, including dry (<10% relative humidity) and moist (62-66% relative humidity) heat (80-82 oC) in the drying cycle of industrial instrument washers, ethylene oxide (EtO), pulsed xenon UV (UV-PX), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), and vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Respirator samples were treated and analyzed for biological indicator inactivation using four viruses (MS2, phi6, influenza A virus, murine hepatitis virus), three bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus), and the fungus Aspergillus niger. The impact of different application media was also evaluated. In parallel, decontaminated respirators were evaluated for filtration integrity and fit. Results: VHP resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all tested biological indicators. The combination of UV-PX + moist heat resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all biological indicators except G. stearothermohphilus. Greater than 95% filtration efficiency was maintained following 2 (UV-PX + <10% relative humidity heat) or 10 (VHP) cycles of treatment, and proper fit was also preserved. UV-PX + dry heat was insufficient to inactivate all biological indicators. Although very effective at virus decontamination, HPGP resulted in decreased filtration efficiency after 3 cycles, and EtO treatment raised potential toxicity concerns. The observed inactivation of viruses with UV-PX, heat, and hydrogen peroxide treatments varied as a function of which culture media (PBS buffer or DMEM) they were deposited in. Conclusions and Relevance: High levels of biological indicator inactivation were achieved following treatment with either moist heat or VHP. These same treatments did not significantly impact mask filtration or fit. Hospitals have a variety of scalable options to safely reprocess N95 masks. Beyond value in the current Covid-19 pandemic, the broad group of microorganisms and conditions tested make these results relevant in potential future pandemic scenarios.","output":"Validation of N95 filtering facepiece respirator decontamination methods available at a large university hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Regulation is a critical function in the governance of health workforces. In many countries, regulatory councils for health professionals guide the development and implementation of health workforce policy, but struggle to perform their responsibilities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Few studies have analyzed the influence of colonialism on modern-day regulatory policy for health workforces in LMICs. Drawing on the example of regulatory policy from India, the goals of this paper is to uncover and highlight the colonial legacies of persistent challenges in medical education and practice within the country, and provide lessons for regulatory policy in India and other LMICs. MAIN BODY: Drawing on peer-reviewed and gray literature, this paper explores the colonial origins of the regulation of medical education and practice in India. We describe three major aspects: (1) Evolution of the structure of the apex regulatory council for doctors-the Medical Council of India (MCI); (2) Reciprocity of medical qualifications between the MCI and the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK following independence from Britain; (3) Regulatory imbalances between doctors and other cadres, and between biomedicine and Indian systems of medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges in medical education and professional regulation remain a major obstacle to improve the availability, retention and quality of health workers in India and many other LMICs. We conclude that the colonial origins of regulatory policy in India provide critical insight into contemporary debates regarding reform. From a policy perspective, we need to carefully interrogate why our existing policies are framed in particular ways, and consider whether that framing continues to suit our needs in the twenty-first century.","output":"The impact of colonial-era policies on health workforce regulation in India: lessons for contemporary reform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motor proteins drive persistent motion and self-organisation of cytoskeletal filaments.

It was seriously hindered for construction of the Green Silk Road Economic Belt by the fragile environment. Therefore, it is of great necessity for environmental protection and social development to monitor the change of surface water in the Aral Sea Region. Methods: In this study, LandTrendr algorithm was used on Landsat time-series data to characterize the change in farmland on the Google Earth Engine platform. Based on multi-source data, the water area changes of the Aral Sea were extracted based on the Google Earth Engine, and the mean method was utilized to extract the changes in water level and water storage. Finally, a water-farmland coupling degree model was utilized to evaluate the impact of farmland changes on the surface water in the Aral Sea Region. Results: As a result, the change of farmland is as follows: the farmland area of the Aral Sea Region has abandoned 3,129 km2 from 1987 to 2019, with overall accuracy of 85.3%. The farmland change had increased the drainage downstream of the Amu Darya River and the Syr Darya River. It has led area of the Aral Sea to decrease each year continuously. The area of the Aral Sea shrank by 1,606.36 km2 per year from 1987 to 2019. Furthermore, Aral Sea's water level decreased by 0.13 m per year from 2003 to 2009.

Since the first whole-genome sequence was published in January 2020, a growing database of tens of thousands of viral genomes has been constructed. This offers opportunities to study pathways of molecular change in the expanding viral population that can help identify molecular culprits of virulence and virus spread. Here we investigate the genomic accumulation of mutations at various time points of the early pandemic to identify changes in mutationally highly active genomic regions that are occurring worldwide. We used the Wuhan NC_045512.2 sequence as a reference and sampled 15 342 indexed sequences from GISAID, translating them into proteins and grouping them by month of deposition. The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins. Notable expanding mutations include R203K and G204R of the nucleocapsid (N) protein inter-domain linker region and G251V of the viroporin encoded by ORF3a between March and April. The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively. These results predict an ongoing mutational shift from the spike and replication complex to other regions, especially to encoded molecules known to represent major -interferon antagonists.

Vaccines are a primary tool to combat infection, yet they are less effective in the elderly population. While many groups have aimed to address this problem by studying vaccine-induced peripheral blood responses in the elderly, work from our lab and others demonstrate that immune responses to vaccination and infectious challenge may differ between tissue sites and the periphery. In this pilot study, we established an in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity model of Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination and tuberculin skin test in two adult and two aged baboons. Vaccination generates BCG-specific immune cells that are recruited to the skin upon tuberculin challenge. We tested short term recall responses (8 weeks post-vaccination) and long term recall responses (25 weeks post-vaccination) by performing skin punch biopsies around the site of tuberculin injection. In short term recall responses, we found increased oxidation and decreased production of immune proteins in aged baboon skin at the site of TST challenge, in comparison to adult skin. Differences between adult and aged animals normalized in the long term response to tuberculin. In vitro, aged peripheral blood mononuclear cells had increased migration and functional responses to antigen-specific stimulation, suggesting that age-related changes in the tissue in vivo impairs aged immune recall responses to antigenic challenge. These findings highlight the impact of age-associated changes in the local tissue environment in memory recall responses, which may be more broadly applied to the study of other tissues. Moreover, these findings should be considered in future studies aimed at understanding and improving aging immune responses to vaccination and tissue challenge.

But, in contrast with acute settings, relatively little attention has been given to those who work in mental health settings. We aimed to characterise the experiences of those working in English NHS secondary mental health services during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: The design was a qualitative interview-based study. We conducted semi-structured, remote (telephone or online) interviews with 35 members of staff from NHS secondary (inpatient and community) mental health services in England. Analysis was based on the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Participants reported wide-ranging changes in the organisation of secondary mental health care and the nature of work in response to the pandemic, including pausing of all services deemed to be \\"non-essential\\", deployment of staff across services to new and unfamiliar roles, and moves to remote working. The quality of participants' working life was impaired by increasing levels of daily challenge associated with trying to provide care in trying and constrained circumstances, the problems of forging new ways of working remotely, and constraints on ability to access informal support. Participants were confronted with difficult dilemmas relating to clinical decision-making, prioritisation of care, and compromises in ability to perform the therapeutic function of their roles. Other dilemmas centred on trying to balance the risks of controlling infection with the need for human contact. Many reported features of moral injury linked to their perceived failures in providing the quality or level of care that they felt service users needed. They sometimes sought to compensate for deficits in care through increased advocacy, taking on additional tasks, or making exceptions, but this led to further personal strain. Many experienced feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout. These problems were compounded by sometimes poor communication about service changes and by staff feeling that they could not take time off because of the potential impact on others. Some reported feeling poorly supported by organisations. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health workers faced multiple adversities during the pandemic that were highly consequential for their wellbeing.

The presented treatment guideline aims to provide guidance to physicians treating the very heterogenous sarcoidosis manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A European Respiratory Society Task Force (TF) committee composed of clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience in sarcoidosis developed recommendations based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology. The committee developed eight PICO (Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) questions and these were used to make specific evidence-based recommendations. RESULTS: The TF committee delivered twelve recommendations for seven PICOs. These included treatment of pulmonary, cutaneous, cardiac, and neurologic disease as well as fatigue. One PICO question regarding small fiber neuropathy had insufficient evidence to support a recommendation. In addition to the recommendations, the committee provided information on how they use alternative treatments, when there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: There are many treatments available to treat sarcoidosis. Given the diverse nature of the disease, treatment decisions require an assessment of organ involvement, risk for significant morbidity, and impact on QoL of the disease and treatment. MESSAGE: An evidence based guideline for treatment of sarcoidosis is presented. The panel used the GRADE approach and specific recommendations are made. A major factor in treating patients is the risk of loss of organ function or impairment of quality of life.","output":"ERS clinical practice guidelines on treatment of sarcoidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How effective are restrictions on mobility in limiting COVID-19 spread?

The 42-item scale assesses the following second-order and first-order factors: Practice (preliminary, during), Benefits (short-term, long-term) and Benefits at work. Three studies were conducted. The first study assessed the factor structure and internal consistency on a sample of 141 mindfulness practitioners. Using a two-wave lagged design on a different sample of 46 trainees attending mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) courses, the second study examined concurrent validity by performing correlations between the TFMQ and Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The third study (same sample as Study 1) examined criterion validity by testing a structural equation model wherein mindfulness practice predicts job burnout, both directly and indirectly through mindfulness benefits at work. All studies relied on anonymous surveys. Our findings suggest that the TFMQ: (a) has a factor structure consistent with the hypothesized conceptual dimensions; (b) has good concurrent validity as demonstrated by significant correlations with the FFMQ dimensions; and (c) consists of mindfulness dimensions that predict job burnout in organizations (i.e., criterion validity). The TFMQ is a valid and reliable mindfulness measure that may help (a) practitioners gain awareness of different types of inputs that potentially distract the mind and mindfulness beneficial consequences, and (b) organizations implement mindfulness in work-settings.","output":"Implementing Mindfulness in General Life and Organizations.

Evidence shows the onset of significant degrees of mental illnesses is detectable in this age range. For such early identification to be made there should be a system responding to those needs. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the extent to which the education system is responsive to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools through putting appropriate professionals in place, raising teachers awareness and putting in place viable policies and guidelines. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted in public and private primary schools in Gondar city Data was collected through focus group discussions from seventeen participants drawn from both schools and key informant interviews with two experts from the zonal Department of Education. A thematic qualitative data analysis was employed. Themes were identified with the help of the Nvivo 12 plus software. Results: We found teachers mental health awareness is very low with parameters such as magnitude, case identification and support. There is an exception in terms of causal attributions of mental illness that matches with scientific literature. Psychosocial support and mental health resources are not available and schools do not provide capacity building mental health trainings for teachers which might help them to identify, handle and make referrals of mental health cases. We also found the Ethiopian education policy and other guidelines do not address the issue of mental health at primary school level. Conclusion: The Ethiopian education system is not responsive to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools. Implications: Arresting minor impairments before they become major disabilities is vital. Investing in childhood mental health enables a healthy and productive society to be cultivated. The Ethiopian education system should therefore respond to the psychosocial and mental health needs of children in primary schools.","output":"System Responsiveness to the Psychosocial and Mental Health Needs of Children in Ethiopian Primary Schools: The Case of Gondar City, Northwest Ethiopia Needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood flow imaging becomes an emerging trend in cardiology with the recent progress in computer technology. It not only visualizes colorful flow velocity streamlines but also quantifies the mechanical stress on cardiovascular structures; thus, it can provide the detailed inspections of the pathophysiology of diseases and predict the prognosis of cardiovascular functions. Clinical applications include the comprehensive assessment of hemodynamics and cardiac functions in echocardiography vector flow mapping (VFM), 4D flow MRI, and surgical planning as a simulation medicine in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).For evaluation of the hemodynamics, novel mathematically derived parameters obtained using measured velocity distributions are essential. Among them, the traditional and typical parameters are wall shear stress (WSS) and its related parameters. These parameters indicate the mechanical damages to endothelial cells, resulting in degenerative intimal change in vascular diseases. Apart from WSS, there are abundant parameters that describe the strength of the vortical and/or helical flow patterns. For instance, vorticity, enstrophy, and circulation indicate the rotating flow strength or power of 2D vortical flows. In addition, helicity, which is defined as the cross-linking number of the vortex filaments, indicates the 3D helical flow strength and adequately describes the turbulent flow in the aortic root in cases with complicated anatomies. For the description of turbulence caused by the diseased flow, there exist two types of parameters based on completely different concepts, namely: energy loss (EL) and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). EL is the dissipated energy with blood viscosity and evaluates the cardiac workload related to the prognosis of heart failure. TKE describes the fluctuation in kinetic energy during turbulence, which describes the severity of the diseases that cause jet flow. These parameters are based on intuitive and clear physiological concepts, and are suitable for in vivo flow measurements using inner velocity profiles.","output":"Hemodynamic Parameters for Cardiovascular System in 4D Flow MRI: Mathematical Definition and Clinical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) develop a demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks after infection. Astrogliosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells are prominent findings in the brains and spinal cords of infected mice. In this report, astrocytes in infected spinal cords were analyzed for expression of three pleiotropic cytokines, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6; Type 2 nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); and MHC class I and II antigen. The data show that all three cytokines and iNOS are expressed by astrocytes in chronically infected spinal cords. These activated astrocytes are localized to areas of virus infection and demyelination, although most of the astrocytes expressing these proteins are not MHV-infected. MHC class I and II antigen can be detected in these spinal cords as well, but not in cells with the typical morphology of astrocytes. TNF-, IL-6, and iNOS are also evident in the brains of mice with MHV-induced acute encephalitis, but in marked contrast to the results obtained with the chronically infected mice, most of the cells expressing these cytokines or iNOS had the morphology of macrophages or other mononuclear cells and very few appeared to be astrocytes. Additionally, astrocytes and, most likely, oligodendrocytes are infected in the spinal cords of mice with chronic demyelination. These results are consistent with a role for both viral infection of glial cells and high localized levels of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in the demyelinating process in mice infected with MHV-JHM. They also show that analogously to the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, astrocytes are a major cellular source for these cytokines in mice with chronic, but not acute disease.","output":"Activation of Astrocytes in the Spinal Cord of Mice Chronically Infected with a Neurotropic Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the burden, epidemiology and outcomes of co-infections and superinfections occurring in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted for &#8805;48 hours to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona for COVID-19 (28 February to 22 April 2020) who were discharged or dead. We describe demographic, epidemiologic, laboratory and microbiologic results, as well as outcome data retrieved from electronic health records. RESULTS: Of a total of 989 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 72 (7.2%) had 88 other microbiologically confirmed infections: 74 were bacterial, seven fungal and seven viral. Community-acquired co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis was uncommon (31/989, 3.1%) and mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 51 hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections, mostly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, were diagnosed in 43 patients (4.7%), with a mean (SD) time from hospital admission to superinfection diagnosis of 10.6 (6.6) days. Overall mortality was 9.8% (97/989). Patients with community-acquired co-infections and hospital-acquired superinfections had worse outcomes.

If a patient presents with SMV thrombosis, past medical history should be reviewed, and the patient should be screened for underlying disease. SMV thrombosis may also occur due to systemic infection. In this report, we describe a case of SMV thrombosis complicated by influenza B infection. CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old male visited the hospital with general weakness, muscle aches, fever, and abdominal pain. The patient underwent computed tomography (CT) and was diagnosed with SMV thrombosis. Since the patients muscle pain and fever could not be explained by the SMV thrombosis, the clinician performed a test for influenza, which produced a positive result for influenza B. The patient had a thrombus in the SMV only, with no invasion of the portal or splenic veins, and was clinically stable. Anticoagulation treatment was prescribed without surgery or other procedures. The follow-up CT scan showed improvement, and the patient was subsequently discharged with continued oral anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSION: This case provides evidence that influenza may be a possible risk factor for SMV thrombosis.

Although previous studies have analyzed blockchain applications from the perspectives of technology, business, or patient care, few studies have focused on actual use-case scenarios of blockchain in health care. In particular, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to some new ideas for the application of blockchain in medical practice. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the current and projected uses of blockchain technology in health care, as well as directions for future research. In addition to the framework structure of blockchain and application scenarios, its integration with other emerging technologies in health care is discussed. METHODS: We searched databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, IEEE, and Springer using a combination of terms related to blockchain and health care. Potentially relevant papers were then compared to determine their relevance and reviewed independently for inclusion. Through a literature review, we summarize the key medical scenarios using blockchain technology. RESULTS: We found a total of 1647 relevant studies, 60 of which were unique studies that were included in this review. These studies report a variety of uses for blockchain and their emphasis differs. According to the different technical characteristics and application scenarios of blockchain, we summarize some medical scenarios closely related to blockchain from the perspective of technical classification. Moreover, potential challenges are mentioned, including the confidentiality of privacy, the efficiency of the system, security issues, and regulatory policy. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain technology can improve health care services in a decentralized, tamper-proof, transparent, and secure manner. With the development of this technology and its integration with other emerging technologies, blockchain has the potential to offer long-term benefits. Not only can it be a mechanism to secure electronic health records, but blockchain also provides a powerful tool that can empower users to control their own health data, enabling a foolproof health data history and establishing medical responsibility.","output":"Applications of Blockchain in the Medical Field: Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection affects the stimulatory levels of cellular-mediated immunity, which plays an essential role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. In fact, several studies have shown the association of lymphopenia with severe COVID-19 in patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the response of the immune system, including cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, during different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Peripheral blood and serum samples were collected from patients with moderate infection, patients under medication (hospitalized), patients who had recovered, and healthy individuals (n = 80). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on peripheral blood samples to determine the cellular immunity profile of each patient. The data showed a significant reduction in the levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells and CD45(+) cells in the moderate and under-medication groups, suggesting lymphopenia in those patients. Also, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted on the serum samples to measure the levels of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, in each patient. The results revealed a significant increase in the levels of IgM in the moderate infection and under-medication patients, thus indicating the production of IgM during the first week of infection. Furthermore, changes in the levels of IgG were significantly detected among recovered patients, indicating therefore a remarkable increase during the recovery stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus a strong humoral-mediated immunity. In summary, the results of this study may help us to understand the main role of the cellular immune responses, including CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells, against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This understanding might support the development of SARS-CoV-2 treatments and vaccines in the near future. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 in China. This virus is a serious threat to people not only in China but also worldwide, where it has been detected in over 222 countries. It has been reported that 3.4% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have died. The significance of our study relies on the fact that an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry were used to measure the levels of antibodies and cellular immune response, respectively, from clinical samples of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Evaluation of the Levels of Peripheral CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T Cells and IgG and IgM Antibodies in COVID-19 Patients at Different Stages of Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause large disease burden each year. The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is quite common; however, the significance for clinical severity remains controversial. We aimed to identify viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI and the impact of mixed detections. Hospitalized children with ARI aged 16 were recruited from 2009 to 2013 at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected for detection of common respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Detection and codetection frequencies and clinical features and severity were compared. Of the 3181 hospitalized children, 2375 (74.7%) were detected with 1 virus and 707 (22.2%) with 1 bacteria, 901 (28.3%) with 2 viruses, 57 (1.8%) with 2 bacteria, and 542 (17.0%) with both virus and bacteria. The most frequently detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. Clinical characteristics were similar among different pathogen infections for older group (6 years old), with some significant difference for the younger. Cases with any codetection were more likely to present with fever; those with 2 virus detections had higher prevalence of cough; cases with virus and bacteria codetection were more likely to have cough and sputum. No significant difference in the risk of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and intensive care unit admission were found for any codetection than monodetection. There was a high codetection rate of common respiratory pathogens among hospitalized pediatric ARI cases, with fever as a significant predictor. Cases with codetection showed no significant difference in severity than those with single pathogens.","output":"Detection of Viral and Bacterial Pathogens in Hospitalized Children With Acute Respiratory Illnesses, Chongqing, 2009C2013"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies. Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic. None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on peoples movements. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse. Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel societys psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories. The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war. In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on peoples mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on. Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies. I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month. The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015). The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others. The analysis of the news reports show that Britains priorities are centered on the governments handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19.","output":"I feel like death on legs: COVID-19 isolation and mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo/Objetivo: Em estudos anteriores, a Concentrao Inibitria Mnima (CIM) de Vancomicina foi associada ao pior prognstico de pacientes com bacteremia causada por Staphylococcus aureus.

The Huddinge site at the Karolinska university hospital (KH) responded through a rapid transformation of inpatient care capacity together with changing working methods in the ED. The aim is to describe the KH response to the COVID-19 crisis, and how ED crowding, and important input, throughput and output factors for ED crowding developed at KH during a 30-day baseline period followed by the first 60 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm Region. METHODS: Different phases in the development of the crisis were described and identified retrospectively based on major events that changed the conditions for the ED. Results were presented for each phase separately. The outcome ED length of stay (ED LOS) was calculated with mean and 95% confidence intervals. Input, throughput, output and demographic factors were described using distributions, proportions and means. Pearson correlation between ED LOS and emergency ward occupancy by phase was estimated with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: As new working methods were introduced between phase 2 and 3, ED LOS declined from mean (95% CI) 386 (373-399) minutes to 307 (297-317). Imaging proportion was reduced from 29 to 18% and admission rate increased from 34 to 43%. Correlation (95% CI) between emergency ward occupancy and ED LOS by phase was 0.94 (0.55-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to avoid ED crowding, even during extreme and quickly changing conditions by leveraging previously known input, throughput and output factors.

In the current study, we aimed to simultaneously evaluate the prospective influence of life change stress, personal COVID-19 impact, prior mental health, worry about COVID-19, state-level indicators of pandemic threat, and socio-demographic factors on mood and anxiety symptoms in November 2020 among adults and children in the US and UK. We used a longitudinal cohort study using the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) collected at 3 time points: an initial assessment in April 2020 (April), a reassessment 3 weeks later (May), and a 7-month follow-up in November 2020 (November). Online surveys were collected in the United States and United Kingdom by Prolific Academic, a survey recruitment service, with a final sample of 859 Adults and 780 children (collected via parent report). We found subtypes of pandemic-related life change stress in social and economic domains derived through Louvain Community Detection. We assessed recalled mood and perceived mental health prior to the pandemic; worries about COVID-19; personal and family impacts of COVID-19; and socio-demographic characteristics. Levels of mood symptoms in November 2020 measured with the circumplex model of affect. We found 3 life change stress subtypes among adults and children: Lower Social/Lower Economic (adults and children), Higher Social/Higher Economic (adults and children), Lower Social/Higher Economic (adults), and Intermediate Social/Lower Economic (children). Overall, mood symptoms decreased between April and November 2020, but shifting from lower to higher-stress subtypes between time points was associated with increasing symptoms. For both adults and children, the most informative predictors of mood symptoms in November identified by conditional random forest models were prior mood and perceived mental health, worries about COVID, and sources of life change. The relative importance of these predictors was the most prominent difference in findings between adults and children, with lifestyle changes stress regarding friendships being more predictive of mood outcomes than worries about COVID in children. In the US, objective state-level indicators of COVID-19 threat were less predictive of November mood than these other predictors. We found that in addition to the well-established influences of prior mood and worry, heterogeneous subtypes of pandemic-related stress were differentially associated with mood after the initial phase of the pandemic.

The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law. Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners. The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19. Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services. The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients' positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine. In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course. The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age. Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers. While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings. It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.","output":"A PATH TO RESUME AESTHETIC CARE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF PROJECT AesCert?

This study aimed to explore follow-up mode changes for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and their effects on PD quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. A retrospective single-center study was conducted. All patients who received PD treatment at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between January 2018 and March 2020 were enrolled in this study. Patient data during the first quarter of 2018 (Q1-2018), the first quarter of 2019 (Q1-2019), and the first quarter of 2020 (Q1-2020) were collected. Results. No significant differences were observed for any serum examinations in different follow-up periods (P>0.05). A significantly reduced outpatient follow-up rate was observed in Q1-2020 compared with Q1-2018 and Q1-2019 (71.6% Vs 78.9% Vs 84.7%, P<0.001), accompanied by a significantly increased remote follow-up rate (28.4% Vs 21.1% Vs 15.3%, P<0.001). Compared with Q1-2018 and Q1-2019, the hospitalization rate (27.7% Vs 30.9% Vs 15.7%, P<0.001) and the incidence of peritonitis (0.162 Vs 0.186 Vs 0.08 per patient-year, P<0.001) decreased significantly in Q1-2020. PD patients had a significant decline in the drop-out rate for Q1-2020 compared with Q1-2019 (4.4% Vs 7.3% Vs 2.2%, P<0.001).

Similar to other coronaviruses, a remarkable variability characterizes both its genome and biology. Despite their potential relevance, different aspects of the evolution of BoCV remain elusive. The present study reconstructs the history and evolution of BoCV using a phylodynamic approach based on complete genome and spike protein sequences. The results demonstrate high mutation and recombination rates affecting different parts of the viral genome. In the spike gene, this variability undergoes significant selective pressuresparticularly episodic pressurelocated mainly on the protein surface, suggesting an immune-induced selective pressure. The occurrence of compensatory mutations was also identified. On the contrary, no strong evidence in favor of host and/or tissue tropism affecting viral evolution has been proven. The well-known plasticity is thus ascribable to the innate broad viral tropism rather than mid- or long-term adaptation. The evaluation of the geographic spreading pattern clearly evidenced two clusters: a European cluster and an AmericanCAsian cluster. While a relatively dense and quick migration network was identified in the former, the latter was dominated by the primary role of the United States (US) as a viral exportation source. Since the viral spreading pattern strongly mirrored the cattle trade, the need for more intense monitoring and preventive measures cannot be underestimated as well as the need to enforce the vaccination of young animals before international trade, to reduce not only the clinical impact but also the transferal and mixing of BoCV strains.","output":"Bovine Coronavirus: Variability,

stress and emotional exhaustion problems. These health professionals include tutors and resident intern specialists, due to the growing demand for the former and the high work overload of the latter. Mindfulness training programs can support these professionals during times of crisis, such as the current global pandemic caused by the coronavirus-19 disease. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an abbreviated Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training program in relation to a standard training program on the levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-perceived empathy in tutors and resident intern specialists of Family and Community Medicine and Nursing. A total of 112 professionals attached to six Spanish National Health System teaching units (TUs) participated in this randomized and controlled clinical trial. Experimental Group (GE) participants were included in the standard or abbreviated MBSR programs. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale short form (SCS-SF), and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) were administered three times during the study: before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant increase in mindfulness (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,91)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.271;p = 0.042;eta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.067) and self-compassion (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,91)&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.046;p = 0.003;eta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.117) in the post-test visit, and in self-compassion (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,79)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.880;p = 0.025;eta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.089) in the follow-up visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training program.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells that produce type I interferon (IFN-I) and other cytokines in response to virus-derived nucleic acids. Persistent viruses often cause depletion or functional impairment of pDCs, but the role of pDCs in the control of these viruses remains unclear. We used conditional targeting of pDC-specific transcription factor E2-2 to generate mice that constitutively lack pDCs in peripheral lymphoid organs and tissues. The profound impact of pDC deficiency on innate antiviral responses was revealed by the failure to control acute infection with the cytopathic mouse hepatitis virus. Furthermore, pDC-deficient animals failed to clear lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from hematopoietic organs during persistent LCMV infection. This failure was associated with reduced numbers and functionality of LCMV-specific CD4(+) helper T cells and impaired antiviral CD8(+) T-cell responses. Adoptive transfer of LCMV-specific T cells revealed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells required IFN-I for expansion, but only CD4(+) T cells required the presence of pDCs. In contrast, mice with pDC-specific loss of MHC class II expression supported normal CD4(+) T-cell response to LCMV. These data suggest that pDCs facilitate CD4(+) helper T-cell responses to persistent viruses independently of direct antigen presentation. Thus pDCs provide an essential link between innate and adaptive immunity to chronic viral infection, likely through the secretion of IFN-I and other cytokines.","output":"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells control T-cell response to chronic viral infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the course of 2020, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) spread rapidly across the world. Clinical diagnostic testing for SARS-Cov-2 infection has relied on the real\\\\time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and is considered the gold standard assay. Commercial vendors and laboratories quickly mobilised to develop diagnostic tests to detect the novel coronavirus, which was fundamentally important in the pandemic response. These SARS-Cov-2 assays were developed in line with the Food Drug Administration-Emergency Use Authorization guidance. Although new tests are continuously being developed, information about SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic molecular test accuracy has been limited and at times controversial. Therefore, the analytical and clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 test kits should be carefully considered by the appropriate regulatory authorities and evaluated by independent laboratory validation. This would provide improved end-user confidence in selecting the most reliable and accurate diagnostic test. Moreover, it is unclear whether some of these rapidly developed tests have been subjected to rigorous quality control and assurance required under good manufacturing practice. Variable target gene regions selected for currently available tests, potential mutation in target gene regions, non-standardized pre-analytic phase, a lack of manufacturer independent validation data all create difficulties in selecting tests appropriate for different countries and laboratories.

However, after two weeks, theatres opened, and productions from New York City's Broadway, such as the musical comedy Ask Dad, appeared at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, to rave reviews. Toronto's stages became more diverse following the Spanish flu, with productions such as Shuffle Along, the first all-Black musical on Broadway, which hit the city's stages in 1923, and one of the first locally cast shows, Amateur Minstrel Frolics, which appeared in 1924 at the Winter Garden Theatre.

Methods In total, 348 CT scans in 112 patients were classified according to the time after the onset of the initial symptoms, namely stage-1 (0C4 days); stage-2 (5C9 days); stage-3 (10C14 days); stage-4 (15C21 days); stage-5 (22C28 days); and stage-6 (28 days). Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). Results The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (62.7 %), stage-4 (75.0 %) and stage-5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter. Total CT scores increased from stage-1 to stage-2 (2.8  3.1, vs. 6.5  4.6, respectively, P < 0.01), and thereafter remained high. The lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores except for stage-1. At stage-6 98.1 % of CT scans still showed abnormalities (CT score 7.5  4.1). Conclusion Thin-section CT could provide semi-quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity.

Two types of coronavirus-based expression vectors have been developed; one is helper-dependent expression system and the other a single genome-based expression system. By modification of the infectious cDNA of the genome of coronaviruse, it has led to an efficient (> 50 microg/10(6)cells) and stable (> 30 passages) expression of the foreign gene. Moreover,several other features of coronavirus make it attractive as a vector. Firstly, the virulent coronaviruse can be converted into nonvirulent viruse by deleting the nonessential, group-specific genes. Secondly, the species and tissue tropism of coronaviruses can be manipulated by modification of their attachment and fusion protein S.

RESULTS: Even ten weeks after disease COVID\\\\19 convalescent patients had fewer neutrophils, while their cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells were activated, reflected as higher HLA\\\\DR and CD38 expression. Multiparametric regression analyses showed that in COVID\\\\19\\\\infected patients both CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) effector memory cells were higher, while CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells were lower.

Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days.

Currently, the research on the disease evolution of the brain functional networks of patients with MCI has gradually become a research hotspot. In this study, we compare the differences in dynamic functional connectivity among eMCI, late MCI (lMCI), and normal control (NC) groups, and their graph theory indicators reveal the integration and segregation of functional connectivity states. Firstly, dynamic functional network windows were constructed based on the sliding time window method, and then these window samples were clustered by k-means to extract the functional connectivity states. The differences in the three groups were compared by analyzing the graph theory indicators, such as the participation coefficient, module degree distribution, clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and local efficiency, which distinguish the functional connectivity states. The results reveal that the NC group has the strongest integration and segregation, followed by the eMCI group, and the lMCI group has the weakest integration and segregation. We conclude that with the aggravation of MCI, the integration and segregation of dynamic functional connectivity states tend to decline. The results also reflect that the lMCI group has significantly more brain functional connections in some states, such as IPL.L-MTG.R and DCG.R-SMG.L, than the eMCI group, while the lMCI group has significantly less OLF.L-SPG.L than the NC group.","output":"Integration and Segregation of Dynamic Functional Connectivity States for Mild Cognitive Impairment Revealed by Graph Theory Indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a technology capable of connecting heterogeneous nodes/objects, such as people, devices, infrastructure, and makes our daily lives simpler, safer, and fruitful.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective observational study of all patients admitted with COVID-19 to Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The hospital was dedicated solely to the treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hypertension and the treatments were stratified according to the medical history or medications administrated prior to the infection. Among 2877 hospitalized patients, 29.5% (850/2877) had a history of hypertension. After adjustment for confounders, patients with hypertension had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of mortality as compared with patients without hypertension [4.0% vs. 1.1%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17C3.82, P = 0.013]. Patients with a history of hypertension but without antihypertensive treatment (n = 140) were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with those with antihypertensive treatments (n = 730) (7.9% vs. 3.2%, adjusted HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.03C4.57, P = 0.041).

Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wongs (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity. Differences in the performance of the Fear of Infection and Existential Threat scales are considered in terms of the respective objective and subjective nature of the constructs.","output":"Measuring COVID-19 Fear and Threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the Covid-19 pandemic an urgent need to simulate social distancing arises. The Optimal Steps Model (OSM) is a pedestrian locomotion model that operationalizes an individual's need for personal space. We present new parameter values for personal space in the Optimal Steps Model to simulate social distancing in the pedestrian dynamics simulator Vadere. Our approach is pragmatic. We consider two use cases: in the first we demand that a set social distance must never be violated. In the second the social distance must be kept only on average. For each use case we conduct simulation studies in a typical bottleneck scenario and measure contact times, that is, violations of the social distance rule. We derive rules of thumb for suitable parameter choices in dependency of the desired social distance. We test the rules of thumb for the social distances 1.5m and 2.0m and observe that the new parameter values indeed lead to the desired social distancing. Thus, the rules of thumb will quickly enable Vadere users to conduct their own studies without understanding the intricacies of the OSM implementation and without extensive parameter adjustment.","output":"Social distancing with the Optimal Steps Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study is to present the current state of knowledge on the influence of vitamin D levels on the severity of the course of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The latest available literature was reviewed until October 30, 2020 from the PubMed database. RESULTS: The literature reports that vitamin D has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces the expression of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#945; and INF-?3, regulates the activity of T helper lymphocytes, and other elements of the immune system at the molecular level. The deficiency of this vitamin promotes the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, contributing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The severity of the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on comorbidities, the development and course of which may also be affected by vitamin D levels (coagulopathies, pulmonary, cardiological, metabolic diseases). Most of the analyzed research studies from different countries indicated a relationship between insufficient vitamin D levels and a more severe course of COVID-19 and an increase in mortality due to it, especially among the elderly. Researchers agree that further analyzes are necessary concerning both the influence of the vitamin D blood serum levels on the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 as well as the use of its supplementation in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are reports of possible beneficial interactions of vitamin D with other substances, such as quercetin, estradiol, some microelements, and other vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining an adequate level of vitamin D has a positive effect on the functioning of the immune system. At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to establish a clear relationship between vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19. It is necessary to conduct further research on a larger study group. The literature does not mention the use of vitamin D as a medication for COVID-19. People at risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider vitamin D supplementation at the current time of the pandemic.","output":"Impact of level of vitamin D in the body on the severity of COVID-19 - review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a rare case of mesenteric venous infarction in a 36-year-old man due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).

The literature on the effects of feedback from WIST during work or work-related activities has not been previously summarised. This review examines the effectiveness of feedback on upper body kinematics during work or work-related activities, along with the wearability and a quantification of the kinematics of the related device. Methods: The Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Scopus, Sportdiscus and Google Scholar databases were searched, including reports from January 2005 to July 2021. The included studies were summarised descriptively and the evidence was assessed. Results: Fourteen included studies demonstrated a 'limited' level of evidence supporting posture and/or movement behaviour improvements using WIST feedback, with no improvements in pain. One study assessed wearability and another two investigated comfort. Studies used tri-axial accelerometers or IMU integration (n = 5 studies). Visual and/or vibrotactile feedback was mostly used. Most studies had a risk of bias, lacked detail for methodological reproducibility and displayed inconsistent reporting of sensor technology, with validation provided only in one study. Thus, we have proposed a minimum 'Technology and Design Checklist' for reporting. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that WIST may improve posture, though not pain; however, the quality of the studies limits the strength of this conclusion. Wearability evaluations are needed for the translation of WIST outcomes.

To find the early change of function in advance, this study examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of cerebral vascular permeability (Ktrans) in the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Ktrans was cross-sectionally measured in T2DM and non-diabetes groups with or without CSVD using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). RESULTS: In all patients with T2DM, the Ktrans of white matter (WM) was increased, whereas the Ktrans of gray matter (GM) was increased only in T2DM with CSVD. The involvement of WM was earlier than GM and was before the CSVD features could be visualized on MRI. Among the commonly available four CSVD items of MRI, microbleeds were the most sensitive, indicating the increased permeability in all patients. Increased Ktrans in T2DM was more associated with moderate WM hyperintensity but less with the presence of lacunae or multiple perivascular spaces, in contrast to patients without diabetes. The differential correlation suggested distinct mechanisms underlying diabetes-related CSVD and other CSVDs. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the early development of cerebral microangiopathy with increased BBB leakage in T2DM, before the CSVD features can be visualized on MRI.

A validated questionnaire to assess the changes in lifestyle-related behaviour was administered on adults across India using a Google online survey platform. RESULTS: A total of 995 responses (58.5% male, mean age 33.3 years) were collected. An improvement in healthy meal consumption pattern and a restriction of unhealthy food items was observed, especially in the younger population (age <30 years). A reduction in physical activity coupled with an increase in daily screen time was found especially among men and in upper-socio-economic strata. Quarantine induced stress and anxiety showed an increase by a unit in nearly one-fourth of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 marginally improved the eating behaviour, yet one-third of participants gained weight as physical activity declined significantly coupled with an increase in screen and sitting time.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) are standardized assessments that consider clinical outcomes from the perspective of the patient. We aimed to evaluate PROMs through a smartphone-based communication platform in patients with stroke who received EVT. METHODS Consecutive patients with stroke who underwent EVT were offered to participate in the PROMs-through-App program (NORA). A set of standardized PROMs were collected at 7, 30 and 90 days after discharge. Disability was determined by clinicians (mRS) at 90 days. To characterize the potential ceiling effect of mRS in the assessment of different domains, the rate of abnormal PROMs among patients with excellent outcome (mRS 0-1) was calculated. RESULTS From June 2020 to October 2021, 186 patients were included. The median PROMs collection rate per patient was 80% (50-100%). A correlation was consistently seen between disability measured by mRS and the different PROMs. The rate of abnormal PROMs ranged from 20.83% (HADS at 7 days) to 59.61% (Mental PROMIS at 7 days). At 90 days, among patients with an excellent outcome, the rate of abnormal PROMs ranged from 8.7% (HADS) to 47.83% (Physical PROMIS). CONCLUSIONS A specifically designed digital platform allows a high collection rate of PROMs among stroke patients who underwent EVT. The mRS score shows a ceiling effect and seems insufficient to fine-tune long-term clinical results. The use of PROMs may allow a better characterization of long-term outcome profiles after EVT.","output":"Patient-reported outcome measures after thrombectomy in patients with acute stroke: fine-tuning the modified Rankin Scale."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycosidase inhibitors have shown great potential as pharmacological chaperones for lysosomal storage diseases.

Currently, RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based nucleic acid assays, while SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody are identified by immunological assays. Both nucleic acid assays and immunological assays rely on the luminescence signals of specific luminescence probes for qualitative and quantitative detection. The exploration of novel luminescence probes will play a crucial role in improving the detection sensitivity of the assays. As innate probes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit negligible luminescence in the free state but enhanced luminescence in the aggregated or restricted states. Moreover, AIEgen-based nanoparticles (AIE dots) offer efficient luminescence, good biocompatibility and water solubility, and superior photostability.

In the first month of COVID-19 infection, incidence of daily positive cases did follow the susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) based predictions we reported in April, but started to deviate in the following month. COVID-19 transmission and disease progression depends on multifaceted determinants e.g. viral genetics, host immunity, social distancing, co-morbidity, socio-demographic and environmental parameters. Therefore deviation in confirmed cases from predicted model may appear and warrant thorough investigation. In this short report, we tried to demonstrate and analyze the possible factors associated with the deviation which included preventive intervention strategies, socioeconomic capabilities, climatic and meteorological indexes, acquired immunity of Bangladeshi population, demographic characteristics, health indicators and food habits. Findings: The key factor responsible for the deviation was found to be the number of tests performed. Having population with low median age, young age groups are being mostly infected. Low prevalence of non-communicable diseases among them and strong immunity compared to the elderly might have kept most of them asymptomatic with silent recovery. Warm temperature, humidity and UV index of Bangladesh during this summer period might have contributed to the slow progression of infection. Longer daylight mediated immunity, fresh air circulations and ventilation, less density in rural areas and certain food habits perhaps helped the large number of populations to restrict the infection. Conclusion: Despite all these helpful determinants in Bangladesh, person to person contact is still the leading risk factor for COVID-19 transmission. Infection may increase rapidly if safe distance and preventive measures are not strictly followed while resuming the normal social and work life. A global second wave may hit in many countries in autumn and as well as in Bangladesh in mid-October when winter starts to approach.

METHODS The MEDLINE database (PubMed) was searched, and all relevant articles that involved a true minimally invasive PS (i.e., segmental or lobar devascularization of the spleen with parenchymal transection) were included. The search was conducted until the 31st of March 2014. Demographic data, operative indications, estimated blood losses, operative times, conversion rates and complications were extracted from the included articles and were summarized for discussion. RESULTS Out of the 195 publications that were retrieved, 33 were included, which were mainly case reports and case series that represented a total of 187 patients. There were 37 men, 33 women and 117 patients of unknown gender. The mean age of the patients was ranged from 6 to 58 years.

Results: The total paediatric tumour cases was 248, including 143 (57.7%) females and 105 (42.3%) males, aged 0 - 12 years (mean 6.1 years  3.97 SD). The age group 2 - 5 year cohort had the highest prevalence of tumour. The predominant tumour based on tissue of origin was epithelial neoplasms 88 (35.5%), vascular neoplasms 56 (22.6%), neural neoplasm 42 (16.9%), mesenchymal neoplasm 37 (14.9%), germ cell neoplasm 13 (5.2%) and haematopoietic neoplasms 12 (4.8%). Majority of the tumours were benign, 148 (59.7%) and malignant 100 (40.3%). The most predominant benign tumour was haemangioma 33 (13.3%) and predominant malignant tumour was lymphoma 22 (8.9%). Conclusion: Benign tumours remain the commonest neoplasm of children in this hospital-based data. Development and implementation of a tumour registry would provide a more comprehensive information.","output":"Histopathologic spectrum of childhood tumours in a Tertiary Hospital: a ten-year review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Imitation of biological membranes and aqueous channels attracts more and more attention. In this review, we mention both the early and very recent papers in this area. Still, we concentrate our attention on less known biomimetic membranes, which are commercial nitrocellulose ultrafilters, impregnated by esters of fatty acids. Pores in filters are filled with lipid-like oils, but aqueous nanochannels are spontaneously formed on the inner pore surfaces with carboxylic groups fixed on nitrocellulose. This combination imitates the most fundamental barrier properties of biological membranes, including specific (per unit thickness) permeability of respiratory gases, transport of nonelectrolytes, water, and ions, cation/anion selectivity, electric impedance, etc. The activation energy for water transport in nanochannels is similar to that in aquaporin. In the presence of fatty acids and other carriers, it is possible to observe facilitated and coupled active counter transport of different metal cations in exchange to H(+) and without any transmembrane pressure, voltage or ATP. When quinones are dissolved in oils, light-sensitive co-transport of electrons and H(+) through oil is possible. In this case, redox-active substances are separated by the membrane. They are not mixed, but they still react. Small biomimetic membranes can be used as electrochemical drug sensors in drug detection and screening, medium size membranesfor smart transdermal drug -delivery, and large membranesfor industrial separation and purification. For example, after small modifications, they can be used for metal recovery, including radioactive strontium removal from nuclear waste accumulated and stored since the Cold War.","output":"Biomimetic Membranes without Proteins but with Aqueous Nanochannels and Facilitated Transport.

T cells can contribute to the rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections1-5. We hypothesised that pre-existing memory T cell responses, with cross-protective potential against SARS-CoV-26-12, would expand in vivo to mediate rapid viral control, potentially aborting infection. We studied T cells against the replication transcription complex (RTC) of SARS-CoV-2 since this is transcribed first in the viral life cycle13-15 and should be highly conserved. We measured SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in a cohort of intensively monitored healthcare workers (HCW) who remained repeatedly negative by PCR, antibody binding, and neutralisation for SARS-CoV-2 (exposed seronegative, ES). 16-weeks post-recruitment, ES had memory T cells that were stronger and more multispecific than an unexposed pre-pandemic cohort, and more frequently directed against the RTC than the structural protein-dominated responses seen post-detectable infection (matched concurrent cohort). The postulate that HCW with the strongest RTC-specific T cells had an abortive infection was supported by a low-level increase in IFI27 transcript, a robust early innate signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection16. We showed that the RNA-polymerase within RTC was the largest region of high sequence conservation across human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and was preferentially targeted by T cells from UK and Singapore pre-pandemic cohorts and from ES. RTC epitope-specific T cells capable of cross-recognising HCoV variants were identified in ES. Longitudinal samples from ES and an additional validation cohort, showed pre-existing RNA-polymerase-specific T cells expanded in vivo following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, becoming enriched in the memory response of those with abortive compared to overt infection. In summary, we provide evidence of abortive seronegative SARS-CoV-2 infection with expansion of cross-reactive RTC-specific T cells, highlighting these highly conserved proteins as targets for future vaccines against endemic and emerging Coronaviridae.","output":"Pre-existing polymerase-specific T cells expand in abortive seronegative SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD4 T follicular helper (T (fh) ) cells are important for the generation of durable and specific humoral protection against viral infections.

It also assesses the coping strategies being used currently. The sample comprised of 1009 Indians ranging between 17 and 83 years. The items of the CSS were constructed based on a review of existing scales, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. The factor structure of COVID-19 Stress Scale (CSS) was examined through the use of an exploratory factor analysis. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. Results suggest a five-factor structure: Vexation with Others, Immediate Concerns, Routine Disruption, Uncertainty about the Future, and Systemic stressors (abbreviated as VIRUS) explaining 55.269% of the total variance in COVID-19 stress. Coefficient alphas for the entire scale (0.90) and for each of the five factors, ranging from 0.69C0.85, indicate satisfactory internal consistency. One-way analysis of variance was done to assess the differences among emotion-focused, problem-solving, and seeking social support coping strategy. Correlations were calculated between various coping strategies and COVID-19 Stress. Results suggested that seeking social support was the most used coping strategy. No significant correlation was found between the use of any coping strategy and COVID-19 stress. The proposed VIRUS model adequately captures the stressful experience of COVID-19.

The number of opinions rapidly increased since the countries began implementing social isolation and reduction. In these comments, users often express different emotions regarding COVID-19 signs and symptoms, the majority of which are sadness and fear sentiments. It is important to determine the symptom effect level for the emotions of symptomatic persons based on their opinions. However, no study analyzes the tweets' sentiment related to the COVID-19 topic to predict the symptoms effect level. Therefore, in this study, we present a method to predict the symptoms effect level based on the sentiment analysis of symptomatic persons according to the following steps. First, the sentiments in tweets are analyzed by using a combination of the text representation model and convolutional neural network. Second, a topic modeling model is built based on the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm to group symptoms into small clusters that conform to sadness and fear sentiments. Finally, the symptom effect level is predicted based on the probability distribution of the symptoms in each sentiment cluster.

The impact of non-RSV respiratory virus coinfection on the severity of RSV disease is unknown. METHODS This hospital-based prospective study was conducted in Nagasaki, Japan, on all children less than 5 years of age with acute respiratory infection (ARI) who had undergone a rapid RSV diagnostic test between April 2009 and March 2010. Thirteen respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal swab samples using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction; polymerase chain reaction-positive samples were considered as confirmed respiratory virus infections. The cases were classified into 3 categories (pneumonia, moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI and mild ARI) according to the findings of the chest radiograph and the hospitalization records. RESULTS Among 384 cases enrolled, 371 were eligible for analysis, of whom 85 (23%) were classified as pneumonia cases; 137 (37%) as moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI cases and 162 (40%) as mild ARI cases. RSV was detected in 172 cases (61.6%), and 31 cases (18.0%) had double or triple infections with other respiratory viruses. RSV infection was more frequently observed in pneumonia cases (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-3.9) and moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI cases (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.82-4.78) than in mild ARI cases. The association with moderate-to-severe nonpneumonic ARI cases was stronger with RSV/non-RSV respiratory virus coinfection (adjusted OR: 4.91; 95% CI: 1.9-12.7) than with RSV single infection (adjusted OR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.64-4.7).

However, as vaccination progresses, demands to lift restrictions increase, despite most of the population remaining susceptible. Using our age-stratified SEIRD-ICU compartmental model and curated epidemiological and vaccination data, we quantified the rate (relative to vaccination progress) at which countries can lift non-pharmaceutical interventions without overwhelming their healthcare systems. We analyzed scenarios ranging from immediately lifting restrictions (accepting high mortality and morbidity) to reducing case numbers to a level where test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) programs efficiently compensate for local spreading events. In general, the age-dependent vaccination roll-out implies a transient decrease of more than ten years in the average age of ICU patients and deceased. The pace of vaccination determines the speed of lifting restrictions; Taking the European Union (EU) as an example case, all considered scenarios allow for steadily increasing contacts starting in May 2021 and relaxing most restrictions by autumn 2021. Throughout summer 2021, only mild contact restrictions will remain necessary. However, only high vaccine uptake can prevent further severe waves. Across EU countries, seroprevalence impacts the long-term success of vaccination campaigns more strongly than age demographics. In addition, we highlight the need for preventive measures to reduce contagion in school settings throughout the year 2021, where children might be drivers of contagion because of them remaining susceptible. Strategies that maintain low case numbers, instead of high ones, reduce infections and deaths by factors of eleven and five, respectively. In general, policies with low case numbers significantly benefit from vaccination, as the overall reduction in susceptibility will further diminish viral spread. Keeping case numbers low is the safest long-term strategy because it considerably reduces mortality and morbidity and offers better preparedness against emerging escape or more contagious virus variants while still allowing for higher contact numbers (freedom) with progressing vaccinations.","output":"Relaxing restrictions at the pace of vaccination increases freedom and guards against further COVID-19 waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been well described. We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15-26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6-10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8-38.2) in the acute phase.

METHODS: A validated, pilot tested online survey was distributed through social networking platforms in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. Responses underwent various statistical analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2,100 responses were included. Around 44% of participants reported changes in their dietary behavior during COVID-19, and 70% believed that healthy habits may prevent the infection. Moreover, 21% believed that dietary supplements surely protect against COVID-19 and 45% thought they aid in treating it.

Descriptive analysis was conducted for the sample, swallowing pathologies, diagnosis, and missing values. Using binary logistic regression, the relationship between dysphagia and underlying diseases was investigated. The largest group with a common diagnosis in the cohort were children with genetic syndromes (n = 43). Sixty-nine children were diagnosed with dysphagia and 59 without dysphagia. The non-dysphagic group included 15 patients with a behavioral feeding disorder.

In this study, we focused on circulating monocyte and lymphocyte counts and their variation tendency in the early stage of ILD. A total of 351 patients from two inception anti-MDA5 antibody-positive cohorts were included in this study, with various treatment choices. Lymphocyte count remained lower in the first month after admission in the non-survivor patients.

FRI has proven its value in pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma, but limited studies have focused on cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aims to investigate the relation of multiple FRI parameters to validated imaging parameters and classical respiratory outcomes in a CF population. METHODS: CF patients aged > 5 years scheduled for a chest CT were recruited in a cross-sectional study. FRI outcomes included regional airway volume, airway wall volume, airway resistance, lobar volume, air trapping and pulmonary blood distribution. Besides FRI, CT scans were independently evaluated by 2 readers using the CF-CT score. Spirometry and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) were also performed. Statistical tests included linear mixed-effects models, repeated measures correlations, Pearson and Spearman correlations. RESULTS: 39 CT scans of 24 (17M/7F) subjects were analyzed. Patients were 24  9 years old and had a ppFEV(1) of 71  25% at the time of the first CT. All FRI parameters showed significant low-to-moderate correlations with the total CF-CT score, except for lobar volume. When considering the relation between FRI parameters and similar CF-CT subscores, significant correlations were found between parameters related to airway volume, air trapping and airway wall thickening. Air trapping, lobar volume after normal expiration and pulmonary blood distribution showed significant associations with all spirometric parameters and oxygen saturation at the end of 6MWT. In addition, air trapping was the only parameter related to the distance covered during 6MWT. A subgroup analysis showed considerably higher correlations in patients with mild lung disease (ppFEV(1)  70%) compared to patients with moderate to severe lung disease (ppFEV(1) < 70%) when comparing FRI to CF-CT scores. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple structural characteristics determined by FRI were associated with abnormalities determined by CF-CT score. Air trapping and pulmonary blood distribution appeared to be the most clinically relevant FRI parameters for CF patients due to their associations with classical outcome measures. The FRI methodology could particularly be of interest for patients with mild lung disease, although this should be confirmed in future research.

Among 110 cN0 patients, 99 had axillary surgery with 28/99 (28.3%) ypN+: SLNB in 83 (75.5%), SLNB+ALND in 14 (12.7%), and ALND in 2 (1.8%). Among all ypN+ patients, 23/108 (21.3%) had SLNB alone: 18/43 (41.9%) of BCS and 5/65 (7.7%) mastectomy patients (p < 0.001). After median follow-up of 35 months, no regional recurrences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Among biopsy-proven cN+ NET patients, we observed deescalation of axillary surgery in selected patients, despite a low nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, without nodal recurrences. These data suggest that patients with low-volume axillary disease treated with NET may be managed similarly to patients treated with a surgery-first approach.

A total of 37 children (62 days-12 years [median 5.5 years]) were included in this study. Pneumocystis was diagnosed by microscopy using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain in 12 cases and by nested PCR using mtLSUrRNA in 25 cases. Genotyping was performed using three different genes, mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA), dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). mtLSUrRNA genotype 3 and novel mutations at the gene target DHFR (401 T > C) and DHPS 96/98 were frequently observed and clinically associated with severe PCP and treatment failure. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 13 unique sequence types (STs). Two STs (i) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96/98 C PJ1 and (ii) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96- PJ3 were significantly associated with treatment failure and high mortality among PCP-positive patients. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests the emergence of virulent P. jirovecii strains or genetic polymorphisms, leading to treatment failure and high mortality.

If transit agencies hope to reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a hyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency using passenger count data from Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012 and 2018. In every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when observing the variation between individual route-segments at one point in time. In other words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive. When observing the variation within each route-segment over time, however, ridership is inelastic; each additional vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership than the average bus already on the route. In three of the four agencies, the elasticity is a decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that low-frequency routes are the most sensitive to frequency change. This paper can help transit agencies anticipate the marginal effect of shifting service throughout the network.

METHODS: We extracted data regarding Covid-19Crelated vaccination and outcomes during a 9-month period (December 11, 2020, to September 8, 2021) for approximately 10.6 million North Carolina residents by linking data from the North Carolina Covid-19 Surveillance System and the Covid-19 Vaccine Management System. We used a Cox regression model to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (PfizerCBioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & JohnsonCJanssen) vaccines in reducing the current risks of Covid-19, hospitalization, and death, as a function of time elapsed since vaccination. RESULTS: For the two-dose regimens of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (30 g per dose) and mRNA-1273 (100 g per dose), vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 was 94.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.1 to 94.9) and 95.9% (95% CI, 95.5 to 96.2), respectively, at 2 months after the first dose and decreased to 66.6% (95% CI, 65.2 to 67.8) and 80.3% (95% CI, 79.3 to 81.2), respectively, at 7 months. Among early recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, effectiveness decreased by approximately 15 and 10 percentage points, respectively, from mid-June to mid-July, when the delta variant became dominant.

SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus, has a genome sequence that can easily undergo mutation. Several mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those with higher infectivity than others, have been reported. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is crucial to trace its infection sources. Here, we developed a simple, easy-to-use genotyping method to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants using a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. METHODS: We investigated five mutation sites, A23403G, G25563T, G26144T, T28144C, and G28882A, which are known strain determinants according to GISAID clades (L, S, V, G, GH, and GR). RESULTS: We first employed synthetic DNA fragments containing the five characteristic sites for HRM analysis. All sequences clearly differentiated wild-type from mutant viruses. We then confirmed that RNA fragments were suitable for HRM analysis following reverse transcription. Human saliva did not negatively affect the HRM analysis, which supports the absence of a matrix effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that this HRM-based genotyping method can identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. This novel assay platform potentially paves the way for accurate and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection sources.","output":"Development of a genotyping platform for SARS-CoV-2 variants using high-resolution melting analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic grows, the shortening of clinical hardware is expanding A key bit of hardware getting out of sight has been ventilators The contrast among the organic market is significant to be dealt with ordinary creation strategies, particularly under social removing measures set up The examination investigates the method of reasoning of human-robot groups to increase creation utilizing preferences of both the simplicity of coordination and keeping up social removing This chapter highlights the role of social robotic in fighting COVID-19 Also, it presents the requirements of social robotics ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"The role of social robotics to combat COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peptides are low-molecular-weight substances that participate in numerous important physiological functions, such as human growth and development, stress, regulation of the emotional state, sexual behavior, and immune responses.

SETTING: A large London teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three groups were compared: group 1COVID-19-associated deaths in the 6-week period (n=243), group 2non-COVID deaths in the same period (n=136) and group 3all deaths in a comparison period of the same 6 weeks in 2019 (n=194). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: This was a descriptive analysis of death case series review and as such no primary or secondary outcomes were pre-stipulated. RESULTS: Deaths in patients from the Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities in the pandemic period significantly increased both in the COVID-19 group (OR=2.43, 95% CI=1.60C3.68, p<0.001) and the non-COVID group (OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.09C2.83, p=0.02) during this time period and the increase was independent of differences in comorbidities, sex, age or deprivation. While the absolute number of deaths increased in 2020 compared with 2019, across all three groups the distribution of deaths by age was very similar. Our analyses confirm major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality including male sex, diabetes, having multiple comorbidities and background from the BAME communities. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of COVID-19 deaths occurring disproportionately in the elderly compared with non-COVID deaths in this period in 2020 and 2019.

Method: The sample included 8,168 Millennium Cohort Study children (1.9% with ID). Multilevel growth curve modelling was used to examine the role of physical environment characteristics in the developmental trajectories of conduct problems after adjustments for ID status. Results: Exposure to external environmental domains was not associated with differences in child conduct problems across development. Alternatively, internal aspects of the household environment: spatial density (b = 0.40, p<.001) and damp problems (b = 0.14, p<.001) were both significantly associated with increased trajectories.

If BBV is beneficial per se, choosing the PS level that maximizes it could be considered a valid strategy for conventional PSV. In this study, we evaluated the effect of different PS levels on intrinsic BBV in acutely ill, mechanically ventilated subjects to determine whether a significant relationship exists between PS level and BBV magnitude. METHODS Fourteen invasively mechanically ventilated subjects were prospectively studied. PS was adjusted at 20 cm H2O and sequentially reduced to 15, 10, and 5 cm H2O. Arterial blood gas analysis and pressure at 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1) were measured at each PS level. Airway and esophageal pressure and air flow were continuously recorded. Peak inspiratory flow, tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency, and pressure-time product (PTP) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. The breathing pattern variability was assessed by the coefficient of variation of the time series of VT, peak inspiratory flow, and breathing frequency from  60 consecutive breath cycles at each PS level. A general linear model for repeated measures was applied, with PS as an independent factor. A significance level of .05 was considered. RESULTS Despite a large inter-individual difference in all measured variables (P < .001), the coefficient of variation was as low as 30%, and no significant differences in the coefficient of variation of peak inspiratory flow, breathing frequency, and VT between PS levels were observed (P > .15). Additionally, a significant increase in P0.1, PTP, and breathing frequency (P < .01) and a reduction in VT (P < .001) were observed with PS reduction. CONCLUSIONS Despite a significant increase in spontaneous activity with PS reduction, BBV was not influenced by the PS level and was as low as 30% for all evaluated parameters.","output":"Effects of different levels of pressure support on intra-individual breath-to-breath variability."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To forecast the time dynamics of an epidemic, we propose a discrete stochastic model that unifies and generalizes previous approaches to the subject. Viewing a given population of individuals or groups of individuals with given health state attributes as living in and moving between the nodes of a graph, we use Monte-Carlo Markov Chain techniques to simulate the movements and health state changes of the individuals according to given probabilities of stay that have been preassigned to each of the nodes. We utilize this model to either capture and predict the future geographic evolution of an epidemic in time, or the evolution of an epidemic inside a heterogeneous population which is divided into homogeneous sub-populations, or, more generally, its evolution in a combination or superposition of the previous two contexts. We also prove that when the size of the population increases and a natural hypothesis is satisfied, the stochastic process associated to our model converges to a deterministic process. Indeed, when the length of the time step used in the discrete model converges to zero, in the limit this deterministic process is driven by a differential equation yielding the evolution of the expectation value of the number of infected as a function of time. In the second part of the paper, we apply our model to study the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic. We deduce a decomposition of the function yielding the number of infectious individuals into\\"wavelets\\", which allows to trace in time the expectation value for the number of infections inside each sub-population.

To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserved grafts before the start of pretransplantation conditioning. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCY) is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY. We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT between 2013 and 2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY. Eighteen patients received bone marrow grafts and 256 received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. These patients were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI), and propensity score with 1080 patients who underwent allo-HCT with fresh grafts. The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh graft versus a cryopreserved graft, was calculated using logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT Comorbidity Index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type, and recipient race. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS). Because of multiple comparisons, only P values <.01 were considered statistically significant. The 2 cohorts (cryopreserved and fresh) were similar in terms of patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-CI, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity. One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.3% to 73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (95% CI, 64.6% to 75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (P = .81). Corresponding probabilities of OS at 2 years were 60.6% (95% CI, 57.3% to 63.8%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 51.9% to 65.4%) (P = .62). In matched-pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for cryopreserved versus fresh, 1.05; 95% CI, .86 to 1.29; P = .60). Similarly, rates of neutrophil recovery (HR, .91; 95% CI, .80 to 1.02; P = .12), platelet recovery (HR, .88; 95% CI, .78 to 1.00; P = .05), grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR, .78; 95% CI, .50 to 1.22; P = .27), NRM (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, .86 to 1.55; P = .32) and relapse/progression (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, .97 to 1.50; P = .09) were similar with cryopreserved grafts versus fresh grafts. There were somewhat lower rates of chronic GVHD (HR, 78; 95% CI, .61 to .99; P = .04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29; P = .04) with graft cryopreservation that were of marginal statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

We aim to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the intervals and outcomes of TACE in HCC patients. Methods: This retrospective study included HCC patients who underwent TACE from Jan 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 (study group) and Jan 1, 2019 to Mar 31, 2019 (control group) at two institutions in China. The endpoints included the TACE interval and the overall response rate (ORR). Uni- and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors associated with a worse ORR. The cut-off point was determined to divide repeated TACE time into long- and short- intervals. Findings: 154 patients (71 in the study group, 83 in the control group) were enrolled. The median TACE interval in the study group was 820 days (IQR, 61C109), longer than 660 days (IQR, 51C94) in the control group (p=0004). The ORR was 239% in the study group, while 398% in the control group (p=0037). The cut-off value was 95 days. The group (OR, 2402;95% CI, 1040C5546;p=0040), the long interval (OR, 2573;95% CI, 1022C6478;p=0045), and the stage system (OR, 2500;95% CI, 1797C3480;p<0001) were independent predictors. Interpretation: For HCC patients, the COVID-19 pandemic results in a longer re-TACE schedule, which may further lead to a lower ORR. Patients with a TACE interval of more than 95 days may have a worse prognosis.

The evolutionary transition from water to land demands various morphological and physiological adaptations of tissues and organs including the sensory and nervous system. In this review, we aim to compare the brain architecture between selected terrestrial and closely related marine representatives of the crustacean taxa Amphipoda, Isopoda, Brachyura, and Anomala with an emphasis on the elements of the olfactory pathway including receptor molecules. Our comparison of neuroanatomical structures between terrestrial members and their close aquatic relatives suggests that during the convergent evolution of terrestrial life-styles, the elements of the olfactory pathway were subject to different morphological transformations. In terrestrial anomalans (Coenobitidae), the elements of the primary olfactory pathway (antennules and olfactory lobes) are in general considerably enlarged whereas they are smaller in terrestrial brachyurans compared to their aquatic relatives. Studies on the repertoire of receptor molecules in Coenobitidae do not point to specific terrestrial adaptations but suggest that perireceptor events - processes in the receptor environment before the stimuli bind - may play an important role for aerial olfaction in this group. In terrestrial members of amphipods (Amphipoda: Talitridae) as well as of isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea), however, the antennules and olfactory sensilla (aesthetascs) are largely reduced and miniaturized. Consequently, their primary olfactory processing centers are suggested to have been lost during the evolution of a life on land. Nevertheless, in terrestrial Peracarida, the (second) antennae as well as their associated tritocerebral processing structures are presumed to compensate for this loss or rather considerable reduction of the (deutocerebral) primary olfactory pathway. We conclude that after the evolutionary transition from water to land, it is not trivial for arthropods to establish aerial olfaction. If we consider insects as an ingroup of Crustacea, then the Coenobitidae and Insecta may be seen as the most successful crustacean representatives in this respect.","output":"More than one way to smell ashore - Evolution of the olfactory pathway in terrestrial malacostracan crustaceans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for cognitive closure is a construct postulated by Kruglanski that explains the motivational aspects which influence decision-making and its impact on the social environment.

This is an area of research in which considerable conflicting results have been produced. In our study, we find that while similarities between these segments exist along demographic factors and donation behaviour (e.g., frequency of donating), important distinctions exist along motivational factors, thereby suggesting differentiated promotion messaging. Surveys were administered to 680 subjects. Their responses along twenty-seven motivational variables were subjected to factor analysis. Cluster analysis was then applied to the factor scores that yielded three donor segments. We find six key motivating factors influencing the donation decision: organizational criteria, external inducements, intrinsic motivators, charity organization attributes, egocentric rewards and economic considerations. We also find three distinct segments of individual donors: intrinsics, sceptics and impressionable.

Subcutaneous (SQ) insulin could decrease intensive care unit need, but the data are limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes after implementation of an SQ insulin protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study is a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively implemented SQ insulin protocol. The study was conducted at an integrated health care system in Northern California. Participants included hospitalized patients with diabetic ketoacidosis at 21 hospitals between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. The preimplementation phase was 2010 to 2015, and the postimplementation phase was 2017 to 2019. Data analysis was performed from October 2020 to January 2022. EXPOSURE: An SQ insulin treatment protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference-in-differences evaluation of the need for intensive care, mortality, readmission, and length of stay at a single intervention site using an SQ insulin protocol from 2017 onward compared with 20 control hospitals using standard care. RESULTS: A total of 7989 hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis occurred, with 4739 (59.3%) occurring before and 3250 (40.7%) occurring after implementation. The overall mean (SD) age was 42.3 (17.7) years, with 4137 hospitalizations (51.8%) occurring among female patients. Before implementation, SQ insulin was the first insulin used in 40 intervention (13.4%) and 651 control (14.7%) hospitalizations. After implementation, 98 hospitalizations (80.3%) received SQ insulin first at the intervention site compared with 402 hospitalizations (12.8%) at control sites. The adjusted rate ratio for intensive care unit admission was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.33-0.56) at the intervention sites, a 57% reduction compared with control sites, and was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25-0.99) for 30-day hospital readmission, a 50% reduction. There were no significant changes in hospital length of stay and rates of death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that a protocol based on SQ insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis treatment was associated with significant decreases in intensive care unit need and readmission, with no evidence of increases in adverse events.","output":"Evaluation of Outcomes Following Hospital-Wide Implementation of a Subcutaneous Insulin Protocol for Diabetic Ketoacidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to meet the rising global demand for food and to ensure food security in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2, technological advances have been introduced in the food production industry.

CCoVs with different variations are typically pantropic and pathogenic in dogs. In this study, we isolated a CCoV, designated HLJ-073, from a dead 6-week-old male Pekingese with gross lesions and diarrhea. Interestingly, sequence analysis suggested that HLJ-073 contained a 350-nt deletion in ORF3abc compared with reference CCoV isolates, resulting in the loss of portions of ORF3a and ORF3c and the complete loss of ORF3b. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene showed that HLJ-073 was more closely related to members of the FCoV II cluster than to members of the CCoV I or CCoV II cluster. Furthermore, recombination analysis suggested that HLJ-073 originated from the recombination of FCoV 79-1683 and CCoV A76, which were both isolated in the United States.

The workflow started with docking (using Autodock Vina) each of 1615 FDA-approved drugs to the M(PRO) active site. This step selected 62 candidates with docking energies lower than ?8.5 kcal/mol. Then, the 62 docked proteinCdrug complexes were subjected to 100 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a molecular mechanics (MM) force field (CHARMM36). This step reduced the candidate pool to 26, based on the root-mean-square-deviations (RMSDs) of the drug molecules in the trajectories. Finally, we modeled the 26 drug molecules by a pseudoquantum mechanical (ANI) force field and ran 5 ns hybrid ANI/MM MD simulations of the 26 proteinCdrug complexes. ANI was trained by neural network models on quantum mechanical density functional theory (wB97X/6-31G(d)) data points. An RMSD cutoff winnowed down the pool to 12, and free energy analysis (MM/PBSA) produced the final selection of 9 drugs: dihydroergotamine, midostaurin, ziprasidone, etoposide, apixaban, fluorescein, tadalafil, rolapitant, and palbociclib.

In the context of the national vaccination campaign targeting the so called extremely vulnerable, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccines in a cohort of 623 patients. METHODS: Between March 26(th), and April 04(th), 2021, the Pfizer and BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA and the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines were given as a two-dose prime-boost regimen. Starting on September 25(th) 2021 a third dose was offered to patients in whom a suboptimal immunogenicity with COVID-19 vaccination could be expected. Safety assessments was performed by phone call 7 days after each dose. Electronic health records were accessed to review demographic information, disease history, treatment detail, and outcome events of participants patients. FINDINGS: No toxicities were reported in 63.7%, 54%, and, in 48.7% patients with cancer after each dose. Mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site was the most commonly adverse event. After the second dose, 46% of the 610 patients reported toxicity, with more systemic side-effects observed. Fever was reported in 45% of patients, with a temperature 38 C in 21.4% of them.

Restoration of blood flow is a critical objective of treating this pathology. However, many patients suffer from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries at the time of revascularization, requiring prolonged hospitalizations. B-1a cells are a subtype of B lymphocytes with roles in regulating inflammation and tissue injury by spontaneous release of natural IgM and IL-10. We hypothesized that treatment with B-1a cells protects mice from intestinal I/R. METHODS Mesenteric ischemia was induced in mice by placing a vascular clip on the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes. At the time of reperfusion, B-1a cells or PBS control were instilled into the peritoneal cavity (PerC) of mice. PerC lavage, blood, intestine, and lungs were collected 4 h after reperfusion. Serum organ injury and inflammatory markers such as ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, IL-6, as well as lung and gut histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were assessed. RESULTS In intestinal I/R, B-1a cell frequency and number in the PerC were significantly decreased compared to sham-operated mice. There was an increase in the serum levels of ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, and IL-6 when comparing the vehicle group with the sham group. These increases were significantly reduced in the B-1a cell treated group. B-1a cell treatment significantly decreased the intestine and lung injury scores as well as MPO content, compared to vehicle treated mice. B-1a cell treatment resulted in a reduction of apoptotic cells in these tissues. Serum IgM levels were decreased in intestinal I/R, while treatment with B-1a cells significantly increased their levels towards normal levels. CONCLUSIONS B-1a cell treatment at the time of mesenteric reperfusion ameliorates end organ damage and reduces systemic inflammation through the improvement of serum IgM levels.

Estimated models projected over 150,000 deaths and 4,600,000 hospitalizations in the first year of the disease in the absence of adequate interventions. Therefore, electronic contact tracing and surveillance have critical roles in decreasing COVID-19 transmission; yet, if not conducted properly, these methods can rapidly become a bottleneck for synchronized data collection, case detection, and case management. While the continent is currently reporting relatively low COVID-19 cases, digitized contact tracing mechanisms and surveillance reporting are necessary for standardizing real-time reporting of new chains of infection in order to quickly reverse growing trends and halt the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe a COVID-19 contact tracing smartphone app that includes health facility surveillance with a real-time visualization platform. The app was developed by the AFRO (African Regional Office) GIS (geographic information system) Center, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) emergency preparedness and response team. The app was developed through the expertise and experience gained from numerous digital apps that had been developed for polio surveillance and immunization via the WHOs polio program in the African region. METHODS: We repurposed the GIS infrastructures of the polio program and the database structure that relies on mobile data collection that is built on the Open Data Kit. We harnessed the technology for visualization of real-time COVID-19 data using dynamic dashboards built on Power BI, ArcGIS Online, and Tableau. The contact tracing app was developed with the pragmatic considerations of COVID-19 peculiarities. The app underwent testing by field surveillance colleagues to meet the requirements of linking contacts to cases and monitoring chains of transmission. The health facility surveillance app was developed from the knowledge and assessment of models of surveillance at the health facility level for other diseases of public health importance. The Integrated Supportive Supervision app was added as an appendage to the pre-existing paper-based surveillance form. These two mobile apps collected information on cases and contact tracing, alongside alert information on COVID-19 reports at the health facility level; the information was linked to visualization platforms in order to enable actionable insights. RESULTS: The contact tracing app and platform were piloted between April and June 2020; they were then put to use in Zimbabwe, Benin, Cameroon, Uganda, Nigeria, and South Sudan, and their use has generated some palpable successes with respect to COVID-19 surveillance. However, the COVID-19 health facilityCbased surveillance app has been used more extensively, as it has been used in 27 countries in the region. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the above information, this paper was written to give an overview of the app and visualization platform development, app and platform deployment, ease of replicability, and preliminary outcome evaluation of their use in the field. From a regional perspective, integration of contact tracing and surveillance data into one platform provides the AFRO with a more accurate method of monitoring countries efforts in their response to COVID-19, while guiding public health decisions and the assessment of risk of COVID-19.","output":"Leveraging Polio Geographic Information System Platforms in the African Region for Mitigating COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Surveillance Challenges: Viewpoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Loss of smell decreases the quality of life and contributes to the failure in recognizing hazardous substances. Given the relevance of olfaction in daily life, it is important to recognize an undiagnosed olfactory dysfunction to prevent these possible complications.

Bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), one of the most common subtypes of bladder cancer worldwide, has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the past decade. However, whether the TME status of BLCA contributes to the prediction of BLCA prognosis still remains uncertain. In this study, the ESTIMATE algorithms were used to estimate the division of immune and stromal components in 406 BLCA samples downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). Based on the comparison between ESTIMATE scores, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected. Using the univariate Cox regression analysis, prognosis-related DEGs were further identified (p < 0.05). The LASSO regression analysis was then used to screen 11 genes that were highly related to the TME of BLCA to generate a novel prognostic gene signature. The following survival analyses showed that this signature could effectively predict the prognosis of BLCA. The clinical value of this signature was further verified in an external cohort obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (n = 120). Based on the stage-correlation analysis and differential expression analysis, IGF1 and MMP9 were identified as the hub genes in the signature. Additionally, using CIBERSORT algorithms, we found that both IGF1 and MMP9 were significantly associated with immune infiltration.

It is clear that intracellular introduction of nucleoside analogues as phosphorylated metabolites (so called pronucleotides) could circumvent difficulties associated with the use of non-phosphorylated nucleoside analogues. METHODS among the current diverse pronucleotide approaches, nucleoside phosphoramidate derivatives appear to be an interesting class of potential antiviral agents because of the known relatively low stability of the P-N bond in cellular media.

However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic pandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask wearing, social distancing and vaccination, and how these may result in sub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a mechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism; moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when designing an effective solution.","output":"Games in the Time of COVID-19: Promoting Mechanism Design for Pandemic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, within a short time span, has had a significant impact on every aspect of life in almost every country on the planet. As it evolved from a local epidemic isolated to certain regions of China, to the deadliest pandemic since the influenza outbreak of 1918, scientists all over the world have only amplified their efforts to combat it. In that battle, Artificial Intelligence, or AI, with its wide ranging capabilities and versatility, has played a vital role and thus has had a sizable impact. In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of the use of AI techniques for spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting and impact modeling on diverse populations as it relates to COVID-19. Furthermore, we catalogue the articles in these areas based on spatio-temporal modeling, intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, dynamic parameters and multivariate inputs (to ascertain the penetration of AI usage in each sub area). The manner in which AI is used and the associated techniques utilized vary for each body of work. Majority of articles use deep learning models, compartment models, stochastic methods and numerous statistical methods.

Cases appear faster than the available Polymerase Chain Reaction test kits in many countries. Recently, lung computerized tomography (CT) has been used as an auxiliary COVID-19 testing approach. Automatic analysis of the lung CT images is needed to increase the diagnostic efficiency and release the human participant. Deep learning is successful in automatically solving computer vision problems. Thus, it can be introduced to the automatic and rapid COVID-19 CT diagnosis. Many advanced deep learning-based computer vison techniques were developed to increase the model performance but have not been introduced to medical image analysis. METHODS: In this study, we propose a self-supervised two-stage deep learning model to segment COVID-19 lesions (ground-glass opacity and consolidation) from chest CT images to support rapid COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed deep learning model integrates several advanced computer vision techniques such as generative adversarial image inpainting, focal loss, and lookahead optimizer. Two real-life datasets were used to evaluate the models performance compared to the previous related works. To explore the clinical and biological mechanism of the predicted lesion segments, we extract some engineered features from the predicted lung lesions. We evaluate their mediation effects on the relationship of age with COVID-19 severity, as well as the relationship of underlying diseases with COVID-19 severity using statistic mediation analysis. RESULTS: The best overall F1 score is observed in the proposed self-supervised two-stage segmentation model (0.63) compared to the two related baseline models (0.55, 0.49). We also identified several CT image phenotypes that mediate the potential causal relationship between underlying diseases with COVID-19 severity as well as the potential causal relationship between age with COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: This work contributes a promising COVID-19 lung CT image segmentation model and provides predicted lesion segments with potential clinical interpretability. The model could automatically segment the COVID-19 lesions from the raw CT images with higher accuracy than related works. The features of these lesions are associated with COVID-19 severity through mediating the known causal of the COVID-19 severity (age and underlying diseases).

The daily life of human beings, their health, and the economy of a country are affected due to this deadly viral disease. Covid-19 is a common spreading disease, and till now, not a single country can prepare a vaccine for COVID-19. A clinical study of COVID-19 infected patients has shown that these types of patients are mostly infected from a lung infection after coming in contact with this disease. Chest x-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lunge related problems. Still, a substantial chest x-ray is a lower cost process in comparison to chest CT. Deep learning is the most successful technique of machine learning, which provides useful analysis to study a large amount of chest x-ray images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19. In this work, we have taken the PA view of chest x-ray scans for covid-19 affected patients as well as healthy patients. After cleaning up the images and applying data augmentation, we have used deep learning-based CNN models and compared their performance. We have compared Inception V3, Xception, and ResNeXt models and examined their accuracy. To analyze the model performance, 6432 chest x-ray scans samples have been collected from the Kaggle repository, out of which 5467 were used for training and 965 for validation. In result analysis, the Xception model gives the highest accuracy (i.e., 97.97%) for detecting Chest X-rays images as compared to other models.

Of at least 21 BBS-related genes that can carry multiple mutations, a pathogenic mutation, BBS1M390R, is the single most common mutation of clinically diagnosed BBS outcomes. While the deletion of BBS-related genes in mice can cause variable penetrance in different organ systems, the impact of the Bbs1M390R mutation in the olfactory system remains unclear. Using a clinically relevant knock-in mouse model homozygous for Bbs1M390R, we investigated the impact of the mutation on the olfactory system and tested the potential of viral-mediated, wildtype gene replacement therapy to rescue smell loss. The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in Bbs1M390R/M390R mice were significantly shorter and fewer than those of wild-type mice. Also, both peripheral cellular odor detection and synaptic-dependent activity in the olfactory bulb were significantly decreased in the mutant mice. Furthermore, to gain insight into the degree to which perceptual features are impaired in the mutant mice, we used whole-body plethysmography to quantitatively measure odor-evoked sniffing. The Bbs1M390R/M390R mice showed significantly higher odor detection thresholds (reduced odor sensitivity) compared to wild-type mice; however, their odor discrimination acuity was still well maintained. Importantly, adenoviral expression of Bbs1 in OSNs restored cilia length and re-established both peripheral odorant detection and odor perception. Together, our findings further expand our understanding for the development of gene therapeutic treatment for congenital ciliopathies in the olfactory system.","output":"Gene therapy rescues olfactory perception in a clinically relevant ciliopathy model of Bardet-Biedl syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Septoplasty is a common procedure in ENT practice with fewer complication rates.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing CP effects on hospitalized, adult COVID-19 patients were searched until November 24, 2020. We assessed risk of bias (RoB) using Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tools. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methodology. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, clinical improvement, and adverse events. RESULTS: Five RCTs (n = 1067) and 6 cohorts (n = 881) were included. Three and 1 RCTs had some concerns and high RoB, respectively; and there was serious RoB in all cohorts. Convalescent plasma did not reduce all-cause mortality in RCTs of severe (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.33C1.10) or moderate (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.09C3.86) COVID-19 vs. standard of care (SOC); CP reduced all-cause mortality vs. SOC in cohorts (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49C0.91). Convalescent plasma did not reduce invasive ventilation vs. SOC in moderate disease (RR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.47C1.55).

Washing hands takes longer than using ABHR, and the use of powdered gloves may be an obstacle to hand-hygiene compliance. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of replacing powdered gloves with powder-free gloves on hand-hygiene compliance among HCW of an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a general ICU of a tertiary care university hospital in Brazil. From June 1st to July 15th, 2017, all HCW were provided with powdered latex gloves only for all clinical procedures. From July 15th to August 31st, 2017, HCW were provided with nitrile powder-free gloves only. Hand-hygiene compliance was assessed through direct observation, and evaluated according to the World Health Organization Hand Hygiene guidelines. We calculated that a sample size of 544 hand hygiene opportunities needed to be observed per period. Data analysis were performed using the STATA SE? version 14, and we compared the individuals percentage of compliance using the t test for paired data before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Overall, 40 HCW were assessed before and after the introduction of nitrile powder-free gloves, with 1114 and 1139 observations of hand hygiene opportunities, respectively. The proportion of compliance with hand hygiene was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51C59%) using powdered latex gloves and 60% (95% CI 57C63%) using powder-free gloves. The difference in proportions between the two types of gloves was 5.1% (95% CI 2.5C7.6%, p < 0.001).

Unlike traditional text streams, short text stream data present the following characteristics: short length, weak signal, high volume, high velocity, topic drift, etc. Existing methods cannot simultaneously address two major problems very well: inferring the number of topics and topic drift. Therefore, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for short text streams based on the Dirichlet process (DCSS), which can automatically learn the number of topics in documents and solve the topic drift problem of short text streams. To solve the sparsity problem of short texts, DCSS considers the correlation of the topic distribution at neighbouring time points and uses the inferred topic distribution of past documents as a prior of the topic distribution at the current moment while simultaneously allowing newly streamed documents to change the posterior distribution of topics. We conduct experiments on two widely used datasets, and the results show that DCSS outperforms existing methods and has better stability.","output":"Dynamic clustering for short text stream based on Dirichlet process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many people have been affected by COVID-19, a novel respiratory illness, caused by a new type of coronavirus SARS-CoV2.

Lockdowns have been implemented to slow down the spread of the virus with the expectation that these restrictions will limit the number of cases, and hence the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. However, these restrictions, and in particular lockdowns, impact on the life of everyone living in Ireland. AIM: To record how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictive measures impacted on people's activities, work, schooling, and childcare. METHODS: The Corona Citizens' Science Project was set up as a population-wide survey. A questionnaire was designed, and the survey was first launched on the 8th of April 2020. An overview of results was released in the press days later. Data was collected in four waves: April 8, April 22, May 6, and June 17, 2020. Each wave had core questions allowing to compare each wave, and wave-specific questions, to understand current impact of changing measures. RESULTS: Over four waves, 152,259 responses were collected. The mean age of respondents was 47 with about 10% over the age of 65. Around 75% were female and 85% had a higher degree. Nearly 70% of the respondents were in employment, and around 13% were retired. Up to 20% of the respondents were essential workers, and 10% of respondents indicated they were in receipt of the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment. Around 10% of the people who responded were living alone. The number of people talked to the previous day was on average 2.3 in the first survey; during the lockdown, this went up over time, and in the last survey, the mean was 3.9. The percentage of respondents who did not talk to anyone the previous day decreased from 40 to 22% over the waves. In the first wave, about 6% of respondents reported having had flu-like symptoms in the last 14 days, which declined to 3.3%, 2.5%, and 2.0% in waves 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Similarly, over the four waves, the respondents who indicated that someone they lived with had flu-like symptoms declined from 17 to 12%, 9%, and 11%. Throughout the four waves, nearly one third of people reported one or more underlying conditions.

We investigated whether the effect of this agent on cardiometabolic parameters in subjects with T2DM varied in relation to the concomitant presence of obesity. METHODS: One hundred thirty-five subjects (78 men and 57 women; age: 62  10 years) na?ve to incretin-based therapies were treated with low-dose liraglutide (1.2 mg/day) as an add-on to metformin for 18 months. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on their body-mass index (BMI): (a) obese (BMI  30) and (b) non-obese (BMI < 30). Clinical and laboratory analyses were assessed at baseline and every 6 months. RESULTS: During follow-up, significant improvements were seen in both groups in fasting glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, waist circumference, and carotid intimaCmedia thickness (cIMT), while body weight, BMI, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly in obese subjects only. Correlation analysis revealed that changes in subclinical atherosclerosis (assessed by cIMT) were associated with changes in triglycerides (r = 0.488, p < 0.0001) in the obese group only. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide had beneficial actions on glycemic parameters and cardiometabolic risk factors in both non-obese and obese patients with T2DM, with a greater efficacy in the latter. These findings reinforce the benefits of liraglutide for the cardiometabolic outcomes of obese patients with T2DM in the real-world setting.

Moreover, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded, referring specifically to the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 paradigm. Our data highlighted the presence of similarities between the intellectually gifted individuals and the ones with autism (i.e., a nonhomogeneous intellective profile, an adaptive skills impairment, subthreshold autistic symptoms and increased perfectionism). Interestingly, a distinct neurophysiological characterization between groups came out, with evidence of a reduced MMN amplitude only in the HFA group. Furthermore, no differences within groups in the P300 component emerged. Therefore, our results start to provide a more informative characterization of the HIP phenotype in comparison to those of HFA and NTD, highlighting the potential role of the MMN amplitude index in helping clinicians and researchers to distinguish between HIP and HFA.

This paper investigates the impact of this disruption on the progress towards the WHO 2030 target for STH. METHODS: We used two stochastic individual-based models to simulate the impact of missing one or more preventive chemotherapy (PC) rounds in different endemicity settings. We also investigated the extent to which this impact can be lessened by mitigation strategies, such as semiannual or community-wide PC. RESULTS: Both models show that without a mitigation strategy, control programmes will catch up by 2030, assuming that coverage is maintained. The catch-up time can be up to 4.5 y after the start of the interruption. Mitigation strategies may reduce this time by up to 2 y and increase the probability of achieving the 2030 target. CONCLUSIONS: Although a PC interruption will only temporarily impact the progress towards the WHO 2030 target, programmes are encouraged to restart as soon as possible to minimise the impact on morbidity. The implementation of suitable mitigation strategies can turn the interruption into an opportunity to accelerate progress towards reaching the target.","output":"Modelling the impact of COVID-19-related control programme interruptions on progress towards the WHO 2030 target for soil-transmitted helminths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to be the most severe and long-lasting economic shock experienced by female sex workers (FSWs) globally due to the high and close contact nature of the profession. Given that there is a positive income premium attached to unprotected sex, FSWs may resort to adopting risky sexual behaviours as a means to cope with the decreased earnings resulting from COVID-19. Methods: We used data from a cohort study of around 600 Senegalese FSWs in Dakar, Senegal. During the COVID-19 pandemic in June-July 2020, we elicited respondents perceptions of how COVID-19 has affected them. We also compared FSWs income and sexual behaviours in 2020 with that of previous survey waves in 2015 and 2017. For continuous variables, the mean, median, interquartile range (IQR), 10th and 90th percentiles were reported. A t-test was also carried out to test the differences between the means in 2017 and 2020. For categorical variables, bar charts were shown. Condom use was elicited via the list experiment method to overcome social desirability bias. Heterogeneity analyses were carried out to identify the channels through which COVID-19 affected condom use. Findings: COVID-19 led to a 700% reduction in the number of clients seen in a week from 2017 levels. The steep fall in the number of clients led to a reduction in sex work earnings by 503%. Estimated condom use prevalence with the last client was similar in 2015 and 2017, but decreased by 131%-pts during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0014), corresponding to a drop of 168% compared to 2017. Condom use decline was concentrated amongst asset-poor FSWs (227%-pts drop (p=0004);270% reduction in condom use from 2017 levels). However, self-reported STI symptoms did not increase. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of FSWs reported that they have reduced visits to health facilities because of COVID-19, but there was no evidence that this was associated with decreased condom use. Mental health of FSWs has deteriorated, while experience of violence from clients or the police has remained largely unchanged.Interpretation: Condom use has likely to have fallen to alleviate the economic shock brought about by COVID-19. While the plunge in the number of clients may have offset the transmission of HIV and other STIs for now, it remains to be seen whether condom use would resume once business improves, especially if the crisis were to be prolonged. Given the potential public health issue this may create, policies targeting FSWs to dampen the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis should urgently be considered as a strategy to prevent the transmission of HIV and other STIs.Funding: MRC Public Health Intervention Development Scheme (MR/T00262X/1)Declaration of Interests: There are no conflicts of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: This study has been ethically approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (REC).

A standardized single question and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire were used to assess the presence of suicidal ideation and common mental health problems (CMHPs), respectively. Suicidal ideators were further asked about their perceived need for mental health care and help-seeking from mental health workers. RESULTS: 4.1% of the OCAs experienced suicidal ideation during the past 2 weeks. Among the suicidal OCAs, 31.9% perceived a need for mental health care but only 10.6% had sought help from mental health workers. Factors significantly associated with suicidal ideation were a marital status of others (OR=2.39, P = .021), disagreement regarding the successful containment of the pandemic (OR=2.43, P = .022), physical health problems (OR=2.23, P = .012), and CMHPs (OR=4.99, P < .001).

Social media platforms have been recognized as important tools for health-promoting practices in public health, and the use of social media is widespread among the public. However, little is known about the effects of social media use on health promotion during a pandemic such as COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the predictive role of social media use on public preventive behaviors in China during the COVID-19 pandemic and how disease knowledge and eHealth literacy moderated the relationship between social media use and preventive behaviors. METHODS: A national web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted by a proportionate probability sampling among 802 Chinese internet users (netizens) in February 2020. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and hierarchical multiple regressions were employed to examine and explore the relationships among all the variables. RESULTS: Almost half the 802 study participants were male (416, 51.9%), and the average age of the participants was 32.65 years. Most of the 802 participants had high education levels (624, 77.7%), had high income >5000 (US $736.29) (525, 65.3%), were married (496, 61.8%), and were in good health (486, 60.6%). The average time of social media use was approximately 2 to 3 hours per day (mean 2.34 hours, SD 1.11), and the most frequently used media types were public social media (mean score 4.49/5, SD 0.78) and aggregated social media (mean score 4.07/5, SD 1.07). Social media use frequency (=.20, P<.001) rather than time significantly predicted preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Respondents were also equipped with high levels of disease knowledge (mean score 8.15/10, SD 1.43) and eHealth literacy (mean score 3.79/5, SD 0.59). Disease knowledge (=.11, P=.001) and eHealth literacy (=.27, P<.001) were also significant predictors of preventive behaviors. Furthermore, eHealth literacy (P=.038) and disease knowledge (P=.03) positively moderated the relationship between social media use frequency and preventive behaviors, while eHealth literacy (=.07) affected this relationship positively and disease knowledge (=C.07) affected it negatively. Different social media types differed in predicting an individuals preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Aggregated social media (=.22, P<.001) was the best predictor, followed by public social media (=.14, P<.001) and professional social media (=.11, P=.002). However, official social media (=.02, P=.597) was an insignificant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Social media is an effective tool to promote behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among the public. Health literacy is essential for promotion of individual health and influences the extent to which the public engages in preventive behaviors during a pandemic. Our results not only enrich the theoretical paradigm of public health management and health communication but also have practical implications in pandemic control for China and other countries.","output":"Social Media Use, eHealth Literacy, Disease Knowledge, and Preventive Behaviors in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study on Chinese Netizens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Canada, healthcare and medicine are grounded in structures of coloniality, oppression, heteropatriarchy and a variety of -isms (racism, sexism, ableism, classism).

Post-operative complications including delayed epithelial healing, infection, and loss of visual acuity were recorded. Results: The study included 878 eyes of 654 patients. The mean age was 279.4 years (range 7-71). Five hundred ninety-nine patients (91.6%) had keratoconus while 55 had post-refractive corneal ectasia (8.4%). Forty-seven eyes had prolonged follow-up because of the occurrence of complications in the early post-operative period. The respective rates of delayed epithelial healing, and keratitis were 3.9% (95% CI 2.7-5.3%), and 1.5% (95% CI 0.8-2.5%). Four approaches for management of delayed epithelial healing were compared; epithelium healing duration was the longest in the repeat bandage contact lens (BCL) group (23.8 days) and the shortest in the antibiotic ointment group (14.3 days), with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the healing time between these 2 groups. Conclusion: The concern for early clinical complications after epi-off CXL often leads to delayed CXL intervention and further keratoconus progression with increased economic burdens. A large retrospective review of 878 eyes found that FDA-approved epi-off CXL protocol appears to be safe with low occurrence rates of early post-operative complications. The recommended management for delayed epithelial healing is using antibiotic ophthalmic ointment.","output":"The Safety Profile of FDA-Approved Epithelium-Off Corneal Cross-Linking in a US Community-Based Healthcare System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Achilles tendon (AT) exhibits volume changes related to fluid flow under acute load which may be linked to changes in stiffness. Fluid flow provides a mechanical signal for cellular activity and may be one mechanism that facilitates tendon adaptation. This study aimed to investigate whether isometric intervention involving a high level of load duration and intensity could maximize the immediate reduction in AT volume and stiffness compared to interventions involving a lower level of load duration and intensity. Sixteen healthy participants (12 males, 4 females; age= 24.49.4 y; body mass= 70.916.1 kg; height= 1.70.1 m) performed three isometric interventions of varying levels of load duration (2 s and 8 s) and intensity (35% and 75% MVICs) over a 3-week period. Freehand 3D ultrasound was used to measure free AT volume (at rest) and length (at 35%, 55%, and 75% of maximum plantarflexion force) pre and post interventions. The slope of force-elongation curve over these force levels represented individual stiffness (N/mm). Large reductions in free AT volume and stiffness resulted in response to long-duration high-intensity loading whilst less reduction resulted with a lower load intensity. In contrast, no change in free AT volume and a small increase in AT stiffness occurred with lower load duration. These findings suggest that the applied load on the AT must be heavy and sustained for a long duration to maximize immediate volume reduction, which might be an acute response that enables optimal long-term tendon adaptation via mechanotransduction pathways.","output":"The acute effects of higher versus lower load duration and intensity on morphological and mechanical properties of the healthy Achilles tendon: a randomized crossover trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The first UK guidelines for the management of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) were published by the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) in 2018. The guidelines contained a set of audit criteria. OBJECTIVE To evaluate current HS management against the audit standards in the BAD guidelines. METHODS BAD members were invited to complete audit questionnaires between January and May 2020 for five consecutive HS patients per department. RESULTS Eighty-eight centres participated, providing data for 406 patients. Disease staging using the Hurley system and disease severity using a validated tool during follow-ups were documented in 75% and 56%. Quality of life (QoL) and pain were documented in 49% and 50%. Screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors was as follows: smoking 75%, body mass index (BMI) 27% and others such as lipids and diabetes 57%. Screening for depression and anxiety was performed in 40% and 25%. Support for smokers or obese patients was documented in 35% and 23%. One hundred eighty-two patients were on adalimumab, of whom 68% had documentation of baseline disease severity, and 76% documented inadequate response or contraindications to systemic treatments. Forty-four percent of patients continued on adalimumab despite having less than 25% improvement in lesion count. CONCLUSION UK dermatologists performed well against several audit standards, including documenting disease staging at baseline and smoking status. However, improvements are needed, particularly with regard to screening and management of comorbidities that could reduce the long-term complications associated with HS.

However, laparoscopic hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion is technically challenging. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From March 2013 to August 2013, 8 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection under right hemivascular inflow occlusion using the lowering of the hilar plate approach. RESULTS There were 3 women and 5 men, with a mean age of 52.6 years (range, 44-73 years). The pathologies were hepatocellular carcinoma (n=3), sarcomatoid liver carcinoma (n=1), hepatic vascular epithelial tumor (n=1), hemangioma (n=2), and colorectal liver metastases (n=1). The types of resection included right hepatectomy (n=3), right anterior sectionectomy (n=1), segments 5 and 6 resection (n=1), and segment 6 resection (n=2). All patients underwent right hemivascular inflow occlusion. The mean operation time was 186.2 minutes (range, 100-280 minutes). The mean time taken to prepare for hemivascular inflow occlusion was 17.8 minutes (range, 15-20 minutes). The mean intraoperative blood loss was 218.8 mL (range, 100-300 mL). The mean duration of vascular control was 25.6 minutes (range, 15-40 minutes). No patients developed postoperative liver failure. There was no postoperative morbidity or mortality.

In an effort to provide continuous pharmaceutical care to cancer patients, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) implemented a remote pharmacy service platform based on its already existing web-based hospital app known as Cloud SYSUCC. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, acceptance, and initial impact of the Cloud SYSUCC app during a COVID-19 outbreak in a tertiary cancer hospital in China. METHODS: The total number of online prescriptions and detailed information on the service were obtained during the first 6 months after the remote service platform was successfully set up. The patients gender, age, residence, primary diagnosis, drug classification, weekly number of prescriptions, and prescribed drugs were analyzed. In addition, a follow-up telephonic survey was conducted to evaluate patients satisfaction in using the remote prescription service. RESULTS: A total of 1718 prescriptions, including 2022 drugs for 1212 patients, were delivered to 24 provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government of China between February 12, 2020, and August 11, 2020. The majority of patients were female (841/1212, 69.39%), and 90.18% (1093/1212) of them were aged 31-70 years old. The top 3 primary diagnoses for which remote medical prescriptions were made included breast cancer (599/1212, 49.42%), liver cancer (249/1212, 20.54%), and thyroid cancer (125/1212, 10.31%). Of the 1718 prescriptions delivered, 1435 (83.5%) were sent to Guangdong Province and 283 (16.5%) were sent to other provinces in China. Of the 2022 drugs delivered, 1012 (50.05%) were hormonal drugs. The general trend in the use of the remote prescription service declined since the 10th week. A follow-up telephonic survey found that 88% (88/100) of the patients were very satisfied, and 12% (12/100) of the patients were somewhat satisfied with the remote pharmacy service platform. CONCLUSIONS: The remote pharmacy platform Cloud SYSUCC is efficient and convenient for providing continuous pharmaceutical care to patients with cancer during the COVID-19 crisis. The widespread use of this platform can help to reduce person-to-person transmission as well as infection risk for these patients. Further efforts are needed to improve the quality and acceptance of the Cloud SYSUCC platform, as well as to regulate and standardize the management of this novel service.","output":"Use of a Remote Oncology Pharmacy Service Platform for Patients With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implementation and User Acceptance Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the published data on the effect of cannabis use in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women to alleviate menopausal symptoms, insomnia and anxiety.

METHODS: Epidemiological analysis, environmental samplings, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were performed for a hospital outbreak. RESULTS: A superspreading event involving 12 patients and 9 healthcare workers (HCWs) occurred within 4 days in 3 of 6 cubicles at an old-fashioned general ward with no air exhaust built within the cubicles. The environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly higher in air grilles (>2m from patients' head and not reachable by hands) than high-touch clinical surfaces (36.4%, 8/22 vs 3.4%, 1/29, p=0.003). Six (66.7%) of 9 contaminated air exhaust grilles were located outside patient cubicle. The clinical attack rate of patients was significantly higher than HCWs (15.4%, 12/78 exposed-patients vs 4.6%, 9/195 exposed-HCWs, p=0.005). Moreover, clinical attack rate of ward-based HCWs was significantly higher than non-ward-based HCWs (8.1%, 7/68 vs 1.8%, 2/109, p=0.045). The episodes (mean  S.D) of patient-care duty assignment in the cubicles was significantly higher among infected ward-based HCWs than non-infected ward-based HCWs (6.02.4 vs 3.02.9, p=0.012) during the outbreak period. The outbreak strains belong to SARS-CoV-2 lineage, B.1.36.27 (GISAID Clade GH) with the unique S-T470N mutation on WGS. CONCLUSION: This nosocomial point source superspreading due to possible airborne transmission demonstrated the need for stringent SARS-CoV-2 screening at admission to healthcare facilities and better architectural design of the ventilation system to prevent such outbreaks. Portable high-efficiency particulate filters were installed in each cubicle to improve ventilation before resumption of clinical service.","output":"Nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 by possible airborne transmission leading to a superspreading event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research suggests that not all fact-checking efforts are equal: when and what is fact-checked plays a pivotal role in effectively correcting misconceptions. In that context, signals capturing how much attention specific topics receive on the Internet have the potential to study (and possibly support) fact-checking efforts. This paper proposes a framework to study fact-checking with online attention signals. The framework consists of: 1) extracting claims from fact-checking efforts; 2) linking such claims with knowledge graph entities; and 3) estimating the online attention these entities receive. We use this framework to conduct a preliminary study of a dataset of 879 COVID-19-related fact-checks done in 2020 by 81 international organizations. Our findings suggest that there is often a disconnect between online attention and fact-checking efforts. For example, in around 40% of countries that fact-checked ten or more claims, half or more than half of the ten most popular claims were not fact-checked. Our analysis also shows that claims are first fact-checked after receiving, on average, 35% of the total online attention they would eventually receive in 2020. Yet, there is a considerable variation among claims: some were fact-checked before receiving a surge of misinformation-induced online attention; others are fact-checked much later. Overall, our work suggests that the incorporation of online attention signals may help organizations assess their fact-checking efforts and choose what and when to fact-check claims or stories. Also, in the context of international collaboration, where claims are fact-checked multiple times across different countries, online attention could help organizations keep track of which claims are\\"migrating\\"between countries.","output":"Can online attention signals help fact-checkers fact-check?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The calcium-dependent lectin dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interactions with dendritic cells.

One such population, was assumed to be patients with primary genetic defect involving components or pathways of the immune system. While human immunity against COVID-19 is not fully understood, it is, so far, well documented, that both adaptive and innate cells have a critical role in protection against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we aimed to summarize the clinical and laboratory data on primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients in Israel, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, in order to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on such patients. Data was collected from mid-February to end-September. During this time Israel experienced two \\"waves\\" of COVID-19 diseases; the first, from mid-February to mid-May and the second from mid-June and still ongoing at the end of data collection.

Fourteen of the patients were on routine monthly IVIG replacement therapy at the time of virus detection. None of the patients displayed severe illness and none required hospitalization; moreover, 7/20 patients were completely asymptomatic. Possible explanations for the minimal clinical impact of COVID-19 pandemic observed in our PID patients include high level of awareness, extra-precautions, and even self-isolation. It is also possible that only specific immune pathways (e.g. type I interferon signaling), may increase the risk for a more severe course of disease and these are not affected in many of the PID patients.

It is indeed an irony that the reticuloendothelial system (RES), the bodys major defence system, is the primary site for intracellular infections which are more difficult to treat. Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages play an important role in defence. However, ingenious pathogen survival mechanisms including phagolysosome destruction enable their persistence. Microbial biofilms present additional challenges. Low intracellular drug concentrations, drug efflux by efflux pumps and/or enzymatic degradation, emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR), are serious limitations of conventional therapy. Targeted delivery using nanocarriers, and passive and active targeting strategies could provide quantum increase in intracellular drug concentration. Receptor mediated endocytosis using appropriate ligands is a viable approach. Liposomes and polymeric/lipidic nanoparticles, dendrimers micelles and micro/nanoemulsions could all be relied upon. Specialised targeting approaches are demonstrated for important diseases like tuberculosis, HIV and Malaria.

METHODS: We collected clinical data of children aged younger than 13 years with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 presenting to Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town between 17th of April and 24th of July 2020. RESULTS: Hundred and fifty-nine children (median age 480 months (interquartile range, IQR 120-1060)) were included. Hospitalized children (n=62), median age of 135 months (IQR 18-435) were younger than children not admitted (n=97), median age 810 months (IQR 345-1205, p< 001). Thirty-three of 159 (208%) children had pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty-one of 62 (823%) hospitalized children were symptomatic; lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed in 21/51 (412%) and 11/16 (688%) children younger than 3 months of age.

METHODS: A sample of undergraduate students (N = 5,738) completed an online questionnaire 7 days after lockdown measures were introduced. The survey comprised variables related to lockdown measures and the COVID-19-pandemic, mood, stress, body image, binge eating and dietary restriction during the past 7 days, as well as intent to binge eat and restrict in the following 15 days. RESULTS: Stress related to the lockdown was associated with greater likelihood of binge eating and dietary restriction over the past week and intentions to binge eat and restrict over the next 15 days. Greater exposure to COVID-19-related media was associated with increased eating restriction over the past week. Binge eating and restriction (past and intentions) were associated with established risk factors, including female gender, low impulse regulation, high body dissatisfaction, and having a concurrent probable eating disorder.

Primary outcomes were measures of acute care use after 4 common elective operations: joint replacement, spinal fusion, bariatric surgery, and coronary artery bypass grafting. A framework for matching changing demand with changes in supply was created by overlaying acute care data with publicly available outbreak capacity data. RESULTS: Elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 117 423) had the highest acute care use: 92.8% of patients used intensive care unit beds, 89.1% required postoperative mechanical ventilation, 41.0% required red blood cell transfusions, and 13.3% were readmitted within 90 days of surgery.

RESULTS: The SMART-R intervention was not significantly associated with decreased perceived stress. Linear regression modeling showed that depression was positively correlated with reported stress levels, while male sex and self-efficacy were negatively correlated with stress. Qualitative analysis elucidated differences in these groups: Residents with lower self-efficacy, those with a positive depression screen, and/or female residents were more likely to describe experiencing lack of control over work. Residents with higher self-efficacy described more positive health behaviors. Residents with a positive depression screen were more self-critical, and more likely to describe negative personal life events. CONCLUSIONS: This curriculum did not significantly modify junior residents stress. Certain subpopulations experienced greater stress than others (female residents, those with lower self-efficacy, and those with a positive depression screen). Qualitative findings from this study highlight universal stressful experiences early in residency, as well as important differences in experience of the learning environment among subgroups. Tailored wellness interventions that aim to support diverse resident sub-groups may be higher yield than a one size fits all approach.

Genosensors were fabricated on either gold (Au) interdigitated electrodes for electrical and electrochemical measurements or on Au nanoparticles on a glass slide for optical measurements. They contained a matrix of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) onto which a layer of capture probe (cpDNA) sequence was immobilized. Detection was performed using electrical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The highest sensitivity was reached with impedance spectroscopy, including using a low-cost (US$ 100) homemade impedance analyzer. Complementary ssDNA sequences were detected with a detection limit of 0.5 aM (0.3 copy per mu L). This performance may be attributed to the high sensitivity of the electrical impedance technique combined with an appropriate arrangement of the sequences on the electrodes and hybridization between the complementary sequences, as inferred from polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). The selectivity of the genosensor was confirmed by plotting the impedance spectroscopy data with a multidimensional projection technique (interactive document mapping, IDMAP), where a clear separation was observed among the samples of the complementary DNA sequence at various concentrations and from buffer samples containing a non-complementary sequence and other DNA biomarkers. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 mimicking sequences was also achieved with machine learning techniques applied to scanning electron microscope images taken from genosensors exposed to distinct concentrations of the complementary ssDNA sequences. In summary, the genosensors proposed here are promising for detecting SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) in biological fluids in point-of-care settings.","output":"Detection of a SARS-CoV-2 sequence with genosensors using data analysis based on information visualization and machine learning techniques"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(D,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/42.md","filePath":"doctor/42.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/42.md"},M=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,M as default};
