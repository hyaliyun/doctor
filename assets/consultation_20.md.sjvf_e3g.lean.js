Beyond knowledge of digital technologies, self-efficacy is known to affect the learning motivation and learning goals of students. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to determine the relationship between eHealth literacy and self-efficacy levels in midwifery students receiving distance education during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The research data were collected using a literature-based questionnaire developed by the researchers, the eHealth Literacy Scale for Adolescents, and the Online Technologies Self-Efficacy Scale. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0, with values of p < .05 considered to be significant. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic on a sample of 578 female midwifery students. Snowball sampling method was used for data collection using an online questionnaire. RESULTS: On the basis of the results, eHealth literacy and self-efficacy levels were relatively low in students who were 20 years old or below, who were in their first year, who were from low-income families, who spent less than an hour a day on the Internet, who had a low level of satisfaction with distance education, and who wanted to continue taking theoretical courses via distance education. In addition, self-efficacy related to online technologies was shown to be relatively low in students who found Internet services to be expensive, who had Internet connection problems, and who preferred asynchronous courses. Furthermore, a significant relationship was found between eHealth literacy and self-efficacy levels for online education.

Although it is known that the risk of severe disease is increased in certain human populations, including the elderly, it remains unclear why others who consume contaminated food develop listeriosis. Here, we used a murine model to discover that pulmonary coinfections can impair the host's ability to adequately control and eradicate systemic Lm that cross from the intestines to the bloodstream. We found that the resistance of mice to oral Lm infection was dramatically reduced by coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), a bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract and can also cause severe infections in the elderly. Exposure to Spn or microbial products, including a recombinant Lm protein (L1S) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), rendered otherwise resistant hosts susceptible to severe systemic Lm infection. In addition, we show that this increase in susceptibility was dependent on an increase in the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) from Ncr1+ cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Lastly, the ability of Ncr1+ cell derived IL-10 to increase disease susceptibility correlated with a dampening of both myeloid cell accumulation and myeloid cell phagocytic capacity in infected tissues. These data suggest that efforts to minimize inflammation in response to an insult at the respiratory mucosa render the host more susceptible to infections by Lm and possibly other pathogens that access the oral mucosa.","output":"Pulmonary insults exacerbate susceptibility to oral Listeria monocytogenes infection through the production of IL-10 by NK cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate COVID-19 vaccination status in admitted children in 2020C2021 and during the OMICRON variant circulation (2022), a period when children older than 12 years of age had received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

Due to this figure, the 90s witnessed the rise of green buildings (GBs) that were designed with the purpose of lowering the demand for energy, water, and materials resources while enhancing environmental protection efforts and human well-being over time. This paper examines recent studies and technologies related to the design, construction, and overall operation of GBs and determines potential future research directions in this area of study. This global review of green building development in the last two decades is conducted through bibliometric analysis on the Web of Science, via the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. Publication performance, countries characteristics, and identification of key areas of green building development and popular technologies were conducted via social network analysis, big data method, and S-curve predictions. A total of 5246 articles were evaluated on the basis of subject categories, journals performance, general publication outputs, and other publication characteristics. Further analysis was made on dominant issues through keyword co-occurrence, green building technologies by patent analysis, and S-curve predictions. The USA, China, and the UK are ranked the top three countries where the majority of publications come from. Australia and China had the closest relationship in the global network cooperation. Global trends of the top 5 countries showed different country characteristics. China had a steady and consistent growth in green building publications each year. The total publications on different cities had a high correlation with cities GDP by Baidu Search Index. Also, barriers and contradictions such as cost, occupant comfort, and energy consumption were discussed in developed and developing countries.

As approximately one-third of the worlds population is living under lockdown conditions, medical resources are being reallocated and hospital admissions are limited to emergencies. We examined the decision-making impact of these actions and their effects on access to hospital treatment in patients with neurosurgical conditions. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzes hospital admissions of two major neurosurgical services in Germany during the nationwide lockdown period (March 16(th) to April 16(th), 2020). Spinal or cranial conditions requiring immediate hospital admission and treatment constituted emergencies. RESULTS: A total of 243 in-patients were treated between March 16(th) and April 16(th) 2020 (122 patients at the University Medical Center Mainz, 121 patients at the University Medical Center G?ttingen). Of these, 38.016% qualified as emergency admission. Another 1,688 admissions were reviewed during the same periods in 2018 and 2019, providing a frame of reference. Overall, emergency admissions declined by 44.70.7% during lockdown. Admissions for cranial emergencies fell by 48.14.44%, spinal emergencies by 30.914.6%. CONCLUSION: Above findings indicate that in addition to postponing elective procedures, emergency admissions were dramatically curtailed during the COVID-19 lockdown.

As RIG-I is absent in chickens, MDA5 is hypothesized to be important in detecting viral nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. However, the molecular mechanism of the regulation of chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) expression has yet to be fully elucidated. With this in mind, a 2.5 kb chMDA5 gene promoter region was examined and PCR amplified to assess its role in immune response. A chMDA5 promoter reporter plasmid (piggybac-MDA5-DsRed) was constructed and transfected into DF-1 cells to establish a Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line. The MDA5 promoter activity was extremely low under basal condition, but was dramatically increased when cells were stimulated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), interferon beta (IFN-) or Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV). The DsRed mRNA level represented the promoter activity and was remarkably increased, which matched the expression of endogenous MDA5. However, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to increase the MDA5 promoter activity and the expression of endogenous MDA5. The results indicated that the promoter and the Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line could be utilized to determine whether a ligand regulates MDA5 expression.

In the last two decades, mortality rates for Indonesian pilgrims ranged between 200C380 deaths per 100,000 pilgrims over the 10-week Hajj period. Reasons for high mortality are not well understood. In 2008, verbal autopsy was introduced to complement routine death certificates to explore cause of death diagnoses. This study presents the patterns and causes of death for Indonesian pilgrims, and compares routine death certificates to verbal autopsy findings. METHODS: Public health surveillance was conducted by Indonesian public health authorities accompanying pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, with daily reporting of hospitalizations and deaths. Surveillance data from 2008 were analyzed for timing, geographic location and site of death. Percentages for each cause of death category from death certificates were compared to that from verbal autopsy. RESULTS: In 2008, 206,831 Indonesian undertook the Hajj. There were 446 deaths, equivalent to 1,968 deaths per 100,000 pilgrim years. Most pilgrims died in Mecca (68%) and Medinah (24%). There was no statistically discernible difference in the total mortality risk for the two pilgrimage routes (Mecca or Medinah first), but the number of deaths peaked earlier for those traveling to Mecca first (p=0.002). Most deaths were due to cardiovascular (66%) and respiratory (28%) diseases. A greater proportion of deaths were attributed to cardiovascular disease by death certificate compared to the verbal autopsy method (p<0.001). Significantly more deaths had ill-defined cause based on verbal autopsy method (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite pre-departure health screening and other medical services, Indonesian pilgrim mortality rates were very high. Correct classification of cause of death is critical for the development of risk mitigation strategies.

However, these vaccines are designed against SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan, China, and thereby may not be effective against other SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the United Kingdom variant (VUI-202012/01). The UK SARS-CoV-2 variant possesses D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which impart it a high rate of infection. Therefore, newer strategies are warranted to design novel vaccines and drug candidates specifically designed against the mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2. One such strategy is to target ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2)-Spike protein RBD (receptor binding domain) interaction. Here, we generated a homology model of Spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 UK strain and screened a marine seaweed database employing different computational approaches. On the basis of high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision, and extra precision molecular docking, we identified BE011 (Dieckol) as the most potent compounds against RBD. However, Dieckol did not display drug-like properties, and thus different derivatives of it were generated in silico and evaluated for binding potential and drug-like properties. One Dieckol derivative (DK07) displayed good binding affinity for RBD along with acceptable physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and ADMET properties. Analysis of the RBD-DK07 interaction suggested the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions with key residues mediating the ACE2-RBD interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the RBD-DK07 complex. Free energy calculations suggested the primary role of electrostatic and Van der Waals' interaction in stabilizing the RBD-DK07 complex. Thus, DK07 may be developed as a potential inhibitor of the RBD-ACE2 interaction.

At social level, social distancing behaviors such as abstaining from face-to-face contact were predicted by perceived social norms. Support for behavioral mandates was predicted by confidence in the government and cultural tightness, whereas support for anti-lockdown protests was predicted by (lower) perceived clarity of communication about the virus.

Direct threats to biodiversity within PAs and their interactions with broader-scale threats are both likely to vary with PA spatial and management characteristics (e.g., location, dependence on ecotourism revenues, governmental support). Private Land Conservation Areas (PLCAs) are interesting case study systems for assessing cross-scale threats to PAs and their determinants. Despite the growing number of PLCAs around the world, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the long-term capacity of these privately owned areas to conserve biodiversity. Their potential impermanence is commonly raised as a key concern. To better understand the threats to which different types of PLCAs are likely to be vulnerable, we asked 112 PLCA landholders in South Africa what they perceived as the top threats to their PLCAs. Landowners identified direct threats to the biodiversity within their PLCAs (e.g., poaching, extreme weather, inappropriate fire regimes, alien species) as well as describing broader socio-economic threats (e.g., regional crime, national legislation and politics, global economic recessions), which were noted to interact across scales. We found support for the hypothesis that patterns in the perceived multi-scale threats to a PLCA correspond with its management and spatial characteristics, including its remoteness, dependence on ecotourism or hunting revenues, and richness of megafaunal species. Understanding the threats to which different PLCAs may be vulnerable is useful for developing more nuanced, targeted strategies to build PLCA resilience to these threats (for example, by strengthening the capacity of self-funded PLCAs to cope with the threat of economic downturns through more innovative financial instruments or diversified revenue streams). Our findings highlight the importance of considering interactions between broad-scale socio-economic changes and direct threats to biodiversity, which can influence the resilience of PAs in ways that are not anticipated by more traditional, discipline-specific consideration of direct threats to the biodiversity within their boundaries.","output":"Cross-scale and social-ecological changes constitute main threats to private land conservation in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymer film capacitor with high energy density has attracted great attention in past decades to accomplish the requirements of miniaturization and lightweight for electronics and energy storage system.

Understanding the current state of the HIV epidemic and its change over time is essential to this effort. This study assesses the current sex-specific HIV burden in 204 countries and territories and measures progress in the control of the epidemic. METHODS: To estimate age-specific and sex-specific trends in 48 of 204 countries, we extended the Estimation and Projection Package Age-Sex Model to also implement the spectrum paediatric model. We used this model in cases where age and sex specific HIV-seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care-clinic sentinel surveillance data were available. For the remaining 156 of 204 locations, we developed a cohort-incidence bias adjustment to derive incidence as a function of cause-of-death data from vital registration systems. The incidence was input to a custom Spectrum model. To assess progress, we measured the percentage change in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 (threshold >75% decline), the ratio of incident cases to number of people living with HIV (incidence-to-prevalence ratio threshold <003), and the ratio of incident cases to deaths (incidence-to-mortality ratio threshold <10). FINDINGS: In 2019, there were 368 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 351C389) people living with HIV worldwide. There were 084 males (95% UI 078C091) per female living with HIV in 2019, 099 male infections (091C110) for every female infection, and 102 male deaths (095C110) per female death. Global progress in incident cases and deaths between 2010 and 2019 was driven by sub-Saharan Africa (with a 2852% decrease in incident cases, 95% UI 1958C3543, and a 3966% decrease in deaths, 3649C4236). Elsewhere, the incidence remained stable or increased, whereas deaths generally decreased. In 2019, the global incidence-to-prevalence ratio was 005 (95% UI 005C006) and the global incidence-to-mortality ratio was 194 (176C212). No regions met suggested thresholds for progress. INTERPRETATION: Sub-Saharan Africa had both the highest HIV burden and the greatest progress between 1990 and 2019. The number of incident cases and deaths in males and females approached parity in 2019, although there remained more females with HIV than males with HIV. Globally, the HIV epidemic is far from the UNAIDS benchmarks on progress metrics.

MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS Mental disorders were assessed using the \\"Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\\" and social support was determined using the \\"Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale.\\" Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. KEY CONCLUSIONS The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health. Pregnant women should have easy access to psychosocial support, and they should be provided obstetric counseling during the pandemic conditions.","output":"The Covid 19 outbreak: Maternal Mental Health and Associated Factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although policy makers recommend or impose various standard measures, such as social distancing, movement restrictions, wearing face masks and washing hands, against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, individuals follow these measures with varying degrees of meticulousness, as the perceptions regarding the impending danger and the efficacy of the measures are not uniform within a population.

This paper aims to contribute to academic literature on Romani studies, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, by adopting as its case study the town of ??nd?rei, a small town in the south of Romania, which in early 2020 was widely reported by Romanian media during both the pre- and post-quarantine period. The contributions rest on anchoring the study in post-foundational theory and media studies to understand the performativity of Roma identity and the discursive-performative practices of control employed by the Romania media in the first half of 2020. Aroused by the influx of ethnic Romani returning from Western Europe, the Romanian mainstream media expanded its coverage through sensationalist narratives and depictions of lawlessness and criminality. These branded the ethnic minority as a scapegoat for the spreading of the virus. Relying on critical social theory, this study attempts to understand how Roma have been portrayed during the Coronavirus crisis. Simultaneously, this paper resonates with current Roma theories about media discourses maintaining and reinforcing a sense of marginality for Roma communities. To understand the dynamics of Romanian media discourses, this study employs NVivo software tools and language-in-use discourse analysis to examine the headlines and sub headlines of approximately 300 articles that have covered COVID-19 developments in Roma communities between February and July 2020.

Objective To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation improves the time to a severe exacerbation in children with asthma and low vitamin D levels. Design, Setting, and Participants The Vitamin D to Prevent Severe Asthma Exacerbations (VDKA) Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin D3 supplementation to improve the time to severe exacerbations in high-risk children with asthma aged 6 to 16 years taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. Participants were recruited from 7 US centers. Enrollment started in February 2016, with a goal of 400 participants; the trial was terminated early (March 2019) due to futility, and follow-up ended in September 2019. Interventions Participants were randomized to vitamin D3, 4000 IU/d (n = 96), or placebo (n = 96) for 48 weeks and maintained with fluticasone propionate, 176 g/d (6-11 years old), or 220 g/d (12-16 years old). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. Secondary outcomes included the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants in whom the dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced halfway through the trial, and the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Results Among 192 randomized participants (mean age, 9.8 years; 77 girls [40%]), 180 (93.8%) completed the trial. A total of 36 participants (37.5%) in the vitamin D3 group and 33 (34.4%) in the placebo group had 1 or more severe exacerbations. Compared with placebo, vitamin D3 supplementation did not significantly improve the time to a severe exacerbation: the mean time to exacerbation was 240 days in the vitamin D3 group vs 253 days in the placebo group (mean group difference, -13.1 days [95% CI, -42.6 to 16.4]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.85]; P = .63). Vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, likewise did not significantly improve the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants whose dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced, or the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Serious adverse events were similar in both groups (vitamin D3 group, n = 11; placebo group, n = 9). Conclusions and Relevance Among children with persistent asthma and low vitamin D levels, vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to a severe asthma exacerbation.

METHODS: VOC B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2-positive patient samples were identified via whole-genome sequencing and variant-specific PCR. Confirmed B.1.1.7 (n = 48) and non-B.1.1.7 samples (n = 58) were analysed using the Allplex&#8482; SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV&#8482; PCR assay for presence of SARS-CoV-2 S, RdRp and N genes. The N gene coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with and without the D3L mutation (specific for B.1.1.7) was cloned into pCR&#8482;II-TOPO&#8482; vectors to validate polymorphism-dependent N gene dropout with the Allplex&#8482; SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV&#8482; PCR assay. RESULTS: All studied B.1.1.7-positive patient samples showed significantly higher Ct values in qRT-PCR (&#916;6-10, N gene dropout on Ct values > 29) of N gene than the corresponding values of S (p &#8804; 0.0001) and RdRp (p &#8804; 0.0001) genes.

This might not be true for bariatric surgery because of reimbursement requirements and changes in coding systems. We assessed the availability and validity of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes among bariatric surgery patients. METHODS We identified three nested retrospective cohorts of adult bariatric surgery patients who underwent adjusted gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or sleeve gastrectomy between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2018 using different components of OptumLabs? Data Warehouse, which contains linked de-identified claims and electronic health records (EHRs). We measured the availability of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes in the 6-month preoperative and 1-year postoperative periods in the main cohort identified in the claims data. We created two claims-based algorithms to classify the presence of severe obesity (a commonly used cohort selection criterion) and categorize BMI (a commonly used baseline confounder or postoperative outcome). We evaluated their performance by estimating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and weighted kappa in two sub-cohorts using EHR-based BMI measurements as the reference. RESULTS Among the 29,357 eligible patients identified using claims only, 28,828 (98.2%) had preoperative weight-related diagnosis codes, either granular indicating BMI ranges or nonspecific denoting obesity status. Among the 27,407 patients with granular preoperative codes, 12,346 (45.0%) had granular codes and 9355 (34.1%) had nonspecific codes in the 1-year postoperative period. Among the 3045 patients with both preoperative claims-based diagnosis codes and EHR-based BMI measurements, the severe obesity classification algorithm had a sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 78%. The BMI categorization algorithm had good validity categorizing the last available preoperative or postoperative BMI measurements (weighted kappa [95% confidence interval]: preoperative 0.78, [0.76, 0.79]; postoperative 0.84, [0.80, 0.87]).

Many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that numerous genetic loci were significantly associated with PBC susceptibility. However, the effects of genetic determinants on liver cells and its immune microenvironment for PBC remain unclear. RESULTS: We constructed a powerful computational framework to integrate GWAS summary statistics with scRNA-seq data to uncover genetics-modulated liver cell subpopulations for PBC. Based on our multi-omics integrative analysis, 29 risk genes including ORMDL3, GSNK2B, and DDAH2 were significantly associated with PBC susceptibility. By combining GWAS summary statistics with scRNA-seq data, we found that cholangiocytes exhibited a notable enrichment by PBC-related genetic association signals (Permuted P < 0.05). The risk gene of ORMDL3 showed the highest expression proportion in cholangiocytes than other liver cells (22.38%). The ORMDL3(+) cholangiocytes have prominently higher metabolism activity score than ORMDL3(?) cholangiocytes (P = 1.38  10(C15)). Compared with ORMDL3(?) cholangiocytes, there were 77 significantly differentially expressed genes among ORMDL3(+) cholangiocytes (FDR < 0.05), and these significant genes were associated with autoimmune diseases-related functional terms or pathways. The ORMDL3(+) cholangiocytes exhibited relatively high communications with macrophage and monocyte. Compared with ORMDL3(?) cholangiocytes, the VEGF signaling pathway is specific for ORMDL3(+) cholangiocytes to interact with other cell populations. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate genetic information with single cell sequencing data for parsing genetics-influenced liver cells for PBC risk.

While in the 1990s, it was detergents and the formation of foam in water, later the causes of discolouration around tanneries were researched, as well as the presence of chemicals and pollutants near industrial plants. Organochlorine pesticides, brominated flame retardants, perfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS, organotin compounds are some examples of such Emerging substances. After pesticides and industrial chemicals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, cosmetics and personal care products have also become Emerging substances. Ultimately, however, it is the effect of the substanceswhether persistent, bioaccumulative, mobile, toxic or even endocrine disruptionthat attracts attention and triggers legal regulations. As the substances and the methods for their detection changed, so did the corresponding legislation. This in turn led to the use of new or slightly modified substances and substance groups. Innovative methods such as non-targeted analytics and biological effect tests or bioassays are now being utilised to address the variety and combined effects of the existing substances. In order to ensure comprehensive groundwater and water protection, the investigation and assessment methods must be developed. Furthermore, the existing and newly acquired knowledge need to be translated into regulatory consequences more quickly. Beyond that, a comprehensive societal transformation with regard to the sustainable use of natural water resources is essential for environmentally sound and healthy development.

Urgent and careful planning is needed to mitigate negative effects of pandemic on engineering education that has been traditionally content-centered, hands-on and design-oriented. To enhance engineering online education during the pandemic, we conducted an observational study at California State University, Long Beach (one of the largest and most diverse four-year university in the U.S.). A total of 110 faculty members and 627 students from six engineering departments participated in surveys and answered quantitative and qualitative questions to highlight the challenges they experienced during the online instruction in Spring 2020. Our results identified various issues that negatively influenced the online engineering education including logistical/technical problems, learning/teaching challenges, privacy and security concerns and lack of sufficient hands-on training. For example, more than half of the students indicated lack of engagement in class, difficulty in maintaining their focus and Zoom fatigue after attending multiple online sessions. A correlation analysis showed that while semi-online asynchronous exams were associated with an increase in the perceived cheating by the instructors, a fully online or open-book/open-note exams had an association with a decrease in instructors perception of cheating. To address various identified challenges, we recommended strategies for educational stakeholders (students, faculty and administration) to fill the tools and technology gap and improve online engineering education. These recommendations are practical approaches for many similar institutions around the world and would help improve the learning outcomes of online educations in various engineering subfields. As the pandemic continues, sharing the results of this study with other educators can help with more effective planning and choice of best practices to enhance the efficacy of online engineering education during COVID-19 and post-pandemic.","output":"An observational study of engineering online education during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Reflection.","output":"A Covid Spring .2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human -coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It causes Covid-19 disease which has become pandemic. Each of the five-known human -coronaviruses has four major structural proteins (E, M, N and S) and 16 non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b together (ORF1ab) that are involved in virus pathogenicity and infectivity. Here, we performed detailed positive selection analyses for those six genes among the four previously known human -coronaviruses and within 38 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to assess signatures of adaptive evolution using maximum likelihood approaches. Our results suggest that three genes (E, S and ORF1ab genes) are under strong signatures of positive selection among human -coronavirus, influencing codons that are located in functional important protein domains. The E protein-coding gene showed signatures of positive selection in two sites, Asp 66 and Ser 68, located inside a putative transmembrane -helical domain C-terminal part, which is preferentially composed by hydrophilic residues. Such Asp and Ser sites substitutions (hydrophilic residues) increase the stability of the transmembrane domain in SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, substitutions in the spike (S) protein S1 N-terminal domain have been found, all of them were located on the S protein surface, suggesting their importance in viral transmissibility and survival. Furthermore, evidence of strong positive selection was detected in three of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP16), which are encoded by ORF1ab and play vital roles in suppressing host translation machinery, viral replication and transcription and inhibiting the host immune response. These results are insightful to assess the role of positive selection in the SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins, which will allow to better understand the virulent pathogenicity of the virus and potentially identifying targets for drug or vaccine strategy design","output":"Positive Selection as a Key Player for SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenicity: Insights into ORF1ab, S and E genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report for the first time DNA aptamers targeted toward the COVID-19 nucleocapsid protein (Np).

Therefore, the most affordable method to estimate COVID-19-related mortality is excess mortality (EM). Very often, though, EM is calculated on large spatial units that may entail different EM patterns and without stratifying deaths by age or sex, while, especially in the case of epidemics, it is important to identify the areas that suffered a higher death toll or that were spared. We developed the Stata COVID19_EM.ado procedure that estimates EM within municipalities in six subgroups defined by sex and age class using official data provided by ISTAT (Italian National Statistics Bureau) on deaths occurred from 2015 to 2020. Using simple linear regression models, we estimated the mortality trend in each age-and-sex subgroup and obtained the expected deaths of 2020 by extrapolating the linear trend. The results are then displayed using choropleth maps. Subsequently, local autocorrelation maps, which allow to appreciate the presence of local clusters of high or low EM, may be obtained using an R procedure that we developed. ? We focused on estimating excess mortality in small-scale spatial units (municipalities) and in population strata defined by age and sex. ? This method gives a deeper insight on excess mortality than summary figures at regional or national level, enabling to identify the local areas that suffered the most and the high-risk population subgroups within them. ?

Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place. However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes. Methods: Fourteen out of the randomly selected sample of the Ciao Corona cohort study participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections of school children attending primary and secondary school. A buccal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days. Results: Out of 1,299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least one of two testings. None of the teachers but one child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2% (95% CI 0.0C1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7 (0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in a new buccal sample taken 2 h to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. Thirty-five percent of children and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing. Conclusion: In a setting of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures in place (e.g., clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the low point prevalence even in a setting of very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for symptomatic children and school personnel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools.

The introduction of CO(2) as a soft oxidant into the reaction not only averts the over-oxidation of products, but also maintains the high oxidation state of the redox-active sites. Furthermore, the presence of CO(2) increases the conversion of propane by coupling the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) with the reverse water gas reaction (RWGS) and inhibits the coking formation to prolong the lifetime of catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction. An effective catalyst should selectively activate the CCH bond but suppress the CCC cleavage. However, to prepare such a catalyst remains challenging. Chromium-based catalysts are always applied in industrial application of DHP; however, their toxic properties are harmful to the environment. In this aspect, exploring environment-friendly and sustainable catalytic systems with Cr-free is an important issue. In this review, we outline the development of the CO(2)-ODHP especially in the last ten years, including the structural information, catalytic performances, and mechanisms of chromium-free metal-based catalyst systems, and the role of CO(2) in the reaction.

As of December 2015, this epidemic killed more than 11,000 people and infected more than 28,000; it has also generated more than 17,000 survivors and orphans, many of whom face somatic and psychological complications. The continued treatment and rehabilitation of these people is a public health priority, which also requires an integration of specific medical and social science approaches, not always available in West Africa.","output":"The 2014C2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa: Hands On"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) risk between patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) and the general population METHODS: We identified patients with ARD recorded in the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 2002 to 2015 and randomly selected a comparison cohort from the general population matched for age and sex. We analyzed PJP risk stratified by sex, age, comorbidities, and medications using Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: We enrolled 103,117 patients with ARD. PJP risk significantly increased in patients with any ARD and with each individual ARD like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogrens syndrome (SjS), polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and systemic vasculitis. Patients with PM/DM showed prominent risk with incidence rate of 12.47/100,000 patient year (95% confidence interval (CI), 32.16C86.70). In a time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model with comorbidities and medications as covariates, PM/DM, SSc, SLE, and SjS significantly increased adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 5.40, 5.12, 4.09, and 3.64, respectively (95% CI of 2.82C10.35, 2.16C12.13, 2.41C6.95, and 2.06C6.42, respectively). AHR after adjusting for male sex, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), and interstitial lung disease also significantly increased. Use of daily oral steroid dose of >10 mg conferred the highest risk followed by mycophenolate. Use of injected steroids, cyclophosphamide, biological agents, methotrexate, and cyclosporine conferred a significantly higher risk. CONCLUSION: Underlying ARD significantly predisposes patients to PJP, with PM/DM posing the highest threat. In addition to underlying disease, comorbidities and concomitant immunosuppressants are major risks. The strongest risk is recent daily steroid dose of >10 mg. Mycophenolate seems to be a more prominent risk factor than cyclophosphamide.","output":"Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in autoimmune rheumatic diseases: a nationwide population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astrotourism and related citizen science activities are becoming a major trend of a sustainable, high-quality tourism segment, core elements to the protection of Dark skies in many countries.

METHODS: A mass test campaign was performed on May 13, 2020, with the use of antibody-detection rapid tests for asymptomatic inmates and RT-PCR for symptomatic. Those with negative results were retested on June 16. Inmates were interviewed for the characterization of background health conditions and the presence of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 159 inmates were evaluated. In the first mass testing, we found that 79.9% (127/159) had been infected and 53.5% (68/127) of those reported symptoms. There were 17 new cases after the second testing, meaning 90.6% (144/159) of inmates had some positive result. Comorbidities were present in 67.3%; two hospitalizations and no COVID-related deaths were recorded. CONCLUSION: More than 90% of inmates over the age of 60 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Periodic health monitoring, active case finding and early care for symptomatic patients were the main actions that contributed to positive post-infection outcomes. Such measures must be considered as essential components for the surveillance of COVID-19 in environments with limited capacity to promote social distance, such as penitentiary institutions.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 among inmates over 60 years of age during a COVID-19 outbreak in a penitentiary complex in Brazil: positive health outcomes despite high prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers have increasingly paid attention to the impact that the administrative component of elections has on voter behavior. Existing research has focused almost exclusively on the effect that legal changes--such as voter identification laws--have on turnout. This paper extends our understanding of the electoral process by exploring how one aspect of the precinct experience--standing in line to vote--can shape the turnout behavior of voters in subsequent elections. I demonstrate that for every additional hour a voter waits in line to vote, their probability of voting in the subsequent election drops by 1 percentage point. To arrive at these estimates, I analyze vote history files using a combination of exact matching and placebo tests to test the identification assumptions. I then leverage an unusual institutional arrangement in the City of Boston and longitudinal data from Florida to show that the result also holds at the precinct level. The findings in this paper have important policy implications for administrative changes that may impact line length, such as voter identification requirements and precinct consolidation.

Like other businesses, webstores have also faced the challenges in their efforts to satisfy their customers during COVID-19. Service failure has increased due to unexpected circumstances produced by this pandemic. It has become necessary for the webstores to retain their dissatisfied customers by reconsidering their service strategies. Relevant data for the purpose of this study were collected through questionnaires from 383 respondents by using online channels. The online channels were exclusively employed for maintaining the safety of respondents during COVID-19. Respondents for this study were online shoppers who encountered service failure during COVID-19. The results indicated that the incidence of service failure has increased due to an increase in online shopping during COVID-19. Some customers tend to repurchase from the same webstore. On the other hand, some customers do not want to purchase again from the same seller and decided to switch to the alternative webstore. Based on the findings, new strategy for online shopping service providers was introduced. This strategy will be helpful for the online service providers to increase their profitability by retaining their dissatisfied customers. Service providers can minimize the number of customers switching to other webstores by reducing the events of service failure. Customers assistive intent can also be helpful for service providers to increase the efficiency of service recovery.

This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in social settings. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at aspects of the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require measures to be switched on and off and for this reason elimination is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for elimination, it would not on its own be an efficient mechanism to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up elimination, and be a better tool for the prevention of infection or reinfection. Because the analysis presented here is theoretical, and not data-driven, it is intended to be a stimulus for further data-collection, particularly on individual interactivity levels, and for more comprehensive modelling which takes account of the type of heterogeneity discussed here. While there are some clear lessons from the simple model presented here, policy makers should have these tested and validated by epidemiological specialists before acting on them.","output":"Human agency and infection rates: Implications for social distancing during epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV-3) is the most common in Europe in both humans and pigs.

Prevalence was higher in growers than in fatteners, with most of the pigs still positive around 166 days of age. Beyond some difference among individual pigs, the amount of HEV in feces decreased with the age of animals.

METHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by an assessment of the ongoing clinical trials that were revealed by the search. RESULTS: A number of substances have been found to prevent the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These include virustatic agents that have already been approved for the treatment of other types of viral infection, as well as drugs that are currently used for entirely different purposes. High in vitro activity has been found for the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and for nitazoxanide, a drug used to treat protozoan infections. Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a role in the fusion of the virus with cells; inhibitors of this enzyme are known as well. The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials. At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov. Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020.

Setting: United States; December 14, 2020, to November 17, 2021. Participants: COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Measurements: Reporting rates for death events per million persons vaccinated; adverse event counts; data mining signals of disproportionate reporting. Results: 9,201 death events were reported for COVID-19 vaccine recipients aged five years and older (or age unknown). Reporting rates for death events increased with increasing age, and males generally had higher reporting rates than females. For death events within seven days and 42 days of vaccination, respectively, observed reporting rates were lower than the expected all-cause death rates. Reporting rates for Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were generally higher than for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but still lower than the expected all-cause death rates. Reported adverse events were non-specific or reflected the known leading causes of death. Limitations: VAERS data are subject to several limitations such as reporting bias (underreporting and stimulated reporting), missing or inaccurate information, and lack of a control group. Reported diagnoses, including deaths, are not causally verified diagnoses. Conclusion: Reporting rates for death events were lower than the expected all-cause mortality rates.

In order to develop and optimize new annuloplasty ring designs, it is important to study the complex biomechanical behaviour of the valve annulus and the subvalvular apparatus with simultaneous in- and out-of-plane restraining force measurements. A new flat D-shaped mitral valve annular force transducer was developed. The transducer was mounted with strain gauges to measure strain and calibrated to provide simultaneous restraining forces in- and out of the mitral annular plane. The force transducer was implanted and evaluated in an 80 kg porcine experimental model. Accumulation of out-of-plane restraining forces, creating strain in the anterior segment were 0.7  0.0 N (towards apex) and an average force accumulation of 1.5  0.3 N, creating strain in the commissural segments (away from apex). The accumulations of in-plane restraining forces, creating strain on the inner side of the ring were 1.7  0.2 N (away from ring center). A new mitral annular force transducer was successfully developed and evaluated in vivo. The transducer was able to measure forces simultaneously in different planes. Initial indications point towards overall agreement with previous individual force measurements in- and out-of the mitral annular plane.

The most rigorous NPIs decreased the peak number of infections by 4.3 and delayed the peak by 9.7 days in the absence of pre-symptomatic controls. Reductions in attack rate were not likely, even with rigorous application of all defined NPIs, unless pre-symptomatic carriers were identified and isolated at rates exceeding 76%. Attack rate was most sensitive to the pre-symptomatic isolation rate (Sobol' index > 0.7) and secondarily to R0. Conclusions. Common NPIs delayed and reduced epidemic peaks.

However, it remains unclear how genetic variations in ACE2 may affect its function and structure, and consequently alter the recognition by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We have systemically characterized missense variants in the gene ACE2 using data from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; N = 141,456). To investigate the putative deleterious role of missense variants, six existing functional prediction tools were applied to evaluate their impact. We further analyzed the structural flexibility of ACE2 and its proteinCprotein interface with the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 using our developed Legion Interfaces Analysis (LiAn) program. RESULTS: Here, we characterized a total of 12 ACE2 putative deleterious missense variants. Of those 12 variants, we further showed that p.His378Arg could directly weaken the binding of catalytic metal atom to decrease ACE2 activity and p.Ser19Pro could distort the most important helix to the S-protein. Another seven missense variants may affect secondary structures (i.e. p.Gly211Arg; p.Asp206Gly; p.Arg219Cys; p.Arg219His, p.Lys341Arg, p.Ile468Val, and p.Ser547Cys), whereas p.Ile468Val with AF = 0.01 is only present in Asian. CONCLUSIONS: We provide strong evidence of putative deleterious missense variants in ACE2 that are present in specific populations, which could disrupt the function and structure of ACE2.

MS does not alter fertility and has no impact on fetal development, the course of pregnancy, or childbirth. The Pregnancy in Multiple Sclerosis Study in 1998 showed that pregnancy, mostly in untreated women, did not adversely affect MS, as disease activity decreased during pregnancy (although it significantly increased in the first trimester postpartum). These findings, together with the limited information available on the potential risks of fetal exposure to disease modifying treatments (DMTs), meant that women were advised to delay the onset of DMTs, stop them prior to conception, or, in case of unplanned pregnancy, discontinue them when pregnancy was confirmed. Now, many women with MS receive DMTs before pregnancy and, despite being considered a period of MS stability, up to 30% of patients could relapse in the first trimester postpartum. Factors associated with an increased risk of relapse and disability during pregnancy and postpartum include relapses before and during pregnancy, a greater disability at the time of conception, the occurrence of relapses after DMT cessation before conception, and the use of high-efficacy DMTs before conception, especially natalizumab or fingolimod. Strategies to prevent postpartum activity are needed in some patients, but consensus is lacking regarding the therapeutic strategies for women with MS of a fertile age. This, along with the increasing number of DMTs, means that the decision-making processes in aspects related to family planning and therapeutic strategies before, during, and after pregnancy are increasingly more complex. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on pregnancy-related issues in women with MS, including recommendations for counseling, general management, use of DMTs in pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum periods, and breastfeeding-related aspects of DMTs.","output":"Updated Perspectives on the Challenges of Managing Multiple Sclerosis During Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate systematically the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrial gov, CNKI, Wanfang Data, China Biomedical Literature Service System, and China Clinical Trial Registry were searched for randomized controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines published up to December 31, 2020 The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to assess the quality of studies A qualitative analysis was performed on the results of clinical trials RESULTS: Thirteen randomized, blinded, controlled trials, which involved the safety and efficacy of 11 COVID-19 vaccines, were included In 10 studies, the 28-day seroconversion rate of subjects exceeded 80% In two 10 000-scale clinical trials, the vaccines were effective in 95% and 70 4% of the subjects, respectively The seroconversion rate was lower than 60% in only one study In six studies, the proportion of subjects who had an adverse reaction within 28 days after vaccination was lower than 30% This proportion was 30%-50% in two studies and &gt; 50% in the other two studies Most of the adverse reactions were mild to moderate and resolved within 24 hours after vaccination The most common local adverse reaction was pain or tenderness at the injection site, and the most common systemic adverse reaction was fatigue, fever, or bodily pain The immune response and incidence of adverse reactions to the vaccines were positively correlated with the dose given to the subjects The immune response to the vaccines was worse in the elderly than in the younger population In 6 studies that compared single-dose and double-dose vaccination, 4 studies showed that double-dose vaccination produced a stronger immune response than single-dose vaccination CONCLUSIONS: Most of the COVID-19 vaccines appear to be effective and safe Double-dose vaccination is recommended However, more research is needed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the vaccines and the influence of dose, age, and production process on the protective efficacy","output":"Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The filoviruses, which include the marburg- and ebolaviruses, have caused multiple outbreaks among humans this decade.

There is limited data on the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders, particularly in rural as compared to urban areas. ObjectiveTo examine the association between stay-at-home order implementation and the incidence of COVID-19 in rural vs. urban counties. DesignInterrupted time series analysis using a mixed effects zero-inflated Poisson model. Participants3,142 U.S. counties. InterventionsStay-at-home orders. Main MeasuresCOVID-19 daily incidence (primary) and mobility (secondary and intermediate measure of stay-at-home effectiveness) Key ResultsStay-at-home orders were implemented later (median March 30 vs. March 28) and were shorter (median 35 vs. 54 days) in rural than urban counties. Indoor mobility was, on average, 2.6-6.9% higher in rural than urban counties both during and after stay-at-home orders. Compared to the baseline (pre-stay-at-home) period, the number of new COVID-19 cases increased under stay-at-home by IRR 1.60 (95% CI, 1.57-1.64) in rural and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.30-1.42) in urban counties. For each day under stay-at-home orders, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.982 (95% CI 0.981-0.982) in rural and 0.952 (95% CI, 0.951-0.953) in urban counties compared to prior to stay-at-home. Each day after stay-at-home orders expired, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.995 (95% CI, 0.994-0.995) in rural and 0.997 (95% CI, 0.995-0.999) in urban counties compared to prior to stay-at-home. ConclusionStay-at-home orders decreased mobility and slowed the spread of COVID-19, but less effectively in rural than in urban counties. This necessitates a critical reevaluation of how stay-at-home orders are designed, communicated, and implemented in rural areas.","output":"The Association of Stay-at-Home Orders and the Spread of COVID-19 in Rural and Urban United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How to quickly identify high-risk populations is critical to epidemic control.

Despite widespread outbreaks in many countries, no effective PDCoV vaccines are currently available. Here, we generated, for the first time, a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PDCoV. We further manipulated the infectious clone by replacing the NS6 gene with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to generate rPDCoV-NS6-GFP; likewise, rPDCoV-NS7 was constructed by removing the ATG start codons of the NS7 gene. Growth kinetics studies suggest that rPDCoV-NS7 could replicate similarly to that of the wild-type PDCoV, whereas rPDCoV-NS6-GFP exhibited a substantial reduction of viral titer in vitro and in vivo. Piglets inoculated with rPDCoV-NS7 or wild-type PDCoV showed similar diarrheic scores and pathological injury. In contrast, rPDCoV-NS6-GFP-infected piglets did not show any clinical signs, indicating that the NS6 protein is an important virulence factor of PDCoV and that the NS6-deficient mutant virus might be a promising live-attenuated vaccine candidate. Taken together, the reverse genetics platform described here not only provides more insights into the role of PDCoV accessory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis, but also allows the development of novel vaccines against PDCoV infection.","output":"Genetic manipulation of porcine deltacoronavirus reveals insights into NS6 and NS7 functions: a novel strategy for vaccine design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dr Khouli has special expertise in the evaluation and management of patients with complex critical illnesses including sepsis and septic shock, ARDS, multiorgan failure and decision-making at the end of life.

The Dominican Republic was among the first countries in recommending the administration of a third dose COVID-19 vaccine to address potential waning immunity and reduced effectiveness against variants. Here, we evaluated the effects of a heterologous BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine booster on the humoral immunity of participants that had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine used globally. We found that heterologous CoronaVac prime followed by BNT162b2 booster regimen induces elevated virus-specific antibody levels and potent neutralization activity against the ancestral virus and Delta variant, resembling the titers obtained after two doses of mRNA vaccines. While neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in participants that had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac vaccine, BNT162b2 booster resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in neutralization activity against Omicron, compared to two-dose mRNA vaccine. Despite this increase, neutralizing antibody titers were reduced by 6.3-fold and 2.7-fold for Omicron compared to ancestral and Delta variant, respectively. Surprisingly, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection did not affect the neutralizing titers for Omicron in participants that received the heterologous regimen. Our findings have immediate implications for multiples countries that previously used a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac and reinforce the notion that the Omicron variant is associated with immune escape from vaccines or infection-induced immunity, highlighting the global need for vaccine boosters to combat the impact of emerging variants.","output":"Immunogenicity of heterologous BNT162b2 booster in fully vaccinated individuals with CoronaVac against SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta and Omicron: the Dominican Republic Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 main protease, M(pro), is conserved among coronaviruses with no human homolog and has therefore attracted significant attention as an enzyme drug target for COVID-19.

Clearly, current attempts at designing drugs targeting M(pro) with the aid of computational docking would benefit from a priori knowledge of the ability of docking programs to predict correct binding modes and score these correctly. In the current work, we tested the ability of several leading docking programs, namely, Glide, DOCK, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, FRED, and EnzyDock, to correctly identify and score the binding mode of M(pro) ligands in 193 crystal structures. None of the codes were able to correctly identify the crystal structure binding mode (lowest energy pose with root-mean-square deviation < 2 ?) in more than 26% of the cases for noncovalently bound ligands (Glide: top performer), whereas for covalently bound ligands the top score was 45% (EnzyDock).

These measures are also a signal of other things like systemic risks and weaknesses. A period of quarantine is also a thing in and by itself. What happens after quarantine is thus shaped both by the state of the social-ecological system preceding quarantine and by what happened during quarantine. The selectivities introduced during quarantine span discursive, institutional and material realms. Old discourses can return with a new meaning. Social and economic relations can reappear seemingly unchanged, they can be more visibly altered and they can be dismantled. Ideologies, however, to be understood here as master discourses, read problems and solutions in their own way and do not necessarily come closer to each other or disappear. All this, offers food for thought regarding the possibilities and limits of resilience and transition. We argue that the current COVID- 19 pandemic casts doubt on the generic applicability of theories of resilience and transition, yet also sheds a new light on the value of both. We propose the concept of reinvention to describe what is happening and what could happen in a more coordinated fashion. We argue that the current crisis reveals mechanisms in systems dynamics that point at the existence of multiple pathways after dramatic system shocks. Some shocks and their system- specific responses (such as a particular kind of quarantine) are more amenable to resilience strategies afterwards, while others require a path of radical transition. They might also both be needed: a rather stark transition now might ensure future resilience. While the outline of the system after transition is not clear, some desirable features are clear as are the risks and damages of the current system. Also clear is the argument for transitional governance, a temporary governance system (beyond quarantine) which can enable the construction of new long term perspectives in governance and new governance tools meant to reduce chances of a crisis like this one reoccuring.","output":"Resilience, Reinvention and Transition during and after Quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with those expected from historical trends have been unequally distributed, both geographically and socioeconomically. Not all excess deaths have been directly related to COVID-19 infection. We investigated geographical and socioeconomic patterns in excess deaths for major groups of underlying causes during the pandemic. METHODS: Weekly mortality data from 27/12/2014 to 2/10/2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends for deaths caused directly by COVID-19 (and other respiratory causes) and those caused indirectly by it (cardiovascular disease or diabetes, cancers, and all other indirect causes) over the first 30 weeks of the pandemic (7/3/2020C2/10/2020). FINDINGS: There were 62,321 (95% CI: 58,849 to 65,793) excess deaths in England and Wales in the first 30 weeks of the pandemic. Of these, 46,221 (95% CI: 45,439 to 47,003) were attributable to respiratory causes, including COVID-19, and 16,100 (95% CI: 13,410 to 18,790) to other causes. Rates of all-cause excess mortality ranged from 78 per 100,000 in the South West of England and in Wales to 130 per 100,000 in the West Midlands; and from 93 per 100,000 in the most affluent fifth of areas to 124 per 100,000 in the most deprived. The most deprived areas had the highest rates of death attributable to COVID-19 and other indirect deaths, but there was no socioeconomic gradient for excess deaths from cardiovascular disease/diabetes and cancer. INTERPRETATION: During the first 30 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant geographic and socioeconomic variation in excess deaths for respiratory causes, but not for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Pandemic recovery plans, including vaccination programmes, should take account of individual characteristics including health, socioeconomic status and place of residence.

The scheme offers 5G-tactile internet (5G-TI)-based services for UAV communication networks (UAVCN) monitored through ground controller stations (GCs). 5G-TI enabled UAVCN supports real-time dense connectivity at ultra-low round-trip time (RTT) latency of < 1 and high availability of 99.9999%. Thus, it can support resilient vaccine distributions in a phased manner at government-designated nodal centers (NCs) with reduced round trip delays from vaccine production warehouses (VPW). Further, UAVCNs ensure minimizes human intervention and controls vaccine health conditions due to shorter trip times. Once vaccines are supplied at NCs warehouses, then the BC ensures timestamped documentation of vaccinated persons with chronology, auditability, and transparency of supply-chain checkpoints from VPW to NCs. Through smart contracts (SCs), priority groups can be formed for vaccination based on age, healthcare workers, and general commodities. In the simulation, for UAV efficacy, we have compared the scheme against fourth-generation (4G)-assisted long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, and traditional logistics for round-trip time (RTT) latency, logistics, and communication costs. In the BC setup, we have compared the scheme against the existing 5G-TI delivery scheme (Gupta et al.) for processing latency, packet losses, and transaction time. For example, in communication costs, the proposed scheme achieves an average improvement of 9.13 for block meta-information. For 4000 transactions, the proposed scheme has a communication latency of 16s compared to 36s. The packet loss is significantly reduced to 2.5% using 5G-TI compared to 16% in 4G-LTE-A. The proposed scheme has a computation cost of 1.6 ms and a communication cost of 157 bytes, which indicates the proposed scheme efficacy against conventional approaches.","output":"VaCoChain: Blockchain-based 5G-assisted UAV Vaccine distribution scheme for future pandemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Metastatic Crohn's disease (CD) is a rare manifestation of CD. It involves inflammatory skin lesions with histopathological findings (granulomas) similar to CD, without connection to the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been suggested as a possible treatment option. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify and treat a consecutive series of patients with biopsy-proven metastatic CD and monitor wound healing using prospectively acquired outcomes. METHODS Pathology results of all patients with ongoing perineal wound-healing problems after proctectomy between 2005 and 2018 at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre were assessed for metastatic CD. Patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of perineal metastatic CD were offered HBO (40 daily sessions of 100% oxygen at 2.4 atmosphere absolute). Wound healing was monitored using photographs and standardised questionnaires (the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and the Female Sexual Function Index) at baseline and 1 and 3 months after HBO. RESULTS Out of 13 patients in the cohort with persisting perineal wounds after proctectomy, six (46%) had biopsy results consistent with metastatic CD. Of these, three accepted treatment with HBO. All three patients were female. One patient had complete healing of her perineal wound; another patient showed initial improvement but had a flare of luminal and perineal disease at the 3-month follow-up. The third patient showed improvement solely in the questionnaires, with higher scores on all three questionnaires. CONCLUSION A high rate of metastatic CD was found in patients with ongoing wound-healing problems after proctectomy, implying that the disease might not be as rare in these selected patients as previously thought.

The text was extended and introduced a broader view in particular on the impact of culture and religion. The results were discussed at the ESPEN Congress in Lisbon 2015 and accepted in an online survey among ESPEN members. RESULTS The ESPEN Guideline on Ethical Aspects of Artificial Nutrition and Hydration is focused on the adult patient and provides a critical summary for physicians and caregivers. Special consideration is given to end of life issues and palliative medicine; to dementia and to specific situations like nursing care or the intensive care unit. The respect for autonomy is an important focus of the guideline as well as the careful wording to be used in the communication with patients and families. The other principles of Bioethics like beneficence, non-maleficence and justice are presented in the context of artificial nutrition and hydration. In this respect the withholding and withdrawing of artificial nutrition and/or hydration is discussed. Due to increasingly multicultural societies and the need for awareness of different values and beliefs an elaborated chapter is dedicated to cultural and religious issues and nutrition.

BPDCN occurs at least three times more frequently in men than women, but the reasons for this sex bias are unknown. Here, studying genomics of primary BPDCN and modeling disease-associated mutations, we link acquired alterations in RNA splicing to abnormal pDC development and inflammatory response through Toll-like receptors. Loss-of-function mutations in ZRSR2, an X chromosome gene encoding a splicing factor, are enriched in BPDCN and nearly all mutations occur in males. ZRSR2 mutation impairs pDC activation and apoptosis after inflammatory stimuli, associated with intron retention and inability to upregulate the transcription factor IRF7. In vivo, BPDCN-associated mutations promote pDC expansion and signatures of decreased activation. These data support a model in which male-biased mutations in hematopoietic progenitors alter pDC function and confer protection from apoptosis, which may impair immunity and predispose to leukemic transformation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Sex bias in cancer is well recognized but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely defined. We connect X chromosome mutations in ZRSR2 to an extremely male-predominant leukemia. Aberrant RNA splicing induced by ZRSR2 mutation impairs dendritic cell inflammatory signaling, interferon production, and apoptosis, revealing a sex- and lineage-related tumor suppressor pathway.","output":"Sex-biased ZRSR2 mutations in myeloid malignancies impair plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation and apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic. According to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of China, negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the key criterion for discharging COVID-19 patients. However, repeated RT-PCR tests lead to medical waste and prolonged hospital stays for COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. Our purpose is to assess a model based on chest computed tomography (CT) radiomic features and clinical characteristics to predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, 203 mild COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital were retrospectively included (training: n = 141; testing: n = 62), and clinical characteristics were collected. Lung abnormalities on chest CT images were segmented with a deep learning algorithm. CT quantitative features and radiomic features were automatically extracted. Clinical characteristics and CT quantitative features were compared between RT-PCR-negative and RT-PCR-positive groups. Univariate logistic regression and Spearman correlation analyses identified the strongest features associated with RT-PCR negativity, and a multivariate logistic regression model was established. The diagnostic performance was evaluated for both cohorts. RESULTS: The RT-PCR-negative group had a longer time interval from symptom onset to CT exams than the RT-PCR-positive group (median 23 vs. 16 days, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the other clinical characteristics or CT quantitative features. In addition to the time interval from symptom onset to CT exams, nine CT radiomic features were selected for the model. ROC curve analysis revealed AUCs of 0.811 and 0.812 for differentiating the RT-PCR-negative group, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.765/0.625 and 0.784/0.600 in the training and testing datasets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The model combining CT radiomic features and clinical data helped predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment, indicating the proper time for RT-PCR retesting.","output":"A model based on CT radiomic features for predicting RT-PCR becoming negative in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness, termed COVID-19 in December 2019. There is a lack of specific therapeutic agents based on evidence for this novel coronavirus infection; however, several medications have been evaluated as a potential therapy. Therapy is required to treat symptomatic patients and decrease the virus carriage duration to limit the communitytransmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We hypothesise that patients with mild COVID-19 treated with favipiravir will have a shorter duration of time to virus clearance than the control group. The primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of favipiravir on the timing of the PCR test conversion from positive to negative within 15 days after starting the medicine.Adults (>18 years, men or nonpregnant women, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 within 5 days of disease onset) are being recruited by physicians participating from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs and the Ministry of Health ethics committee approved primary healthcare centres. This double-blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening, treatment and a follow-up period. The treating physician and patients are blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800 mg by mouth two times per day for the first day, followed by 800 mg two times per day for 4-7 days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1 (5 days before therapy). On day51 day, 101 day, 152 days, extra nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID-19 samples are requested.The primary analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be a modified intention to treat population. Anticipating a 10% dropout rate, we expect to recruit 288 subjects per arm. The results assume that the hazard ratio is constant throughout the study and that the Cox proportional hazard regression is used to analyse the data.

The impact of fiscal stress on environmental efficiency is examined from the perspective of urban horizontal imbalance. We find that the smaller the fiscal stress, the higher urban environmental efficiency. The endogeneity is mitigated by using instrumental variables and the generalized method of moments, and the results are still robust after considering the interference of sample selection bias and variable estimation bias. At the same time, the impact of fiscal stress on environmental efficiency varies with spatial location, ecological strategic planning, economic development, and other factors, especially in southern cities, cities in the Yangtze River Basin, and cities in urban agglomerations, where reducing fiscal stress promotes environmental efficiency.

The NIMHD Framework was used to identify SDOHs that may change for families during COVID-19. METHODS: Parents were recruited via Prolific (N = 321) and completed questions about COVID-19 family impacts on employment, income, access to food and healthcare, and psychosocial functioning, including discrimination. It was hypothesized that NHW families of children with asthma and BIPOC families would endorse greater negative outcomes relative to NHW parents of healthy children. RESULTS: BIPOC families experienced greater food insecurity and discrimination relative to NHW parents of healthy children. When compared with the NHW healthy group, COVID-19 resulted in greater parent-reported resource losses for both BIPOC groups and greater reductions in healthcare access for both asthma groups. Children with asthma and BIPOC children had greater distress surrounding COVID-19. BIPOC and NHW parents of children with asthma reported greater worries about resource losses due to COVID-19.

If not, they could be uncurable and deadly. Due to this reason, there is a need of analysing complex medical data, medical reports, and medical images at a lesser time but with greater accuracy. There are even some instances where certain abnormalities cannot be directly recognized by humans. In healthcare for computational decision making, machine learning approaches are being used in these types of situations where a crucial data analysis needs to be performed on medical data to reveal hidden relationships or abnormalities which are not visible to humans. Implementing algorithms to perform such tasks itself is difficult, but what makes it even more challenging is to increase the accuracy of the algorithm while decreasing the required time for the algorithm to execute. In the early days, processing of large amount of medical data was an important task which resulted in machine learning being adapted in the biological domain. Since this happened, the biology and biomedical fields have been reaching higher levels by exploring more knowledge and identifying relationships which were never observed before. Reaching to its peak now the concern is being diverted towards treating patients not only based on the type of disease but also their genetics, which is known as precision medicine. Modifications in machine learning algorithms are being performed and tested daily to improve the performance of the algorithms in analysing and presenting more accurate information. In the healthcare field, starting from information extraction from medical documents until the prediction or diagnosis of a disease, machine learning has been involved. Medical imaging is a section that was greatly improved with the integration of machine learning algorithms to the field of computational biology. Nowadays, many disease diagnoses are being performed by medical image processing using machine learning algorithms. In addition, patient care, resource allocation, and research on treatments for various diseases are also being performed using machine learning-based computational decision making. Throughout this paper, various machine learning algorithms and approaches that are being used for decision making in the healthcare sector will be discussed along with the involvement of machine learning in healthcare applications in the current context. With the explored knowledge, it was evident that neural network-based deep learning methods have performed extremely well in the field of computational biology with the support of the high processing power of modern sophisticated computers and are being extensively applied because of their high predicting accuracy and reliability. When giving concern towards the big picture by combining the observations, it is noticeable that computational biology and biomedicine-based decision making in healthcare have now become dependent on machine learning algorithms, and thus they cannot be separated from the field of artificial intelligence.","output":"Involvement of Machine Learning Tools in Healthcare Decision Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore anxiety status across a broad range of HCWs supporting patients with COVID-19 in different global regions. METHOD: This was an international online survey in which participation was on voluntary basis and data were submitted via Google Drive, across a two-week period starting from March 18, 2020. The Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to quantify the level of anxiety. RESULTS: 1416 HCWs (70.8% medical doctors, 26.2% nurses) responded to the survey from 75 countries. The distribution of anxiety levels was: normal/minimal (n = 503, 35.5%), low (n = 390, 27.5%); moderate (n = 287, 20.3%), and severe (n = 236, 16.7%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 127 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the intensive care unit of two teaching hospitals were included. VTE was diagnosed with either ultrasound or computed tomography scan. Univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for Positive End Expiratory Pressure, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time as well as levels of fibrinogen, antithrombin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate analysis was done using binary linear regression. RESULTS: Variables associated with VTE in both univariate and multivariate analysis were D-dimer and CRP with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64, P = 0.023 and 0.75, P = 0.045, respectively. Variables indicating hypoxemia were not predictive. The ROC curve of D-dimer and CRP combined had an AUC of 0.83, P < 0.05.

In particular, the migration of exercise physiology labs, which included anaerobic and aerobic exercise tests, posed a considerable hurdle in attempting to provide a practical and engaging lab environment fully online. Using a qualitative case-study design, this presentation will highlight the experience of migrating exercise physiology labs into a virtual post-secondary course context. In Fall 2020, approximately 200 Kinesiology students attended a virtual second-year exercise physiology course, which included four previously in-person, bi-weekly labs. Labs were rapidly migrated onto an open access platform for integration into the existing institutional learning management system. Students completed bi-weekly labs in lab groups of 20-25 students, led by a Teaching Assistant (TA), with students working in small breakout groups of 4-5 students to complete the virtual lab as a group using a collaborative workspace. Following the breakouts, students would rejoin their peers in the main group for a post-lab discussion period to discuss lab report questions with the TA. After the lab, students completed a content quiz which included a responsive question: ?What did you like about the lab? What do you feel could be improved about the lab?? Given the importance of considering students as partners in course development, responses from students were considered in refinement of future virtual labs throughout the term. Responses were analyzed using qualitative coding for positive/neutral/negative responses, and general themes emerged for each lab. Briefly, main themes for improvement included: increased organization and instruction for navigating the virtual lab, more contact with the TA in breakout rooms, improving engagement between members of breakout groups, and enhancements to the virtual lab components. Positive themes included: students enjoying breakout room opportunities to connect with peers, TA support especially in the post-lab discussion period, and additional cues added to the virtual lab. Finally, student responses became increasingly positive from the first lab to fourth lab, with students noting their appreciation for being a part of the refinement process. Overall, this presentation, detailing the practical considerations of migrating labs to a virtual environment, will benefit future exercise physiology instructors in pursuing successful virtual lab delivery.","output":"Learning pains: practical considerations in migrating exercise physiology labs to a virtual environment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper summarizes the results of study on the recovery of previously mastered skills of attack motions when transferring from classical to beach volleyball by means of biomechanical analysis. The purpose of the study was to evaluate advantages of the implementation of biomechanical analysis in the recovery of previously mastered techniques in beach volleyball.

Knowing the intended uptake of the vaccine will inform supply and public health messaging to maximize vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the acceptance of influenza vaccination in the 2020-2021 season, specifically focusing on people who were previously eligible but routinely declined vaccination and newly eligible people. METHODS: Intention to receive the influenza vaccine in 2020-2021 was asked of all registrants of the largest electronic personal health record in the NHS by a web-based questionnaire on July 31, 2020. Of those who were either newly or previously eligible but had not previously received an influenza vaccination, multivariable logistic regression and network diagrams were used to examine their reasons to undergo or decline vaccination. RESULTS: Among 6641 respondents, 945 (14.2%) were previously eligible but were not vaccinated; of these, 536 (56.7%) intended to receive an influenza vaccination in 2020-2021, as did 466 (68.6%) of the newly eligible respondents. Intention to receive the influenza vaccine was associated with increased age, index of multiple deprivation quintile, and considering oneself to be at high risk from COVID-19. Among those who were eligible but not intending to be vaccinated in 2020-2021, 164/543 (30.2%) gave reasons based on misinformation. Of the previously unvaccinated health care workers, 47/96 (49%) stated they would decline vaccination in 2020-2021. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, COVID-19 has increased acceptance of influenza vaccination in previously eligible but unvaccinated people and has motivated substantial uptake in newly eligible people. This study is essential for informing resource planning and the need for effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions, which is also necessary for COVID-19 vaccination programs.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Uptake of Influenza Vaccine: UK-Wide Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report infection of 3 Malayan tigers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant at a zoologic park in Virginia, USA.

Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication.

While existing studies have examined how misinformation spreads, few studies have examined the role of psychological distance in people?s mental processing of a rumor and their propensity to accept self-transformed narratives of the message. Based on an open-ended survey data collected in the U.S. (N = 621) during an early phase of the pandemic, the current study examines how psychological distance relates to the transformation and acceptance of conspiratorial narratives in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two instances of misinformation are examined, both of which were widely heard at the time of data collection: the role of (a) Bill Gates and (b) government during the outbreak of the pandemic. This study uses topic modeling techniques to capture distinctive topical attributes that emerged from rumor narratives. In addition, statistical analyses estimate the psychological distance effects on the salience of topical attributes of a rumor story and an individual?s propensity to believe them. Findings reveal that psychological distance to the threats of COVID-19 influences how misinformation evolves through word-of-mouth, particularly in terms of who is responsible for the pandemic and why the world finds itself in the current situation. Psychological distance also explains why people accept the message to be true.

Studies using mosses allow both short-and long-term air quality monitoring. The increasing contamination of the environment (including air) is causing a search for new, cheap and effective methods of monitoring its condition. Once such method is the use of mosses in active biomonitoring. The aim of the study was to assess the atmospheric aerosol pollution with selected heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) from the smoke of fireworks used during New Years Eve in the years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021. In studies a biomonitoring moss-bag method with moss Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.) Mitt. genus Pleurozium was used. The research was conducted in the town Prszkw (5 km in south direction from Opole, opolskie voivodship, Poland). The moss was exposed 14 days before 31 December (from 17 to 30 of December), on New Years Eve (31 December and 1 January) and 2 weeks after the New Year (from 2C15 January). Higher concentrations of analysed elements were determined in samples exposed during New Years Eve. Increases in concentrations were demonstrated by analysis of the Relative Accumulation Factor (RAF). The results indicate that the use of fireworks during New Years Eve causes an increase in air pollution with heavy metals. In addition, it was shown that the COVID-19 induced restrictions during New Years Eve 2020 resulted in a reduction of heavy metal content in moss samples and thus in lower atmospheric aerosol pollution with these analytes. The study confirmed moss usefulness in monitoring of atmospheric aerosol pollution from point sources. ? 2021 by the authors.

Since these tasks often conflate cognitive control and cognitive effort, it remains unknown if FMT amplitude maps onto cognitive control or effort. To address this gap, we utilized the glucose facilitation effect to manipulate cognitive effort without changing cognitive control demands. We performed a single-blind, cross-over human study in which we provided participants with a glucose drink (control session: volume-matched water) to reduce cognitive effort and improve performance on a visuospatial working memory task. Following glucose consumption, participants performed the working memory task at multiple timepoints of a three-hour window to sample across the rise and fall of blood glucose. Using high-density electroencephalography (EEG), we calculated FMT amplitude during the delay period of a working memory task. Source localization analysis revealed that FMT oscillations originated from bilateral prefrontal cortex. We found that glucose increased working memory accuracy during the high working memory load condition, but decreased FMT amplitude. The decrease in FMT amplitude coincided with both peak blood glucose elevation and peak performance enhancement for glucose relative to water. Therefore, the inverse association between glucose and task performance provided causal evidence that the amplitude of FMT oscillations may correspond to cognitive effort, rather than cognitive control. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection was terminated prematurely; the preliminary nature of these findings due to small sample size should be contextualized by rigorous experimental design and use of a novel causal perturbation to dissociate cognitive effort and cognitive control.","output":"Causal role of frontal-midline theta in cognitive effort: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms.

In this study, 260 adults: 126 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 sorted into severity groups: severe (n=68) and mild or moderate (n=58), and 134 healthy controls were enrolled. We quantified 39 plasma cytokines and chemokines using multiplex ELISA. Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney U test were used to identify mechanistically coupled cytokines/chemokines and compare disease severity. Compared to healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of interleukins 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), IFN--inducible protein-10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1), eotaxin-3, interferon-gamma (IFN-?), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1). Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher IL-10 and lower macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) compared to the mild or moderate group (P<0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic curve, SAA, IL-6 and CRP showed strong sensitivity and specificity predicting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.

Hospital admissions lag infection by 10 C 17 days, and test positivity rate is sensitive to changing availability of, access to, and demand for diagnostic testing. The U.S. city of Chicago investigated whether sentinel surveillance of recently symptomatic individuals receiving an outpatient diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 could provide early warning of increasing transmission. Methods & Materials From May 2020 to June 2021, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) established community-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing sites throughout Chicago. From November 2020, these sites collected and reported patient data on symptom status and symptom onset date to CDPH and IDPH. Symptomatic individuals residing in Chicago who reported symptom onset within four days of diagnostic test were included in the sentinel population. COVID-19 case counts among the sentinel population were used to calculate the instantaneous reproductive number R(t) over time, which was compared to R(t) curves calculated from COVID-like illness (CLI) hospital admissions, CLI emergency department visits, and COVID-19-diagnosed emergency department visits. Pearson correlation between time-shifted sentinel case counts and each of these indicators was used to estimate the potential lead time provided by outpatient sentinel surveillance. Results From November 1, 2020, to June 13, 2021, IDPH and CDPH collected a total of 15,023 sentinel samples at community-based testing sites, an average of 470 samples per week. Trends in sentinel COVID-19 cases preceded CLI hospital admissions by 10 to 14 days. R(t) calculated from sentinel cases tracked well with R(t) calculated from CLI hospital admissions, CLI emergency department visits, and COVID-19-diagnosed emergency department visits. Adjusting case counts to account for changing testing volume over time improved correlation with other indicators. Conclusion Outpatient sentinel surveillance of recently symptomatic individuals accurately captures trends in SARS-CoV-2 community transmission and provides early warning of increases in transmission rate. The reliability of outpatient sentinel surveillance can be limited by low testing volume, slow test turnaround time, and delays in reporting.","output":"Tracking Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission

patients with comorbidities. It is also associated with atypical presentation of the disease. Despite the possible contribution of malnutrition to the acquisition and severity of COVID-19, it is not clear which nutritional screening measures may best diagnose malnutrition in these patients at early stages. This is of crucial importance given the urgency and rapid progression of the disease in vulnerable groups. Accordingly, this review examines the available literature for different nutritional screening approaches implemented among COVID-19 patients, with a special focus on elderly adults. After a literature search, we selected and scrutinized 14 studies assessing malnutrition among COVID-19 patients. The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) has demonstrated superior sensitivity to other traditional screening measures. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which comprises serum albumin level, cholesterol level, and lymphocytes count, as well as a combined CONUT-lactate dehydrogenase-C-reactive protein score expressed a predictive capacity even superior to that of NRS-2002 (0.81% and 0.92% vs. 0.79%) in midlife and elder COVID-19 patients. Therefore, simple measures based on routinely conducted laboratory investigations such as the CONUT score may be timely, cheap, and valuable alternatives for identifying COVID-19 patients with high nutritional risk. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was the only measure used to detect residual malnutrition and high malnutrition risk in remitting patients-MNA scores correlated with hypoalbuminemia, hypercytokinemia, and weight loss. Older males with severe inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, or hypertension) are more prone to malnutrition and subsequently poor COVID-19 prognosis both during the acute phase and during convalescence. Thus, they are in need of frequent nutritional monitoring and support while detecting and treating malnutrition in the general public might be necessary to increase resilience against COVID-19.","output":"Approaches to Nutritional Screening in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the lockdown of the densely-populated metropolis caused panic and disorderly behavior among its population Community governance systems (CGSs) were mobilized to lead community engagement to address the challenges and issues brought about by the sudden quarantine measures, still unprecedented in any part of the world during that time This commentary aims to describe and analyze the roles of the CGSs, its implementation of culturally-tailored strategies and the performance of new functions as called for by the outbreak We will introduce the community governance structure which has two parallel administrative units of government including the branches of the Communist Party of China (CPC) The pandemic showed that the roles of the CGSs evolved and may continue to be improved in the future It is important to engage the community and to have community-based approaches in addressing issues brought about by lockdowns This community experience in Wuhan provides important lessons for the rest of the world","output":"Engaging the communities in Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is wreaking havoc around the world, bring out that the enormous pressure on national health and medical staff systems One of the most effective and critical steps in the fight against COVID-19, is to examine the patients lungs based on the Chest X-ray and CT generated by radiation imaging In this paper, five keras-related deep learning models: ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, transfer learning and pre-trained VGGNet16 is applied to formulate an classificationCdetection approaches of COVID-19 Two benchmark methods SVM (Support Vector Machine), CNN (Conventional Neural Networks) are provided to compare with the classificationCdetection approaches based on the performance indicators, i e , precision, recall, F1 scores, confusion matrix, classification accuracy and three types of AUC (Area Under Curve) The highest classification accuracy derived by classificationCdetection based on 5857 Chest X-rays and 767 Chest CTs are respectively 84% and 75%, which shows that the keras-related deep learning approaches facilitate accurate and effective COVID-19-assisted detection ? 2020 Tech Science Press All rights reserved","output":"A classificationCdetection approach of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray and CT by using keras pre-trained deep learning models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Portable chest radiography through glass (TG-CXR) is a novel technique, particularly useful during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. The purpose of this study was to understand the cost and benefit of adopting TG-CXR in quantifiable terms. METHODS: Portable or bedside radiographs are typically performed by a team of two technologists. The TG-CXR method has the benefit of allowing one technologist to stay outside of the patient room while operating the portable radiography machine, reducing PPE use, decreasing the frequency of radiography machine sanitization and decreasing technologists exposures to potentially infectious patients. The cost of implementing this technique during the current COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from our department's operational database. The direct cost of routinely used PPE and sanitization materials and the cost of the time taken by the technologists to clean the machine was used to form a quantitative picture of the benefit associated with TG-CXR technique. RESULTS: Technologists were trained on the TG-CXR method during a 15 min shift change briefing. This translated to a one-time cost of $424.88 USD. There was an average reduction of portable radiography machine downtime of 4 min and 48 s per study. The benefit of adopting the TG-CXR technique was $9.87 USD per patient imaged. This will result in a projected net cost savings of $51,451.84 USD per annum. CONCLUSION: Adoption of the TG-CXR technique during the COVID-19 pandemic involved minimal one-time cost, but is projected to result in a net-benefit of over $51,000 USD per annum in our emergency department.","output":"Cost benefit analysis of portable chest radiography through glass: Initial experience at a tertiary care centre during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may be required to treat critically ill patients with COVID-19-associated severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We report the case of a 43-year-old peripartum patient, who underwent two sequential V-V ECMO runs. The first extracorporeal support was established for COVID-19 ARDS, as characterized by severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia (arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction ratio 85 mmHg and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide 95 mmHg) and reduction of respiratory system static compliance to 25 mL/cmH(2)O, unresponsive to mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. After 22 days of lung rest, V-V ECMO was successfully removed and ventilator weaning initiated. A second V-V ECMO was required 7 days later, because of newly onset ARDS due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia. The second V-V ECMO run lasted 12 days. During both V-V ECMO runs, anticoagulation and ventilator settings were titrated through bedside thromboelastometry and electrical impedance tomography, respectively, without major complications. The patient was successfully decannulated, weaned from mechanical ventilation, and finally discharged home without oxygen therapy. At one-month follow-up, she showed good general conditions and no sign of respiratory failure.","output":"Two Consecutive Runs of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in a Peripartum Patient with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compare the psychological impact of the lockdown measures contrasting the COVID-19 outbreak between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and general population. Patients and Methods: From July 15th to August 15th 2020, a retrospective survey referring to the period March 9th to May 18th 2020 was administered to SLE patients and the results of the survey, called LEPRE (Lupus Erythematosus PREsto) study, were compared with those from the PRESTO (imPact of quaRantine mEasures againST cOvid19) project, the same survey provided to the general population. Consecutive patients &gt; 18 years old affected by SLE and regularly followed in a single rheumatologic centre were involved. Primary outcome was to compare the scores of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12) and the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D) between patients and general population. Results: A total of 64 patients completed the survey. After a propensity score matching, they were compared to 128 people from PRESTO project. The median age among patients was 43 years (ICIII interquartile range 35C 54.5), 88% were female and 100% Caucasian.

Contrary to our expectation, we show here that the histones released by NETosis enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, as found by using live SARS-CoV-2 and two pseudovirus systems as well as a mouse model. The histone H3 or H4 selectively binds to subunit 2 of the spike (S) protein, as shown by a biochemical binding assay, surface plasmon resonance and binding energy calculation as well as the construction of a mutant S protein by replacing four acidic amino acids. Sialic acid on the host cell surface is the key molecule to which histones bridge subunit 2 of the S protein. Moreover, histones enhance cellCcell fusion. Finally, treatment with an inhibitor of NETosis, histone H3 or H4, or sialic acid notably affected the levels of sgRNA copies and the number of apoptotic cells in a mouse model. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could hijack histones from neutrophil NETosis to promote its host cell attachment and entry process and may be important in exploring pathogenesis and possible strategies to develop new effective therapies for COVID-19.","output":"Histones released by NETosis enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by bridging the spike protein subunit 2 and sialic acid on host cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical symptoms, including affection of sense of smell and taste, among participants in a party held in Copenhagen after which many participants reported symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) METHODS: A 37-item questionnaire was sent electronically to all 95 participants seven weeks after the party The questionnaire included questions about the type, timing and duration of COVID-19 symptoms RESULTS: In total, 65 of 95 (68%) participants responded, among whom 51/65 (78%) had symptoms compatible with COVID-19;53% (27/51) had affection of their sense of smell and taste;70% (19/27) reported a total loss of taste These symptoms continued for 1-3 weeks for 78% and 3-6 weeks for 22% (6/27) Interestingly, 11/27 (41%) reported that they had not fully regained their sense of taste and 3/27(11%) were still very affected by this symptom Moreover, 44% of the respondents who had lost their sense of taste perceived this symptom as moderate to severe Eighty-one percent (22/27) reported a total loss of smell This symptom continued for 1-3 and &gt; 3 weeks in 74% and 26%, respectively At the time of the investigation, 48% had not fully regained their sense of smell and 7% were still very affected More than half of the respondents who lost their sense of smell perceived this symptom as moderate to severe CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with clinically diagnosed COVID-19 report an affected sense of smell and taste The duration of these symptoms currently remains unknown FUNDING: none TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant","output":"Acute loss of smell and taste among patients with symptoms compatible with covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RHD Endgame Strategy: the blueprint to eliminate rheumatic heart disease in Australia by 2031 (the Endgame Strategy) is the blueprint to eliminate rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in Australia by 2031. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live with one of the highest per capita burdens of RHD in the world. The Endgame Strategy synthesises information compiled across the 5-year lifespan of the End Rheumatic Heart Disease Centre of Research Excellence (END RHD CRE). Data and results from priority research projects across several disciplines of research complemented literature reviews, systematic reviews and narrative reviews. Further, the experiences of those working in acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and RHD control and those living with RHD to provide the technical evidence for eliminating RHD in Australia were included. The lived experience of RHD is a critical factor in health outcomes. All future strategies to address ARF and RHD must prioritise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's knowledge, perspectives and experiences and develop co-designed approaches to RHD elimination. The environmental, economic, social and political context of RHD in Australia is inexorably linked to ending the disease. Statistical modelling undertaken in 2019 looked at the economic and health impacts of implementing an indicative strategy to eliminate RHD by 2031. Beginning in 2019, the strategy would include: reducing household crowding, improving hygiene infrastructure, strengthening primary health care and improving secondary prophylaxis. It was estimated that the strategy would prevent 663 deaths and save the health care system $188 million. The Endgame Strategy provides the evidence for a new approach to RHD elimination. It proposes an implementation framework of five priority action areas. These focus on strategies to prevent new cases of ARF and RHD early in the causal pathway from Streptococcus pyogenes exposure to ARF, and strategies that address the critical systems and structural changes needed to support a comprehensive RHD elimination strategy.","output":"Ending rheumatic heart disease in Australia: the evidence for a new approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is a widespread temperature-dependent disease in salmonids caused by the myxozoan parasite, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Canning, Curry, Feist, Longshaw et Okamura, 1999) (Tb). Tb has a two-host life cycle, involving fish as an intermediate host and freshwater bryozoans as the definitive host. Although salmonids are acknowledged as hosts for the parasite, it is less clear which fish species are active hosts in the life cycle of Tb. Differences in infection dynamics have been observed between some fish species, which are thought to be related to the existence of two main Tb-strains, the American and European. Iceland, having three species of indigenous salmonids and positioned geographically between Europe and North America, is an ideal location to study the natural development of Tb in wild fish. The main aim of this study was to determine the genetic origin of Tb in Iceland and confirm whether mature spores are produced in Icelandic salmonids. In this study, Icelandic salmonids were infected with the European Tb-strain. In situ hybridisation revealed that intraluminal sporogonic stages, including mature spores, were commonly observed in all three salmonid species. The presence of intraluminal stages has previously been confirmed in brown trout Salmo trutta Linnaeus and Atlantic salmon S. salar Linnaeus in Europe, but they have only been observed in Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus) in North America, infected by the local strain. This is, therefore, the first time that sporogonic stages have been observed in Arctic charr in Europe, where fish are infected with the European Tb-strain. Our data strongly suggest that all the three salmonid species inhabiting Icelandic waters serve as active hosts in the life cycle of Tb. However, for full confirmation, transmission trials are needed.","output":"The presence of sporogonic stages of Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae in Icelandic salmonids detected using in situ hybridisation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Qingwu Jiang and colleagues discuss Chinas experience of contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine of infected people and their contacts, and mass nucleic acid testing in the second phase of the covid-19 epidemic","output":"Use of contact tracing, isolation, and mass testing to control transmission of covid-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cerebral autoregulation plays an important role in safeguarding adequate cerebral perfusion and reducing the risk of secondary brain injury, which is highly important for patients in the neurological intensive care unit (neuro-ICU). Although the consensus white paper suggests that a minimum of 5 min of data are needed for assessing dynamic cerebral autoregulation with transfer function analysis (TFA), it remains unknown if the length of these data is valid for patients in the neuro-ICU, of whom are notably different than the general populations. We aimed to investigate the effect of data length using transcranial Doppler ultrasound combined with invasive blood pressure measurement for the assessment of dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients in the neuro-ICU. METHODS: Twenty patients with various clinical conditions (severe acute encephalitis, ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain injury, cerebrovascular intervention operation, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial space-occupying lesion, and toxic encephalopathy) were recruited for this study. Continuous invasive blood pressure, with a pressure catheter placed at the radial artery, and bilateral continuous cerebral blood flow velocity with transcranial Doppler ultrasound were simultaneously recorded for a length of 10 min for each patient. TFA was applied to derive phase shift, gain, and coherence function at all frequency bands from the first 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 min of the 10-min recordings in each patient on both hemispheres. The variability in the autoregulatory parameters in each hemisphere was investigated by repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Forty-one recordings (82 hemispheres) were included in the study. According to the critical values of coherence provided by the Cerebral Autoregulation Research Network white paper, acceptable rates for the data were 100% with a length  7 min. The final analysis included 68 hemispheres. The effects of data length on trends in phase shift in the very low frequency (VLF) band (F(1.801,120.669) = 6.321, P = 0.003), in the LF band (F(1.274,85.343) = 4.290, P = 0.032), and in the HF band (F(1.391,93.189) = 3.868, P = 0.039) were significant for 3C7 min, for 4C7 min, and for 5C8 min, respectively. Effects were also significant on the gain in the VLF band (F(1.927,129.134) = 3.215, P = 0.045) for 2C8 min and on the coherence function in all frequency bands (VLF F(2.846,190.671) = 90.247, P < 0.001, LF F(2.515,168.492) = 55.770, P < 0.001, HF F(2.411, 161.542) = 33.833, P < 0.001) for 2C10 min.

However, it has been shown recently that the deep learning networks can be exploited by adversarial attacks that not only make IoMT vulnerable to the data theft but also to the manipulation of medical diagnosis. The existing studies consider adding noise to the raw IoMT data or model parameters which not only reduces the overall performance concerning medical inferences but also is ineffective to the likes of deep leakage from gradients method. In this work, we propose proximal gradient split learning (PSGL) method for defense against the model inversion attacks. The proposed method intentionally attacks the IoMT data when undergoing the deep neural network training process at client side.

Larval Drosophila is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels, often simultaneously, but existing behavioral assays for larval learning and memory do not address individual animals, and it has been difficult to form long lasting memories, especially those requiring synaptic re-organization. We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae. We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas Carbon Dioxide (CO2). We confirm that when coupled to odor presentation in appropriate temporal sequence, optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO2. We find that learning is switch-like: all-or-none and quantized in two states.

Using feature vectors (f-vectors) extracted from the incoming faces, OGMC generates clusters that may be connected to others depending on their proximity and their robustness. Every time a cluster is updated with a new sample, its connections are also updated. With this approach, we reduce the dependency of the clustering process on the order and the size of the incoming data and we are able to deal with complex data distributions.

In March 2020, as the COVID-19 surge began, an interdisciplinary group of administrators, providers, and trainees at Brigham and Women's Hospital created an inpatient virtual staffing model called the Virtual Team Rounding Program (VTRP). APPROACH: The conceptual framework guiding VTRP development was rapid-cycle innovation. The VTRP was designed iteratively using feedback from residents, physician assistants, attendings, and administrators from March to June 2020. The VTRP trained and deployed a diverse set of providers across specialties as \\"virtual rounders\\" to support inpatient teams by joining and participating in rounds via videoconference and completing documentation tasks during and after rounds. The program was rapidly scaled up from March to June 2020. OUTCOMES: In a survey of inpatient providers at the end of the pilot phase, 10/10 (100%) respondents reported they were getting either \\"a lot\\" or \\"a little\\" benefit from the VTRP and did not find the addition of the virtual rounder burdensome. During the scaling phase, the program grew to support 24 teams. In a survey at the end of the contraction phase, 117/187 (62.6%) inpatient providers who worked with a virtual rounder felt the rounder saved them time. VTRP leadership collaboratively and iteratively developed best practices for challenges encountered during implementation. NEXT STEPS: Virtual rounding provides a valuable extension of inpatient teams to manage COVID-19 surges. Future work will quantitatively and qualitatively assess the impact of the VTRP on inpatient provider satisfaction and well-being, virtual rounders' experiences, and patient care outcomes.","output":"Virtual Team Rounding: A Cross-Specialty Inpatient Care Staffing Program to Manage COVID-19 Surges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Once Covid-19 vaccines become available, 5-10 billion vaccine doses should be globally distributed, stored and administered. In this commentary, we discuss how this enormous challenge could be addressed for viral vector-based Covid-19 vaccines by learning from the wealth of formulation development experience gained over the years on stability issues related to live attenuated virus vaccines and viral vector vaccines for other diseases. This experience has led -over time- to major improvements on storage temperature, shelf-life and in-use stability requirements. First, we will cover work on 'classical' live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8 C with a shelf life of years has become the norm. In the case of pandemics with incredibly high and urgent product demands, however, the desire for rapid and convenient distribution chains combined with short end-user storage times require that liquid formulations with shelf lives of months stored at 2-8 C be considered.

Here we report that BHK-21/WI-2 cells were significantly less susceptible to primary infection by the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) than were BHK-21/C-13 cells. The electroporation efficiency of alphavirus RNA into BHK-21/WI-2 was also lower than that of BHK-21/C-13.

This study was conducted to analyse the outcomes of TDC insertion by nephrologists from a single centre in SEA. METHODS All patients who underwent TDC insertion by nephrologists from October 2013 to June 2016 were included. TDC survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival method. Impact of variables was assessed using Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS A total of 344 TDCs were inserted in 274 patients. The most common indication was haemodialysis initiation (60.2%) followed by existing catheter dysfunction (CD) (12.2%), failed vascular access (10.2%) and catheter-related bacteraemia (CRB) (9.9%). Insertion was successful in 97% patients. The most common location was the right internal jugular vein (87%). The cumulative survival for all TDCs inserted, as defined by the time to non-elective removal of a TDC, at 3, 6 and 9 months was 83%, 61%, and 44%, respectively. Median catheter survival was 231 days. Common indications for removal were CD (13.4%) and CRB or suspected infection (12.5%). Common complications were bleeding (8.72%), infection (13.7%) and CD (16.5%). Median time to infection was 103 days. In multivariate analysis, male gender was associated with poor catheter survival, for primary insertions (p = 0.015, HR 0.62) and diabetes was associated with TDC infection (p = 0.024, OR 1.1).

It introduces significant challenges to ensure accurate and timely measurements, maintain strong patient engagement, and operationalise data for clinical decision-making. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) devices like the pulse oximeter help mitigate these difficulties, however, practical approaches to successfully integrate this technology into existing patient-clinician interactions that ensure the delivery of safe and effective care are vital. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesise existing literature to provide an overview of the variety of user perceptions associated with pulse oximeter devices, which may impact patients' and clinicians' acceptance of the devices in a RPM context. METHODS A search over three databases was conducted between April 2021 - June 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A total of 16 articles were included in this scoping review. RESULTS Results indicate there has been an increase in use of pulse oximeters across hospital and community settings for continuous vital signs monitoring and remote monitoring of patients over time. Research in this area is shifting towards increasing accessibility of care through the development and implementation of telehealth systems and phone oximeters. Aspects of pulse oximeter UX most frequently investigated are usability and acceptability, however, these terms are often undefined, or definitions vary across studies. Perceived effectiveness, opportunity costs, and attitude towards use remain unexplored areas of UX. Overall, patients and clinicians view the pulse oximeter positively and find it user-friendly. A high level of learnability was found for the device and additional benefits included increasing patient self-efficacy and clinician motivation to work. However, issues getting an accurate reading due to device usability are still experienced by some patients and clinicians. CONCLUSION This scoping review is the first to summarise user perceptions of the pulse oximeter in a healthcare context. It showed that both patients and clinicians hold positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter and important factors to consider in designing user-focused services include ease-of-use and wearability of devices; context of use including user's prior health and IT knowledge; attitude towards use and perceived effectiveness; impact on user motivation and self-efficacy; and finally, potential user costs like inconvenience or increased anxiety.

However, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum or C. striatum is known to be a pathogen in lower respiratory tract infections. We report three cases of VAC, probably due to C. pseudodiphtheriticum, in patients with COVID-19. If purulent lower respiratory tract specimens showed coryneform predominantly upon Gram staining, empirical therapy should be started. Furthermore, species identification and drug susceptibility testing should be performed.","output":"Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum as a Pathogen in Bacterial Co-Infection in COVID-19 Patients on Mechanical Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Optic capture of sutured scleral fixated posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PC IOLs) is an occasional complication resulting in blurred vision and discomfort. Methods A retrospective study of the management of 18 eyes (3.6%) with optic capture out of 495 eyes with scleral fixated IOLs during the study period. 54 procedures were performed in the management of optic capture of sutured scleral fixated PC IOLs. An in-office technique was utilized to relieve the optic capture by repositioning the optic posterior to the iris. This technique was performed after topical anesthesia and topical 5% betadine with the patient stably positioned at the slit lamp. Using a 30-gauge needle, sometimes after a 15-degree paracentesis blade, the needle was advanced in a parallel plane above the iris until the tip reached the edge of the captured optic. The optic is engaged in the inferior periphery away from the central visual axis, and pushed gently posteriorly just enough to reposition the optic posterior to the iris. In some cases, pilocarpine 2% drops were utilized after the procedure to decrease the risk of recapture of the optic. Results All 54 procedures were successfully performed in the office without significant pain or discomfort. Vision before optic capture, during optic capture, and at the first office visit after optic capture were comparable. There were not any cases of endophthalmitis, hyphema, iris trauma, iris prolapse or keratitis. While eight patients only had one episode of optic capture, 10 patients had multiple episodes of optic capture, all managed with this in office procedure. Recurrent optic capture occurred more frequently in eyes with fixation at less than 2 mm from the limbus than eyes with scleral fixation at 2 mm from the limbus. Conclusion Reposition of the optic after pupillary capture of a scleral fixated PC IOL can be successfully performed in the office without discomfort or significant complications and is an alternative management option to a return to the operating room. This procedure may be especially important when there is poor access to the operating room or restricted access to the operating room as during the COVID19 pandemic.","output":"In office management of optic capture of scleral fixated posterior chamber intraocular lenses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) family, including DAAM1 and DAAM2, is key regulators in Wnt signaling pathway. Although the oncogenic role of Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) was investigated in several lines, the expression and function of DAAM in CRC are still obscure. OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression and function of DAAM in CRC. METHODS DAAM1 and DAAM2 expression in high grade dysplasia (HGD), CRCs and corresponding adjacent tissues were detected with qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The prognostic significance of DAAM1/2 were estimated with univariate and multivariate analyses. Moreover, the correlations between clinicopathological factors and DAAM were evaluated with the 2 test. With experiments in vitro, we investigated the function of DAAM2 in CRC cell proliferation and invasion, and investigated the underlying mechanism of how DAAM2 facilitated CRC invasion. RESULTS DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, was substantially up-regulated in CRCs compared with paired adjacent normal tissues and HGDs. The ratio of high DAAM1 and DAAM2 expression accounted for 44.83% and 46.31%, respectively. High DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, was a risk factor indicating an unfavorable prognosis of CRC. In multivariate analysis, high DAAM2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of CRC predicting poor prognosis. With experiments in vitro, DAAM2 promoted invasion of CRC cells via activating PAK1 and promoting the expression of MMP7, suggesting an essential role of DAAM2 in CRC invasion. CONCLUSIONS High expression of DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, indicated an unfavorable prognosis of CRC independently, which suggested that detecting DAAM2 can help define the high-risk patients. DAAM2 activated PAK1 and promoted MMP7 expression and facilitated the invasion of CRC cells, indicating that DAAM2 may be a potential drug target of CRC.","output":"Disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 2 promotes invasion of colorectal cancer by activating PAK1 and promoting MMP7 expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces new methods to track the offset between two multivariate time series on a continuous basis.

Faced with this situation, the objective of the work was to promote good prevention practices against COVID-19 in the general population to avoid the collapse of the public health system. METHODS An exploratory review on prevention measures against COVID-19 was carried out in the databases Elsevier, Pubmed, Wiley, Scopus, Scielo and, in general, in academic Google, to obtain gray information. RESULTS The role of seven individual protection and prevention measures and barriers to stop the advance of community infections by COVID-19 were described and analyzed. Studies showed that the use of preventive measures can play a critical role in containing the pandemic. However, they can also provide a false security of protection, predisposing to neglect the correct use and handling of all containment measures.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this observational longitudinal study was to identify nonoverlapping severity subgroups (ie, clusters) among patients with COVID-19, based exclusively on clinical data and standard laboratory tests obtained during patient assessment in the emergency department. METHODS: We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols. RESULTS: From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests-the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils-were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3.

For service learning classes, generally defined as students learning as they provide service to a community partner, these large scale disruptions create special challenges even when it is possible to move classes online. The COVID-19 pandemic seriously affected the active involvement of community partners, including non-profit organizations, local schools and hospitals, and local governments. Many community organizations struggled to meet increased demand for their assistance while simultaneously cutting personnel due to budget shortfalls. In this paper, we report results from 34 survey respondents who offered service learning classes in undergraduate computer and information science during spring 2020. Despite the turmoil, only three faculty respondents lost their community partner entirely. In response to disruption, nearly half of faculty removed some of the assignments' requirements, while others made the service project optional or removed it completely. Going online negatively affected students' ability to collaborate with each other and interact with community partners, activities that are considered important for reaching learning outcomes for service learning. Nevertheless, about two-thirds of faculty reported that their students completed their service assignments and described conditions that led to or detracted from their success. Based on the findings, the authors present several implications for development of future computer and information science service learning offerings that are resilient during times of crisis. ? 2021 Owner/Author.","output":"Service Interruption: Managing Commitment to Community Partners during a Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sleep behaviour is controlled by both circadian and homeostatic influences. Changes in both factors are related to the delayed sleep timing observed in adolescence, which also generates restrictions in their sleep duration. In addition, the circadian factor explains part of the observed influence of light on sleep duration. We recorded 15 high-school students for 23 days (vacation: 11 days; school term: 12 days) using GENEactive accelerometers. We employed a repeated-measures analysis to explore the day-to-day bidirectional association between mean light exposure and sleep behaviour across a period with extreme variability in social pressures. Sleep onset was more than 30 min earlier and sleep duration almost 20 min longer when previous day light was 10 times more intense. Light intensity had a reduction of more than 20% as sleep ended 1 hr later. Besides, sleep onset and offset were both later during vacation than on school days (almost 2 hr and 4 hr, respectively) and free days (almost 1 hr, respectively). Therefore, sleep duration was almost 2 hr longer on vacation and free days than on school days. On the other hand, light exposure intensity was twice as high during vacation days when adjusted by sleep timing. Insufficient sleep duration is a major problem for adolescents.

AIMS: Our aim was to evaluate whether VFCs reduce the volume of X-rays performed for common fractures of the wrist and ankle. METHODS: A retrospective cohort review was performed. The pre-VFC group consisted of 168 wrist and 108 ankle referrals from March to September 2019. The VFC group included 75 wrist and 68 ankle referrals, during the period March to September 2020. The total number of X-ray images, carried out within a 3-month period for each fracture was summated, with statistical analysis performed following fracture pattern classification. FINDINGS: A statistically significant decrease in mean X-rays was observed for isolated stable fracture patterns, such as non-displaced distal radius, ? 0.976 (p = 0.00025), and Weber A ankle fractures, ? 0.907 (p = 0.000013).

Key elements of ACP are to enable persons to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these with family and health care professionals, and to document and review these if appropriate. ACP is usually conducted through personal conversations between a health care professional, a patient, and-if appropriate-family members. Although Web-based ACP programs have the potential to support patients in ACP, their effectiveness is unknown. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs. METHODS We systematically searched for quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs in seven databases including EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central and Google Scholar. Data on the characteristics of the ACP programs' content (using a predefined list of 10 key elements of ACP), feasibility, and effectiveness were extracted using a predesigned form. RESULTS Of 3434 titles and abstracts, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, evaluating 11 Web-based ACP programs-10 were developed in the United States and one in Ireland. Studied populations ranged from healthy adults to patients with serious conditions. Programs typically contained the exploration of goals and values (8 programs), exploration of preferences for treatment and care (11 programs), guidance for communication about these preferences with health care professionals or relatives (10 programs), and the possibility to generate a document in which preferences can be recorded (8 programs). Reportedly, participants were satisfied with the ACP programs (11/11 studies), considering them as easy to use (8/8 studies) and not burdensome (7/8 studies). Designs of 13 studies allowed evaluating the effectiveness of five programs. They showed that ACP programs significantly increased ACP knowledge (8/8 studies), improved communication between patients and their relatives or health care professionals (6/6 studies), increased ACP documentation (6/6 studies), and improved concordance between care as preferred by the patients and the decisions of clinicians and health care representatives (2/3 studies). CONCLUSIONS Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs were mainly developed and evaluated in the United States. They contained the key elements of ACP, such as discussing and documenting goals and preferences for future care. As participants considered programs as easy to use and not burdensome, they appeared to be feasible. Among the 13 studies that measured the effectiveness of programs, improvement in ACP knowledge, communication, and documentation was reported.

How do specialist surgeons make decisions about patient care in these unprecedent times? DESIGN: Between April and May 2020, we conducted an international qualitative study. Sarcoma surgeons from diverse global settings participated in 60 min interviews exploring surgical decision making during COVID-19. Interview data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. SETTING: Participants represented public and private hospitals in 14 countries, in different phases of the first wave of the pandemic: Australia, Argentina, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, UK and USA. PARTICIPANTS: From 22 invited sarcoma surgeons, 18 surgeons participated. Participants had an average of 19 years experience as a sarcoma surgeon. RESULTS: 17/18 participants described a decision they had made about patient care since the start of the pandemic that was unique to them, that is, without precedence. Common to unique decisions about patient care was uncertainty about what was going on and what would happen in the future (theme 1: the context of uncertainty), the impact of the pandemic on resources or threat of the pandemic to overwhelm resources (theme 2: limited resources), perceived increased risk to self (theme 3: duty of care) and least-worst decision making, in which none of the options were perceived as ideal and participants settled on the least-worst option at that point in time (theme 4: least-worst decision making). CONCLUSIONS: In the context of rapidly changing standards of justice and beneficence in patient care, traditional decision-making frameworks may no longer apply. Based on the experiences of surgeons in this study, we describe a framework of least-worst decision making.

However, evaluation of the preactivation of knee stabilizer muscles by surface electromyography (sEMG) showed to be a predictive value in the assessment of the risk of ACL injury. Therefore, this proof-of-concept study aimed at evaluating the role of visual input on the thigh muscle preactivation through sEMG to reduce ACL injury risk in tennis players. We recruited male, adult, semiprofessional tennis players from July to August 2020. They were asked to drop with the dominant lower limb from a step, to evaluatebased on dynamic valgus stressthe preactivation time of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis, biceps femoris, and medial hamstrings (MH), through sEMG. To highlight the influence of visual inputs, the athletes performed the test blindfolded and not blindfolded on both clay and grass surfaces. We included 20 semiprofessional male players, with a mean age 20.3  4.8 years; results showed significant early muscle activation when the subject lacked visual input, but also when faced with a less-safe surface such as clay over grass. Considering the posteromedialCanterolateral relationship (MH/RF ratio), tennis players showed a significant higher MH/RF ratio if blindfolded (22.0 vs. 17.0% not blindfolded; p < 0.01) and percentage of falling on clay (17.0% vs. 14.0% in grass; p < 0.01). This proof-of-principle study suggests that in case of absence of visual input or falling on a surface considered unsafe (clay), neuro-activation would tend to protect the anterior stress of the knee. Thus, the sEMG might play a crucial role in planning adequate athletic preparation for semiprofessional male athletes in terms of reduction of ACL injury risk.","output":"Electromyographic Assessment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Risk in Male Tennis Players: Which Role for Visual Input?

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone (O3) have reported antimicrobial properties but few studies have examined associations with community infectivity of COVID-19. Research suggests UV light can be preventative while the effect of O3 is contested. We sought to determine the relationship between UV, O3, and COVID-19 incidence in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: In our time series analyses, we calculated daily incidence rates and reproductive number (Rt) from 34,975 cases between January and June 2020 across 34 Ontario Public Health Units. We used generalised linear models, adjusting for potential confounders, to calculate point estimates (PE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for UV and O3. Analyses were further stratified by age groups and outbreaks at institutions versus community. RESULTS: We found that 1-week averaged UV was significantly associated with a 13% decrease (95% CI: 0.80-0.96) in overall COVID-19 Rt, per unit increase. A negative association with UV was also significant among community outbreaks (PE: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) but not institutional outbreaks (PE: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.85-1.03). A positive association of O3 with COVID-19 incidence is strongly suggested among institutional outbreak cases (PE: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13). CONCLUSION: Our study found evidence to support the hypothesis that higher UV reduced transmission of COVID-19 and some evidence that ground-level O3 positively influenced COVID-19 transmission.

Data elements including patient demographics, neuroimaging findings, acuity of neurological symptoms and/or imaging findings relative to COVID-19 onset (acute, subacute, chronic), and patient outcomes were recorded and summarized. RESULTS: After review of 775 unique articles, a total of 39 studies comprising 884 COVID-19 patients &#8805; 18 years of age with abnormal neuroimaging findings and reported outcomes were included in our analysis. Ischemic stroke was the most common neuroimaging finding reported (49.3%, 436/884) among patients with mortality outcomes data. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) had the highest all-cause mortality (49.7%, 71/143), followed by patients with imaging features consistent with leukoencephalopathy (38.5%, 5/13), and ischemic stroke (30%, 131/436).

The diagnosis of DIC was confirmed by an International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis score greater than or equal to 5. The maternal outcomes included the changes in organ function 24 h after ICU admission. The durations of hospital stay and ICU stay were recorded as secondary outcomes. Among 297 ICU admissions (median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 4) for obstetric diseases, there were 87 DIC cases, with an estimated DIC incidence of 87 per 87,580 deliveries. Postpartum hemorrhage was the leading disease associated with DIC (71, 81.6%), followed by hypertensive disorders (27, 31.0%), sepsis (15, 17.2%), acute fatty liver of pregnancy (11, 12.6%) and amniotic fluid embolism (10, 11.5%).

The complex stoichiometry was 1:1, with a formation constant of 5.82a?a?102a?La?mol-1 and molar absorptivity of 5.82a?a?103a?mola?L-1a?cm-1. Then, a spectrophotometric analytical method was developed and validated according to the Brazilian legislation. The linearity of the analytical curve was demonstrated by ANOVA, at a confidence level of 95%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.0659 and 0.200a?mga?L-1, respectively. The coefficients of variation for both the intra- and inter-day precisions were lower than 3.83%, and the accuracy presented a mean recovery of 100.55a?a?2.87%. The absence of a matrix effect was confirmed by the standard addition method, and the copper content in three artisanal cacha?as from different geographical origins was estimated as lower than 2.93a?mga?L-1. This result was in accordance with the Brazilian legislation but reinforces the need to carry out stricter quality control to achieve exportation standards. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered a simple, selective, linear, precise, and accurate tool that involves only a simple complexation reaction through the addition of the chemosensor solution in a buffered medium.

We also aimed to raise awareness about the possible problems may have been encountered by the HCPs during the pandemic. Methodology: This qualitative study was conducted through semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions. A phenomenological approach used to collect data. Purposive and snowball sampling methods were used to recruit participants. We interviewed twelve HCP s. Topics included their first experience with a COVID-19 case, changes in the work environment, working with personal protective equipment (PPE), changes in private life, and the challenges encountered. Data gathering and data analysis were carried out concurrently. We used the classical content analysis method for data analysis. Results: Four main categories emerged from the content analysis. The first was Responsibility. Healthcare professionals felt responsible towards both the patients and healthy people and some experiences made them feel helpless. They expressed a wide range of feelings about their professions. The second category was Fatigue. Participants explained that they experienced intense fear initially and were very overwhelmed. All participants thought that people were insensitive to follow measurements. The third category was Relief. Before the outbreak reached Turkey, medical staff could not predict what was coming. Over time they got used to this new situation, and normalize their lives. The fourth category was Experience. Participants told about what they learned during the pandemic and made some suggestions. Conclusion: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, some experiences can be demotivating and disappointing for healthcare professionals. Managers and supervisors should listen to their requests, and hearing positive feedback from authorities may increase their motivation. All kinds of psychosocial support should be provided for healthcare workers, and their mental well-being should be cared as well as their physical health. ? 2021 Faculty of Anaesthesia, Pain and Intensive Care, AFMS.

We assessed the antibody titers among patients who received REGN-COV with the purpose of evaluating this therapeutic and prophylactic option from the serological point of view. METHODS: We collected serological data of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with REGN-COV 1200 mg (casirivimab 600 mg/imdevimab 600 mg). Antibody titers were assessed within 24 h before and within 48 h after the administration of REGN-COV using ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)G (IgG(NC)), which is against nucleocapsid protein, and ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (IgG(SP)), which is against spike protein. RESULTS: A total of nine patients were evaluated. IgG(SP) was elevated after REGN-COV administration with a median of 208,370 Arbitrary Units/mL while simultaneous IgG(NC) remained low. With the simple linear regression model, the IgG(SP) after the REGN-COV administration was correlated with the reciprocal of ideal body weight.

The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 widely varies from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and systemic inflammatory disease. It is thought that host genetic variability may affect the host's response to the virus infection and thus cause severity of the disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus requires interaction with its receptor complex in the host cells before infection. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been identified as one of the key molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor binding and cell invasion. Therefore, in this study we investigated the correlation between a genetic variant within the human TMPRSS2 gene and COVID-19 severity and viral load.ResultsWe genotyped 95 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Dr Soetomo General Hospital and Indrapura Field Hospital (Surabaya, Indonesia) for the TMPRSS2 p.Val160Met polymorphism. Polymorphism was detected using a TaqMan assay. We then analysed the association between the presence of the genetic variant and disease severity and viral load. We did not observe any correlation between the presence of TMPRSS2 genetic variant with the severity of the disease. However, we identified significant association between the p.Val160Met polymorphism and the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, as estimated by the Ct value of the diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test. Furthermore, we observed a trend of association between the presence of the C allele and the mortality rate in patients with severe COVID-19.

They utilize concepts from behavioral economics to affect agents concurrent suboptimal choices: in principle, without applying coercion. However, most choice situations involve some coercive elements. This study features a functional analysis of rationality, nudging, and boosting applied to public policy. The relationship between behavior and environmental variables is termed a behavioral contingency, and the analysis can include social and cultural phenomena by applying a selectionist perspective. Principles of behavioral control, whether tight or loose, may be exerted by policymakers or regulators who subscribe to paternalistic principles and may be met with demands of libertarianism among their recipients. This warrants discussion of the legitimacy and likelihood of behavioral control and influence on choices. Cases and examples are provided for extending the unit of analysis of choice behavior to achieve outcomes regulated by policies at the individual and group levels, including health, climate, and education. Further research and intervention comprise the study of macrocontingencies and metacontingencies. Advancing the understanding and application of behavioral science to policymaking may, therefore, benefit from moving from the relatively independent contributions of behavioral economics and behavior analysis to an inclusive selectionist approach for addressing choice behavior and cultural practices.","output":"Tutorial.

Improving the major symptoms and quality of life (QoL) is as important as postponing the process of fibrosis. However, only pirfenidone and nintedanib conditionally recommended by guidelines and no definite proof indicate that they can significantly ameliorate the main symptoms and QoL of IPF sufferers. At present, multiple types of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) interventions alone or in combination with conventional western medicine managements are widespreadly applied in IPF treatment, which seemingly have a promising clinical effect, especially in ameliorating the main symptoms and improving QoL. Subsequently, the number of relevant studies in systematic reviews(SRs) and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials(RCTs) increased significantly. Hence, we plan to implement an overview to collect, evaluate, and summarize the results of these SRs. METHODS: An all-round literature retrieval will be conducted in 9 electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, CNKI, CBM, Wanfang, and VIP. We will focus on the systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs for multiple TCM interventions alone or in combination with routine western medicine measures in IPF treatment. The main outcomes we follow with interest include the improvement of major symptoms (cough, dyspnea) and QoL. Secondary outcomes will consist of minor symptoms improvement, clinical total effective rate, lung function, blood gas analysis, 6-minute walk text, adverse events, acute exacerbation, all-cause mortality, and IPF-related mortality. Two reviewers will independently select the SRs satisfactory with the enrolling criteria, extract key characteristics, and datas on predefined form, evaluate methodological quality by AMSTAR-2, ROBIS and PRISMA tools, and the quality of evidences adopting GRADE method. In case of any divergence will be reached an agreement by discussion or adjudicated by a third senior reviewer. We will perform a narrative synthesis of the proofs from SRs included. RESULTS: The findings of this overvew will be presented at relevant conferences and submitted for peer-review publication. CONCLUSIONS: We expect to obtain comprehensive and reliable evidence of IPF treated by diversified TCM interventions from the potential standard SRs, which may provide suggestions for future RCTs and SRs.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the HOME-CoV rule reliable for identifying a subgroup of COVID-19 patients with a low risk of adverse outcomes who can be treated at home safely? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We aimed to validate the HOME-CoV rule in a prospective, multicenter study before and after trial of patients with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who sought treatment at the ED of 34 hospitals. The main outcome was an adverse evolution, that is, invasive ventilation or death, occurring within the 7 days after patient admission. The performance of the rule was assessed by the false-negative rate. The impact of the rule implementation was assessed by the absolute differences in the rate of patients who required invasive ventilation or who died and in the rate of patients treated at home, between an observational and an interventional period after implementation of the HOME-CoV rule, with propensity score adjustment. RESULTS: Among 3,000 prospectively enrolled patients, 1,239 (41.3%) demonstrated a negative HOME-CoV rule finding. The false-negative rate of the HOME-CoV rule was 4 in 1,239 (0.32%; 95% CI, 0.13%-0.84%), and its area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 80.9 (95% CI, 76.5-85.2).

Unlike clinical signs, electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring allows to detect and quantify an overdose of hypnotics. Therefore, we tested whether the use of an electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring will cause less hypotension following induction with propofol. METHODS Subjects were randomly assigned to a bispectral index (BIS)-guided (target range 40-60) or to a weight-related (2 mg.kg- 1) manual administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypotension following the administration of propofol. Secondary endpoints included the degree of hypotension and correlations between BIS and drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Incidences were analyzed with Fisher's Exact-test. RESULTS Of the 240 patients enrolled into this study, 235 predominantly non-geriatric (median 48 years, 25th - 75th percentile 35-61 years) patients without severe concomitant disease (88% American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1-2) undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery, ophthalmic surgery, and dermatologic surgery were analyzed. Patients who were manually administered propofol guided by BIS (n = 120) compared to those who were given propofol by weight (n = 115) did not differ concerning the incidence of hypotension (44% vs. 45%; p = 0.87). Study groups were also similar regarding the maximal drop in MAP compared to baseline (33% vs. 30%) and the proportion of hypotensive events related to all measurements (17% vs. 19%). Final propofol induction doses in BIS group and NON-BIS group were similar (1.93 mg/kg vs. 2 mg/kg). There was no linear correlation between BIS and the drop in MAP at all times (r < 0.2 for all) except for a weak one at 6 min (r = 0.221). CONCLUSION Results of our study suggest that a BIS-guided compared to a weight-adjusted manual administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia in non-geriatric patients will not lower the incidence and degree of arterial hypotension.

METHODS: The CFR among the confirmed Covid-19 cases in Yemen was calculated. The data was retrieved from national Covid-19 surveillance between April 10, when the first COVID-19 case reported, and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 419 confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported. There were 14.1% and 5.7% of cases who required intensive care and mechanical ventilators, respectively. Out of the total cases, 95 deaths were reported, giving a CFR of 22.6% which is much higher compared to other countries. CFR was significantly higher among elderly people compared to young adults and varied between governorates. Mortality was associated with pre-existing hypertension (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.58, 3.54) and diabetes (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.61). CONCLUSIONS: The elderly and those with comorbidities, in particular hypertension and diabetes, have higher risk for poor outcomes and therefore should receive more attention in the clinical setting.

This study aimed to elucidate the cytokines and chemokines inhibited by different treatments (conventional synthetic DMARD [csDMARD], biological and targeted synthetic DMARD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Fifty-nine RA patients with low disease activity or remission included in a cross-sectional study were classified by treatment in groups: abatacept, certolizumab, rituximab (RTX), tocilizumab, tofacitinib (TOF), baricitinib (BAR), and csDMARD. Cytokine and chemokine serum levels were measured by LEGENDplex Human Inflammation panel. Quantitative variables were compared using Student t or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate, whereas qualitative variables were compared using (2) or Fisher exact test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Certolizumab, RTX, tocilizumab, and TOF showed that most cytokine pathways inhibited: tumor necrosis factor , interferon , interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-12, IL-18, and IL-23; in addition, csDMARDs showed a similar inhibition patron except for IL-23. Serum level of tumor necrosis factor  pathway was one of the most inhibited being undetectable in RTX, TOF, and BAR groups. Interleukin 6 was shown to be inhibited by abatacept, RTX, and TOF; however, higher levels were observed in 3 patients treated with tocilizumab. Abatacept, certolizumab, RTX, and TOF downregulated IL-10 in this group of patients but remained detectable in almost half of the subjects, with the highest levels in the BAR group. The active pathways that remained the most were CC chemokine ligand 2, IL-8, IL-17, and IL-33.

METHODS Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced electrically in anaesthetised healthy adult pigs and left untreated for seven minutes followed by randomisation to manual ventilation with 50% or 100% oxygen and mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS?). Defibrillation was performed at thirteen minutes and repeated if necessary every two minutes with 1mg intravenous adrenaline. Cerebral oxygenation was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (rSO2, INVOS?5100C Cerebral Oximeter) and with a probe (NEUROVENT-PTO, RAUMEDIC) in the frontal brain cortex (PbO2). Heart biopsies were obtained 20min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with an analysis of mitochondrial respiration (OROBOROS Instruments Corp., Innsbruck, Austria), and compared to four control animals without VF and CPR. Brain rSO2 and PbO2 were log transformed and analysed with a mixed linear model and mitochondrial respiration with an analysis of variance. RESULTS Of the twenty pigs, one had a breach of protocol and was excluded, leaving nine pigs in the 50% group and ten in the 100% group. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in six pigs in the 50% group and eight in the 100% group. The rSO2 (p=0.007) was lower with FiO2 50%, but the PbO2 was not (p=0.93). After ROSC there were significant interactions between time and FiO2 regarding both rSO2 (p=0.001) and PbO2 (p=0.004). Compared to the controls, mitochondrial respiration was decreased, with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels of 57 (17)pmols-1mg-1 compared to 92 (23)pmols-1mg-1 (p=0.008), but there was no difference between different oxygen fractions (p=0.79). CONCLUSIONS The use of 50% oxygen during CPR results in lower cerebral oximetry values compared to 100% oxygen but there is no difference in brain tissue oxygen. Cardiac arrest disturbs cardiac mitochondrial respiration, but it is not alleviated with the use of 50% compared to 100% oxygen (Ethical and hospital approvals ESAVI/1077/04.10.07/2016 and HUS/215/2016, 7 30.3.2016, Funding Helsinki University and others).","output":"The effect of 50% compared to 100% inspired oxygen fraction on brain oxygenation and post cardiac arrest mitochondrial function in experimental cardiac arrest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 10 percent of recovered and discharged patients retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, raising a public health concern whether they could be potential origins of infection.

ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to examine public perception and discussion of COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter in the US, as well as geographic and demographic characteristics of Twitter users who discussed about COVID-19 vaccines. MethodsThrough Twitter streaming Application Programming Interface (API), COVID-19-related tweets were collected from March 5th, 2020 to January 25th, 2021 using relevant keywords (such as \\"corona\\", \\"covid19\\", and \\"covid\\"). Based on geolocation information provided in tweets and vaccine-related keywords (such as \\"vaccine\\" and \\"vaccination\\"), we identified COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets from the US. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were performed to examine public perception and discussion of COVID-19 vaccines. Demographic inference using computer vision algorithm (DeepFace) was performed to infer the demographic characteristics (age, gender and race/ethnicity) of Twitter users who tweeted about COVID-19 vaccines. ResultsOur longitudinal analysis showed that the discussion of COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter in the US reached a peak at the end of 2020. Average sentiment score for COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets remained relatively stable during our study period except for two big peaks, the positive peak corresponds to the optimism about the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the negative peak corresponds to worrying about the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

The most common manifestations are mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, with a prevalence of 16-53% among patients. Cases with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seem to have higher rates of acute liver dysfunction, and the presence of abnormal liver tests at admission signifies a higher risk of severe disease during hospitalization. Patients with chronic liver diseases also have a higher risk of severe disease and mortality (mainly seen in patients with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease). Several pathways of damage have been proposed in the liver involvement of COVID-19 patients; although, the end-cause is most likely multifactorial. Abnormal liver tests have been attributed to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This enzyme is expressed widely in cholangiocytes and less in hepatocytes. Other factors attributed to liver damage include drug-induced liver injury, uncontrolled release of proinflammatory molecules (cytokine storm), pneumonia-associated hypoxia, and direct damage by the infection. Hepatic steatosis, vascular thrombosis, fibrosis, and inflammatory features (including Kupffer cell hyperplasia) are the most common liver histopathological findings in deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting important indirect mechanisms of liver damage.

A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. OBJECTIVE: To understand people's COVID-19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID-19 and attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions.

Herein, we describe HIV-associated morbidity among hospitalised HIV/AIDS patients with advanced immunosuppression and assess the comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and immunological markers associated with mortality. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at the Funda??o de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) in Manaus, Brazil. In all, 83 participants aged between 12 and 70 years were enrolled by convenience within 72 h of their hospitalisation. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records. We prospectively measured the cytokines Th1/Th2/Th17 and inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1, and IL-12 using cytometric bead array, and the soluble CD14 using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The HIV/AIDS inpatients presented a scenario of respiratory syndromes as the most prevalent comorbidity. Almost all patients had CD4 T counts below 350 cells/mL and the mortality rate was 20.5%. Pulmonary tuberculosis, neurotoxoplasmosis and oropharyngealCesophageal candidiasis were the most prevalent opportunistic infections. TB and weight loss were more prevalent in HIV/AIDS inpatients who died. The Mann Whitney analysis showed that those who died had higher platelet distribution width (PDW) on admission, which is suggestive for platelet activation. The Poisson multivariate analysis showed the prevalence of TB, digestive syndrome and increases in IL-8 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) associated to death. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced immunosuppression characterized by the opportunistic infections presented in these HIV/AIDS inpatients was the major factor of mortality. The role of platelet activation in worse outcomes of hospitalisation and the IL-8 associated with the context of advanced immunosuppression may be promising markers in the prediction of mortality in HIV/AIDS patients.","output":"Immunologic biomarkers, morbidity and mortality among HIV patients hospitalised in a Tertiary Care Hospital in the Brazilian Amazon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forced displacement of citizens has been on the rise since the 1990s but has significantly increased over the past decade.

The water contact angle (WCA) of the prepared PDA/Fe/HDS PET fabric was higher than 160 and the scrolling angle (SA) was lower than 2.09. The excellent adhesion property of polydopamine (PDA) on the substrate is helpful to improve the stability of superhydrophobic PDA/Fe/HDS PET fabric. The tests results showed that the modified PET fabric maintains excellent mechanical properties. Its superhydrophobic property had good stability and durability in the harsh environment of washing, mechanical friction, UV irradiation, seawater immersion, acid-base and organic reagents erosion. The PDA/Fe/HDS PET fabric also had good self-cleaning and oil-water separation properties. It still had good oil-water separation performance after repeated use for 25 times, and the separation efficiency was more than 95%. The preparation method was facile, the treatment time can be shortened, the cost of the modified substrate was low, and fluorine-free substances were used in the process.

In Yemen, a country that is entering its seventh year of a protracted war, the ongoing conflict severely limited the country's capacity to implement effective preparedness and response measures to outbreaks including COVID-19. There are growing concerns that the virus may be circulating within communities undetected and unmitigated especially as underreporting continues in some areas of the country due to a lack of testing facilities, delays in seeking treatment, stigma, difficulty accessing treatment centers, the perceived risks of seeking care or for political issues. The Yemen Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) was launched in 2011 to address the shortage of a skilled public health workforce, with the objective of strengthening capacity in field epidemiology. Thus, events of public health importance can be detected and investigated in a timely and effective manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Yemen FETP's response has been instrumental through participating in country-level coordination, planning, monitoring, and developing guidelines/standard operating procedures and strengthening surveillance capacities, outbreak investigations, contact tracing, case management, infection prevention, and control, risk communication, and research. As the third wave is circulating with a steeper upward curve than the previous ones with possible new variants, the country will not be able to deal with a surge of cases as secondary care is extremely crippled. Since COVID-19 prevention and control are the only option available to reduce its grave impact on morbidity and mortality, health partners should support the Yemen FETP to strengthen the health system's response to future epidemics. One important lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the Yemen context and applicable to developing and war-torn countries, is that access to outside experts becomes limited, therefore, it is crucial to invest in building national expertise to provide timely, cost-effective, and sustainable services that are culturally appropriate. It is also essential to build such expertise at the governorate and district levels, as they are normally the first respondents, and to provide them with the necessary tools for immediate response in order to overcome the disastrous delays.","output":"Field Epidemiology Training Program Response to COVID-19 During a Conflict: Experience From Yemen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are recurrent intestinal pathologies characterized by a compromised epithelial barrier and an exaggerated immune activation. Mediators of immune cell infiltration may represent new therapeutic opportunities. Metallothioneins (MTs) are stress-responsive proteins with immune-modulating functions. Metallothioneins have been linked to IBDs, but their role in intestinal inflammation is inconclusive. We investigated MT expression in colonic biopsies from IBDs and acute infectious colitis patients and healthy controls and evaluated MT's role in experimental colitis using MT knockout mice and anti-MT antibodies. Antibody potential to target extracellular MT and its mechanism was tested in vitro. Biopsies of patients with active colitis showed infiltration of MT-positive cells in a pattern that correlated with the grade of inflammation. MT knockout mice displayed less severe acute dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis compared to congenic wild-type mice based on survival, weight loss, colon length, histological inflammation and leukocyte infiltration. Chronic DSS-colitis confirmed that Mt1 and Mt2 gene disruption enhances clinical outcome. Blockade of extracellular MT with antibodies reduced F4/80-positive macrophage infiltration in DSS- and trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-colitis, with a tendency towards a better outcome. Whole-body single-photon emission computer tomography of mice injected with radioactive anti-MT antibodies showed antibody accumulation in the colon during colitis and clearance during recovery. Necrotic and not apoptotic cell death resulted in western blot MT detection in HT29 cell supernatant. In a Boyden chamber migration assay, leukocyte attraction towards the necrotic cell supernatant could be abolished with anti-MT antibody, indicating the chemotactic potential of endogenous released MT. Our results show that human colitis is associated with infiltration of MT-positive inflammatory cells. Since antibody blockade of extracellular MT can reduce colitis in mice, MT may act as a danger signal and may represent a novel target for reducing leukocyte infiltration and inflammation in IBD patients.","output":"Role of metallothioneins as danger signals in the pathogenesis of colitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a great threat to global public health.

After first taking power and in accordance with its concerns about attaining domestic and international legitimacy, AKP launched a democratization process by implementing several reforms leading toward EU membership. During this process, the boundaries of politics were broadened, enabling political discussion of certain taboo topics. However, this trend was reversed after AKPs authoritarian populist tendencies strengthened. The partys growing anti-intellectualist stance has also made scholars the target of the governments populist discourse. These circumstances make it critical to examine the challenges Turkeys political scientists experience since their discipline is directly influenced by the boundaries of what is political. This study therefore explores these challenges through ten in-depth interviews conducted with political scientists. It finds that political scientists mostly engage in self-censorship to protect themselves under Turkeys populist authoritarian atmosphere, which has narrowed down in-class discussion and research agendas leading to the impoverishment of the discipline in Turkey.

The infection is caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and clinically characterized by common symptoms including fever, dry cough, loss of taste/smell, myalgia and pneumonia in severe cases. With overwhelming spikes in infection and death, its pathogenesis yet remains elusive. Since the infection spread rapidly, its healthcare demands are overwhelming with uncontrollable emergencies. Although laboratory testing and analysis are developing at an enormous pace, the high momentum of severe cases demand more rapid strategies for initial screening and patient stratification. Several molecular biomarkers like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL6), eosinophils and cytokines, and artificial intelligence (AI) based screening approaches have been developed by various studies to assist this vast medical demand. This review is an attempt to collate the outcomes of such studies, thus highlighting the utility of AI in rapid screening of molecular markers along with chest X-rays and other COVID-19 symptoms to enable faster diagnosis and patient stratification. By doing so, we also found that molecular markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6 eosinophils, etc. showed significant differences between severe and non-severe cases of COVID-19 patients. CT findings in the lungs also showed different patterns like lung consolidation significantly higher in patients with poor recovery and lung lesions and fibrosis being higher in patients with good recovery.

After screening the titles, abstracts and full texts of the retrieved results, two reviewers independently evaluated the relevant data. 35 of 508 studies met our criteria. The majority of the eligible studies reported data from central China (e.g., Wuhan and Hubei Province), and the most frequently measured air pollutant was nitrogen dioxide (NO2;51 values in 28 studies), followed by fine particulate matter (PM2.5;49 values in 26 studies). We found evidence of a substantial reduction in air pollution immediately after lockdown measures were implemented, with traffic-related NO2 exhibiting the largest decrease. The reported reductions in air pollution varied by region and period. Specifically, urban, industrial and highly populated areas of China experienced greater improvements in air quality than rural, residential and less populated areas. Additionally, owing to meteorological factors, the effects differed between inland and coastal regions. However, despite the changes, the pollutant concentrations in many regions (e.g., Beijing, where PM2.5 and PM10 levels remained above 100 mu g m(-3)) still exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 24-hour mean guidelines (e.g., 25 mu g m(-3) and 50 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively).

This study aimed to assess whether training to proficiency using a novel laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) simulation curriculum improved operating room (OR) performance. METHODS For this study, 17 surgical residents [postgraduate years (PGYs) 2-5] participated in a didactic LIHR course and then were randomized to a training (T) or a control (C, standard residency) group. Performance of totally extraperitoneal (TEP) LIHR in the OR at baseline and after the study was measured using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills-Groin Hernia (GOALS-GH). RESULTS Of the 17 residents, 14 (5 T and 9 C) completed their final evaluations. The two groups showed no differences in terms of LIHR experience. The baseline GOALS-GH scores in the OR were similar (T 14.8; range 12.8-16.8 vs. C 13.6; range 12.3-14.8; P = 0.20). The mean number of training sessions needed to achieve proficiency was 4.8 (range 4.4-5.2), and the mean total training time was 109 min (range 61.9-149.1 min). After training, OR performance improved in the T group by 3.4 points (range 2.0-4.8 points; P = 0.002), whereas no significant change was seen in the C group [1.2; (range -1.1 to 3.6; P = 0.27)].

CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the skills required for transfer of LIHR to the OR using a low-cost procedure-specific simulator.

The mutation R518W or R518Q on NPC1 is one of such disease-related mutations, causing reduced cholesterol transport by half, resulting in accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in late endosomal/lysosomal region of the cell. Even though there has been significant progress in understanding cholesterol transport by NPC1 in combination with NPC2, especially after the structural determination of full length NPC1 in 2016, many details such as interaction of full length NPC1 with NPC2, molecular motions responsible for cholesterol transport during and after this interaction, and structure and function relations of many mutations are still not well understood. We report the extensive molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the structure and motions of NPC1 lumenal domain for cholesterol transport and disease behind the mutation (R518W). It is found that the mutation induces structural shift of NTD (N-terminal domain), toward the loop region in MLD (middle lumenal domain), which is believed to play central role in interaction with NPC2 protein, such that the interaction with NPC2 protein might be less favorable compare to wild NPC1. Also, the simulation indicates the possible re-orientation of the NTD, aligning to form an internal tunnel, after receiving the cholesterol from NPC2 with wild NPC1 unlike the mutated one, a possible pose for further action in cholesterol trafficking.

For instance, cognitive mechanisms required for sustenance can be affected due to stress caused by daily mundane events, not necessarily by chronic events. Thus, it becomes essential to manage stress effectively especially for college students. Meditation is one of the useful techniques that facilitates cognitive flexibility and has consequences at the molecular and endocrinal level to treat stress. OBJECTIVES: The present study attempts to understand the effect of meditation on the brain waves when participants face stressful events. METHODS: A randomized controlled pre-post experimental design was used. Total 18 subjects were randomly assigned to control group and experimental group. Subsequently, Electroencephalograph (EEG) data were recorded during the determination test (DT) before and after the meditation. The Control group underwent relaxation music while the experimental group practiced Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) (a type of meditation). Non-linear EEG signal processing algorithm was applied to capture dynamics and complexity in brain waves. Results: Results indicated that the efficacy of meditation was reflected with the improved information processing in the brain. Improved performance and reduced errors were reported in DT Scores in the experimental group. Increased complexity of beta band was observed for non-linear features, signifying efficient utilization of cognitive resources while performing the task.

Aged patients require more significant healthcare resources because they are more likely to have chronic diseases that result in higher healthcare expenses. The design and implementation of e-health solutions, which offer patients mobile services to assist and enhance their treatment based on monitoring specific physiological data, is one of the key achievements in medical information technology. In the last few decades, there have been tremendous advancements in healthcare technology regarding mobility, size, speed, and communication. However, the critical drawback of todays e-Health monitoring systems is that patients are confined to smart rooms and beds with monitoring gadgets. Such tracking is not widespread due to chronic patients mobility, privacy, and flexibility issues. Further, health monitoring devices that are fastened to a patients body do not give any analysis or advice. To improve the health monitoring process, a multi-agent-based system for health monitoring is provided in this study, which entails a group of intelligent agents that gather patient data, reason together, and propose actions to patients and medical professionals in a mobile context. A multi-agent-based framework presented in this study is evaluated through a case study.

Methods A retrospective analysis of all thoracic surgical cases from 5/1/2019 to 12/31/2020 was conducted. Demographics, pre-operative surgical indications, procedures, final pathologic diagnoses, and perioperative outcomes were recorded. A census of operative cases, relevant ancillary services, and outpatient thoracic clinics were obtained from our institutional database. Results 619 cases were included in this study (329 pre-COVID-19 and 290 COVID-19, representing an 11.8% reduction). There were no differences in type of thoracic procedures or peri-operative outcomes between the two cohorts. Prolonged reduction of thoracic surgical cases (50% of baseline) during the first half of the COVID-19 period was followed by a resurgence of surgical volumes to 110% of baseline in the second half. Similar incidence of cases were performed for oncologic indications during the first half while more benign cases were performed in the second half coinciding with the launch of our robotic foregut surgery program. After undergoing surgery during the pandemic, none of our patients reported COVID-19 symptoms within 14 days of discharge. Conclusion During the initial surge of COVID-19, while there was temporary closure of operative services, our healthcare system continued to provide safe care for thoracic surgery patients, particularly those with oncologic indications.

Methods:The vaccination strategies are defined by solving optimal control problems of a compartmental epidemic model in which the daily vaccination rate and the daily testing rate for the identification and isolation of asymptomatic subjects are the control variables. Different kinds of algebraic constraints are considered, representing different vaccination scenarios in which the total amount of vaccines available during the time period under consideration is limited or the number of daily available vaccines is limited. These optimal control problems are numerically solved by means of a direct transcription technique, which allows both equality and inequality constraints to be straightforwardly included in the formulation of the optimal control problems. Results:Several numerical experiments are conducted, in which the objective functional to be minimized is a combination of the number of symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious subjects with the cost of vaccination of susceptible subjects and testing of asymptomatic infectious subjects. The results confirm the hypothesis that the implementation of early control measures significantly reduces the number of symptomatic infected subjects, which is a key aspect for the resilience of the healthcare system. The sensitivity analysis of the solutions to the weighting parameters of the objective functional reveals that it is possible to obtain a vaccination strategy that allows vaccination supplies to be saved while keeping the same number of symptomatic infected subjects. Furthermore, it indicates that if the vaccination plan is not supported by a sufficient rate of testing, the number of symptomatic infected subjects could increase. Finally, the sensitivity analysis shows that a significant reduction in the efficacy of the vaccines could also lead to a relevant increase in the number of symptomatic infected subjects. Conclusions:The numerical experiments show that the proposed approach, which is based on optimal control of compartmental epidemic models, provides healthcare systems with a suitable method for scheduling vaccination plans and testing policies to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Optimal Control-Based Vaccination and Testing Strategies for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Examine the associations of BMI with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and risk of adverse outcomes in a cohort of Veterans Affairs enrollees.

METHODOLOGY: Literature searches were conducted to identify published records and analysis, including across various healthcare organizations and agencies, of the impact of the FreeStyle Libre(?) flash glucose monitoring system in diabetes. These findings were combined with the outcomes of three healthcare attitudes surveys among PWD and diabetes healthcare professionals in Canada, including two commissioned for this purpose. RESULTS: Clinical trials data and real-world evidence have proven the benefits of the FreeStyle Libre system on limiting hypoglycemia, lowering HbA1c, optimizing metrics of glucose control and reducing hospital admissions. These benefits are accompanied by improvements in patients quality of life, work productivity, and savings to the health system. The FreeStyle Libre system has created an opportunity to change the organization and delivery of care, including during COVID-19 restrictions on access to standard care, thus generating system-wide benefits in addition to those accrued by patients and HCPs.

This study aimed to evaluate a novel, context-specific education package to teach midwives basic obstetric ultrasound, including the determination of gestational age by measurement of fetal femur length. METHODS: The study was conducted across six sites in Malawi in January 2021. Following a virtual training of the trainers, local teams delivered a 10-day programme encompassing both didactic and hands on components. Matched pre and post course tests assessed participants' knowledge of key concepts, with Objective Structured Clinical Examinations used to evaluate practical skills. To achieve a pass, trainees were required to establish the gestational age to within 7 days of an experienced practitioner and achieve an overall score of >65% on five consecutive occasions. A matched pre and post course survey explored participants' attitudes and confidence in performing ultrasound examinations. RESULTS: Of the 29 midwives who participated, 28 finished the programme and met the criteria specified to pass. 22 midwives completed the matched knowledge tests, with the mean (SD) score increasing from 10.2 (3.3) to 18 (2.5) after training (P <0.0001). Mean difference 7.9, 95% CI 6.5C9.2.

Methods: : In this retrospective cohort study all confirmed COVID-19 adult patients (18 years of age) in Lagos between February 27 to July 6 2020 were included. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records of patients admitted at the COVID-19 isolation centers in Lagos. Outcomes included dying, being discharged after recovery or being evacuated/transferred. Descriptive statistics considered proportions, means and medians. The Chi-square and Fishers exact tests were used in determining associations between variables. KaplanCMeier survival analysis and Cox regression were performed to quantify the risk of worse outcomes among hypertensives with COVID-19 and adjust for confounders. P-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: : A total of 2075 adults with COVID-19 were included in this study. The prevalence of hypertension, the most common comorbidity, was 17.8% followed by diabetes (7.2%) and asthma (2.0%). Overall mortality was 4.2% while mortality among the hypertensives was 13.7%. Severe symptoms and mortality were significantly higher among the hypertensives and survival rates were significantly lowered by the presence of an additional comorbidity to 50% from 91% for those with hypertension alone and from 98% for all other patients (P<0.001). After adjustment for confounders (age and sex), severe COVID-19and death were higher for hypertensives {severe/critical illness: HR=2.41, P=0.001, 95%CI=1.4C4.0, death: HR=2.30, P=0.001, 95%CI=1.2C4.6, for those with hypertension only} {severe/critical illness: HR=3.76, P=0.001, 95%CI=2.1C6.4, death: crude HR=6.63, P=0.001, 95%CI=3.4C1.6, for those with additional comorbidities}. Hypertension posed an increased risk of severe morbidity (approx. 4-fold) and death (approx. 7-fold) from COVID-19 in the presence of multiple comorbidities. Conclusion: The potential morbidity and mortality risks of hypertension especially with other comorbidities in COVID-19 could help direct efforts towards prevention and prognostication.

Its expression induces a physical alteration of surface adhesion molecules, which causes cell rounding and detachment of the infected cells. This phenomenon likely plays a crucial role in viral pathogenicity. In this study, we show that such morphological changes are cell line-dependent as well as dependent on the surface proteins that interact with EBOV-GP in cis and trans. We have generated data showing that natural killer (NK) cell receptors (NCRs: NKp44 and NKp46), selectins (CD62E/P/L) and inhibitory Siglecs function as receptors for Ebola-GP and human papilloma virus (HPV-L1). We used HEK293 cells transfected with Ebola-GP and recombinant fusion proteins containing the extracellular domain of each of these receptors linked to the Fc of human IgG1, which showed significant differences in their virus-binding behavior compared to HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector. Further, to demonstrate that EBOV-GP is a ligand for NKp44 and other NK-receptors, and to investigate their role in immune escape, we also used human HEK-293, HeLa- and hamster CHO-GP-transfectants. Our data show that the NK receptors NKp44 and NKp46 play a key role in recognizing EBOV (Ebolavirus) and strongly suggest that other inhibitory (Siglec-7, Siglec-5) and non-inhibitory homing receptors (P-Selectin, L-Selectin, E-Selectin, and DC-SIGNR/DC-SIGN) take part in the interaction with virus particles. In addition, we show that NKp44, and NKp46, Siglec-7, and -5, and P-, L-, E-selectins as well as of and DC-SIGNR/DC-SIGN bind to the artificial viral envelope of a lentiviral vector that contains EBOV-GP. Altogether we prove that NCRs and a range of other inhibitory and activating receptors can interact with viral envelope/capsid proteins and that such interaction could play an important role in the elimination of virus infected cells. Our findings could be used to develop new strategies for prevention and treatment of infections by these viruses. Author summary The innate immune system is able to recognize specifically certain virus components. Here we show that activating NK-cell receptors (NKp44, and NKp46) are involved in such interaction by using HEK293 and CHOK1 cells transfected with the Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) and by binding studies with purified EBOV-GP.

Virtual loads were applied on the eyeball and the infra-orbital rim separately. Von Mises stresses were examined in each simulation. RESULTS: The simulation predicted fractures on the infra-orbital rim and orbital floor when simulating the hydraulic mechanism, and on the orbital floor and mesial wall when simulating the buckling mechanism. CONCLUSION: Biomechanical studies are essential part in understanding maxillofacial fractures mechanisms. The results confirmed and ascertained what is seen clinically, and explained clearly the two mechanisms of orbital fractures.","output":"Biomechanical assessment of orbital fractures using patient-specific models and clinical matching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Despite recombinant interferon- 4 (IFN-4) demonstrating anti-viral activity in vitro and the ancestral functional gene (IFNL4) being conserved in all other primates, there has been speculation that IFN-4 may be detrimental in humans. In light of recent rekindled interest in humoral immunity, this study aimed at evaluating the impact of baseline characteristics, including IFNL4, on antibody levels to hepatitis C virus (HCV). MATERIALS AND METHODS Pretreatment sera from 279 well-characterized North European Caucasians with chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection having undergone liver biopsy were analyzed regarding IFNL4 (rs12979860) and anti-HCV antibody levels using a commercially available assay. RESULTS Patients producing IFN-4 had higher signal to cut-off (S/CO) anti-HCV antibody ratios as compared with those lacking IFN-4 (IFNL4rs12979860 CT/TT versus CC, p<.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Additionally, in univariate analyses S/CO was significantly higher in men than women (p<.001), as well as in patients with absent/mild interface hepatitis (Ishak grade 0-2 versus 3-4, p = .009), and absent/mild steatosis (grade 0-1 versus 2-3, p = .0005). Also, an inverse correlation with HCV RNA level (rs= -0.14, p = .02) was noted. In multivariate analysis IFN-4, gender, steatosis and viral load remained independently associated. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates that the ability to produce IFN-4, in addition to male gender, absent/mild steatosis, and lower viral load, augments antibody levels against HCV. This indicates that IFN-4 may be associated with T helper cell 2 (Th2) immune skewing, which might have clinical implications beyond HCV infection.

IA platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are a promising alternative, but no systematic reviews to date have compared them to the current standard of care, IA CS injections. We aim to investigate the effect of IA PRP injections versus IA corticosteroid injections for the symptomatic management of knee OA. METHODS: All published trials comparing IA PRP and CS injections for knee OA were included. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched through June 2020. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. A random effects model was used to calculate standardized mean difference with 95% confidence interval in WOMAC/VAS score (or subscores), comparing IA PRP to CS injections across studies. RESULTS: Included were eight studies and 648 patients, 443 (68%) were female, mean age 59 years, with a mean BMI of 28.4. Overall, the studies were considered at low risk of bias. Compared with CS injections, PRP was significantly better in reducing OA symptoms (pain, stiffness, functionality) at 3, 6 and 9 months post-intervention (P < 0.01). The greatest effect was observed at 6 and 9 months (? 0.78 (? 1.34 to ? 0.23) standard mean deviations (SMD) and ? 1.63 (? 2.14 to ? 1.12) SMD respectively). At 6 months, this equates to an additional reduction of 9.51 in WOMAC or 0.97 on the VAS pain scales. At 6 months PRP allowed greater return to sporting activities than CS, measured by the KOOS subscale for sporting activity, of magnitude 9.7 (? 0.45 to 19.85) (P = 0.06). Triple injections of PRP, generally separated by a week, were superior to single injections over 12 months follow-up (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: IA-PRP injections produce superior outcomes when compared with CS injections for symptomatic management of knee OA, including improved pain management, less joint stiffness and better participation in exercise/sporting activity at 12 months follow-up. Giving three IA-PRP, with injections separated by a week, appears more effective than 1 IA-PRP injection. PROSPERO TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020181928.

Due to the 3Rs Principle (Refine, Reduce, Replacement), the scientific community has shifted its focus to 3D organoid models rather than testing animal models. 3D organoid models provide a better physiological architecture as it mimics the real tissue microenvironment and is the best platform to recapitulate organs in a dish. Hence, the organoid approach provides a more realistic drug response in comparison to the traditional 2D cellular models, which lack key physiological relevance due to the absence of proper surface topography and cellular interactions. Furthermore, an adverse outcome pathway (AOPs) provides a best fit model to identify various molecular and cellular events during the exposure of SARS-CoV-2.

NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated egg-based Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine expressing the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Wuhan-Hu-1. The spike protein was stabilized and incorporated into NDV virions by removing the polybasic furin cleavage site, introducing the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the fusion protein of NDV, and introducing six prolines for stabilization in the prefusion state. Vaccine production and clinical development was initiated in Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil. Here the interim results from the first stage of the randomized, dose-escalation, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial conducted at the Hanoi Medical University (Vietnam) are presented. Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, non-pregnant, and with self-reported negative history for SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible. Participants were randomized to receive one of five treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: 1 mcg +/- CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3 mcg alone, 10 mcg alone, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited adverse events (AEs) during 7 days and subject-reported AEs during 28 days after each vaccination. Investigators further reviewed subject-reported AEs. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and pseudotyped virus neutralization). This interim analysis assessed safety 56 days after first vaccination (day 57) in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through 14 days after second vaccination (day 43) per protocol. Between March 15 and April 23, 2021, 224 individuals were screened and 120 were enrolled (25 per group for active vaccination and 20 for placebo). All subjects received two doses. The most common solicited AEs among those receiving active vaccine or placebo were all predominantly mild and included injection site pain or tenderness (<58%), fatigue or malaise (<22%), headache (<21%), and myalgia (<14%). No higher proportion of the solicited AEs were observed for any group of active vaccine. The proportion reporting vaccine-related AEs during the 28 days after either vaccination ranged from 4% to 8% among vaccine groups and was 5% in controls. No vaccine-related serious adverse event occurred. The immune response in the 10 mcg formulation group was highest, followed by 1 mcg+CpG1018, 3 mcg, and 1 mcg formulations. Fourteen days after the second vaccination, the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of 50% neutralizing antibody against the homologous Wuhan-Hu-1 pseudovirus ranged from 56.07 IU/mL (1 mcg, 95% CI 37.01, 84.94) to 246.19 IU/mL (10 mcg, 95% CI 151.97, 398.82), with 84% to 96% of vaccine groups attaining a [] 4-fold increase over baseline. This was compared to a panel of human convalescent sera (N=29, 72.93 95% CI 33.00-161.14).

Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures, cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well. We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the results on business closures and stay-at-home orders. Finally, we stress that our study is observational and therefore should be interpreted with great caution.

While some IBV strains replicate locally, others can disseminate to various organs, including the kidney. Here, we elucidate the determinants for kidney tropism by studying interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral attachment protein spike from two IBV strains with different tropisms. Recombinantly produced RBDs from the nephropathogenic IBV strain QX and from the nonnephropathogenic strain M41 bound to the epithelial cells of the trachea. In contrast, only QX-RBD binds more extensively to cells of the digestive tract, urogenital tract, and kidneys. While removal of sialic acids from tissues prevented binding of all proteins to all tissues, binding of QX-RBD to trachea and kidney could not be blocked by preincubation with synthetic alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. The lack of binding of QX-RBD to a previously identified IBV-M41 receptor was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrating that tissue binding of QX-RBD is dependent on a different sialylated glycan receptor. Using chimeric RBD proteins, we discovered that the region encompassing amino acids 99 to 159 of QX-RBD was required to establish kidney binding. In particular, QX-RBD amino acids 110 to 112 (KIP) were sufficient to render IBV-M41 with the ability to bind to kidney, while the reciprocal mutations in IBV-QX abolished kidney binding completely. Structural analysis of both RBDs suggests that the receptor-binding site for QX is located at a different location on the spike than that of M41. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens. Upon infection of chicken flocks, the poultry industry faces substantial economic losses by diminished egg quality and increased morbidity and mortality of infected animals. While all IBV strains infect the chicken respiratory tract via the ciliated epithelial layer of the trachea, some strains can also replicate in the kidneys, dividing IBV into the following two pathotypes: nonnephropathogenic (example, IBV-M41) and nephropathogenic viruses (including IBV-QX). Here, we set out to identify the determinants for the extended nephropathogenic tropism of IBV-QX. Our data reveal that each pathotype makes use of a different sialylated glycan ligand, with binding sites on opposite sides of the attachment protein. This knowledge should facilitate the design of antivirals to prevent coronavirus infections in the field.","output":"Three Amino Acid Changes in Avian Coronavirus Spike Protein Allow Binding to Kidney Tissue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recognising the transition from relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in clinical practice can be challenging. With disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) commonly used for RRMS accepted to be less efficacious once progression has occurred, treatment options for progressive forms of MS have been limited. Emergence of new DMTs in SPMS are changing the treatment landscape. There is a need to better understand current practice and the factors underlying it, to facilitate consensus on the overall management of SPMS and optimise diagnostic and management decisions. This survey project aimed to assess current practices for the diagnosis and management of patients with SPMS in the UK. METHODS: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the management of patients with SPMS from geographically distributed MS neurology centres in the UK participated in face-to-face or telephone interviews, facilitated by a semi-structured questionnaire. The survey data were descriptively analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Fifty-nine HCPs (41 neurologists, 15 specialist nurses and 3 'other'), from 59 UK centres took part. Sixty-one percent (n = 36/59) of respondents applied a specific definition for SPMS, although only 6% of these (2/36) used the Lublin 2014 phenotype criteria. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score increase with an absence of relapses was an important consideration for SPMS diagnosis for 83% (n = 49/59) of respondents, and 36% (n = 21/59) considered this to be the most important piece of evidence that they look for when they suspect a patient is transitioning from RRMS to SPMS. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) estimated time between first suspicion and diagnosis of SPMS was 12 months (12-24 [n = 45/59]), with concerns over withdrawing DMTs and the psychological impact of a diagnosis on patients the most commonly reported reasons for reluctance to diagnose. Seventy-three percent (n = 43/59) of respondents followed specific guidelines for DMT management of patients transitioning from RRMS to SPMS, with most (86%, n = 37/43) using the NHS England algorithm. Ninety-eight percent (n = 58/59) use DMTs to treat patients they suspect may be transitioning to SPMS, and 51% (n = 30/59) reported using DMTs for newly diagnosed SPMS patients. Approximately 1 in 5 HCPs may consider continuing DMTs beyond EDSS 7.0 in certain circumstances. CONCLUSION: The survey highlighted variation across the UK in SPMS definition, diagnosis and reported real-world management. Disparity in practice may result in unnecessary variations in treatment patterns and consequently outcomes. HCPs should be equipped to make timely and accurate decisions, which will be important in improving access to appropriate therapies for patients with SPMS.","output":"Results from SPECTRUM: A survey of healthcare professionals to understand current diagnosis and management practices for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Seating for long periods is associated with several health conditions and increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Sensitivity analyses and tests for publication bias were also performed. Results: Eight articles with more than 268,683 subjects were included. PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95%CI = 0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11). While it can add risk of severe disease (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.20-1.99, P<0.001;) and secondary infection (OR=4.33, 95% CI=2.57-7.29). No publication bias was detected. Conclusions: PPI use is not associated with increased risk infection and may not change the mortality risk of COVID-19, but appeared to be associated with increased risk of progression to severe disease and secondary infection. However, more original studies to further clarify the relationship between PPI and COVID-19 are still urgently needed.","output":"Will Proton Pump Inhibitors Lead to a Higher Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Progression to Severe Disease?

The original scale of the WAQ was translated into Korean and then administered to 4,242 working people from a broad range of economic sectors. The nation-wide sample was a representative one from the 17th wave Korean Labor and Income Panel Study in 2014. The main body comprises two steps. First, through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as well as a reliability analysis, along with content validity examination among experts, thirteen items from the original WAQ were eliminated. The EFA yielded a four-factor solution with four items established in compulsive dependency (CD), four in illusion of control (IC), four in endurance of conflicts (EC), and four in withdrawal symptoms (WS). This process provided a succinct and convenient measure of workaholism, the KOWS with 16 items. The reliability coefficient () of the new scale was .90, and the split-half reliability coefficient was .72. Secondly, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed by way of structural equation modeling to validate the new construct. This KOWS showed adequate convergent validity (AVE > .5), construct reliability (CR > .7), as well as discriminant validity (AVE > 2). Between four subscales of the KOWS and affective commitment (AC) to organizations there proved meager correlation. In conclusion, the KOWS with 16-item psychometric properties is a valid and reliable tool to measure workaholism in South Korea.","output":"A Critical Analysis of the WAQ: The Development of a Korean Form."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hygiene and social distancing are recommended control measures for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina. However, empirical data to support this recommendation are limited. METHODS During an outbreak of HFMD and herpangina due to infection by the human enterovirus 71, we defined a case as a vesicular papular rash on the hands, feet, buttocks, or oral mucosa and onset from April 30 to June 26, 2008. We selected 176 HFMD and herpangina case-children and a stratified random sample of 201 asymptomatic control-children; frequency matched according to residency status. We administered a questionnaire to the parents about their children's exposures and hygienic behaviors. RESULTS Risk factors for HFMD and herpangina included playing with neighborhood children (odds ratio [OR]: 11 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.2-17]), visiting an outpatient clinic for another reason  1 week before onset (OR: 20 [95% CI: 5.0-88]), and community exposures to crowded places (OR: 7.3 [95% CI: 4.1-13]). By using a score summarizing responses to 4 hand-washing questions, we found that 50% of the case-children and 2.5% of control-children had a poor score of 1 to 3, whereas 12% of the case-children and 78% of control-children had a good score of  7 (OR: 0.00069 [95% CI: 0.0022-0.022]) after we adjusted for residency, age, and community exposures by using logistic regression.

Rwanda has made notable efforts to fight the pandemic. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country's economy are numerous and the refugees residing in Rwanda are not spared these effects. As of December 2020, 164,000 people were granted refugee status in Rwanda according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The majority were from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes regions, including DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Burundi. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has led to a decline in donations to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which in turn has significantly reduced the food rations of refugees. Such paucity will no doubt cause unprecedented impacts on the people residing in refugee camps, who completely depend on humanitarian aid to meet their basic food requirements. This lack of access to adequate and affordable food will expose refugees to extreme hunger and starvation, putting their lives in danger by triggering forced returns, infections, social conflicts and thus higher morbidity and mortality.Furthermore, such stressful environments would no doubt put the mental health of these already vulnerable communities at risk. It is unsurprising that refugees are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to local population, including higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This is an issue as they are also less likely to receive support than the general population.

To store hydrogen with a high gravimetric/volumetric density, gaseous hydrogen storage systems require a very high-pressure compressed gas cylinder which is quite unsafe and the storage in the liquid form needs cryogenic containers to be maintained at roughly 20 K under ambient pressure because hydrogen has a very low critical temperature of 33 K. However, hydrogen can be stored in solid materials with higher concentration of hydrogen compared to the gaseous and liquid hydrogen storage systems. It is therefore, worthwhile to look into the experimental and theoretical research on prospective hydrogen storage materials. The hydride-forming alloys and intermetallic compounds are found to be the most important families of hydrogen storage materials. Multicomponent alloys consisting of five or more principal elements, also known as high-entropy alloys appear to have potential for the development as hydrogen storage materials. Hydride-forming elements like Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Hf, Ta, La, Ce, Ni, and others have been shown to have hydrogen storage properties and the ability to produce single-phase high-entropy intermetallics. Here, attempts will be made to present a short review on utilization of multicomponent high-entropy alloys as solid hydrogen storage materials. Furthermore, we will also present some of our work on the synthesis, structuralCmicrostructural characterization and hydrogen storage properties of TiCZrCVCCrCNi equi-atomic hydride-forming high-entropy alloys.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors present during COVID-19 hospitalization associated with an increased risk of exhibiting new or persisting symptoms (Post-COVID-19 Syndrome, PCS). MedLine and WebOfScience were last searched on 30 September 2021. We included English language clinical trials and observational studies investigating prognostic factors for PCS in adults previously hospitalized for COVID-19, reporting at least one individual prospective follow-up of minimum 12 weeks. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias, which was judged generally moderate. Risk factors were included in the analysis if their association with PCS was investigated by at least two studies. To summarize the prognostic effect of each factor (or group of factors), odds ratios were estimated using raw data. Overall, 20 articles met the inclusion criteria, involving 13,340 patients. Associations were statistically significant for two factors: female sex with any symptoms (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.27C1.82), with mental health symptoms (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21C2.29) and with fatigue (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.32C1.79); acute disease severity with respiratory symptoms (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.03C2.68). The I2 statistics tests were calculated to quantify the degree of study heterogeneity. This is the first meta-analysis measuring the association between factors present during COVID-19 hospitalization and long-term sequelae.

A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020. Na?ve seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation.

Deep learning performance has already proven superior to human experts, including physicians and certified readers, in terms of accuracy and speed. Reproducible measurement of retinal fluid relies on precise AI-based segmentation methods that assign a label to each OCT voxel denoting its fluid type such as intraretinal fluid (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) or pigment epithelial detachment (PED) and its location within the central 1-, 3- and 6-mm macular area.

By doing this, viruses limit the production of antiviral proteins and increase production capacity for viral proteins. Coronaviruses from the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), establish host shutoff via their nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). The Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus genomes, however, do not encode nsp1, and it has been suggested that these viruses do not induce host shutoff. Here, we show that the Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) does induce host shutoff, and we find that its accessory protein 5b is indispensable for this function. Importantly, we found that 5b-null viruses, unlike wild-type viruses, induce production of high concentrations of type I interferon protein in vitro, indicating that host shutoff by IBV plays an important role in antagonizing the host's innate immune response. Altogether, we demonstrate that 5b is a functional equivalent of nsp1, thereby answering the longstanding question of whether lack of nsp1 in gammacoronaviruses is compensated for by another viral protein. As such, our study is a significant step forward in the understanding of coronavirus biology and closes a gap in the understanding of some IBV virulence strategies. IMPORTANCE Many viruses inhibit protein synthesis by their host cell to enhance virus replication and to antagonize antiviral defense mechanisms. This process is referred to as host shutoff. We studied gene expression and protein synthesis in chicken cells infected with the important poultry pathogen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We show that IBV inhibits synthesis of host proteins, including that of type I interferon, a key component of the antiviral response. The IBV-induced host shutoff, however, does not require degradation of host RNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that accessory protein 5b of IBV plays a crucial role in the onset of host shutoff. Our findings suggest that inhibition of host protein synthesis is a common feature of coronaviruses and primarily serves to inhibit the antiviral response of the host.","output":"Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Limits Interferon Production by Inducing a Host Shutoff That Requires Accessory Protein 5b."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a multi-language, cross-platform, open-source library for asymmetric private set intersection (PSI) and PSI-Cardinality (PSI-C).

Applying the multiple case study method, this study aimed to explore whether and how the establishment of an audience for knowledge can support students shaping of knowledge construction that is both scientifically valid and meaningful to students. The recordings of 26 student discussions and student-produced artifacts were analyzed as the main data sources. Student-created audiences and the epistemic features of knowledge construction processes were identified, and how the establishment of the audience did or did not support students knowledge construction was inferred. The analysis revealed that the students first explicated their epistemic goals by creating audiences as persons who hold students uncertainties and then designed processes to resolve these uncertainties. This indicates that the created audiences could explicate the object orientation of student activities, serving as the central axis in the students subsequent shaping of the process to construct knowledge that is meaningful to themselves. However, the activity had limited value in supporting the students plans for scientifically valid knowledge construction.

METHODS: We performed a 2-sample Mendelian randomization to determine whether blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), presence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) are causally related to presentation with severe COVID-19. Variant-exposure instrumental variable associations were determined from most recently published genome-wide association and meta-analysis studies (GWAS) with publicly available summary-level GWAS data. Variant-outcome associations were obtained from a recent GWAS meta-analysis of laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with severity determined according to need for hospitalization/death. We also examined reverse causality using exposure as diagnosis of severe COVID-19 causing cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: We found no evidence for a causal association of cardiovascular risk factors/disease with severe COVID-19 (compared to population controls), nor evidence of reverse causality. Causal odds ratios (OR, by inverse variance weighted regression) for BP (OR for COVID-19 diagnosis 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99C1.01, P = 0.604] per genetically predicted increase in BP) and T2DM (OR for COVID-19 diagnosis to that of genetically predicted T2DM 1.02 [95% CI: 0.9C1.05, P = 0.927], in particular, were close to unity with relatively narrow confidence intervals.

Once in the blood, numerous drugs are taken up by the liver for metabolism and/or biliary elimination, or by the kidney for renal elimination. Many common drugs are organic anions. The major liver uptake transporters for organic anion drugs are organic anion transporter polypeptides (OATP1B1 or SLCO1B1; OATP1B3 or SLCO1B3), whereas in the kidney they are organic anion transporters (OAT1 or SLC22A6; OAT3 or SLC22A8). Since these particular OATPs are overwhelmingly found in the liver but not the kidney, and these OATs are overwhelmingly found in the kidney but not liver, it is possible to use chemoinformatics, machine learning (ML) and deep learning to analyze liver OATP-transported drugs versus kidney OAT-transported drugs. Our analysis of >30 quantitative physicochemical properties of OATP- and OAT-interacting drugs revealed eight properties that in combination, indicate a high propensity for interaction with liver transporters versus kidney ones based on machine learning (e.g., random forest, k-nearest neighbors) and deep-learning classification algorithms. Liver OATPs preferred drugs with greater hydrophobicity, higher complexity, and more ringed structures whereas kidney OATs preferred more polar drugs with more carboxyl groups.

Greater Manchester has seen some of the highest rates of COVID-19 and as a result has faced particularly stringent 'lockdown' regulations. Manchester is the sixth most deprived Local Authority in England (according to 2019 English Indices of Multiple Deprivation). As a consequence, many neighbourhoods in the city were always going to be less resilient to the economic shock caused by the pandemic compared with other, less-deprived, areas. Particular challenges for Manchester include the prevalence of poor health, low-paid work, low qualifications, poor housing conditions and overcrowding. Ethnic minority groups also faced disparities long before the onset of the pandemic. Within the UK, ethnic minorities have been found to be most disadvantaged in terms of employment and housing C particularly in large urban areas containing traditional settlement areas for ethnic minorities. Further, all Black, Asian, and Minority ethnic (BAME) groups in Greater Manchester have been found to be less likely to be employed pre-pandemic compared with White people. For example, people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic backgrounds, especially women, have the lowest levels of employment in Greater Manchester. Finally, unprecedented cuts to public spending as a result of austerity have also disproportionately affected women of an ethnic minority background alongside women, disabled people, the young and those with no or low-level qualifications. This environment has created and sustained a multiplicative disadvantage for Manchesters ethnic minority residents through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ethnic Minorities in Manchester (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The worldwide emergence and rapid expansion of COVID-19 emphasizes the need to assess the knowledge gap and to predict the disease-related behaviors and reactions during this epidemic Methods and design: COVID19 Population Survey of Iran (COPSIR) is a repeated cross sectional survey that will be conducted in 8 waves In each wave, 515 Iranian adults aged 18 years or older will be randomly selected and interviewed by phone The study waves will be performed at approximately weekly intervals The survey tool is adapted from COSMO (COVID-19 Snapshot MOnitoring) study This study will provide information on trends of knowledge, risk perception, preventive behaviors, psychological problems, essential needs, and public trust among Iranian adults during COVID-19 epidemic Discussion: The key findings of each wave will be immediately reported to the National Headquarters for Coronavirus Control to set better policies for disease control and prevention Moreover, if a message is extracted from the results of this study that needs to be communicated to the public, it will be done through the mass media","output":"COVID-19 Population Survey of Iran (COPSIR) study protocol: Repeated survey on knowledge, risk perception, preventive behaviors, psychological problems, essential needs, and public trust during COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>The paper conducts a metadata analysis of articles on developing countries in highly ranked international accounting journals, the topics covered, research methods employed, their authorship and impact, across countries and continents.Design/methodology/approach>A database of the publications of accounting journals ranked A*, A and B in the Australian Business Dean Council (ABDC) journal rankings from 2009 to 2018 was constructed. A structured literature review, partly using NVivo and Leximancer, analysed the 1,317 articles on developing countries. A parallel online repository contains the research data.Findings>Articles on accounting in developing countries increased by 36% over the ten years but remained a small proportion of all published articles (i.e. 1,317 of 13,805 representing 9.5%). They have concentrated on quantitative market-based studies of financial reporting and auditing, especially in larger and relatively richer developing countries in Asia and Africa, with developed capital markets. Broader topics deemed important in recent reviews of the area, for instance, on achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and on smaller, poorer countries, which have been neglected, albeit less so in qualitative studies. The research identifies important jurisdictional differences. Many authors held positions in British Commonwealth universities. The most cited articles overall, all quantitative, were in highly ranked North American journals, whereas most qualitative studies came from journals located in richer British Commonwealth countries.Research limitations/implications>The study only covers English language journals. Journals in other languages and lesser ranked journals, especially those based in developing countries, may be important sources too.Practical implications>More research on a broader range of accounting issues, especially in smaller and poorer developing countries, is needed. Although quantitative work is valuable, more recognition of the value of qualitative studies is needed, especially given the disappointing results of market-based policies prescribed by foreign institutions and their shift to advocating good governance reforms and achieving SDGs.Originality/value>To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the most exhaustive analysis of recent accounting research on developing countries. It traces which journals have published such research, when, on which countries, on what topics and by whom. This is of interest to journal editors, course designers and researchers in the area. The authors hope that making the raw data and detailed analyses available online, consistent with protocols adopted in science disciplines, will encourage accounting researchers to do likewise to enable further testing of results and claims and build knowledge cumulatively.","output":"Accounting articles on developing countries in ranked English language journals: a meta-review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Asthma can be exacerbated by many triggers, and the heterogeneity of asthma triggers is clear among children with asthma. This study describes asthma triggers using a large-scale electronic dataset from the smartphone-based Chinese Children's Asthma Action Plan (CCAAP) app and aims to examine the difference in asthma triggers among different subgroups of children with asthma. Methods: Data from the smartphone-based CCAAP app between February 22, 2017, and November 23, 2020, were reviewed, and children with asthma who reported their asthma triggers were enrolled. Eight common asthma triggers were listed in the software: upper respiratory infection (URI), allergen sensitization, exercise, emotional disturbances, pungent odors, air pollution/smog, weather change, and tobacco smoke. We compared the incidence of asthma triggers among different subgroups (<6 years vs. 6C17 years; boy vs. girl; eastern region vs. central region vs. western region). Results: We enrolled 6,835 patients with self-reported asthma triggers. When compared by sex, boys had a higher proportion of exercise-triggered asthma than girls (boys vs. girls, 22.5 vs. 19.7%, p < 0.05). The proportion of patients <6 years of age with URI-triggered asthma was higher than that of patients 6C17 years of age (<6 vs. 6C17 years, 80.9 vs. 74.9%, p < 0.001). Patients 6C17 years of age were more likely than patients <6 years of age to report five of the asthma triggers: allergen sensitization (<6 vs. 6C17 years, 26.6 vs. 35.8%, p < 0.001), exercise (<6 vs. 6C17 years, 19.3 vs. 23.7%, p < 0.001), pungent odors (<6 vs. 6C17 years, 8.8 vs. 12.7%, p < 0.001), air pollution/smog (<6 vs. 6C17 years, 9.4 vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), and tobacco smoke (<6 vs. 6C17 years, 3.5 vs. 5.3%, p < 0.001). In subgroups based on geographical distribution, asthma triggering of allergen sensitization was reported to be the most common in patients from the eastern region (eastern region vs. central region vs. western region, 35.0 vs. 24.6 vs. 28.0%, p < 0.001). Exercise-triggered asthma was found to be the most prevalent among patients from the central region (eastern region vs. central region vs. western region, 21.6 vs. 24.8 vs. 20.4%, p < 0.05). However, the proportion of patients with air pollution/smog as an asthma trigger was the lowest among those from the western region (eastern region vs. central region vs. western region, 14.1 vs. 14.1 vs. 10.8%, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Children with asthma present different types of asthma triggers, both allergenic and nonallergenic. Age, sex, and geographical distribution affect specific asthma triggers. Preventive measures can be implemented based on a patient's specific asthma trigger.","output":"The Age, Sex, and Geographical Distribution of Self-Reported Asthma Triggers on Children With Asthma in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research investigates how people engage with data visualizations when commenting on the social platform Reddit.

Tools that facilitate the in silico prediction of immune response to biothreats, emerging infectious diseases, and cancers can accelerate the design of novel and next generation vaccines and their delivery to the clinic. Over the past 20 years, vaccinologists, bioinformatics experts, and advanced programmers based in Providence, Rhode Island, USA have advanced the development of an integrated toolkit for vaccine design called iVAX, that is secure and user-accessible by internet. This integrated set of immunoinformatic tools comprises algorithms for scoring and triaging candidate antigens, selecting immunogenic and conserved T cell epitopes, re-engineering or eliminating regulatory T cell epitopes, and re-designing antigens to induce immunogenicity and protection against disease for humans and livestock. Commercial and academic applications of iVAX have included identifying immunogenic T cell epitopes in the development of a T-cell based human multi-epitope Q fever vaccine, designing novel influenza vaccines, identifying cross-conserved T cell epitopes for a malaria vaccine, and analyzing immune responses in clinical vaccine studies. Animal vaccine applications to date have included viral infections of pigs such as swine influenza A, PCV2, and African Swine Fever. Rapid-Fire applications for biodefense have included a demonstration project for Lassa Fever and Q fever. As recent infectious disease outbreaks underscore the significance of vaccine-driven preparedness, the integrated set of tools available on the iVAX toolkit stand ready to help vaccine developers deliver genome-derived, epitope-driven vaccines.","output":"Better Epitope Discovery, Precision Immune Engineering, and Accelerated Vaccine Design Using Immunoinformatics Tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is now a well-developed research literature on the temporary use of land and buildings in cities around the world Research interest has focused in particular on experimental and inventive reuse of unused or under-used spaces, structures and infrastructure to accommodate a variety of cultural or creative activities The emergence of these new temporary uses has also provoked critical assessment, highlighting the role of short-term land use as a tactic to entrench developer interests by stabilizing land markets during periods of slack or legitimizing controversial development proposals Here, Deas et al highlight the ways in which the COVID-19 crisis has triggered multiple examples of the temporary reuse of land and buildings They highlight two challenges as the crisis evolves: how to employ temporary uses more effectively to create capacity for emergency uses and bolster resilience, and how to ensure that innovative or experimental land uses can continue to be supported in the context of future recovery","output":"Temporary urban uses in response to COVID-19: bolstering resilience via short-term experimental solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare alignment parameters between patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for knee osteoarthritis (OA) and non-arthritic controls. METHODS: Pre-operative computed tomography images from 194 patients undergoing HTO for medial knee OA and 118 non-arthritic controls were utilized. All patients had varus knee alignment (mean age: 57  11 years; 45% female). The hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and non-weight-bearing joint line convergence angle (nwJLCA) were compared between \\"control group\\" and \\"HTO group\\". Femoral and tibial phenotypes were also assessed and compared between groups. Variables found on univariate analysis to be different between the groups were entered into a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The mean age was lower (&#916; = 4  6 years, p = 0.024), body mass index (BMI) was higher (&#916; = 1.1  2.8 kg/m2, p = 0.032) and there were more females (&#916; = 14%, p = 0.020) in the HTO group. The HTO group had more overall varus (7  4.7 vs 4.8  1.3, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the mean mLDFA between the two groups with the HTO group having more femoral varus (88.7  3.2 vs 87.3  1.8, p < 0.001). MPTA was similar between the groups (p = 0.881). Age was found to be a strong determinant for femoral varus (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing HTO for medial knee OA have more femoral varus compared to non-arthritic controls while tibial morphology was similar. This will be an important consideration in pre-operating planning for realignment osteotomy in patients presenting with medial knee OA and warrants further investigation.

The purpose of this article is to describe the US inaugural event in alignment with the broader goals of WHPCD and provide lessons learned in anticipation of the second annual conference to be held on October 5-6, 2021. METHODS: Description of the inaugural event in the context of COVID-19 and WHPCD, co-planning conference team reflection, and attendee survey responses. RESULTS: The Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance initially launched WHPCD in 2005 as an annual unified day of action to celebrate and support hospice and palliative care around the world. The US-based innovative virtual conference featured 23 interprofessional hospice and palliative care specialists and patient and family caregiver speakers across nine diverse sessions addressing priorities at the intersection of COVID-19, social injustice, and the global burden of serious health-related suffering. Two primary aims guided the event: community building and wisdom sharing. Nearly 270 registrants from at least 16 countries and one dozen states across the US joined the free program focused on both personal and professional development. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Unlike many other academic conferences and professional gatherings that were relegated to online forums due to pandemic-related restrictions, the US WHPCD Celebration was intentionally established to create a virtual coming together for collective reflection on the barriers and facilitators of palliative care delivery amid vast societal change. The goal to ensure a globally relevant and culturally inclusive agenda will continue to draw increased participation at an international level during future annual events. Finally, the transparent and respectful sharing of palliative care team experiences in the year preceding the conference established a safe environment for both individual expression and scholarly discussion.","output":"The inaugural United States World Hospice and Palliative Care Day Celebration: A virtual coming together"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Internalized stigma is an ongoing process of psychological assimilation of the community labels towards mental illness, in which people with mental illness (PWMI) gradually lose their current positive belief and confidence in themselves and their future wishes. It affects the treatment and help-seeking behavior which leads to poor drug adherence, social marginalization, unemployment, socio-economic devastation, and poor quality of life for PWMI. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the magnitude and correlates of high internalized stigma among People with Mental Illness (PWMI) attending the outpatient department of Amanuel mental specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 03 to March 28, 2019. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select an estimated 406 study participants. Internalized stigma was assessed using a 29 Item Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI-29) tool. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 22 software. A Binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify correlates of internalized stigma. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the strength of association and the level of significance was declared with a p-value <0.05. RESULT: Of the total study participants, 388 respondents agreed to participate in the study giving a response rate of 96%. The magnitude of high internalized stigma among the study participants was 61.3% (95% CI: 58.2, 64.4). Poor social support (AOR = 1.973; 95%CI = 1.189, 3.27) and being unemployed (AOR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.192C6.931) were significant correlates of high internalized stigma among PWMI. CONCLUSION: Overall, around three in five PWMI experienced high internalized stigma. Poor social support and being unemployed were significant correlates of high internalized stigma. Large scale community-based study supplemented by qualitative design is highly recommended to identify additional correlates of internalized stigma and understand perspectives of PWMI.","output":"The magnitude and correlates of internalized stigma among people with mental illness attending the outpatient department of Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first report of a case of COVID\\\\19 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

However, the predictors of mortality in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are not yet well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with ICU mortality in our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-centered retrospective study, we enrolled 86 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (Izmir, Turkey) between 18 March 2020 and 31 October 2020. Data on demographic information, preexisting comorbidities, treatments, the laboratory findings at ICU admission and clinical outcomes were collected. The chest computerized tomography (CT) of the patients were evaluated specifically for COVID-19 and CT score was calculated. Data of the survivors and nonsurvivors were compared with survival analysis to identify risk factors of mortality in the ICU. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 71.114.1 years. The patients were predominantly male. The most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension. ICU mortality was 62.8%. Being over 60 years old, CT score > 15, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score ? 15, having dementia, treatment without favipiravir, base excess in blood gas analysis ? -2.0, WBC > 10000/mm3, D-dimer > 1.6 ug/mL, troponin > 24 ng/L, Na ? 145 mmol/L were considered to link with ICU mortality according to Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank test, p<0.05). APACHE II score (HR:1.055, 95%CI: 1.021-1.090) and chest CT score (HR:2.411, 95%CI:1.193-4.875) were associated with ICU mortality in the cox proportional-hazard regression model adjusted for age, dementia, favipiravir treatment and troponin. Howewer, no difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of intubation timing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have a high ICU admission and mortality rate. Studies in the ICU are also crucial in this respect. In our study, we investigated the ICU mortality risk factors of COVID-19 patients. We determined a predictive mortality model consisting of APACHE II score and chest CT score.

Several systematic reviews examining the association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19-related mortality have recently been published. Although these reviews have been conducted thoroughly, certain methodological limitations may hinder the accuracy of their research findings. Methods: A systematic literature search, using the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (from inception to July 23, 2021), was conducted for observational studies assessing the risk of death associated with COVID-19 infection in adult patients with pre-existing schizophrenia spectrum disorders, BD, or MDD. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: Of 1,446 records screened, 13 articles investigating the rates of death in patients with pre-existing SMI were included in this systematic review. Quality assessment scores of the included studies ranged from moderate to high. Most results seem to indicate that patients with SMI, particularly patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, are at significantly higher risk of COVID-19-related mortality, as compared to patients without SMI. However, the extent of the variation in COVID-19-related mortality rates between studies including people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was large because of a low level of precision of the estimated mortality outcome(s) in certain studies. Most studies on MDD and BD did not include specific information on the mood state or disease severity of patients. Due to a lack of data, it remains unknown to what extent patients with BD are at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. A variety of factors are likely to contribute to the increased mortality risk of COVID-19 in these patients. These include male sex, older age, somatic comorbidities (particularly cardiovascular diseases), as well as disease-specific characteristics. Conclusion: Methodological limitations hamper the accuracy of COVID-19-related mortality estimates for the main categories of SMIs. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that SMI is associated with excess COVID-19 mortality. Policy makers therefore must consider these vulnerable individuals as a high-risk group that should be given particular attention. This means that targeted interventions to maximize vaccination uptake among these patients are required to address the higher burden of COVID-19 infection in this already disadvantaged group.","output":"COVID-19-Related Mortality Risk in People With Severe Mental Illness: A Systematic and Critical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with unresectable esophageal cancer suffer from dysphagia, causing severe malnutrition and reduced quality of life (QOL).

Eighteen patients underwent thoracotomy, and 16 patients did not have a thoracotomy. CT was obtained to check the anastomosis and the oral stump of the esophagus and to measure the diameter of the intrathoracic esophagus. In the thoracotomy group, the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications was high. On the other hand, in the non-thoracotomy group, the rates of anastomotic leak and recurrent nerve paralysis were high. The stump of the esophagus was 2 cm lower in the T group than in the nT group. As the esophagus shortens after division, the final difference in esophageal height between the groups was only around 1 cm.

Sepsis can affect individuals of any age group, with no or multiple co-morbidities, and with many different ongoing diagnoses. It can occur as the result of infection by one or more of a multitude of microbial pathogens impacting on any of numerous different sites within the body. Given the huge complexity of sepsis and the diverse populations of patients it affects, simple definitions are of relatively little use and a more detailed framework which can be used to better characterize patients with sepsis has been proposed, much as the TNM classification (tumor size, nodal spread, metastases) has been successfully used in clinical oncology.

Care management is a common form of outpatient support for both psychiatric and medical conditions in which assessment, care planning, and care coordination are provided. Although care management is often remote and delivered by telephone, the evidence supporting this model of care is uncertain. OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review of the literature on remote care management programs for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness. METHODS A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A multi-database search was performed. Articles were included for review if they studied fully remote care management for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and chronic medical illness or poor physical health. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS A total of 6 articles representing 6 unique studies met inclusion criteria. The 6 studies included 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 case-matched retrospective cohort study, and 1 pre-post analysis. Two studies focused on specific medical conditions. All interventions were entirely telephonic. Five of 6 studies involved an intervention that was 3 to 6 months in duration. Across the 6 studies, care management demonstrated mixed results in terms of impact on psychiatric outcomes and limited impact on medical outcomes. No studies demonstrated a statistically significant impact on health care utilization or cost. CONCLUSION Among older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness, remote care management may have favorable impact on psychiatric symptoms, but impact on physical health and health care utilization is uncertain. Future research should focus on identifying effective models and elements of remote care management for this population, with a particular focus on optimizing medical outcomes.","output":"Remote care management for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has afflicted most countries on the planet.

This paper examined the cross-national variation in students depressive symptoms and whether this can be related to the various protective measures implemented in response to the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Student data stem from the COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study, covering 26 countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Country-level data on government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were retrieved from the Oxford COVID-19 Tracker. Multilevel analyses were performed to estimate the impact of the containment and economic support measures on students depressive symptoms (n = 78 312). RESULTS: School and workplace closures, and stay-at-home restrictions were positively related to students depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, while none of the economic support measures significantly related to depressive symptoms. Countries scores on the index of these containment measures explained 1.5% of the cross-national variation in students depressive symptoms (5.3%). This containment indexs effect was stable, even when controlling for the economic support index, students characteristics, and countries epidemiological context and economic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings raise concerns about the potential adverse effects of existing containment measures (especially the closure of schools and workplaces and stay-at-home restrictions) on students mental health.","output":"Depressive symptoms in higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of containment measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing rapidly, but little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of fatal cases in children in Indonesia. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of children with COVID-19 with fatal outcomes in a tertiary referral hospital in Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data collected from the medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia from March to October 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 490 patients were admitted and diagnosed with suspected and probable COVID-19. Of these patients, 50 (10.2%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, and 20 (40%) had a fatal outcome. The fatality rate was higher in patients aged &#8805;10 years, categorized with severe disease upon admission, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804;300 mmHg and chronic underlying diseases. The most common clinical manifestations were generalized symptoms, while acute respiratory distress syndrome (8/20) and septic shock (7/20) were the two most common causes of death. Increased procalcitonin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and presepsin levels were found in all fatal cases. One patient met the criteria of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. CONCLUSION: Our work highlights the high mortality rate in paediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. These findings might be related to or co-incided with COVID-19 infection.

Patients are typically observed for at least 6-8 hours after a kidney biopsy, with serial measurements of vital signs and hemoglobin to monitor for major hemorrhage. This study assessed whether an immediate postbiopsy ultrasound can reliably exclude delayed major hemorrhage. Methods We retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes in 147 patients undergoing an outpatient native kidney biopsy with an 18-gauge needle at a large medical center during a 2.5-year period (January 2017 to June 2019). All patients underwent a standardized postbiopsy ultrasound to assess for active extravasation of blood. We extracted from the medical records vital signs and hemoglobin values obtained before the biopsy and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after the procedure. We ascertained whether any patients with a negative postbiopsy ultrasound developed a delayed major hemorrhage. Results Each patient underwent two or three biopsy passes. The mean patient age was 4817 years, 49% were female, 37% were black, 53% had hypertension, and 16% had diabetes. Of the 142 patients without evidence of active extravasation on ultrasound, the BP, heart rate, and hemoglobin remained stable during 6 hours of observation. All were discharged after 6 hours, and none had a late bleeding complication. Conclusions If the immediate postkidney biopsy ultrasound does not show active bleeding, the patient is extremely unlikely to develop a late major hemorrhagic complication (negative predictive value, 100%). Such patients can be discharged home safely after a 2-hour observation, thereby simplifying their management.","output":"Value of Immediate Post-Kidney Biopsy Ultrasound in Excluding Late Hemorrhagic Complications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since COVID-19 was declared the pandemic by the WHO, it has continued to spread. There is a need for rapid, efficient, and accurate diagnostic kits and techniques to control its spread. OBJECTIVE: The diagnostic capability of the qRT-PCR-based Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection Kit and dPCR-based Dr. PCR? Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit was compared and evaluated. METHODS: Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 were performed using two different COVID-19 kits and 301 individual specimens with confirmed COVID-19 positive/negative at the government-accredited medical institution. Assessment of diagnostic capability was measured through diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, Cohens Kappa coefficient, and dilutional linearity tests. RESULTS: The COVID-19 diagnostic test results using two kits and 301 individual specimens perfectly matched the pre-diagnosis results of the medical institution. In addition, the measurement results of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 1, indicating high diagnostic capability. Cohens Kappa coefficient value is 1, which means that the diagnosis concordance between the two kits is Almost Perfect. As a result of dilutional linearity tests to evaluate their detection capability, both kits were measured with very high detection reliability. CONCLUSION: Here, we propose that the dPCR-based Dr. PCR? Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit has the advantages of the dPCR method reported in the previous study and is suitable for point-of-care testing (POCT) by overcoming the limitations of space, test time, cross-over contamination, and biosafety due to omitting RNA extraction process.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of statins use on mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to March 3, 2021. We pooled unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using random-effects models. RESULTS: Twenty-five cohort studies involving 147824 patients were included. The mean age ranged from 44.9 to 70.9 years and 57% of patients were men. The use of statins was not associated with mortality using unadjusted risk ratio (uRR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.86-1.57, 19 studies). In contrast, meta-analyses of adjusted odds ratio (aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.86, 11 studies) and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91, 10 studies) showed that statins were independently associated with a significant reduction of mortality. Subgroup analyses showed that only chronic use of statins significantly reduced mortality according to the adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins was associated with a lower risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients based on adjusted effects of cohort studies.

For over three decades, the federal government has formally recognized the impact of fishery disasters via federal declarations. Despite these impacts, national syntheses of the dynamics, impacts, and causes of fishery disasters are lacking. We developed a nationwide Federal Fishery Disaster database using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fishery disaster declarations and fishery revenue data. From 1989-2020, there were 71 federally approved fishery disasters (eleven are pending), which spanned every federal fisheries management region and coastal state in the country. To date, we estimate fishery disasters resulted in $2B (2019 USD) in Congressional allocations, and an additional, conservative estimate of $3.2B (2019 USD) in direct revenue loss. Despite this scale of impact, the disaster assistance process is largely ad hoc and lacks sufficient detail to properly assess allocation fairness and benefit. Nonetheless, fishery disasters increased in frequency over time, and the causes of disasters included a broad range of anthropogenic and environmental factors, with a recent shift to disasters now almost exclusively caused by extreme environmental events (e.g., marine heatwaves, hurricanes, and harmful algal blooms). Nationwide, 84.5% of fishery disasters were either partially or entirely attributed to extreme environmental events. As climate change drives higher rates of such extreme events, and as natural disaster assistance requests reach an all-time high, the federal system for fisheries disaster declaration and mitigation must evolve in order to effectively protect both fisheries sustainability and societal benefit.","output":"The rise in climate change-induced federal fishery disasters in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many medical schools have transitioned to teaching anatomy with prosections and models1. The efficacy of these curricular approaches as they compare to the gold standard of dissection anatomy has been evaluated2. In addition to helping students acquire professional competencies3, students who participate in dissection achieve higher scores on written examinations than students who participate in prosection1,4. Dissection helps students develop integrated three-dimensional models of the human body, which is fundamental to clinical practice2. In a typical year, medical students at our university take Clinical Morphology which includes histology, embryology, imaging, and dissection anatomy. In 2020, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory access was significantly restricted, requiring a shift to a prosection and virtual learning hybrid model. All other components of the course were retained. This necessary change in curriculum provided a natural experiment to investigate the impact of eliminating dissection anatomy on students? academic performance. We hypothesized a negative impact. Students in the 2020 cohort worked in small groups to complete a weekly two-hour online simulated dissection, and attended an optional weekly in-person prosection lab. Faculty-produced prosection videos were available to view asynchronously. Virtual office hours were held in the laboratory. In contrast, the 2019 cohort participated in a traditional dissection anatomy lab that included six hours of instructor-supported dissection each week and 24-hour lab access. All other course components were comparable. Respectively, for the 2020 and 2019 cohorts, mean quiz scores were 86.2 and 85.6;lab practical averages were 92.5 and 86.3;mean NBME scores were 80.9 and 82.2;and course numeric score means were 84.7 and 84.8 (no significant differences, t-test). The frequency of passing and failing scores followed a similar pattern with no differences identified between the two cohorts (Chi Square). All 2020 students had a passing average for lab practicals;significantly better than the 2019 cohort (p &lt; 0.05, Chi Square). Pairwise Pearson r correlation coefficients showed a strong relationship (r &gt; 0.75) for quiz, NBME, and lab practical scores in the 2019 cohort. For the 2020 cohort, there was a strong relationship (r = 0.72) only for quiz and NBME scores. Dissection anatomy correlates strongly with quizzes and the NBME exam performance, while virtual-prosection anatomy does not. The lack of strong pairwise correlations between virtual anatomy with either NBME or quiz performance suggest that the virtual-prosection model did not align well with academic objectives. These data support the continued inclusion of dissection in medical school anatomy. 1. Eppler E, Serowy S, Link K, Filgueira L. Anat Sci Educ. 2018;11:32-43. doi:10.1002/ase.1707 2.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether patients maintain their treatment for rheumatic conditions during the pandemic period and determine the factors responsible for discontinuation. METHODS: Patients were randomly selected from the prospectively collected database of our tertiary referral center. The patients were interviewed by telephone through a standardized closed-ended questionnaire, which is targeting the continuity of the treatment plan and the considerations related to the individual choice. The patients were asked whether they hesitated to visit the hospital for follow-up or intravenous drug administration. RESULTS: A total of 278 patients completed the questionnaire. While 62 of the patients (22.3%) had reduced or interrupted the treatment, only 11 patients (3.9%) stopped the treatment completely. A significant difference was observed between the duration of illness and the discontinuation of treatment. (p = 0.023) There was a significant difference in disease activity between the group that stopped treatment and continued treatment. (p = 0.001) There was no statistically significant difference in other demographic characteristics. One hundred thirty-five patients (48.6%) made the treatment decision by themselves, and 80% continued the treatment. Reasons for stopping the treatment were anxiety (48.4%), not being able to go to the hospital for intravenous treatment (45.1%), and not being able to find the drug (6.5%).

Relevant policy implications are discussed. For instance, to better prepare Native American communities for shocking events like the COVID-19 pandemic in the future, policymaking should integrate informal institutions to build efficient formal institutions for self-governance.

A higher BMI value increases the risk factor for critical diseases, e.g., high blood pressure (hypertension), cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease, type 2 diabetes, etc. Obesity also increases the risk factor of COVID-19 in patients. BMI, the ratio of mass (in kilogram) to the square of height (in meter), is an estimation of an individual's physique. It depends upon the adults height and mass and is intended to evaluate the tissue mass. In this article, we have described the design and developmental aspects of a temperature-compensated BMI measuring system. The developed BMI measuring system is comprised of an ultrasonic sensor for height measurement, strain gauge-based load cell for precise and accurate mass measurement, a temperature sensor to eliminate the effect of temperature, and a microcontroller with related electronics, software, and display system. The developed BMI system is capable to measure mass precisely in the range (0C200) kg with a resolution of 0.01 kg, and height in the range of (0C4) m with resolution of 0.01 m. The expanded uncertainty in height measurement is estimated as 2.8 mm. The BMI value is determined with the help of these parameters and displayed with precision of 0.01.

There is limited data on risk factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) infection among HCWs. Aim: To evaluate the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs of tertiary care hospitals in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire based crosssectional study was conducted among 801 HCWs from three tertiary care hospitals. Data regarding demography, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, immunosuppressive therapy, asthma), symptoms, contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and protective precautions at the work place was collected. Infection diagnosed by Respiratory Tract samples-Reverse Trancriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test was correlated with the above factors. Results: Of the participants, 50.1% were working in designated COVID-19 area;85.1% had no co-morbidity. A total of 62 of the 801 (7.75%) HCWs had a history of positive RT-PCR for SARSCoV-2. Only asthma was associated with a significant higher in infection rate. Loss of taste/smell (30%), acute febrile illness (46.4%), acute respiratory illness (18.5%) were more common in persons with RT-PCR positivity (p&lt;0.05). Visit to fever clinic, positive household member, and a definite history of exposure to a COVID-19 positive patient, were significantly associated with higher risk of infection. Working in designated COVID-19 hospital was not a significant risk factor (8.5% vs 5.6%). HCWs on Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis had significantly lower rate of infection. Conclusion: Rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among HCWs was 7.7%. Presence of symptoms, especially, loss of taste/smell, fever and respiratory symptoms are associated with high positive rates. Working in a designated COVID hospital was not a risk factor for increased rate of infection. HCQ prophylaxis is associated with reduced rate of COVID-19 among HCWs.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess health care workers knowledge and practice of proper face mask utilization to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection in Amhara region referral hospitals, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional institutional-based quantitative study design was conducted from May 15 to 30/2020 using pre-tested self-administrated questionnaire and analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. The study included 422 health care providers, and the sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula with the assumption of a p value of 0.05. Data were collected using a consecutive sampling technique from all referral hospitals and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Finally, the outcome was presented in the form of a text and a table. RESULTS: The overall knowledge and practice of health care providers regarding proper face mask utilization were 278 (65.8%) and 252 (59.5%), respectively.

The prominence of corporate-sponsored foodbanking as a containment response to pandemic-aggravated food insecurity follows decades of replacing rights with charity. We review structural drivers of charitys growth to prominence as a hunger solution in North America, and of its spread to countries including the UK. By highlighting pre-pandemic pressures shaping foodbanking, including charities efforts to retool themselves as health providers, we ask whether anti-hunger efforts during the pandemic serve to contain ongoing socioeconomic crises and the unjust living conditions they cause, or contest them through transformative pathways to a just food system. We suggest that pandemic-driven philanthropic and state funding flows have bolstered foodbanking and the food system logics that support it. By contextualising the complex and variegated politics of foodbanking in broader movements, from community food security to food sovereignty, we reframe simplistic narratives of charity and highlight the need for justice-oriented structural changes in wealth redistribution and food system organisation if we are to prevent the kinds of emergency-within-emergency that we witnessed as COVID-19 revealed the proximity of many to hunger.","output":"Containing Hunger, Contesting Injustice?

The SARS-COV-2 pandemic further exacerbates this problem of the adequacy of the immune response to vaccination of obese people. The purpose of this review is to present and summarize information on the changes in various links of cellular and humoral immunity in the experiment and in the clinic during the immune response to vaccination in obesity. Results. The mechanisms of action of obesity and associated chronic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation on the post-vaccination immune response in various infections are discussed. The systemic inflammatory response that occurs in obesity represents a barrier to the induction of a sustained immune response. In obese individuals, innate and adaptive immune responses are slowed down and diminished, contributing to the spread of infections. Conclusion. In obesity, the differentiation and proliferation of cells of the immune system is impaired, and the immune response to vaccination changes. Further research is needed to study post-vaccination immunity in obesity, taking into account the effect on the vaccination of the microbiota of a particular person, the presence of possible comorbid conditions.","output":"[Possible mechanisms of impaired post-vaccination immune response in obesity]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undetected infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contributes to transmission in nursing homes, settings where large outbreaks with high resident mortality have occurred (1,2). Facility-wide testing of residents and health care personnel (HCP) can identify asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections and facilitate infection prevention and control interventions (3-5). Seven state or local health departments conducted initial facility-wide testing of residents and staff members in 288 nursing homes during March 24-June 14, 2020. Two of the seven health departments conducted testing in 195 nursing homes as part of facility-wide testing all nursing homes in their state, which were in low-incidence areas (i.e., the median preceding 14-day cumulative incidence in the surrounding county for each jurisdiction was 19 and 38 cases per 100,000 persons); 125 of the 195 nursing homes had not reported any COVID-19 cases before the testing. Ninety-five of 22,977 (0.4%) persons tested in 29 (23%) of these 125 facilities had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The other five health departments targeted facility-wide testing to 93 nursing homes, where 13,443 persons were tested, and 1,619 (12%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. In regression analyses among 88 of these nursing homes with a documented case before facility-wide testing occurred, each additional day between identification of the first case and completion of facility-wide testing was associated with identification of 1.3 additional cases. Among 62 facilities that could differentiate results by resident and HCP status, an estimated 1.3 HCP cases were identified for every three resident cases. Performing facility-wide testing immediately after identification of a case commonly identifies additional unrecognized cases and, therefore, might maximize the benefits of infection prevention and control interventions. In contrast, facility-wide testing in low-incidence areas without a case has a lower proportion of test positivity; strategies are needed to further optimize testing in these settings.","output":"Facility-Wide Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes - Seven U.S. Jurisdictions, March-June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Hokkaido medical personnel training plan connecting humans and medicine aims to train\\"Medical personnel for genome medicine\\",\\" Medical personnel for rare cancer and childhood cancer\\", and\\"Medical personnel who promote cancer measures according to patient's life stage\\".

Phenotypic, developmental, and functional aspects of these cells in steady state and in different diseases are the focus of this review. Recently it has become evident that KC precursors seed the liver already early in fetal development, and the population can be maintained independently from circulating monocytes. However, inflammatory conditions allow rapid differentiation of monocytes into mature cells that are indistinguishable from genuine KC. KC are located in the lumen of sinusoids that receive blood both from the portal vein, carrying nutrients and microbial products from the gut, and from the hepatic artery. This positions KC ideally for their prime function, namely surveillance and clearance of the circulation. As such, they are important in iron recycling by phagocytosing effete erythrocytes, for instance. The immunophenotype of KC, characterized by a wide variety of endocytic receptors, is indicative of this scavenger function. In maintaining homeostasis, KC have an ambivalent response to exogenous triggers. On the one hand, their surveillance function requires alert responses to potentially hazardous substances. On the other hand, continuous exposure of the cells to the trigger-rich content of blood originating from the gut dampens their responsiveness to further stimuli. This ambivalence is also reflected in their diverse roles in disease pathogenesis. For the latter, we sketch the contribution of KC by giving examples of their role in metabolic disease, infections, and liver injury.","output":"Kupffer Cells in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop an automatic control system to help to design efficient mitigation measures for the Covid-19 epidemic in cities. Taking into account parameters associated to the population of each city and the mobility among them, the optimal control framework suggests the level and duration of protective measures that must be implemented to ensure that the number of infected individuals is within a range that avoids the collapse of the health care system. Compared against other mitigation measures that are implemented simultaneously and in equal strength across cities our method has three major particularities when: Accounts for city commute and health infrastructure: It takes into account the daily commute among cities to estimate the dynamics of infected people while keeping the number of infected people within a desired level at each city avoiding the collapse of its health care system. City-specific control: It allows for orchestrating the control measures among cities so as to prevent all cities to face the same level control. The model tends to induce alternation between periods of stricter controls and periods of a more normal life in each city and among the cities. Flexible scenarios: It is flexible enough to allow for simulating the impact of particular actions. For example, one can simulate the how the control all cities change when the number of care beds increases in specific places. Therefore, our method creates an automatic dance adjusting mitigation levels within cities and alternating among cities as suggested in~cite{Pue2020}. This automatic dance may help the city economy and orchestration of resources. We provide case studies using the major cities of the state of Sao Paulo given by using estimates on the daily mobility among the cities their health care system capacity. We use official data in our case studies. However, sub-notification of infected people in Brazil is notoriously high. Hence the case study should not be considered as a real world policy suggestion. It high sub-notification is taken into account, the optimal control algorithm will suggest stricter mitigation measures, as also shown in the case studies. Surprisingly, the total duration of the protocol for the state is barely affected by the sub-notification, but the severity of such protocols is strengthened. This stresses a twofold implication, first, the protocol depends on high-quality data and, second, such optimal and orchestrated protocol is robust and can be adjusted to the demand.","output":"Robot dance: a city-wise automatic control of Covid-19 mitigation levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To model the healthcare impact (clinical attendance time and financial cost) and clinical outcomes (glaucoma diagnoses) of different risk factorCdriven review frequencies for glaucoma suspect patients up until the point of discharge or diagnosis. METHODS: Medical records of 494 glaucoma suspects were examined to extract the clinical diagnosis. Two criteria for review periods were defined, based on contrasting stringency from established clinical guidelines: American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), more stringent/less frequent; and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), less stringent/more frequent. We used these data to model patient outcomes and healthcare costs using a Markov model. RESULTS: The less stringent/more frequent criterion resulted in more high-risk glaucoma suspects requiring more frequent review compared with the more stringent/less frequent criterion. Across the 15 Markov cycles (7.5 years), the less stringent/more frequent review criterion resulted in 6.6% more diagnoses and fewer overall clinical visits (14.7%) and reduced cost per diagnosis by 12% to 32% (P < 0.0001). The number of glaucoma diagnoses made using each criterion converged at 2.5 to 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The stringency of risk assessments for glaucoma suspects impacts review periods and therefore clinical load, healthcare costs, and diagnosis rates. Using current testing methods, more frequent review periods appear advantageous for diagnostic efficiency, with both lower clinic load and lower cost up until the point of discharge or glaucoma diagnosis. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: A less stringent criterion for assessing the risk of developing glaucoma potentially offers a more cost-effective method for reviewing glaucoma suspects, especially within the first 2.5 years.","output":"Glaucoma Suspects: The Impact of Risk Factor-Driven Review Periods on Clinical Load, Diagnoses, and Healthcare Costs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of the Vaccine Innovation Prioritisation Strategy (VIPS), three immunization-stakeholder consultations were conducted between September 2018 and February 2020 to ensure that countries needs drove the prioritization of vaccine product innovations. All consultations targeted respondents with immunization program experience. They included: (1) an online survey to identify immunization implementation barriers and desired vaccine attributes in three use settings, (2) an online survey to identify and evaluate the most important immunization challenges for ten exemplar vaccines, and (3) in-depth interviews to better understand the perceived programmatic benefits and challenges that could be addressed by nine innovations and to rank the innovations that could best address current challenges. The first consultation included responses from 442 participants in 61 countries, representing 89% of the 496 respondents who correctly completed at least one section of the online survey. For facility-based settings, missed opportunities for vaccination due to reluctance to open multidose vaccine vials was the barrier most frequently selected by respondents. In community-based (outreach) and campaign settings, limited access to immunization services due to geographic barriers was most frequently selected. Multidose presentations with preservative or single-dose presentations were most frequently selected as desired vaccine attributes for facility-based settings while improved thermostability was most frequently selected for outreach and campaign settings. The second online survey was completed by 220 respondents in 54 countries. For the exemplar vaccines, vaccine ineffectiveness or wastage due to heat or freeze exposure and missed opportunities due to multidose vial presentations were identified as the greatest vaccine-specific challenges. In-depth interviews with 84 respondents in six countries ranked microarray patches, dual-chamber delivery devices, and heat-stable/controlled temperature chain qualified liquid vaccines as the three innovations that could have the greatest impact in helping address current immunization program challenges.

Despite their high risk of stroke and clear indication for anticoagulation according to established risk scores, in practice geriatric AF patients often are withheld treatment because of comorbidities and comedications, concerns about low treatment adherence or fear of bleeding events, in particular due to falls. METHOD The present position paper summarises the outcomes of an expert panel discussion held by hospital-based and office-based physicians with ample experience in the treatment of geriatric patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The panel agreed that geriatric patients should receive oral anticoagulation as a rule, unless a comprehensive neurological and geriatric assessment (including clinical examination, gait tests and validated instruments such as Modified Rankin Scale, Mini-mental state examination or Timed Test of Money Counting) provides sound reasons for refraining from treatment AII patients with a history of falls should be thoroughly evaluated for further evaluation of the causes. Patients with CHADS2 score  2 should receive anticoagulation even if at high risk for falls.

Despite these intensive research efforts, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation in many countries present substantial obstacles to achieving sufficient coverage and community immunity. Here, we report the findings of a survey regarding the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a sample of physicians in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous web-based survey was prepared and sent to medical doctors randomly selected from seven parts of Turkey via a text message sent to their mobile phones. Demographic data were collected, including sex (male or female), medical specialty, age, professional experience, COVID-19 history, knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines and behaviours related to vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases. The survey was conducted over a 1-week period in December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,557 medical doctors responded to the survey. A total of 1,065 (68.4%) respondents were considering COVID-19 vaccination, 374 (24%) were undecided and 118 (7.6%) did not want to be vaccinated. As a result of multivariate analysis, the male gender, absence of history of COVID-19 infection, and having sufficient information about the vaccine were determined as predictive factors for willingness to vaccination.

The aim of this study was to describe the COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain, how they managed the disease at home, focusing on differences by age, as well as differences in knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices, compared with the uninfected population. DESIGN: An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of individuals who were 14 years or older living in Spain during the COVID-19 lockdown. The main variable was a COVID-19 case. Logistic regression models for COVID-19 cases were obtained using a backward stepwise procedure to assess the association between social variables, disease knowledge, attitudes, prevention practices and emotional impact. RESULTS: 3398 people completed the survey. Participants' mean age was 49.6 (SD=14.3). COVID-19 was significantly more prevalent among married people (5.3%) and those currently doing an on-site work (8.7%). Most of the COVID-19 cases stayed at home (84.0%) during the episode. There were significant age-based differences with regard to self-isolation conditions at home during the disease. COVID-19 cases showed better attitudes, practices and knowledge about disease symptoms and transmission than the uninfected population. COVID-19 cases also felt more depressed (adjusted OR: 3.46, 95% CI 1.45 to 8.26) and had better preventive behaviour than the uninfected population, such as always wearing a mask outside the home (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.30). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 cases found it difficult to comply with recommended home self-isolation conditions, with differences by age group. COVID-19 had an important impact on care dependency in non-hospitalised patients, who were mostly dependent on their families for care.

In this work, we propose a network approach to model the implementation of a partial lockdown, breaking the society into disconnected components, or partitions. Our model is composed by two main ingredients: a multiplex network representing human contacts within different contexts, formed by a Household layer, a Work layer, and a third Social layer including generic social interactions, and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process that mimics the epidemic spreading. We compare different partition strategies, with a twofold aim: reducing the epidemic outbreak and minimizing the economic cost associated to the partial lockdown. We also show that the inclusion of unconstrained social interactions dramatically increases the epidemic spreading, while different kinds of restrictions on social interactions help in keeping the benefices of the network partition.","output":"Modeling partial lockdowns in multiplex networks using partition strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the Thai government's politicised COVID-19 containment strategies, which have been challenged by Thai protesters.

By supplementing securitisation theory with social-conflict theory, we have found that the roles of securitising actors and audiences are not fixed. In our case study of Thailand, the Thai government and protesters have played two roles simultaneously: the role of a securitising actor and the role of an audience.

However, little is known about the difference in antibody responses induced by these two mRNA vaccines in na?ve and previously infected (PI) individuals. METHOD: We investigated the levels of anti-S-RBD (total, IgG and IgA) levels in na?ve and PI individuals, 1C13 (median = 6) weeks following the second dose of either vaccine. Results in the na?ve-vaccinated group, the mRNA-1273 vaccine induced significantly higher levels of anti-S-RBD total antibodies (3.5-fold; P < 0.001), IgG (2-fold, P < 0.01) and IgA (2.1-fold, P < 0.001) as compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine. In addition, both vaccines produced significantly higher anti-S-RBD total antibody levels in the PI-group compared with na?ve-vaccinated group. The PI group elicited a higher level of anti-S-RBD IgG than the na?ve-BNT162b2 (P = 0.05), but not more than the na?ve-mRNA-1273 (P = 0.9) group. Interestingly, the PI vaccinated group elicited a comparable level of IgA ratio to the na?ve-mRNA-1273 group but significantly higher than the na?ve-BNT162b2 group (1.6-fold, P < 0.001).

The purpose of our study was to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and use of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of patients with COVID-19 through the hospital system in Ontario. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and hospital health care capacity. Our outcomes included the number of patients who needed admission to the ward or to the intensive care unit (ICU) with or without the need for mechanical ventilation, number of days to resource depletion, number of patients awaiting resources and number of deaths. RESULTS: We found that with effective early public health measures, hospital system resources would not be depleted. For scenarios with late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, hospital resources would be depleted within 14-26 days, and in the worst case scenario, 13 321 patients would die while waiting for needed resources. Resource depletion would be avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to increase ICU, ventilator and acute care hospital capacities. INTERPRETATION: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures, the Ontario hospital system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19 despite a rapid increase in capacity. This lack of hospital resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease using public health measures and by increasing hospital capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its hospitals.","output":"Estimation of COVID-19-induced depletion of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has been gaining popularity over the last decades.

Nevertheless, it is unclear if they present better decontamination effectiveness than traditional mercury vapor lamps. Hence, this research uses a systematic literature review (SLR) to enlighten three aspects: (1) UVC LEDs application according to the field, (2) UVC LEDs application in terms of different biological indicators, and (3) the decontamination effectiveness of UVC LEDs in comparison to conventional lamps. UVC LEDs have spread across multiple areas, ranging from health applications to wastewater or food decontamination. The UVC LEDs decontamination effectiveness is as good as mercury vapor lamps. In some cases, LEDs even provide better results than conventional mercury vapor lamps. However, the increase in the targets complexity (e.g., multilayers or thicker individual layers) may reduce the UVC decontamination efficacy.

The aim was to explore symptoms of depression and anxiety in young adults over 5 years' follow-up after undergoing MBS. METHODS Beck Depression Inventory-2 and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in 62 patients 1, 2, and 5 years after having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 13-18 years of age. Mental health, eating-related problems, and weight outcomes were tested for association with suicidal ideation at the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS At the 5-year follow-up, the mean score for depression was 11.4 ( 12.4), indicating minimal symptoms of depression. The mean score for anxiety was 12.82 ( 11.50), indicating mild anxiety symptoms. Still, several participants reported moderate or severe symptoms of depression (26%) and anxiety (32%). Women reported more symptoms than men (P = 0.03 and 0.04). No significant changes were found in self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety between the 1-year and the 5-year follow-up (P = 0.367 and 0.934). Suicidal ideation was reported by 16% at the 5-year follow-up. Participants reporting suicidal ideation had lost significantly less excess weight than participants without suicidal ideation (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION Five years after adolescent MBS, a substantial minority still struggles with mental health issues, and women are more burdened than men. Our results indicate an association between less optimal weight loss and suicidal ideation 5 years after MBS.

However, with rapid increases in international travel, globalization, geographic spread of viral vectors, and widespread use of vaccines, there is an increasing need to consider how pre-exposure to viruses which share similar antigenic regions can impact vaccine efficacy. Pre-existing antibodies, derived from either from maternalCfetal transmission, or by previous infection or vaccination, have been demonstrated to interfere with vaccine immunogenicity of measles, adenovirus, and influenza LAVs. Immune interference of LAVs can be caused by the formation of virusCantibody complexes that neutralize virus infection in antigen-presenting cells, or by the cross-linking of the B-cell receptor with the inhibitory receptor, FcRIIB. On the other hand, pre-existing antibodies can augment flaviviral LAV efficacy such as that of dengue and yellow fever virus, especially when pre-existing antibodies are present at sub-neutralizing levels. The increased vaccine immunogenicity can be facilitated by antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection, enhancing virus uptake in antigen-presenting cells, and robust induction of innate immune responses that promote vaccine immunogenicity. This review examines the literature on this topic and examines the circumstances where pre-existing antibodies can inhibit or enhance LAV efficacy. A better knowledge of the underlying mechanisms involved could allow us to better manage immunization in seropositive individuals and even identify possibilities that could allow us to exploit pre-existing antibodies to boost vaccine-induced responses for improved vaccine efficacy.","output":"The Effects of Pre-Existing Antibodies on Live-Attenuated Viral Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The demand for water is increasing due to its finite availability and a water-dependent world whose population is growing every day.

The complete solution is validated using independently measured mobility data and accurate predictions of COVID-19 case dynamics in multiple countries. It replicates the observed phenomenology, quantitates pandemic dynamics, and provides simple analytical tools for policy makers. Of particular note, it projects that increased social containment measures shorten an epidemic and reduce the ultimate number of cases and deaths. In contrast, the widely used Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) models, based on an approximation to Kermack and McKendricks original equations, project that strong containment measures delay the peak in daily infections, causing a longer epidemic. These projections contradict both the complete solution and the observed phenomenology in COVID-19 pandemic data. The closed-form solution elucidates that the two parameters classically used as constants in approximate SIR models cannot, in fact, be reasonably assumed to be constant in real epidemics. This prima facie failure forces the conclusion that the approximate SIR models should not be used to characterize or manage epidemics. As a replacement to the SIR models, the closed-form solution and the expressions derived from the solution form a complete set of analytical tools that can accurately diagnose the state of an epidemic and provide proper guidance for public health decision makers.","output":"CHARACTERIZING AND MANAGING AN EPIDEMIC: A FIRST PRINCIPLES MODEL AND A CLOSED FORM SOLUTION TO THE KERMACK AND MCKENDRICK EQUATIONS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: One of the most significant challenges currently facing businesses is the loss of revenue as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders Businesses across all sectors are incurring losses, and those with business interruption insurance (BI) are submitting claims to their insurers However, both individual insurance carriers and the industry as a whole have asserted that BI claims related to COVID-19 are not covered, either because there has been no physical damage to the property or because the policy expressly excludes coverage for viruses, or both More detail on BI insurance can be found in CRS [Congressional Research Service] Insight IN11295, 'Business Interruption Insurance and COVID-19 ' Insurance companies are regulated by states;the role of the federal government in regulating private insurance (other than health insurance) is more limited COVID-19 (Disease);Business insurance","output":"Business Interruption Insurance and COVID-19: State Legislative Initiatives [May 11, 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to examine the mediating role of depressed and anxious mood in the relationship between perceived social isolation and perceived sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

They form new alliances for sustainable transformation in the agri-food sector. Simultaneously, discourse has arisen in science and practice about the sustainability potential of such hybrid cooperation, referring to a lack of critical systematization and the necessity for creating an assessment concept. From the latter, one could draw conclusions about the transformative potential of such cooperation models and their potential to serve as blueprints for other regions. In this conceptual paper, a classification approach derived from social enterprise literature is elaborated, extended, and evaluated, to design a classification of new hybrid cooperation models that allow comparisons between regions and are sensitive to their dynamics.

Various national apps with different technical design features have been commissioned and issued by governments worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop and propose an item set that was suitable for describing and monitoring nationally issued COVID-19 contact tracing apps. This item set could provide a framework for describing the key technical features of such apps and monitoring their use based on widely available information. METHODS: We used an open-source intelligence approach (OSINT) to access a multitude of publicly available sources and collect data and information regarding the development and use of contact tracing apps in different countries over several months (from June 2020 to January 2021). The collected documents were then iteratively analyzed via content analysis methods. During this process, an initial set of subject areas were refined into categories for evaluation (ie, coherent topics), which were then examined for individual features. These features were paraphrased as items in the form of questions and applied to information materials from a sample of countries (ie, Brazil, China, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom [England and Wales]). This sample was purposefully selected; our intention was to include the apps of different countries from around the world and to propose a valid item set that can be relatively easily applied by using an OSINT approach. RESULTS: Our OSINT approach and subsequent analysis of the collected documents resulted in the definition of the following five main categories and associated subcategories: (1) background information (open-source code, public information, and collaborators); (2) purpose and workflow (secondary data use and warning process design); (3) technical information (protocol, tracing technology, exposure notification system, and interoperability); (4) privacy protection (the entity of trust and anonymity); and (5) availability and use (release date and the number of downloads). Based on this structure, a set of items that constituted the evaluation framework were specified. The application of these items to the 10 selected countries revealed differences, especially with regard to the centralization of the entity of trust and the overall transparency of the apps' technical makeup. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a set of criteria for monitoring and evaluating COVID-19 tracing apps that can be easily applied to publicly issued information. The application of these criteria might help governments to identify design features that promote the successful, widespread adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps among target populations and across national boundaries.","output":"Analyzing the Essential Attributes of Nationally Issued COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: Open-Source Intelligence Approach and Content Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), creates a diagnostic vacuum, since differentiation of Omicron from Delta relies on relatively slow next generation sequencing (NGS) technology delaying epidemiologic understanding and therapeutic intervention.

RESULTS: The analysis revealed that calls were of a longer duration in the postlockdown period in comparison with the preCCOVID-19 period. There were changes in the behavior of individuals in the cluster types defined by caller behavior, where some caller types tended to make longer calls to the service in the postlockdown period. There were also changes in caller behavior patterns with regard to the time of day of the call; variations were observed in the duration of calls at particular times of day, where average call durations increased in the early hours of the morning. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on a national crisis helpline service. Statistical differences were observed in caller behavior between the prelockdown and active lockdown periods. The findings suggest that service users relied on crisis helpline services more during the lockdown period due to an increased sense of isolation, worsening of underlying mental illness due to the pandemic, and reduction or overall removal of access to other support resources. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.","output":"Behavior of Callers to a Crisis Helpline Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the pandemic gripping the entire humanity and with uncertainty hovering like a black cloud over all our future sustainability and growth, it became almost apparent that though the development and advancement are at their peak, we are still not ready for the worst.

Drawing on interviews and media data, this study fills this gap by examining Health Code (jiankangma), the Chinese contact tracing and risk assessment algorithmic system that serves as the COVID-19 health passport. I first explore the intensive and invisible work and infrastructures that enact and stabilize Health Codes sociotechnical assemblage. I then show how this assemblage is frequently challenged and destabilized by errors, breakdowns, and exclusions. Facing unintended engagements from heterogeneous social actors, local interests, and power hierarchies, Health Code reassembles into multiple and contradictory assemblages at different periods and social localities. Finally, I examine how people game and bypass the algorithms surveillance with their agencies. Recognizing this messiness and heterogeneity contributes to a more nuanced and realistic understanding of states use of algorithms, including the risks.

To find this balance, we have developed the HUBDesign pipeline, which makes use of sequence homology to design probes at multiple taxonomic levels. This creates an efficient probe set capable of simultaneously and specifically capturing known and related sequences. We validated HUBDesign by generating probe sets targeting the breadth of coronavirus diversity, as well as a suite of bacterial pathogens often underlying sepsis.

The main model we use is SIR which is a classical model, but because we can not fully trust the numbers of infected or recovered we base our analysis on the number of deceased people which is more reliable. To actually deal with this we introduce a simple modification of the SIR model to account for the deceased separately. This in turn will be our base for fitting the parameters. The estimation of the parameters is done in two steps. The first one consists in training a neural network based on SIR models to detect the regime changes. Once this is done we fit the main parameters of the SIRD model using a grid search.

Although information and communication technologies were essential for achieving this objective, the extent to which health systems incorporated this technology is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To map the use of digital health strategies in primary health care worldwide and their impact on quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review based on the Joanna Briggs Institute manual and guided by PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. A systematic and comprehensive three-step search was performed in June and July 2021 in multidisciplinary health science databases and gray literature. Data extraction and eligibility were performed by two independent authors and interpreted using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Forty-four studies were included, and six thematic groups were identified: characterization and geographic distribution of studies; nomenclatures of digital strategies adopted; types of information and communication technologies; characteristics of digital strategies in primary health care; impacts on quality of care; and benefits, limitations, and challenges of digital strategies in primary health care. The impacts on organization of quality of care were investigated by most studies and strengthened (1) continuity of care; (2) economic, social, geographical, time, and cultural accessibility; (3) coordination of care; (4) access; (5) integrality of care; (6) optimization of appointment time; (7) and efficiency. Negative impacts were also observed in the same dimension, such as reduced access to services and increased inequity and unequal use of services offered, digital exclusion of part of the population, lack of planning for defining the role of professionals, disarticulation of actions with real needs of the population, fragile articulation between remote and face-to-face modalities, and unpreparedness of professionals to meet demands using of technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed the positive and negative impacts of remote strategies on quality of care in primary care and the inability to take advantage of the potential of technologies. This may demonstrate differences in organization of fast and urgent implementation of digital strategies in primary health care worldwide. Primary health care must strengthen its response capacity, expand the use of information and communication technologies, and manage challenges using scientific evidence since digital health is important and must be integrated into public service.","output":"Digital health opportunities to improve Primary Health Care in the context of COVID-19: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health centers are located in each municipality in Japan and are responsible for infectious disease control including COVID-19. Public health nurses (PHNs) are stationed at the centers and work at the forefront, covering a variety of services from individual consultations to hospital escort for those tested positive. Starting January, PHNs at A city (population approx. 210,000) established a free telephone consultation hotline for COVID-19. This study aims to review the PHNs telephone consultations during the first wave of COVID-19. The number of calls were aggregated weekly and their time-trend was examined. The study was approved by the University of Tokyo Ethics Review Board. During the first wave between January and May, there were 3,242 calls, with the highest number of calls (n=491/week) in the second week of April. At this point the regular PHNs were not enough to meet the hightened needs of consultations and PHNs from other departments were temporalily transferred for support. The number of consultation calls fluctuated weekly. The increase of calls seemed to preceed the increase of positive cases by one week. We consider that the call may be an initial action of those who suspected possible infection, and the consultation by the PHN might have led them to proper clinic visits and PCR testing. Telephone consultation is an easy tool to use for general public, especially older persons.

Material and Method: In this multicentric retrospective study, a total of 269 adult patients (18 years of age) with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized for the treatment were enrolled. Demographic features, complete medical history, and laboratory findings of the study participants at admission were obtained from the medical records. Patients were grouped regarding their ICU requirements during their hospitalization periods. Results: Among all 269 participants, 106 were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 66 died. The patients hospitalized in ICU were older than patients hospitalized in wards (p=0.001) and expired patients were older than alive patients (p=0.001). Age, elevated serum D-dimer, creatinine, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels at admission were independent factors predicting ICU hospitalization and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: In conclusion, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, laboratory data on admission, including serum, creatinine, GGT and d-dimer levels have an important predictive role for the ICU requirement and mortality.

High transmissibility and contagious nature of the virus helps it to flourish in a large population. The immune system aids to retain the virus, but with accelerated cytokine secretion, it could transform into double edge sword resulting in unrestrained systemic inflammation which might become life-threatening. SARS-CoV-2 sets substantial impact on T-lymphocytes during its course of infection. The number of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and Treg cells tend to decrease profoundly in case of severe illness. Besides, the virus modulates the CD4+ T/ CD8+ T and Treg/Th17 cells ratio and induces the functional exhaustion of T cells to make them inefficient. T cells define the pathogenesis of severe cases and provide major contributions in antiviral defense.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the adverse initial CT features to predict poor prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS: From February to April 2020, 281 COVID-19 patients who underwent CT at the time of admission were included. We divided the patients into the severe and non-severe disease groups. The severe group included patients with severe pneumonia or critical events. Intensive care unit admission or death were the critical events in this study. We compared the clinical and CT findings between the severe and non-severe groups and investigated the prognostic factors and critical events of the severe group using the regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 281 patients, 36 (12.8%) patients were in the severe group and 245 (87.2%) patients were in the non-severe group. Critical events occurred in 10 patients (3.6%). In the severe group, patients showed significantly more pneumonia with consolidation, crazy-paving appearance, pleural effusion, and higher CT scores than those in the non-severe group (all, P < 0.05).

The predominant approaches developed use PCR to detect viral nucleic acids or immunoassays to detect viral proteins. Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages, but alternatives that do not share the same limitations could enable substantial improvements in outbreak detection and management. For instance, methods that have comparable sensitivity to PCR, but that are not prone to the false-positive results that stem from the tendency of PCR to detect molecular degradation products could improve accurate identification of infected individuals. An alternative approach with potential to achieve this entails harnessing the unique enzymatic properties of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes to generate SARS-Cov-2-specific signals that indicate the presence of the virus. This route benefits from the high sensitivity provided by enzymatic signal amplification and also the fact that signal is generated only by intact viral enzymes, not degradation products. Here, we demonstrate enzymatic reaction conditions that enable the preferential detection of NendoU of SARS-CoV-2, versus several of its orthologues, with a fluorogenic oligonucleotide substrate.

Although genome structure of SAV has been characterized and each individual viral protein has been identified, the role of 6K protein in viral replication and infectivity remains undefined. The 6K protein of alphaviruses is a small and hydrophobic protein which is involved in membrane permeabilization, protein processing and virus budding. Because these common features are shared across many viral species, they have been named viroporins. In the present study, we applied reverse genetics to generate SAV3 6K-deleted (6K) variant and investigate the role of 6K protein. Our findings show that the 6K-deletion variant of salmonid alphavirus is non-viable. Despite viral proteins of 6K variant are detected in the cytoplasm by immunostaining, they are not found on the cell surface. Further, analysis of viral proteins produced in 6K cDNA clone transfected cells using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) and western blot showed a protein band of larger size than E2 of wild-type SAV3. When 6K cDNA was co-transfected with SAV3 helper cDNA encoding the whole structural genes including 6K, the infectivity was rescued. The development of CPE after co-transfection and resolved genome sequence of rescued virus confirmed full-length viral genome being generated through RNA recombination. The discovery of the important role of the 6K protein in virus production provides a new possibility for the development of antiviral intervention which is highly needed to control SAV infection in salmonids.","output":"A 6K-Deletion Variant of Salmonid Alphavirus Is Non-Viable but Can Be Rescued through RNA Recombination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Les tatouages sont de plus en plus frquents et leur surface est en augmentation.

Recently, a new case definition has been proposed by the Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration (MAGIC) to close the diagnostic gap. The aim of this study was to validate the MAGIC criteria as a suggested diagnostic standard for the diagnosis of suspected VGEI in the prospective Vascular Graft Cohort study (VASGRA). METHODS VASGRA is an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Prospective participants in VASGRA between 2013 and 2019 were included (257 patients; 137 with VGEI). The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for a diagnosis of VGEI was evaluated retrospectively by calculating the sensitivity and specificity vs. the consensually adjudicated VASGRA infection status. RESULTS The VASGRA cohort categorised 137 (53.3%) patients as \\"diseased\\" and 120 patients as \\"not diseased\\"; using the MAGIC criteria, 183/257 (71.2%) patients were considered to be \\"diseased\\". Thus, for the MAGIC criteria, a sensitivity of 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96-100) and a specificity of 61% (95% CI 52-70) were calculated. Considering suspected VGEI according to the MAGIC criteria as \\"not diseased\\" achieved congruent assessments of the VASGRA team and the MAGIC criteria, with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 93%. The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for the different graft locations were also compared. If the suspected VGEIs were assigned to the \\"not diseased\\" group, VGEIs of the thoracic aorta seemed to have a poorer sensitivity (86%; 95% CI 73-95) than the other graft locations. CONCLUSION The current MAGIC criteria offer good sensitivity and specificity in the context of true infections but a reduced specificity for a possible VGEI.","output":"Validation of the Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration (MAGIC) Criteria for the Diagnosis of Vascular Graft/Endograft Infection: Results from the Prospective Vascular Graft Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol consumption is a major threat to global health. The aim of the present study was to explore the association between alcohol consumption and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a Chinese population. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 4664 participants, aged 18 years, who participated in a baseline alcohol survey in 1997 and were followed up in 2009 of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), were recruited in the current study. Data on alcohol consumption was obtained using standardized questionnaires, with CKD (defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) as the outcome. The results showed that 37.3% of the participants had consumed alcohol at the baseline. Current drinkers were mainly men, with at least senior high school education, and a history of smoking. In the 2009 survey, 14.5% of the participants had CKD. Association analyses revealed that alcohol drinkers had a lower likelihood of CKD than non-drinkers (11.0% vs. 16.6%, aOR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.58-1.00), after adjusting potential covariates. Restricted cubic splines revealed that the relationship between alcohol consumption and CKD prevalence was U-shaped. The probability of CKD significantly increased when alcohol consumption exceeded 18 standard drinks per week (aOR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.00-2.76). Approximately one-fourth of participants changed their drinking patterns during the 12-year follow-up, and male drinkers with persistent drinking patterns had the lowest prevalence of CKD (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.31-0.73). CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption showed a U-shaped association with CKD. Moderate drinkers exhibited a lower disease prevalence compared with non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. Further studies should be conducted to explore the mechanisms underlying this protective effect. However, non-drinkers should not start drinking alcohol even with this protective effect.","output":"Alcohol consumption and its association with chronic kidney disease: Evidence from a 12-year China health and Nutrition Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In managing patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era, clinical oncologists and palliative care practitioners had to face new, disrupting and complex medical situations, challenging the quality of the shared decision-making process. During the first lockdown in France, we developed an onco-palliative ethics meeting to enhance the quality of the decision-making process for patients with advanced cancer treated for COVID-19. METHODS: A least one of the institutional ethics committee members was present along with oncologists, palliative care teams, psycho-oncologists, radiologists and intensive care specialists. Specific medical parameters were systematically collected to form a standardised framework for the discussions. RESULTS: The main raised issues were the definition of new criteria for the implementation of invasive resuscitation techniques, optimal ways to adapt or delay anticancer treatment and best procedures to address terminal respiratory failure and end-of-life care. The main clinical and ethical guidelines that emerged during these debates are presented. The palliative care team played a major role in assessing and reporting patients' awareness of cancer-related prognosis and their wishes concerning invasive therapies or transfer to intensive care units, enabling an individualised benefit-risk balance assessment. The ethics committee members ensured continuous monitoring during the discussions. Their function was to recall the main ethical principles including dignity, which is conferred on people when there are treated as having equal status. CONCLUSIONS: The onco-palliative ethics meeting provided a powerful avenue for improvement of collegiality and reinforcement of teamwork, which could be a major protection against burnout for healthcare professionals facing an epidemic onslaught.","output":"Advanced cancer and COVID-19 comorbidity: medical oncology-palliative medicine ethics meetings in a comprehensive cancer centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It was back in 2005 that the first IEEE Spectrum Awards were presented to Nesscap Co , a South Korean maker of ultracapacitors, and to Microsoft TV, for Internet Protocol television In those days, the IEEE Spectrum Awards were given out in partnership with EE Times, at the Annual Creativity in Electronics (ACE) Awards ? 1964-2012 IEEE","output":"Ellume and Relativity Space Win IEEE Spectrum Awards > A COVID-19 home test and 3D-printed rockets were notable achievements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurosurgeons receive extensive and lengthy training to equip themselves with various technical skills, and neurosurgery require a great deal of pre-, intra- and postoperative clinical data collection, decision making, care and recovery.

Kidney transplant is a superior mode of kidney replacement therapy for most individuals with kidney failure. Patients with obesity often are not approved for kidney transplant until they lose sufficient weight, as obesity may complicate the surgical procedure, and the risk of graft loss increases with a higher body mass index. To help potential kidney transplant recipient candidates lose weight, further knowledge of their thoughts, feelings, and attitudes is needed. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews and an exploratory research design, guided by qualitative content analysis. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients at a hospital in Denmark required to lose weight to achieve kidney transplant eligibility. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: From patients responses, we identified descriptive themes using a phenomenological approach. The factors affecting outcomes were derived reflexively from these themes. RESULTS: Ten interviews were analyzed. Experiences of obesity and weight-loss attempts were described across 4 themes; (1) restrictions and exhaustion, (2) hope and hopelessness, (3) support and self-discipline, and (4) motivation based on severity. A major motivating factor to achieving weight loss in the studied group of patients was their declining kidney function and the fact that kidney transplant cannot be considered until sufficient weight loss is achieved. LIMITATIONS: Thematic saturation was reached after an unexpectedly low number of participants. The patients were only interviewed once and over the phone. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obesity who are seeking kidney transplant need additional help with the dietary restrictions brought on by kidney disease. They need assistance bridging between a kidney-friendly diet and a sustainable diet that will ensure weight loss. These patients also express not wanting to feel alone in their weight-loss battle.

The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched databases for all case reports and series from 12 February to 4 April 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between 8 December 2019 and 1 April 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%). Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section. Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported. Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.","output":"Maternal and perinatal outcomes with COVID-19: A systematic review of 108 pregnancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite extensive research, there is still no treatment that would lead to remission in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis as our understanding of the affected site, the synovium, is still incomplete.

Hearing provides a poignant example of this with noise-induced and age-related hearing loss. Hearing loss is not unique to humans, however, and is experienced by all animals in the face of wild and eclectic differences in ear morphology and operation. Here we exploited the high throughput and accessible tympanal ear of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (mixed sex) to rigorously quantify changes in the auditory system due to noise exposure (3 kHz pure tone at 126 dB SPL) and age. We analysed tympanal dispalcements, morphology of the auditory Mllers organ and measured activity of the auditory nerve, the transduction current and electrophysiological properties of individual auditory receptors. We found that noise mildly and transiently changes tympanal displacements, decreases both the width of the auditory nerve and the transduction current recorded from individual auditory neurons. Whereas age C but not noise - decreases the number of auditory neurons and increases their resting potential. Multiple other properties of Mllers organ were unaffected by either age or noise including: the number of supporting cells in Mllers organ or the nerve, membrane resistance and capacitance of the auditory neurons. The sound-evoked activity of the auditory nerve decreased as a function of age and this decrease was exacerbated by noise, with the largest difference during the middle of their life span. This middle-aged deafness pattern of hearing loss mirrors that found for humans exposed to noise early in their life. Key point summary Age and noise lead to hearing loss. Tympanal displacements have a transient and delayed reduction after noise. The number of auditory neurons decreases with age. The width of the auditory nerve is reduced with noise exposure. Locusts repeatedly exposed to noise lost their hearing compared to silent controls, but their hearing became similar to old silent control locusts due to age-related hearing loss dominating. The electrophysiological properties of the auditory neurons and the transduction current remained unchanged for aged locusts but repeated noise exposure led to a cumulative decrease in the transduction current.","output":"Physiological changes throughout the ear due to age and noise - a longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Examining the upper lip position is a key indicator of facial beauty This study aimed to examine the upper lip position following cosmetic rhinoplasty at the frontal and profile views The medical records of 67 patients who underwent rhinoplasty with no history of any facial skeletal surgery were obtained from archives Complete preoperative and postoperative photos including the profile view at rest and the frontal view at rest, were prepared and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 software Interpupillary distances of two eyes in frontal views and Glabella to Pogonion (POG) distance in profile views were considered as fixed landmarks to calibrate the preoperative and postoperative photos Upper lip length, subnasal area, and vermilion points were marked and compared between preoperative and postoperative photos Data analysis was carried out using one-sample t-test and p&lt;0 05% was considered as the significant level Lip length (frontal view) was increased in 46 subjects There were changes in the profile view of vermilion and subnasal positions in 56 patients and 53 patients, respectively In surgical procedures on columella strut, maxillary augment, alar resection, spreader graft, columella retraction, and depressor septi muscle release, vermilion and subnasal protrusion in the profile view was statistically significant and lip length increased significantly in the frontal view In tip rotation surgery techniques, the vermilion and subnasal position showed also significant protrusion The depressor septi muscle cutting methods had only led to a significant protrusion of vermilion position and upper lip length Despite all covariant interfering in rhinoplasty, this cosmetic surgery most often may increases maxillary lip length and helps that maxilla looks more protruded","output":"Effects of open rhinoplasty on upper lip position in profile and frontal views"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence, incidence and characteristics of bacterial infections and their impact on outcome in critically ill patients infected with COVID-19.

KaplanCMeier analysis (limit product method) was used to identify the occurrence of infections and risk of acquisition. RESULTS: During the study period 248 patients were recruited in the eight participating ICUs. Ninety (36.3%) patients developed at least one episode of secondary infection. An ICU length of stay between 7 and 14 days was characterized by a higher occurrence of infectious complications, with ventilator-associated pneumonia being the most frequent. At least one course of antibiotic therapy was given to 161 (64.9%) patients. Overall ICU and hospital mortality were 33.9% and 42.9%, respectively.

The expression level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the human cornea was determined via immunofluorescence. In vitro experiments were performed in HCECs stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Moreover, the expression levels of ACE2, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, gasdermin D (GSDMD) and IL-1? in HCECs were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and/or western blotting. It was identified that ACE2 was expressed in normal human corneal epithelium and HCECs cultured in vitro. Furthermore, the expression levels of IL-8, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 in HCECs were decreased following SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stimulation, while the expression levels of GSDMD and IL-1? were increased. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suppressed the host inflammatory response and induced pyroptosis in HCECs.

The effects of SAH orders on the trauma population remain unknown. We hypothesized an increase in rates of penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds, suicide attempts, and domestic violence in the Southern California trauma population after the SAH order. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective analysis of all trauma patients presenting to 11 American College of Surgeons levels I and II trauma centers spanning seven counties in California was performed. Demographic data, injury characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into three groups based on injury date: before SAH from January 1, 2020, to March 18, 2020 (PRE), after SAH from March 19, 2020, to June 30, 2020 (POST), and a historical control from March 19, 2019, to June 30, 2019 (CONTROL). POST was compared with both PRE and CONTROL in two separate analyses. RESULTS: Across all periods, 20,448 trauma patients were identified (CONTROL, 7,707; PRE, 6,022; POST, 6,719). POST had a significantly increased rate of penetrating trauma (13.0% vs. 10.3%, p < 0.001 and 13.0% vs. 9.9%, p < 0.001) and gunshot wounds (4.5% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.002 and 4.5% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.025) compared with PRE and CONTROL, respectively.

Our goal is not only to support large-scale simulations but also to increase the simulation resolution. Moreover, we do not assume an underlying network of contacts, and the person-to-person contacts responsible for the spreading are modeled as a function of the geographical distance among the individuals. In particular, we defined a commuting mechanism combining radiation-based and gravity-based models and we exploited the commuting properties at different resolution levels (municipalities and provinces). Finally, we exploited the high-performance computing (HPC) facilities to simulate millions of concurrent agents, each mapping the individual's behavior. To do such simulations, we developed a spreading simulator and validated it through the simulation of the spreading in two of the most populated Italian regions: Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. Our main achievement consists of the effective modeling of 10 million of concurrent agents, each one mapping an individual behavior with a high-resolution in terms of social contacts, mobility and contribution to the virus spreading. Moreover, we analyzed the forecasting ability of our framework to predict the number of infections being initialized with only a few days of real data. We validated our model with the statistical data coming from the serological analysis conducted in Lombardy, and our model makes a smaller error than other state of the art models with a final root mean squared error equal to 56,009 simulating the entire first pandemic wave in spring 2020.

Targeting postsurgical premetastatic niche and microresiduals presents an excellent prospective opportunity but is often challenged by poor therapeutic delivery into minimal residual tumors. Here, an enzymatically transformable polymer-based nanotherapeutic approach is presented that exploits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overactivation in tumor-associated tissues to guide the codelivery of colchicine (microtubule-disrupting and anti-inflammatory agent) and marimastat (MMP inhibitor). The dePEGylation of polymersomes catalyzed by MMPs not only exposes the guanidine moiety to improve tissue/cell-targeting/retention to increase bioavailability, but also differentially releases marimastat and colchicine to engage their extracellular (MMPs) and intracellular (microtubules) targets of action, respectively. In primary tumors/overt metastases, the vasculature-specific targeting of nanotherapeutics can function synchronously with the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deter malignant progression of metastatic breast cancer. After the surgical removal of large primary tumors, nanotherapeutic agents are localized in the premetastatic niche and at the site of the postsurgical wound, disrupting the premetastatic microenvironment and eliminating microresiduals, which radically reduces metastatic and local-regional recurrence. The findings suggest that nanotherapeutics can safely widen the therapeutic window to resuscitate colchicine and MMP inhibitors for other inflammatory disorders.","output":"Enzymatically Transformable Polymersome-Based Nanotherapeutics to Eliminate Minimal Relapsable Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess impact of COVID-19 on diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy.

COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. MethodsTwo key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case incidence and case morbidity. GP Practice data was used as this provided the most geographically granular source of published public population data. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, % age >16 at fulltime work/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD 2019, Location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as % self-confident in their own long term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated by applying the international mortality Odds Ratio to the local population relevant age and disease prevalences and then summing and dividing by the equivalent national figure. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. ResultsThe case incidence regression is a dynamic situation with the significance of specific factors moderating over time as the balance between external infection, community transmission and impact of mitigation measures feeds through to the number of cases. It showed that currently Urban, % Working and age >60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative HC impact was wide with 80% of practices falling between 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included it showed that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. ConclusionCovid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health and social care resources across the country. This model provides a method for predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a method for targeting limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources to optimise national, regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak..","output":"COVID-19: Modelling Local Transmission and Morbidity effects to provide an estimate of overall Relative Healthcare Resource Impact by General Practice Granularity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of evidence-based guidelines with regard to eye protection for aerosol-generating procedures in otolaryngology practice.

METHODS: A custom-built setup was utilized to simulate the clinical scenario of a patient cough in proximity of a health care worker. A system that sprays a xanthan-fluorescein mixture was set up and calibrated to simulate a human cough. A mannequin with cellulose paper placed on its forehead, eyes, and mouth was fitted with various PPE combinations and exposed to the simulated cough. The degree of contamination on the cellulose papers was quantified with a fluorescent microscope able to detect aerosols 10 m. RESULTS: When no eye protection was worn, 278 droplets/aerosols reached the eye area. The use of the surgical mask with an attached upward-facing shield alone resulted in only 2 droplets/aerosols reaching the eye area. In this experiment, safety glasses and goggles performed equally, as the addition of either brought the number of droplets/aerosols reaching the eye down to 0. CONCLUSION: When used with an upward-facing face shield, there was no difference in the eye protection rendered by safety goggles or glasses in this study.

Carriers as well as transport users have faced great challenges of maintaining traffic. Measures and requirements imposed on them were often obscure, imprecise, and the journey itself was uncertain. Passengers were in fear of whether they would be able to reach their destination, but also whether they will succeed in preserving their health. Carriers, on the other hand, have also sought to adapt and provide passengers with safe transport. Nevertheless, the pandemic caused financial collapse of many carriers, landed the world fleet and closed many airports. Various legal instruments related to the protection of public health are applied in air transport, and they have been adopted within the framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which will be presented in the paper. Various epidemiological measures related to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic have been prescribed in air transport, applicable during the journey, which have certain specifics in relation to other modes of transport. The paper will present epidemiological measures as well as the procedure applied when there is a passenger on the flight who shows symptoms of an infectious disease, and new procedures related to transport of goods. It will also address the obligation to complete certain forms and provide various information as well as the obligation to compensate costs for cancelled flights. There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant economic impact on air transport, and efforts will be made to present measures and provide forecasts for the recovery of air traffic in the period that follows.

There are numerous serotypes and variants, which do not confer cross protection resulting in failure of currently used IBV vaccines. Although variant IBV isolates with major genetic differences have been subjected to comparative studies, it is unknown whether minor genetic differences in IBV variants within a serotype are different in terms of pathogenesis and eliciting host responses. Two Massachusetts (Mass) variant IBV isolates recovered from commercial layer flocks in the Western Canadian provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK) were compared genetically and evaluated for their pathogenicity, tissue distribution and ability to recruit and replicate in macrophages. RESULTS: Although whole genome sequencing of these two Mass IBV isolates showed low similarity with the M41 vaccinal strain, they had an identical nucleotide sequence at open reading frames (ORFs) 3a, 3b, envelop (E), matrix (M), 5a and 5b. The rest of the ORFs of these 2 IBV isolates showed 99.9% nucleotide similarity. However, upon experimental infection, we found that the IBV isolate originating from AB was different to the one that originated in SK due to higher tracheal lesion scores and lower lung viral replication and lower genome loads in cecal tonsils. Nevertheless, both IBV isolates elicited host responses characterized by significant macrophage recruitment to the respiratory tract and there was evidence that both IBV isolates replicated within tracheal and lung macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study shows that Mass variant IBV isolates, although possessing minor genetic variations, can lead to significant differences in pathogenicity in young chickens. Further studies are required to investigate the pathogenicity of these two Mass variant IBV isolates in laying hens.

Global lockdown has limited travel resulting to losses in the tourism sector. This paper discusses the specific role that fiscal policy plays to improve tourism competitiveness in Kenya. Specifically, the study examines how Kenyan government can revive the tourism economy to improve its competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - A tourism demand model to explore relationship between fiscal policies and inbound tourism in Kenya is developed. This study uses a Markov regime-switching (MS) regression model to establish the relationships that exist between COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal policies and tourism revenue in Kenya. Findings-The estimation results of the Markov-switching dynamic regression showed that the coefficients of international tourists arrivals, domestic bed occupancy and international bed occupancy are positive and significant with p-values of 0.000 during the pandemic period. The findings show that the transitioning periods during the fiscal policy shifts had an effect on the international arrivals. Therefore, fiscal incentives were key in influencing tourism arrivals and bednights occupancies. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical implications show that to promote the state of high international and domestic tourist arrivals, the government should encourage more fiscal spending initiatives that encourage the increase in tourist arrivals and occupancies such as vaccinations against COVID-19 and promoting safe spaces for visitors within the destination is key towards reviving the sector. In order to curb the hysteresis effects of COVID-19 related depression and resultant impacts on GDP, there is a need to review the national fiscal policies and target fiscal policies on the cyclical effects of the COVID-19 impacts on international tourism market.

It has consequently garnered a growing interest as a potential adjunctive therapy for coronavirus disease. Here, we review evidence concerning the effects of N-acetylcysteine in respiratory viral infections based on currently available in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical investigations. The repurposing of a known drug such as N-acetylcysteine may significantly hasten the deployment of a novel approach for COVID-19. Since the drug candidate has already been translated into the clinic for several decades, its established pharmacological properties and safety and side-effect profiles expedite preclinical and clinical assessment for the treatment of COVID-19. In vitro data have depicted that N-acetylcysteine increases antioxidant capacity, interferes with virus replication, and suppresses expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells infected with influenza viruses or respiratory syncytial virus. Furthermore, findings from in vivo studies have displayed that, by virtue of immune modulation and anti-inflammatory mechanism, N-acetylcysteine reduces the mortality rate in influenza-infected mice animal models. The promising in vitro and in vivo results have prompted the initiation of human subject research for the treatment of COVID-19, including severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

METHODS: 165 patients admitted from March 8th to April 17th, 2020, with COVID-19 in an acute geriatric ward in Italy were included. Pre-disease frailty was assessed with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Multimorbidity was defined as the co-occurrence of 2 of these in the same patient. The hazard (HR) of in-hospital mortality as a function of CFS score and number of chronic diseases in the whole population and in those aged 70+ years were calculated. Results: Among the 165 patients, 112 were discharged, 11 were transferred to intensive care units and 42 died. Patients who died were older (81.0 vs. 65.2 years, p<0.001), more frequently multimorbid (97.6 vs. 52.8%; p<0.001) and more likely frail (37.5 vs. 4.1%; p<0.001). Less than 2.0% of patients without multimorbidity and frailty, 28% of those with multimorbidity only and 75% of those with both multimorbidity and frailty died. Each unitary increment in the CFS was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death in the whole sample (HR=1.3; 95%CI=1.05-1.62) and in patients aged 70+ years (HR=1.29;95%CI=1.04-1.62), whereas the number of chronic diseases was not significantly associated with higher risk of death. The CFS addition to age and sex increased mortality prediction by 9.4% in those aged 70+ years.

The identification and structural characterization of the proteins and glycans essential in these recognition phenomena opens up new avenues for both drug discovery and vaccine development. This chapter describes some of the most significant developments in the field of structure-based investigations of viral surface-resident carbohydrate-recognizing proteins. Specifically, an overview of these carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from four important human viruses, including influenza, dengue, rotavirus, parainfluenza, and associated structural investigations will be presented. The surface of flavivirus is predominantly covered by E-glycoprotein (EGP) that forms dimers tethered to the surface by a stalk region. The EGP-associated glycan of the virus has been shown to be important for Dengue virus infection. Both human parainfluenza viruses and Newcastle disease virus have a surface-resident carbohydrate recognizing protein known as hemagglutinin-neuramindase (HN), which is involved in both cellular recognition and as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is a glycosylated homo-tetramer that is tethered to the virus surface by a long protein stalk at its C terminal.","output":"Chapter 15 Viral surface glycoproteins in carbohydrate recognition Structure and modelling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study investigated the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on tinnitus severity and quality of life in individuals with subjective tinnitus. METHODS The study was carried out during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Sixty patients were evaluated with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and a visual analogue scale on resonance intensity and disturbance, together with questions assessing their emotional states. RESULTS There was a significant difference between the visual analogue scale and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores before the pandemic and during the pandemic. It was determined that tinnitus loudness and annoyance were significantly worse in the pandemic and, consequently, that the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic negatively affected perceptions of tinnitus and quality of life. CONCLUSION Psychological support can affect positively the perception of tinnitus and the change in moods experienced during the pandemic. Because personal contact and quotidian activities are severely limited during the pandemic, internet-based interventions should be prioritised in tinnitus therapy.","output":"Effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on subjective tinnitus perception."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac Rehabilitation programs have shown to improve outcomes.

We aimed to (1) describe meal program features as communicated in low-income California school districts on-line resources (2) examine associations between meal program features and change in meal participation between May 2019 and May 2020 and (3) evaluate equity by describing meal site coverage and placement relative to the size of priority populations. Data from district online resources and meal reimbursement claims were collected for a stratified, random sample of 190 CalFresh Healthy Living-eligible districts. Linear regression was used to examine associations between district meal program features and percent change in meal participation. Meal site location and density were examined in relation to the size of priority populations. In May 2020, compared to May 2019, total meals served decreased by a median 46%. There were gaps in the information provided in district online resources and low variation in measured district meal program features. These features explained little of the variation in the percent change in meal participation. A greater proportion of meal sites were placed in areas with larger priority populations, yet the density of sites was not proportionate to the priority populations sizes.

Clinically recruited individuals with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer underwent online screening with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Those with anxiety and/or depression symptoms (> 7 on any of the HADS subscales) were randomized to iCAN-DO or standard care. iCAN-DO comprised psychoeducation and self-care strategies (step 1) and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT, step 2). Data were collected before randomization and at 1, 4, 7, and 10 months and analyzed with ITT regression analysis and randomization tests. Online screening identified 245 (27%) of 909 individuals who reported anxiety and/or depression symptoms. They were randomized to iCAN-DO (n=124) or standard care (n=121). Of them 49% completed the 10-month assessment, and in the iCAN-DO group 85% accessed step 1 and 13% underwent iCBT. iCAN-DO decreased the levels of symptoms of depression (-0.54, 95% CI: (-1.08)- (-0.01), p<.05) and the proportion of individuals with symptoms of depression (p<.01) at 10 months, compared with standard care, according to HADS.

METHODS A total of 72 middle ear samples were collected from 25 children with OME (Group 1) and 47 individuals with no middle ear disease (Group 2). Multiplex real-time PCR was used to investigate the presence of 20 different respiratory viruses. Virus results were compared with bacteriome of the same populations. RESULTS At least one respiratory virus was detected in 56% of the patients in Group 1 and 12.8% of the individuals in Group 2. The viral co-infection rate for Group 1 and 2 was 8% and 2.1%, respectively. In Group 1, adenovirus was the most frequently detected virus with a rate of 24%, either alone (16%) or concurrent with other viruses (8%), followed by influenza B (12%), rhinovirus and bocavirus (8%) each. Parainfluenza 4, coronavirus OC43, and RSV A/B were detected in 4% of the sample each. In Group 2, rhinovirus was detected in 2 samples (4.3%) followed by adenovirus, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus E299, and coronavirus NL63 with a rate of 2.1% each. The detection rate of respiratory viruses was significantly higher in children aged 6 to 11 years. There was no positive association between virus and bacteria found in the middle ear cavity.

Participants (N = 1354 women; M(age)= 31.89 years, SD = 11.14) filled in the Contour Drawing Rating Scale, the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire, the Eating Motivation Survey, the Mindful Eating Questionnaire, and a COVID-19-related stress measure and sociodemographic survey. The cluster analysis technique revealed four distinct clusters: (a) Cluster 1 (N = 314): healthy body weight, no COVID-related stress, and low body dissatisfaction (M = 1.19); (b) Cluster 2 (N = 131): overweight, no COVID-related stress, and high body dissatisfaction (M = 2.41); (c) Cluster 3 (N = 597): healthy body weight, COVID-related stress, and low body dissatisfaction (M = 1.27); (d) Cluster 4 (N = 312): overweight, COVID-related stress, and high body dissatisfaction (M = 2.84). Generally, our outcomes partially support our hypothesis, as higher levels of some types of disordered eating were observed in women who were overweight with COVID-related stress and high body dissatisfaction (Cluster 4) as compared with women with healthy body weight, no COVID-related stress, and with low levels of body dissatisfaction (Cluster 1). Our results indicate that both body weight status, as well as COVID-19-related stress and body dissatisfaction, may contribute to the intensity of disordered eating.

Stress-related trauma is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in wild ruminant species. Trazodone could reduce stress and allow safer capture and handling, thus having a positive effect on their welfare. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical effects and pharmacokinetic profile of an oral dose of trazodone in domestic goats (Capra hircus) as a model for wild ruminants. A pilot study using ethograms and accelerometers identified an oral dose of 10 mg/kg as optimal to reduce activity levels. This dose resulted in a 502% increase in time spent sleeping (P=0.0016) and a 623% increase in time spent lying down (P=0.01). Additionally, there were reductions of 72% in time spent grooming (P=0.02), 49% in time spent moving (P=0.01), and 87% in time spent observing (P=0.0002). Activity levels were significantly decreased by 31% for 4 hr following administration (P=0.049). There were no observed adverse effects. Time spent eating or ruminating was not affected by trazodone administration (P > 0.05). The pharmacokinetics of trazodone following a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg in 7 goats was assessed. All animals achieved plasma concentrations over 130 ng/ml, a level considered therapeutic in humans and dogs, for a mean of 6.4  5.0 hr. Mean terminal half-life was 10.55  6.80 hr. All goats achieved maximum concentration within 5-15 min and still had detectable plasma levels at 24 hr. Trazodone appears promising to decrease stress in exotic ruminant species.

In this randomized, single-blinded, multicenter trial, adults who had received two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) 3 to7 months before were randomly assigned to receive a boost of BNT162b2, Sanofi/GSK SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein MV D614 (monovalent parental formulation) or SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein MV B.1.351 vaccine (monovalent Beta formulation). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects with a [] 10-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers for the Wuhan (D614) and B.1.351 (Beta) SARS-CoV-2 viral strains between day 0 and day 15. Findings. The percentages of participants whose neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan (D614) SARS-CoV-2 strain increased by a factor []10 between day 0 and day 15 was 55.3% (95% CI 43.4-66.7) in MV D614 group (n=76), 76.1% (64.5-85.4) in MV B.1.351 (Beta) group (n=71) and 63.2% (51.3-73.9) in BNT162b2 group (n=76). These percentages were 44.7% (33.3-56.6), 84.5% (74.0-92.0) and 51.3% (39.6-63.0) for the B.1.351 (Beta) viral strain, respectively. Higher neutralizing antibodies rates against Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants were also elicited after Sanofi/GSK MV Beta vaccine compared to the other vaccines. Comparable reactogenicity profile was observed with the three vaccines. Interpretation. Heterologous boosting with the Sanofi/GSK Beta formulation vaccine resulted in a higher neutralizing antibody response against Beta variant but also the original strain and Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants, compared with mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine or the Sanofi/GSK MVD614 formulation.

DATA COLLECTION: Data collection included compiled participatory observations, logbook notes and semi-structured interviews, collected between the summer of 2017 to the summer of 2019. DATA ANALYSIS: Ghadiris identity threats theoretical framework was used to analyse qualitative material and to develop conceptualising categories, using QDA Miner software (V.5.0). RESULTS: All professionals with a clinical care role and patient partners (n=9) accepted to participate in the ethnographic study and semi-structured interviews (RR=100%).

Identity tensions included competing ideals of the good professional, challenges to the impermeability of the patient and professional categories, the interweaving of symbols associated with one or the other of these identities, and the inner balance between the roles of caregiver and colleague. CONCLUSION: This research provides a new perspective on understanding how working in partnership with patients transform health professionals identity. When they are called to work with patients outside of a simple therapeutic relationship, health professionals may feel tensions between their identity as caregivers and their identity as colleague. This allows us to better understand some underlying tensions elicited by the arrival of different patient engagement initiatives (eg, professionals resistance to working with patients, patients status and remuneration, professionals concerns toward patient representativeness). Partnership with patients imply the construction of a new relational framework, flexible and dynamic, that takes into account this coexistence of identities.","output":"Changing relationships: how does patient involvement transform professional identity?

Pariwisata saat pandemi COVID-19 menjadi fokus pembahasan artikel ini karena Pariwisata merupakan salah satu industri yang paling dirugikan oleh pandemi COVID-19. Secara global kerugian pariwisata dunia mencapai US $ 22 miliar. Angka ini akan terus meningkat selama pandemi ini tidak dapat dikendalikan melalui vaksin dan obat-obatan. Tak terkecuali Indonesia yang kehilangan pendapatan asli negaranya dari sektor ini mencapai puluhan triliun rupiah hanya dalam waktu empat bulan sejak WHO mengumumkan COVID-19 sebagai pandemi global.

Another purpose of writing this article is to analyze the Indonesian government's role in using the term \\"new normal\\" and its relation to sustainable tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic has not ended. Tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic is the focus of the discussion of this article because it is one of the industries most harmed by this pandemic. Globally the loss of world tourism reaches US$22 billion. This figure will continue to increase as long as this pandemic cannot be controlled through vaccines and drugs. No exception for Indonesia which lost the country's original income from this sector reaching tens of trillions of rupiah in just four months since WHO announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The new normal situation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity as well as a challenge for world tourism in general and Indonesian tourism in particular. The change in lifestyle and habits of the community in traveling directly or indirectly has \\"hit\\" this industry very hard. Undeniably, reactivating tourism industry activities do have considerable risk but on the other hand many sectors depend on this industry.

This powerful technique does not only provide valuable insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, i.e., the etiopathogenesis of CNS related diseases, it also facilitates the development of new translational, i.e., therapeutic approaches. Whereas competing techniques that make use of recorder systems used in jackets or tethered systems suffer from their unphysiological restraining to semi-restraining character, radiotelemetric EEG recordings overcome these disadvantages. Technically, implantable EEG radiotelemetry allows for precise and highly sensitive measurement of epidural and deep, intracerebral EEGs under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. First, we present a detailed protocol of a straight forward, successful, quick and efficient technique for epidural (surface) EEG recordings resulting in high-quality electrocorticograms. Second, we demonstrate how to implant deep, intracerebral EEG electrodes, e.g., in the hippocampus (electrohippocampogram). For both approaches, a computerized 3D stereotaxic electrode implantation system is used. The radiofrequency transmitter itself is implanted into a subcutaneous pouch in both mice and rats. Special attention also has to be paid to pre-, peri- and postoperative treatment of the experimental animals.

Importantly, these perceptions may vary according to the characteristics of the consumer (e.g., preferences, motivations), the product (e.g., sensory attributes) and the encounter (e.g., how the meat alternative is presented/framed). Qualitative and quantitative methods were applied to examine consumer perceptions of five proposed alternatives to meat: legumes, tofu, seitan, lab-grown meat, and insects. In Study 1, 138 participants provided free associations with regards to conventional animal proteins (e.g., red/white meat, fish) and the five alternatives. Three profiles of consumers were identified: (1) hedonically motivated meat eaters uninterested in meat substitutes; (2) health-oriented meat eaters open to some meat substitutes; and (3) ethically conscious meat avoiders positively oriented to most meat alternatives. In Study 2, the presentation of the product was experimentally manipulated: 285 participants evaluated the same five meat alternatives along several dimensions (e.g., edibility, healthiness), either when framed as an individual product or as part of a larger meal. Overall, most meat alternatives benefited from a meal framing, with the notable exception of legumes, which benefited from an individual framing, and insects which were evaluated quite negatively regardless of framing. The present findings suggest that there is not a single way to frame all meat alternatives that will improve their appeal to all consumers.","output":"Consumer perceptions of conventional and alternative protein sources: A mixed-methods approach with meal and product framing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to analyze adherence to the Mediterranean diet among the adult general population of Cyprus during the COVID-19 confinement.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods. Results: Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (&#8805;80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1. Conclusions and Relevance: A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China.

Next, we analysed whether changes in these metabolic risk factors were mediated by psychological and behavioural mechanisms. Design In this natural experiment, we assessed changes from baseline in metabolic CVD risk factors in the exposed group (whose follow-up measurements were taken during the pandemic), and compared these to the changes in the control group (whose follow-up measurements were taken before the pandemic). Participants This study used data from 6962 participants from six different ethnic groups (Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish and Moroccan) of the HELIUS study, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We included women and men without prior CVD, who participated in both the baseline (2011-2015) and follow-up measurements (2019-2021). Outcome measures Changes between baseline and follow-up measurements in six metabolic CVD risk factors were calculated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), total cholesterol (TC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Results The exposed group experienced somewhat less favourable changes over time in SBP, DBP and FPG (the latter only in women) than the control group, while temporal changes in HbA1c and eGFR were more favourable among the control group. For instance, SBP was 1.119 mmHg [0.046, 2.193] higher in exposed than non-exposed women, and 1.380 [0.288, 2471] in men. Changes in SBP and DBP were partially mediated by changes in behavioural factors, most notably BMI and alcohol consumption. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic, including the restrictive lockdown measures, is associated with a deterioration of several CVD risk factors in women and men.

The objective of this study was to develop a virtual learning environment for antibiotic prescription and to determine its impact on dentists awareness, attitudes, and intention to practice. First, the learning content on multimedia resources was developed and distributed into three challenges that participants had to overcome. Then, a quasi-experimental study was performed in which the virtual learning environment was implemented on dentists from seven Colombian cities. The median of correct answers and the levels of awareness, attitudes, and intention to practice were compared before, immediately after, and 6-months post-intervention. Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemars tests were used to determine the differences. A total of 206 participants who finished the virtual learning environment activities exhibited a favorable and statistically significant impact on the median of correct answers of awareness (p < 0.001), attitudes (p < 0.001), and intention to practice (p = 0.042). A significant increase occurred in the number of participants with a high level of awareness (p < 0.001) and a non-significant increase in participants with high levels of attitudes (p = 0.230) and intention to practice (p = 0.286). At 6 months, the positive effect on the median of correct answers on awareness and intention to practice persisted (p < 0.001); however, this was not evident for attitudes (p = 0.105). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the number of participants who showed low levels of awareness (p = 0.019) and a slight increase in those with high levels of the same component (p = 0.161).

Some of the discovered pockets were found only for the cosolvent simulations, where the nonpolar probes induced local conformational changes in the protein that lead to the opening of transient pockets. In addition, the selection of the ligands based on a combination of the binding free energy and binding free energy gap between the best two poses for each ligand provided more suitable binders than the selection of ligands based solely on one of the criteria.

Consequently, unprecedented amounts of such drug residues discharging into ambient waters raise concerns on the potential ecotoxicological effects to aquatic lives, as well as development of antiviral drug-resistance in wildlife. Here, we estimated the occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological risk of 11 therapeutic agents suggested as drugs for COVID-19 treatment and their 13 metabolites in wastewater and environmental waters, based on drug consumption, physical-chemical property using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), and ecotoxicological and pharmacological data for the drugs. Our results suggest that the removal efficiencies at conventional wastewater treatment plants will remain low (< 20%) for half of the substances, and consequently, high drug residues (e.g. 7402 ng/L ribavirin, 4231 ng/L favipiravir, 730 ng/L lopinavir, 319 ng/L remdesivir; each combined for both unchanged forms and metabolites; and when each drug is administered to 100 patients out of 100,000 populations on a day) can be present in secondary effluents and persist in the environmental waters. Ecotoxicological risk in receiving river waters can be high (risk quotient > 1) by a use of favipiravir, lopinavir, umifenovir and ritonavir, and medium (risk quotient > 0.1) by a use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and ribavirin, while the risk will remain small (risk quotient < 0.1) for dexamethasone and oseltamivir.

The results showed a clear separation between the taxonomic, functional and antibiotic resistant genes in the caeca of the birds reared on the conventional and antibiotic free farm. However, that separation was completely lost on carcasses belonging to the two groups. The antibiotic-free production resulted in statistically significant lower antimicrobial resistance load in the caeca in comparison to the conventional production. Moreover, the antimicrobial resistance load on carcasses was much higher than in the caeca, without any significant difference between carcasses coming from the two types of farms.

In contrast, a late hyper-inflammatory phenomenon, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), is characterized by more frequent gastrointestinal manifestations with greater severity, sometimes presenting as peritonitis.

It argues that knowledge of local languages can help disseminate health-related information on a regional level. This addresses two problems simultaneously: the problems raised by the intelligibilty of governmental healthcare protocols and the functions of the use of local languages. The article is a case study presenting a number of interventions in the languages of East Kalimantan and can be seen as an inclusive, grassroots example of health communication. The study was initially a modest attempt to generate on-the-ground examples of health information in the dominant languages of the region of East Kalimantan. These studies demonstrate that the local communities of these languages are very enthusiastic about getting involved in the interventions. They also reveal that communication using IT and social media is thriving. One of our observations was that information about this pandemic tends to be understood only by highly educated urban people. This happens because it is conveyed by the government in standard Indonesian, which includes many foreign loanwords. The application of local languages is not just using local language vocabulary, it is instead a trigger to revive the collective memory of disaster management based on local culture. In this case, local languages are recognized and considered useful in helping to break the chain of virus transmission to free Indonesia of the Covid-19 outbreak. There were a number of unexpected developments. We found support for the intervention being rolled out on a national level by Special Task Force for Covid-19 under National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana/BNPB).

We aimed to determine predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and develop utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores in thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke patients from both arms of ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study). Methods- ENCHANTED was an international quasi-factorial clinical trial of different doses of intravenous alteplase and intensities of blood pressure control in acute ischemic stroke patients, with outcomes on the 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale and mRS assessed at 90 days post-randomization. Logistic regression models were used to identify baseline predictors of poor HRQoL (mean 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale utility scores). Ordinary least squares regression derived utility-weighted mRS scores. Results- In 4016 acute ischemic stroke patients with complete 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale and mRS data, independent predictors of poor HRQoL were older age (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.12-1.27], per 10-year increase), non-Asian ethnicity (1.91 [1.61-2.27]), greater stroke severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (1.11 [1.09-1.12]), diabetes mellitus (1.41 [1.18-1.69]), premorbid disability (mRS score 1 versus 0; 1.62 [1.33-1.97]), large vessel atheromatous pathogenesis (1.32 [1.12-1.54]), and proxy respondent (2.35 [2.01-2.74]). Sensitivity analyses indicate the ethnicity influence on HRQoL was driven by the high proportion of Chinese (62.9% of Asian) participants with better HRQoL compared with non-Chinese or other Asian groups. Derived utility values across mRS scores 0 to 5 were 0.977, 0.885, 0.748, 0.576, 0.194, and -0.174, respectively. Correlations between mRS and 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale scores were stronger in Asians. Conclusions- HRQoL is worse after thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke in the elderly, non-Asians, with greater initial severity, diabetes mellitus, premorbid disability, due to large vessel atheroma, and proxy assessment. The broader significance of better HRQoL in Asians is tempered by Chinese participants dominating analyses. From utility-weighted mRS scores indicating the greatest steps in mRS scores are between 5 and 3, treatments to avoid major disability provide the greatest benefits for patients.

METHODS: Consecutive CIRD patients reporting to our specialised centre were prospectively included (n=975) in this cross-sectional study. Data on comorbidities including infections, treatment, vaccination status, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and hepatitis B (HepB) were collected. Antibodies against measles and HepB were measured by ELISA. The vaccination status was assessed by a predefined vaccination score (0-26) categorising patients into four immunisation states: low (0-6), moderate (7-13), good (14-20), high (21-26). RESULTS: All patients on bDMARDs (n=499) were screened for LTBI, and 469 for HepB (94%). All LTBI patients (n=16) received isoniazid (3.2%) and 16 chronic HepB patients received lamivudine (3.4%). Protective measles specific IgG-antibodies were found in 901 patients (92.4%). Although 629 patients were educated about vaccination strategies (64.5%), only 540 showed a vaccination card (55.4%). Only 49% of patients had undergone pneumococcal vaccination and less than 30% were protected against HepB and influenza, while 7.6% have not protective antibody titres against measles.

The intervention consisted of displaying the costs of 22 laboratory tests at the time of ordering. The primary outcome was the mean test ordering rate per 1.000 patients per month, per general practice. RESULTS: Test ordering rates were on average rising prior to the intervention.

A subgroup analysis for solely individually priced tests showed a statistically significant decrease in mean monthly test ordering rate after implementation of the price display for the sum of all tests from 67.2 to 63.3 (P = 0.01), as well as for some of these tests individually (i.e. thrombocytes, ALAT, TSH, folic acid). Leucocytes, ESR, vitamin B12, anti-CCP and NT-proBNP also showed a decrease, albeit not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a price display intervention is a simple tool that can alter physicians order behavior and constrain the expanding use of laboratory tests. Future research might consider alternative study designs and a longer follow-up period. Furthermore, in future studies, the combination with a multitude of interventions, like educational programs and feedback strategies, should be studied, while potentially adverse events caused by reduced testing should also be taken into consideration.

Methods In this prospective case series, nasopharyngeal and tear sampling of 43 patients with severe COVID-19 were performed. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2. Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history. Results The mean age of patients was 56  13 years. The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1-7 days. Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling. Only one patient had conjunctivitis. Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis.

BACKGROUND As SARS-CoV-2 spreads and health care facilities near or exceed capacity, facilities may implement alternative care sites (ACSs). With COVID-19 surges predicted, developing additional capacity in alternative facilities, including hotels and convention centers, into patient care environments requires early careful consideration of the existing space constraints, infrastructure, and modifications needed for patient care and infection control. Design-based strategies utilizing engineering solutions have the greatest impact, followed by medical and operational strategies. METHODS This article evaluates infection control and environmental strategies in inpatient units and proposes system modifications to ACS surge facilities to reduce infection risk and improve care environments. RESULTS Although adequate for an acute infectious disease outbreak, existing capacity in U.S. biocontainment units and airborne infection isolation rooms is not sufficient for widespread infection control and isolation during a pandemic. To improve patients' outcomes and decrease infection transmission risk in the alternative care facility, hospital planners, administrators, and clinicians can take cues from evidence-based strategies implemented in biocontainment units and standard inpatient rooms. CONCLUSIONS Innovative technologies, including optimized air-handling systems with ultraviolet and particle filters, can be an essential part of an infection control strategy. For flexible surge capacity in future ACS and hospital projects, interdisciplinary design and management teams should apply strategies optimizing the treatment of both infectious patients and minimizing the risk to health care workers.","output":"Built Environment Airborne Infection Control Strategies in Pandemic Alternative Care Sites."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18-84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.","output":"Death CertificateCBased ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes for COVID-19 Mortality Surveillance  United States, JanuaryCDecember 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Newcastle disease (ND), caused by infections with virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is one of the most important infectious disease affecting wild, peridomestic, and domestic birds worldwide. Vaccines constructed from live, low-virulence (lentogenic) viruses are the most accepted prevention and control strategies for combating ND in poultry across the globe. Avian macrophages are one of the first cell lines of defense against microbial infection, responding to signals in the microenvironment. Although macrophages are considered to be one of the main target cells for NDV infection in vivo, very little is known about the ability of NDV to infect chicken macrophages, and virulence mechanisms of NDV as well as the polarized activation patterns of macrophages and correlation with viral infection and replication. In the present study, a cell culture model (chicken bone marrow macrophage cell line HD11) and three different virulence and genotypes of NDV (including class II virulent NA-1, class II lentogenic LaSota, and class I lentogenic F55) were used to solve the above underlying questions. Our data indicated that all three NDV strains had similar replication rates during the early stages of infection. Virulent NDV titers were shown to increase compared to the other lentogenic strains, and this growth was associated with a strong upregulation of both pro-inflammatory M1-like markers/cytokines and anti-inflammatory M2-like markers/cytokines in chicken macrophages. Virulent NDV was found to block toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 expression, inducing higher expression of type I interferons in chicken macrophages at the late stage of viral infection. Only virulent NDV replication can be inhibited by pretreatment with TLR7 ligand. Overall, this study demonstrated that virulent NDV activates a M1-/M2-like mixed polarized activation of chicken macrophages by inhibition of TLR7, resulting in enhanced replication compared to lentogenic viruses.","output":"Enhanced Replication of Virulent Newcastle Disease Virus in Chicken Macrophages Is due to Polarized Activation of Cells by Inhibition of TLR7"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The time of COVID-19 lockdown has given us an opportunity to practice experimental methodologies of cultural geography I use early-20th-century Polish guides to Rome, Italy, to provide exercises in auto-geography The aim of these exercises is to enrich the practice of cultural geography by opening up to self-exploration and combining lectures and imagination with distanced spaces These exercises relate to finding the hidden narrator, understanding locational formulations, and assessing the role of our own assumptions and memories in studying urban narratives Although travel guides are typically read as sources of historical and cultural knowledge, I propose also reading them to better understand the relationship between reading practice and the researcher?s prior knowledge","output":"Walking Rome without leaving home: practicing cultural geography during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Italy, general practitioners (GPs) are ensuring continued access to primary care for citizens while also absorbing more of the impact of the crisis than most professional groups. The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between dimensions of burnout and various psychological features among Italian GPs during the COVID-19 emergency. A group of 102 GPs completed self-administered questionnaires available online through Google Forms, including Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short Form (IU), and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS). Cluster analysis highlighted four distinct burnout risk profiles: Low Burnout, Medium Risk, High Risk, and High Burnout. The High Burnout group showed both lower Resilience and lower CISS Task-oriented coping strategy than the Medium Risk group and higher IU Prospective than the Low Burnout group. Results of a linear regression analysis confirmed that CISS Emotion-oriented style positively predicted MBI Emotional Exhaustion, CISS Task-oriented and Emotion-oriented emerged as significant predictors (negatively and positively, respectively) of MBI Depersonalization, and Resilience positively predicted MBI Personal Accomplishment. In conclusion, the results showed that the COVID-19 emergency had a significant impact on GPs work management. Implementing task-oriented problem management, rather than emotional strategies, appears to protect against burnout in these circumstances. It is possible that the emotions related to the pandemic are too intense to be regulated and used productively to manage the professional issues that the COVID-19 pandemic presents.","output":"From Resilience to Burnout: Psychological Features of Italian General Practitioners During COVID-19 Emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During 2018, Black or African American (Black) persons accounted for 43% of all new diagnoses of HIV infection in the United States (1). The annual diagnosis rate (39.2 per 100,000 persons) among Black persons was four times the rate among all other racial/ethnic groups combined, indicating a profound disparity in HIV diagnoses (1,2). Community-level social and structural factors, such as social vulnerability, might help explain the higher rate of HIV diagnoses among Black persons. Social vulnerability refers to the potential negative health effects on communities caused by external stresses (3). CDC used National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS)* and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) data to examine the association between diagnosed HIV infections and social vulnerability among Black adults aged 18 years. Black adults in communities in the highest quartile of SVI were 1.5 times (rate ratio [RR] = 1.5;95% CI = 1.4-1.6) as likely to receive a diagnosis of HIV infection as were those in communities in the lowest quartile. Because of a history of racial discrimination and residential segregation, some Black persons in the United States reside in communities with the highest social vulnerability (4,5), and this finding is associated with experiencing increased risk for HIV infection. The development and prioritization of interventions that address social determinants of health (i.e., the conditions in which persons are born, grow, live, work, and age), are critical to address the higher risk for HIV infection among Black adults living in communities with high levels of social vulnerability. Such interventions might help prevent HIV transmission and reduce disparities among Black adults. Data on diagnoses of HIV infection among Black adults and reported to CDC through December 2019 were obtained from NHSS. Cases were geocoded to the U.S. Census Bureau tract level based on a person's residential address at the time of diagnosis. Census tract level social vulnerability data were obtained from the 2018 CDC SVI, which was developed to identify communities with the most potential needs (i.e., highest social vulnerability), before, during, and after public health events. Scores for overall SVI were generated using 15 population-based measures.. and were presented as percentile rankings by census tract, with higher scores indicating more vulnerability. SVI scores ranged from 0 to 1 and were categorized as quartiles based on their distribution among all U.S. Census tracts. NHSS data for Black adults with HIV diagnosed during 2018 were linked with SVI data. Data were analyzed by sex at birth with stratifications by age group and region of residence.. at time of diagnosis to assess differences in HIV diagnosis rates by SVI quartile. HIV diagnosis rates were calculated per 100,000 persons. RRs with 95% CIs were calculated comparing communities with the lowest SVI scores (Quartile 1) to those with the highest scores (Quartile 4) by sex at birth for age group and region of residence. Rates were considered significantly different if the 95% CIs of RRs excluded 1. Differences in numbers of diagnoses across the quartiles were analyzed by sex at birth and transmission category (i.e., male-to-male sexual contact, injection drug use, and heterosexual contact.) Rates and RRs were not calculated for transmission categories because of lack of population data. Data were statistically adjusted using multiple imputation techniques to account for missing HIV transmission categories (6). Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4;SAS Institute, Inc). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**Among the 13,807 diagnoses of HIV infection among Black adults in 2018, the number and percentage of diagnoses by SVI quartile was 1,045 (7.6%) in Quartile 1;1,881 (13.6%) in Quartile 2;3,423 (24.8%) in Quartile 3;and 7,205 (52.2%) in Quartile 4 (Table);SVI scores were missing for 253 persons (1.8%).

Given the pre-pandemic evidence for associations between PA and other health behaviours, changes in PA during the pandemic may have been detrimental for other health behaviours. This study aimed to evaluate whether changes in PA during and after the first national lockdown in the United Kingdom (UK) were associated with concurrent changes in other health behaviours, namely alcohol consumption, sleep, nutrition quality, diet quantity and sedentary time. Methods: Data were derived from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 52,784 adults followed weekly across 22 weeks of the pandemic from 23rd March to 23rd August 2020. Data were analysed using fixed effects regression. Results: There was significant within-individual variation in both PA and other health behaviours throughout the study period. Increased PA was positively associated with improved sleep and nutrition quality. However, increases in PA also showed modest associations with increased alcohol consumption and sedentary time. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that, whilst the first wave of COVID-19 restrictions were in place, increases in PA were associated with improved sleep and better diet. Encouraging people to engage in PA may therefore lead to positive change in other health behaviours in times of adversity. However, increases in PA were also associated with more engagement in the negative health behaviours of alcohol consumption and sedentary time. These associations could be a result of increases in available leisure time for many people during COVID-19 restrictions and require further investigation to inform future public health guidance.","output":"Longitudinal associations between physical activity and other health behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic: A fixed effects analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health policy pundits often observe that COVID-19 exposes healthcare's grave deficiencies, inequities and underdeveloped capacities - factors hobbling Canada's COVID-19 pandemic response This issue of Healthcare Quarterly explores some of these weaknesses, illuminating systemic problems that persist despite the cascading damage they cause It also features accounts of how healthcare leaders, providers and stakeholders did what was possible - not perfect - to contain COVID-19's consequences Other submissions remind us that even with or without COVID-19 and its all-consuming demands, work on other imperatives must continue","output":"From the Editors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we present a comprehensive in vitro characterization of the excised iterative, bimodular PCP-TE of the gramicidin S synthetase GrsB, which is able to act both as a ligation and a cyclization catalyst.

The mechanism of pandemic convergence is that the probability of a healthy persons encountering an infected person decreases progressively as the number of recovered people increases and the total number of viruses in the system decreases due to immunity. The existence of antibodies promotes recovery but is not an essential factor for pandemic convergence. By assuming the effect of immunity being proportional to the number of viruses rather than assuming a constant value, the model well reproduced the actual trend of the number of infected and recovered persons. This result suggests that the medically well-known fact that fever associated with infection enhances immunity is an essential requirement for pandemic convergence. Identifying and isolating infected persons is critical to overcome the pandemic and minimize economic deterioration, especially at the border of the system, such as airports.

The study employs System Generalised Method of Moment model (System GMM) to the panel dataset of 64 Indian firms from 2012 to 2018 to determine the synergy impacts and value creation post merger and acquisition (M&A). The outcome of the study signs that mergers create positive value for post merger acquiring firms, and lagged synergy influences future synergies positively. The lagged dependent variable synergy (p-value is 0.000) shows a significant positive effect on dependent variable synergy, which indicates that previous year sales of the firm have a positive effect on future year sales. If the acquisition of firm post merger and acquisition (M&A) effectively absorbs acquired firm resources and digests nutrition from those resources, then the value can be created, and synergy can be achieved, or at least not damaged.

With the resumption of elective surgeries and the continued planning of surgical recovery over the months (and possibly years) to follow, facilities must brace themselves for repeat waves of COVID-19. Thereby, herein we share the Pivot Plan, its implementation process, evaluation of patient safety, and program performance during a pandemic. This could inform the efforts of other institutions seeking to restart non-emergent surgeries during similarly trying times in the future. Methods The COI formed a multidisciplinary team of leaders that met weekly to design a Pivot Plan and a dashboard to guide the resumption of surgeries and assess the performance of the Pivot Plan. The plan revolved around four domains: safety, space, staff, and supplies. It was implemented in two COI-affiliated facilities: MidState Medical Center (MMC) and St. Vincents Medical Center (SVMC). Monthly metrics from May to November 2020 were compared to the six-month averages for the pre-pandemic baseline period from September 2019 to February 2020. Results The total number (N) of elective orthopaedic cases prior to the pandemic pre-COVID averaged 372 cases per month for MMC and 197 cases for SVMC. During the pandemic post-COVID, N averaging at 361 for MMC and 243 for SVMC illustrates COI was able to perform elective surgeries amid a worsening pandemic. Same-day (SD) discharge rates for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) pre-COVID averaged 8% for MMC and 3% for SVMC. Post-COVID, the SD average was 16.7% for MMC and 11.4% for SVMC. This data indicates that orthopaedic providers were cognizant of length of stay in order to reduce the risk of in-hospital exposure to COVID-19. The 30-day readmission (30R) rate for TJA pre-COVID averaged 1.4% for MMC and 2.7% for SVMC. A high level of care and follow-up is reflected in a lower average 30R post-COVID, 1.1% for both MMC and SVMC. Transitions for TJA patients to their home settings after surgery also reflect the quality of care and the efficiency of the patient throughput process with necessary precautions in place. Post-COVID, the patient transition to home (T) averaged 98.1% for MMC and 97.5% for SVMC compared to T = 96.8% for MMC and 88% for SVMC pre-COVID. No patients experienced deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during the time period of the project. Positive COVID-19 diagnosis 23 days after discharge was 0% at MMC and 0.2% at SVMC. Conclusion The COI Pivot Plan was successfully implemented at two different hospitals offering elective orthopaedic surgeries to a varied patient population. The precautions taken by COI were effective in controlling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus while returning to elective orthopaedic surgery. Furthermore, data collected before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that program performance and quality improved.","output":"A COVID-19 Pivot Plan to Resume Elective Surgeries at the Hartford Healthcare Connecticut Orthopaedic Institute"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores how various pressures, such as the international competitions referred to above, are leading to onerous reporting and accountability, which distract teachers from the core business of teaching, and may be sapping them of the time, energy, creativity, agency and will essential for good teaching.

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to the SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex.

There has been extensive research performed on SARS; however, the understanding of the pathophysiological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still limited. METHODS: This review drew upon the lessons learnt from SARS, in terms of epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis, to further understand the features of COVID-19. RESULTS: By comparing these two diseases, it found that COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, and higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases emerged in COVID-19 literature. Children starting with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe conditions and newborns whose mothers are infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed that the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, and the number of CD4+ and CD8+T-cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases.

Ursonic acid (UNA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid extracted from certain medicinal herbs such as Ziziphus jujuba. Since the pharmacological effects and associated mechanisms of UNA are not well-known, in this work, we attempt to introduce the therapeutic potential of UNA with a comparison to ursolic acid (ULA), a well-known secondary metabolite, for beneficial effects. UNA has a keto group at the C-3 position, which may provide a critical difference for the varied biological activities between UNA and ULA. Several studies previously showed that UNA exerts pharmaceutical effects similar to, or stronger than, ULA, with UNA significantly decreasing the survival and proliferation of various types of cancer cells. UNA has potential to exert inhibitory effects in parasitic protozoa that cause several tropical diseases. UNA also exerts other potential effects, including antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. Of note, a recent study highlighted the suppressive potential of UNA against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular modifications of UNA may enhance bioavailability, which is crucial for in vivo and clinical studies.

In addition to SARS-CoV-2 causing pneumonia, many studies have reported ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19. This article describes the effects and possible underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 on ischemic stroke.Materials and methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and other COVID-dedicated databases and the combination of the keywords 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19' and 'ischemic stroke' up to November 28, 2020.Results: SARS-CoV-2 invades the host through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in the brain and vascular endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause direct vascular disease or enhance the immunogenic thrombosis environment through several mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate the host immune response and can cause inflammation, coagulation disorders, renin angiotensin system disorders, hypoxia, and stress disorders, which may lead to the occurrence of ischemic stroke.Conclusions: Some patients with COVID-19 can develop ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke has a high risk of causing disability and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is hoped that when medical staff treat patients with COVID-19, they would pay attention to the occurrence of ischemic stroke to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","output":"The effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on ischemic stroke and the possible underlying mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with solid tumors and hematological neoplasia can be a special challenge for anesthetists with their multilayered core competences (induction of anesthesia, intensive care, emergency medicine, pain therapy and palliative medicine) due to the systemic manifestation of the disease especially in metastatic stages, to complex sequelae of toxic oncologic therapy especially in curatively intended treatment concepts, to difficult ethical decision-making especially in acute situations and to the special emotional state of the patient which can extend throughout the complete course of the disease.

METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from October 2012 to May 2015. Adult patients were included if they met the Berlin definition of ARDS. The indications for BAL were clinically suspected pneumonia-related ARDS and no definite microbial sample identified from tracheal aspirate or sputum. The presence of microbial pathogens and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 19,936 patients screened, 902 (4.5%) fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS. Of these patients, 255 (22.7%) had pneumonia-related ARDS and were included for analysis.

There is a gap in our understanding of bats as reservoirs of coronaviruses and there is a misconception that bats periodically transmit coronaviruses to humans. Future research should investigate bat viral diversity and loads at interfaces between humans and bats. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to evaluate viral strains circulating in mixed animal markets, where the coronaviruses circulated before becoming adapted to humans.

Testicular torsion is an emergent condition with higher risk of testicular loss with longer ischemic times. We sought to investigate whether patients with testicular torsion had longer time from symptom onset to initial presentation, longer total ischemic time, and higher rate of orchiectomy during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using billing data, we identified all patients age >1yo seen in our hospital from 1/1/2018 through 5/31/2020 who underwent emergent scrotal exploration for confirmed testicular torsion, comparing the COVID-19 crisis (3/1/2020-5/31/20) to the pre-COVID-19 period (1/1/2018-2/29/20). The primary outcome was time from symptom onset to initial presentation and secondary outcomes were ischemic time (time from symptom onset to entry of the OR) and orchiectomy rate. Parameters were compared with Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests; Poisson regression compared rates of torsion. RESULTS: Of 94 total cases, 77 occurred during the pre-COVID-19 period and 17 during the COVID-19 crisis. Median time from symptom onset to initial presentation was not significantly different (2.4 h [IQR 1.1 h-38.9] during COVID-19 vs. 5.6 h [IQR 1.6-16.9] during pre-COVID-19 period, p = 0.476). Time to presentation was >12 h in 5/17 patients (29%) during COVID-19 and 24/77 patients (31%) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 1.00).

The article is organized as follows. Initially the article explores the basic assumption that deontic operators acquire their meaning via social conventions generating personal rules having a mental content which belongs to a wider normative mind, a mind that obviously encompasses all sorts of choices. The article then describes the different types of personal rules, distinguishing social, moral, and legal rules across the normative mind, focusing on social rules within institutions, conceived as sets of rules in equilibrium. The core of this study puts to the test the taxonomy of personal (social, moral, and legal) rules within the normative mind by exploring a situation of dense normativity addressed by a 2021 Lancet paper concerning findings about tight-loose cultures during the Covid-19 crisis, and, for the sake of explanation, focuses on one of the main normative constraints that epitomizes the challenge of the Covid-19 crisis to tight-loose cultures: the wear-mask rule. These observations can be extended to other normative constraints of that crisis, but in essence they parse the interplay between the different types of personal rules, which not only are social, but also moral and legal, drawing conclusions that complement the findings of the Lancet paper with some critical observations. The article critically concludes with remarks about the co-existence of different normative systems of personal rules in a context of biopolitics and suggests that individual morality appears to be the core of normativity to address collective threats such as those caused by the Covid-19 crisis. ? 2021 De Gruyter.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality; thus, timely treatment is crucial to prevent poor prognosis. Therefore, an immediate emergency department (ED) visit is required; however, no domestic studies have reported the effect of COVID-19 on ED visits by patients with AMI. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the changes in the pattern of ED visits by patients with AMI by comparing visits during the COVID-19 outbreak period to those during two control periods. METHODS: This nationwide, retrospective study used registry data of the National Emergency Department Information System. The outbreak period was defined as the period between February 21, 2020 and April 1, 2020, while the control period was defined as the same time period in the preceding two years (2018 and 2019). The primary outcome of our study was the number of patients admitted to the ED owing to AMI during the outbreak and control periods. Secondary outcomes were time from symptom onset to ED visit, length of ED stay, and 30-day mortality following admission. RESULTS: During the outbreak period, 401,378 patients visited the ED; this number was lower than that during the control periods (2018: 577,548; 2019: 598,514). The number of patients with AMI visiting the ED was lower during the outbreak period (2,221) than during 2018 (2,437) and 2019 (2,591). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in ED visits by patients with AMI. We assume that this could likely be caused by misinterpretation of AMI symptoms as symptoms of respiratory infection, fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and restrictions in accessing emergency medical care owing to overburdened healthcare facilities. This study sheds light on the fact that healthcare and emergency medical staff members must work towards eliminating hurdles due to this pandemic for patients to receive timely emergency care, which in turn will help curb the growing burden of mortality.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Emergency Care Utilization in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction: a Nationwide Population-based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Matrine (MAR), oxymatrine (OMAR), and sophoridine (SPD) are natural alkaloids with varying biological activities; matrine was recently used for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the short half-lives and rapid elimination of these matrine-type alkaloids would lead to low oral bioavailability and serious side effects. Herein, resveratrol (RES) was selected as a co-former to prepare their co-amorphous systems to improve the therapeutic index. The formation of co-amorphous MAR-RES, OMAR-RES, and SPD-RES was established through powder X-ray diffraction and modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and NMR studies revealed the strong molecular interactions between resveratrol and these alkaloids, especially OMAR-RES. Matrine, oxymatrine, and sophoridine in the co-amorphous systems showed sustained release behaviors in the dissolution experiments, due to the recrystallization of resveratrol on the surface of co-amorphous drugs. The three co-amorphous systems exhibited excellent physicochemical stability under high relative humidity conditions. Our study not only showed that minor structural changes of active pharmaceutical ingredients may have distinct molecular interactions with the co-former, but also discovered a new type of sustained release mechanism for co-amorphous drugs. This promising co-amorphous drug approach may present a unique opportunity for repurposing these very promising drugs against COVID-19.","output":"Sustained Release of Co-Amorphous Matrine-Type Alkaloids and Resveratrol with Anti-COVID-19 Potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to examine the prevalence of food insecurity (FI) among the general college student population with a focus on student-athletes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FI in these groups.

Behavioral economics researchers suggest personalized, regular nudges can help college students make decisions that positively impact their college career and keep them on track for graduation. The current study presents the results of a randomized field experiment where a text messaging program was implemented in a large college at a public university. The intervention utilized a mixture of automated and personalized text messages from academic advisors and allowed for two-way communication between individual students and their major advisor. Mulitvariate analyses revealed the intervention had no impact on university persistence, but it did increase the odds of persisting in the college to the end of the semester, moving the average, overall college persistence rate from 93 to 95%. Effects were concentrated on underclass students, whose persistence rate moved from 87 to 93% at the college level. Underclass students also showed statistically significant university persistence effects, moving from 90 to 95%.

The traditional understanding of the relationship between wealth and the spread of contagious diseases is that similar to many precedent epidemics, the pandemic spread easily in poor neighborhoods in many countries. The environmental and socioeconomic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are still poorly understood, thus this paper examines the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the spread of the pandemic through a case study of Shenzhen, a Chinese megacity with many low-income rural migrants. The major finding is that wealthier and larger neighborhoods in Shenzhen were more likely to be infected in the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. This spread pattern is likely to result from Chinas strict control to prevent the pandemic, human mobility, and demographic characteristics such as income. This finding reveals a new phenomenon that contrasts with the traditional understanding of the influence of wealth on the spread of epidemics.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a neuroimaging technique that can be used to noninvasively map brain temperature (i.e., thermometry) over a large brain volume. To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range. Methods. Healthy participants aged 23-46 years (N=18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points, ~12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (TCRE) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of TCRE values. Results. The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2{degrees}C, with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time (F(1, 1591)=37.0, p < 0.0001) and for brain region (F(46, 1591)=2.66, p<0.0001). The time*brain region interaction was not significant (F(46, 1591)=0.80, p=0.83)). Participants' TCRE was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 - 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); 30 ROIs had a COVrep < 2.0%. Conclusions. Brain temperature demonstrated subtle regional variations that were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring pathological brain temperature changes when other modalities are unrevealing. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain TCRE, as well as the threshold above which TCRE is likely pathological.","output":"Repeatability and reproducibility of in-vivo brain temperature measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Little is known about the views of U.S. youth on COVID-19 or their use of face coverings. Closing this gap could facilitate messaging to promote COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. METHODS: In July 2020, a five-question text message survey was sent to 1,087 youth aged 14-24 years. Questions assessed youths' perceptions regarding the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, the potential impact of contracting COVID-19 on their lives, the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to others, and their use of face coverings around others with whom they do not live. Coding was conducted to assign responses to discrete categories and to identify common themes. RESULTS: Of 1,087 eligible participants, 797 (73.3%) were included in analyses. Of these participants, 27.3% believed they would likely contract COVID-19 in the next few months, 90.3% believed contracting COVID-19 would have a moderate or significant impact on their lives, 86.0% were moderately or very concerned about spreading COVID-19, and 89.2% reported wearing face coverings all or most of the time. Factors affecting face covering use included the desire to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, peer influence, and policy mandates. CONCLUSIONS: Youths' perceptions regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 varied, but most believed their lives would be adversely impacted if this occurred. Most youth were concerned about spreading COVID-19 and wore face coverings, but many made exceptions to face covering use when around close contacts.

The aim of this perspective is to better analyse the phenomenon. RESULTS: Some data suggest that new onset and recurrence/relapse of eating disorders are increasing due to the ongoing pandemic. Government restrictions, self-confinement, social isolation, restriction to healthcare facilities access, delayed access to diagnosis and cure, fear of contagion, distress and difficulties related to telemedicine approach are believed to contribute to this burden. Immune system dysfunction usually observed in undernourishment (e.g., anorexia nervosa) could play a role in delaying the diagnosis of respiratory infections, including COVID-19, and predisposing to possible bacterial superinfection. Conversely, patients with binge eating, obesity or metabolic syndrome are susceptible to high-grade systemic inflammation and poor prognosis once the infection has occurred. DISCUSSION: Despite some evidence, more detailed data combining research in the field of eating disorders and COVID-19 are required. Many data show that telemedicine has some beneficial aspects, but its impact on long-term mental health is still poorly understood. Short- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 in patients with eating disorders are unknown, but it is likely that they will become more apparent over time. CONCLUSION: Working on emotion regulating strategies in a post-pandemic world, when people have inadequate control over the background of negative emotions, could be a strategy for treatment in the future.

Changes were examined overall, by month, and by sex, race and ethnicity, insurance type, and income. Modified Poisson regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) for the prepandemic to pandemic changes. RESULTS: Depression screening at primary care visits declined from 77.6% to 75.8% during the pandemic period (PR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-1.06).

However, in the medial gastrocnemius (MG), mixed evidence exists on whether fascicle stretch amplitude influences the level of EIMD, thus questioning whether changes in fascicle mechanics underpin the RBE. An alternative hypothesis is that neural adaptations contribute to the RBE in this muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuromechanical adaptations during and after repeated bouts of a highly controlled muscle lengthening exercise that aimed to maximize EIMD in MG. In all, 20 subjects performed two bouts of 500 active lengthening contractions (70% of maximal activation) of the triceps surae, separated by 7 days. Ultrasound constructed fascicle length-torque (L-T) curves of MG, surface electromyography (EMG), maximum torque production, and muscle soreness were assessed before, 2 hours and 2 days after each exercise bout. The drop in maximum torque (4%) and the increase in muscle soreness (24%) following the repeated bout were significantly less than following the initial bout (8% and 59%, respectively), indicating a RBE. However, neither shift in the L-T curve nor changes in EMG parameters were present. Furthermore, muscle properties during the exercise were not related to the EIMD or RBE. Our results show that there are no global changes in gastrocnemius mechanical behavior or neural activation that could explain the observed RBE in this muscle.

Early detection of disease progression is thus pivotal in the development of prevention and mitigation strategies. In this study, we developed a diet-based, non-genetically modified mouse model for early CAVD progression, and explored the utility of two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy for early detection of CAVD progression. TPEF imaging provides label-free, non-invasive, quantitative metrics with the potential to correlate with multiple stages of CAVD pathophysiology including calcium deposition, collagen remodeling and osteogenic differentiation. METHODS Twenty-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control or pro-calcific diet for 16 weeks and monitored via echocardiography, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polarized light imaging. Additionally, TPEF imaging was used to quantify tissue autofluorescence (A) at 755 nm, 810 nm and 860 nm excitation, to calculate TPEF 755-860 ratio (A860/525/(A755/460 + A860/525)) and TPEF Collagen-Calcium ratio (A810/525/(A810/460 + A810/525)) in the murine valves. In a separate experiment, animals were fed the above diets till 28 weeks to assess for later-stage calcification. RESULTS Pro-calcific mice showed evidence of lipid deposition at 4 weeks and calcification at 16 weeks at the valve commissures. The valves of pro-calcific mice also showed positive expression for markers of osteogenic differentiation, myofibroblast activation, proliferation, inflammatory cytokines and collagen remodeling. Pro-calcific mice exhibited lower TPEF autofluorescence ratios, at locations coincident with calcification, that correlated with increased collagen disorganization and positive expression of osteogenic markers. Additionally, locations with lower TPEF autofluorescence ratios at 4 and 16 weeks exhibited increased calcification at later 28-week timepoints.

Many viral diseases have been treated with lectins due to their wide range of structures, specificity for carbohydrates, and ability to bind carbohydrates. Through hemagglutination assays, these proteins can be detected interacting with various carbohydrates on the surface of cells and viral envelopes. This review discusses the most robust lectins and their rationally engineered versions, such as lectibodies, as antiviral proteins. Fusion of lectin and antibodys crystallizable fragment (Fc) of immunoglobulin G (IgG) produces a molecule called a lectibody that can act as a carbohydrate-targeting antibody. Lectibodies can not only bind to the surface glycoproteins via their lectins and neutralize and clear viruses or infected cells by viruses but also perform Fc-mediated antibody effector functions. These functions include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). In addition to entering host cells, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein S1 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and downregulates it and type I interferons in a way that may lead to lung disease. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope are heavily glycosylated, which could make them a major target for developing vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic drugs. Lectibodies can lead to neutralization and clearance of viruses and cells infected by viruses by binding to glycans located on the envelope surface (e.g., the heavily glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein).","output":"Lectins and lectibodies: potential promising antiviral agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most common arboviral disease in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Like other regions, dengue-endemic areas have faced the additional public health and socio-economic impact of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 and dengue co-infections have been reported, with complicated patient management and care requirements. This review aimed to collate and synthesise current knowledge on the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 and dengue virus co-infection, a potentially important new dimension to be considered in public health management of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases from 1st January to 21st November 2020. The key search terms used were dengue and coronavirus. Descriptive analysis with graphical illustrations were used to present the clinical and laboratory parameters of the co-infection. RESULTS: Thirteen published papers and four news articles were included in the review. Most studies were case reports with a detailed description of the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the co-infection. All cases were in adults with the exception of a six-year old child. The common symptoms of co-infection were fever, dyspnea, headache, and cough. Common laboratory results included thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and leukopenia. Serious outcomes of co-infection included septic shock, acute respiratory disease syndrome and multi-organ failure, leading to death in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and dengue co-infection was associated with severe disease and fatal outcomes. The correct diagnosis and treatment of co-infection poses a substantial challenge due to the overlapping clinical and laboratory parameters. Therefore, confirmative diagnostic tests are necessary for accurate and timely diagnosis and patient management.

An overlooked angle is the potential psychosocial impact on PCPs as they place themselves at increased risk of infection. This study examines PCPs' concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS 216 PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were convenience sampled from three primary care organizations in Singapore. Participants completed an online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection, and a source of risk and concern to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks and the need to care for COVID-19 patients. Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high. PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors. CONCLUSIONS Primary care will continue to be crucial in outbreak management efforts.

The present study investigated the potential of isolated compounds from Clerodendrum volubile leaves to stall oxidative bursts in vitro and interact with ORF8 mRNA segments of the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome using computational tools. Five compounds, namely, harpagide, 1-(3-methyl-2-butenoxy)-4-(1-propenyl)benzene, ajugoside, iridoid glycoside and erucic acid, were isolated from C. volubile leaves, and their structures were elucidated using conventional spectroscopy tools. Iridoid glycoside is being reported for the first time and is thus regarded as a new compound. The ORF8 mRNA sequences of the translation initiation sites (TIS) and translation termination sites (TTSs) encoding ORF8 amino acids were retrieved from the full genome of SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking studies revealed strong molecular interactions of the isolated compounds with the TIS and TTS of ORF8 mRNA. Harpagide showed the strongest binding affinity for TIS, while erucic acid was the strongest for TTS. The immunomodulatory potentials of the isolated compounds were investigated on neutrophil phagocytic respiratory bursts using luminol-amplified chemiluminescence technique. The compounds significantly inhibited oxidative burst, with 1-(3-methyl-2-butenoxy)-4-(1-propenyl)benzene having the best activity. Ajugoside and erucic acid showed significant inhibitory activity on T-cell proliferation. These results indicate the potential of C. volubile compounds as immunomodulators and can be utilized to curb cytokine storms implicated in COVID-19 infection. These potentials are further corroborated by the strong interactions of the compounds with the TIS and TTS of ORF8 mRNA from the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome.","output":"Translational suppression of SARS-COV-2 ORF8 protein mRNA as a Viable therapeutic target against COVID-19: Computational studies on potential roles of isolated compounds from Clerodendrum volubile leaves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first phase of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that emerged at the end of 2019 has been brought under control in the mainland of China in March, while it is still spreading globally. When the pandemic will end is a question of great concern. A logistic model that depicts the growth rules of infected and recovered cases in Chinas mainland may shed some light on this question. This model well explained the data by 13 April from 31 countries that have been experiencing serious COVID-2019 outbreaks (R 2 0.95). Based on this model, the semi-saturation period (SSP) of infected cases in those countries ranges from 3 March to 18 June. According to the linear relationship between the growth rules for infected and for recovered cases identified from the Chinese data, we predicted that the SSP of the recovered cases outside China ranges from 22 March to 8 July. More importantly, we found a strong positive correlation between the SSP of infected cases and the timing of a governments response. Finally, this model was also applied to four regions that went through other coronavirus or Ebola virus epidemics (R 2 0.95). There is a negative correlation between the death rate and the logistic growth rate.

In this paper, authors explored basic segments of everyday and their subjective perception to what extent sleeping habits, physical inactivity, physical activity, nutritional habits and smoking have changed. METHODS: The online survey was conducted in nine European countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) in 4108 participants, aged 15-82 years. The survey took place 30 to 40 days after WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic state, from April 15th to May 3rd, 2020. RESULTS: The results have shown 30 minutes longer sleeping time, 50% longer physical inactivity time, 65% longer screen time, 43% shorter walking time, 24% shorter sport time and 37% longer physical work time. Additionally, body mass gains (0.3 kg) could be explained in 20.6% with meals sizes, unhealthy food consumption, screen time and sport time. Further, respondents reported more regular meals (44%) and healthier meals with less alcohol consumption and less smoking, which have been positive outcomes of home confinement. CONCLUSION: The findings draw attention to negative changes in everyday praxis (inactivity, body mass gain) after such a short period.

Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of nonpharmaceutical interventions pushing the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this phase of the pandemic many countries showed an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where either infection numbers grow explosively until herd immunity is reached or the epidemic is completely suppressed. Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, [Formula: see text] , below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above [Formula: see text] traditional epidemiological dynamics take place, e.g., as in susceptibleCinfectedCrecovered (SIR) models. When calibrating our model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find [Formula: see text]. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular, we compare the United States and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on.

In order to address this gap, a scoping review is being conducted. The objectives of this scoping review are to: (1) identify informatics competencies of relevance to nurse leaders, (2) identify frameworks or theories that have been used to develop informatics competencies for nurse leaders, (3) identify instruments used to assess the informatics competencies of nurse leaders and (4) examine the psychometric properties of identified instruments. METHODS Using the Arksey and O'Malley five-step framework, a literature review will be conducted using a scoping review methodology. The search will encompass academic and grey literature and include two primary databases and five secondary databases.

METHODS Between May 2017 and November 2018, 38 patients with suspected choledocholithiasis were prospectively enrolled in this study, regardless of whether they underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy. Transcystic choledochoscopy was routinely attempted following IOC in LC. RESULTS Five cases were excluded due to cholecystitis, bile duct anomaly, or liver cirrhosis. DCBDE was performed in the remaining 33 patients. The biliary tree was delineated by IOC in all patients. Subsequently, choledochosope was performed in 32 patients except for one who was found to have pancreaticobiliary malunion in IOC. The scope was successfully passed into the CBD in 25 (78.1%) patients. Choledochoscopy detected 3 (9.4%) cases of cystic duct stones and 4 (12.5%) cases of CBD stones which were not identified by IOC. All those stones were removed via cystic duct. There were no intra- and postoperative complications, except for two cases of wound infection and one case of a transient increase in serum amylase.

The phylogenetic analysis detected two B.1.1.28 and one P.2 main Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 clades, introduced from the southern and southeastern Brazilian regions into Rocha between early November and mid December, 2020. One synonymous mutation distinguishes the sequences of the main B.1.1.28 clade in Rocha from those widely distributed in RS. The minor B.1.1.28 cluster, distinguished by several mutations, harbours non-synonymous changes in the Spike protein: Q675H and Q677H, so far not concurrently reported. The convergent appearance of S:Q677H in different viral lineages and its proximity to the S1/S2 cleavage site raise concerns about its functional relevance. The observed S:E484K-VOI P.2 partial replacement of previously circulating lineages in Rocha might have increased transmissibility as suggested by the significant decrease in Ct values. Our study emphasizes the impact of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Uruguay and the need of reinforcing real-time genomic surveillance on specific Uruguayan border locations, as one of the key elements for achieving long-term COVID-19 epidemic control.","output":"Spatiotemporal dissemination pattern of SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.28-derived lineages introduced into Uruguay across its southeastern border with Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For emerging epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, quantifying travel is a key component of developing accurate predictive models of disease spread to inform public health planning. However, in many LMICs, traditional data sets on travel such as commuting surveys as well as non-traditional sources such as mobile phone data are lacking, or, where available, have only rarely been leveraged by the public health community. Evaluating the accuracy of available data to measure transmission-relevant travel may be further hampered by limited reporting of suspected and laboratory confirmed infections. Here, we leverage case data collected as part of a COVID-19 dashboard collated via daily reports from the Malagasy authorities on reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the 22 regions of Madagascar. We compare the order of the timing of when cases were reported with predictions from a SARS-CoV-2 metapopulation model of Madagascar informed using various measures of connectivity including a gravity model based on different measures of distance, Internal Migration Flow data, and mobile phone data. Overall, the models based on mobile phone connectivity and the gravity-based on Euclidean distance best predicted the observed spread. The ranks of the regions most remote from the capital were more difficult to predict but interestingly, regions where the mobile phone connectivity model was more accurate differed from those where the gravity model was most accurate. This suggests that there may be additional features of mobility or connectivity that were consistently underestimated using all approaches, but are epidemiologically relevant. This work highlights the importance of data availability and strengthening collaboration among different institutions with access to critical data - models are only as good as the data that they use, so building towards effective data-sharing pipelines is essential.","output":"Existing human mobility data sources poorly predicted the spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Madagascar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Manganese dioxide (MnO(2)) nanosheets have shown exciting potential in nanomedicine because of their ultrathin thickness, large surface area, high near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and good biocompatibility.

We argue that questions of safe disposal for diagnostics should not be an afterthought, only posed once questions of access have already been addressed. Moreover, responsibility for safe disposal of diagnostic waste should not fall solely on national health systems by default.

In this review, the current literature comparing decision-making in patients with BPD versus healthy controls is analyzed. Twenty-eight empirical studies were identified through a structured literature search. The effect sizes from studies applying comparable experimental tasks were analyzed. It was found that (1) BPD patients discounted delayed rewards more strongly; (2) reversal learning was not significantly altered in BPD; and (3) BPD patients achieved lower net gains in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Current psychotropic medication, sex and differences in age between the patient and control group moderated the IGT outcome. Altered decision-making in a variety of other tasks was supported by a qualitative review. In summary, current evidence supports the altered valuation of outcomes in BPD.

These lockdowns have led to temporal improvements in air quality. Here, we evaluate the changes in NO2 and O3 levels along with the associated impact upon premature mortality during the COVID-19 lockdown and deconfinement periods along the first epidemic wave across the provincial capital cities of Spain. We first quantify the change in pollutants solely due to the lockdown as the difference between business-as-usual (BAU) pollution levels, estimated with a machine learning-based meteorological normalization technique, and observed concentrations. Second, instead of using exposure-response functions between the pollutants and mortality reported in the literature, we fit conditional quasi-Poisson regression models to estimate city-specific associations between daily pollutant levels and non-accidental mortality during the period 2010-2018. Significant relative risk values are observed at lag 1 for NO2 (1.0047 [95% CI: 1.0014 to 1.0081]) and at lag 0 for O3 (1.0039 [1.0013 to 1.0065]). On average NO2 changed by -51% (intercity range -65.7 to -30.9%) and -36.4% (-53.7 to -11.6%), and O3 by -1.1% (-20.2 to 23.8%) and 0.6% (-12.4 to 23.0%), during the lockdown (57 days) and deconfinement (42 days) periods, respectively. We obtain a reduction in attributable mortality associated with NO2 changes of -119 (95% CI: -273 to -24) deaths over the lockdown, and of -53 (-114 to -10) deaths over the deconfinement. This was partially compensated by an increase in the attributable number of deaths, 14 (-72 to 99) during the lockdown, and 8 (-27 to 50) during the deconfinement, associated with the rise in O3 levels in the most populous cities during the analysed period, despite the overall small average reductions.

A requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, impaired vaccinia virus production. Here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway, TOFA and C75, reduce viral yield significantly, with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate, the pathway's end-product. Palmitate's major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation. Instead, the mitochondrial import and -oxidation of palmitate are essential, as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine, which target these two processes respectively. Moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. In contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the TCA cycle (anaplerosis). Cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial -oxidation of palmitate which drives the TCA cycle and energy production. Additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (ATP synthesis) that is ablated by etomoxir. The biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of TOFA, C75, or etomoxir, although the levels of viral DNA and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. However, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to TOFA and C75. Electron microscopic analysis of cells released into C75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their -oxidation drives robust ATP production.","output":"De novo Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Contributes Significantly to Establishment of a Bioenergetically Favorable Environment for Vaccinia Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A one-step, real-time reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) for rapid detection and serotyping of Indian foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is described.

This is mediated by pathological Connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel (HC) opening resulting in osmotic and ionic imbalances as well as cytokine production perpetuating the inflammatory environment. Gap19 is an intracellularly acting Cx43 mimetic peptide that blocks HC opening and thus promotes cell survival. However, native Gap19, which must enter the cell in order to function, exhibits low cell permeability. In this study, Gap19 was conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide, Xentry, to investigate if cellular uptake could be improved while maintaining peptide function. Cellular uptake of Xentry-Gap19 (XG19) was much greater than that of native Gap19 even under normal cell culture conditions. Peptide function was maintained post uptake as shown by reduced ethidium homodimer influx and ATP release due to Cx43 HC block. While XG19 blocked pathologic HC opening though, normal gap junction communication required for cell repair and survival mechanisms was not affected as shown in a dye scrape-load assay. Under hypoxic conditions, increased expression of Syndecan-4, a plasma membrane proteoglycan targeted by Xentry, enabled even greater XG19 uptake leading to higher inhibition of ATP release and greater cell survival. This suggests that XG19, which is targeted specifically to hypoxic cells, can efficiently and safely block Cx43 HC and could therefore be a novel treatment for hypoxic and inflammatory diseases.

The present study aimed to summarize economic evaluation evidence of preventing strategies, programs, and treatments of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and specialized databases of economic evaluation from December 2019 to July 2020 to identify relevant literature to economic evaluation of programs against COVID-19. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data from full-text articles, and did their quality assessment by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Then, quality synthesis of results was done. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies of economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. The CHEERS scores for most studies (n = 9) were 85 or higher (excellent quality). Eight studies scored 70 to 85 (good quality), eight studies scored 55 to 70 (average quality), and one study < %55 (poor quality). The decision-analytic modeling was applied to twenty-three studies (88%) to evaluate their services. Most studies utilized the SIR model for outcomes.

Included studies had to report patient-reported pain outcomes (e.g., BPI total pain, GCPS pain intensity, RMDQ pain-related disability), include primary care as an intervention setting, and demonstrate some evidence of teamwork or teaming; specifically, they needed to involve at least two clinicians interacting with each other and with patients in an ongoing process over at least two timepoints. We assessed study quality with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We narratively synthesized intervention team structures and processes, comparing among interventions that reported a clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported pain outcomes defined by the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). RESULTS We included 13 total interventions in our review, of which eight reported a clinically meaningful improvement in at least one patient-reported pain outcome. No included studies had an overall high risk of bias. We identified the role of a care manager as a common structural feature of the interventions with some clinical effect on patient-reported pain. The team processes involving clinicians varied across interventions reporting clinically improved pain outcomes. However, when analyzing team processes involving patients, six of the interventions with some clinical effect on pain relied on pre-scheduled phone calls for continuous patient follow-up.

The pooled prevalence of overall medication non\\\\adherence was 14.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 12.3%, 17.2%) and that of medication discontinuation (i.e., stopping of prescriptions) and poor implementation (i.e., not taking medication at the dose/frequency prescribed) as 9.5% (CI: 5.1%, 14.0%) and 9.6% (CI: 6.2%, 13.0%), respectively. Non\\\\initiation (i.e., not starting/not filling new prescriptions) was not addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Medication taking among individuals with rheumatic diseases during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic varies globally. Unclear reporting and extensive variation in research methods between studies creates barriers to research replication, comparison, and generalization to specific patient populations. Future research in this area should use consistent and transparent approaches to defining and measuring medication taking problems in order to ensure findings appropriately describe the epidemiology of medication adherence and have the potential to identify modifiable targets for improving patient care.","output":"A rapid review of medication taking (adherence) among patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to SARS-CoV, can bind to human cell surface receptor ACE2 through its S-protein, sequentially infecting human cells such as respiratory epithelial cells or corneal and conjunctival tissues, thereby invading the human body.

SETTINGS: National populations in 186 United Nations countries and territories and populations in first-level subnational administrative entities in Brazil, China, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain and the USA. PARTICIPANTS: None (death statistics only). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: An unstandardised occurrence/exposure rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate; an indirectly age-and-sex standardised rate that can be derived even when the breakdown of COVID-19 deaths by age and sex required for direct standardisation is unavailable; the reduction in life expectancy at birth corresponding to the 2020 number of COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: To date, the highest unstandardised rate has been in New York, at its peak exceeding the state 2017 crude death rate. Populations compare differently after standardisation: while parts of Italy, Spain and the USA have the highest unstandardised rates, parts of Mexico and Peru have the highest standardised rates. For several populations with the necessary data by age and sex for direct standardisation, we show that direct and indirect standardisation yield similar results. US life expectancy is estimated to have declined this year by more than a year (?1.26 years), far more than during the worst year of the HIV epidemic, or the worst 3 years of the opioid crisis, and to reach its lowest level since 2008. Substantially larger reductions, exceeding 2 years, are estimated for Panama, Peru, and parts of Italy, Spain, the USA and especially, Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: With lesser demand on data than direct standardisation, indirect standardisation is a valid alternative to adjust international comparisons for differences in population distribution by sex and age-groups. A number of populations have experienced reductions in 2020 life expectancies that are substantial by recent historical standards.","output":"Beyond deaths per capita: comparative COVID-19 mortality indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current biotechnological applications such as biosensors, protein arrays, and microchips require oriented immobilization of enzymes.

This paper assesses what is known about the likely economic implications of either current trends or the transformation to a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy in the years to 2050 for which GEO-6 calls. A key conclusion is that no conventional costCbenefit analysis for either scenario is possible. This is because the final cost of meeting various decarbonisation and resource-management pathways depends on decisions made today in changing behaviour and generating innovation. The inadequacies of conventional modelling approaches generally lead to understating the risks from unmitigated climate change and overstating the costs of a low-carbon transition, by missing out the cumulative gains from path-dependent innovation. This leads to a flawed conclusion as to how to respond to the climate emergency, namely that significant reductions in emissions are prohibitively expensive and, therefore, to be avoided until new, cost-effective technologies are developed. We argue that this is inconsistent with the evidence and counterproductive in serving to delay decarbonisation efforts, thereby increasing its costs. Understanding the processes which drive innovation, change social norms and avoid locking in to carbon- and resource-intensive technologies, infrastructure and behaviours, will help decision makers as they ponder how to respond to the increasingly stark warnings of natural scientists about the deteriorating condition of the natural environment.","output":"The costs and benefits of environmental sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic presents a global crisis and authorities have encouraged the population to promote preventive health behaviors to slow the spread of the virus.

The present study overcomes this limitation and affords a validation of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual framework for explaining the adoption of handwashing and limitation of social contacts, two health behaviors that highly differ in their nature. Specifically, we compare TPB model on these two protective behaviors among people living in Belgium (N = 3744) and France (N = 1060) during the COVID-19 sanitary crisis. Data were collected from March 18 until April 19, 2020, which corresponds to the spring lockdown and the first peak of the pandemic in these countries. Results indicated that more positive attitudes, greater social norms, increased perceived control and higher intentions were related to higher adherence to handwashing and limitation of social contacts, for both Belgian and French residents. Ultimately, we argued that the TPB model tends to manifest similarly across countries in explaining health behaviors, when comparing handwashing and limitation of social contacts among individuals living in different national contexts.","output":"The Theory of Planned Behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison of health behaviors between Belgian and French residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a scarcity of data on lung ultrasound (LUS) in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

A limited anterolateral LUS was performed to limit time spent in isolation rooms by ultrasound operators. We chose to use a hand-held ultrasound device due to portability and superior confidence in infection control. Both linear and phased array probes were used to obtain images of the pleura and lung. Of 69 patients who had lung ultrasound images saved and were included in the analysis, 36 were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Despite multiple attempts to address this unmet need, there have been minimal advances in clinical management, outcomes, and accuracy of diagnostic testing options over the last 3 decades. One strong contributor to a lack of medical progress is a variable case definition of disease. The inability to agree on a precise definition greatly reduces the likelihood of aligning findings from epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers, which, in turn, severely hinders progress toward improving outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS Pediatric consensus definitions for sepsis are not accurate in term infants and are not appropriate for preterm infants. In contrast to the defined multistage criteria for other devastating diseases encountered in the NICU (e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia), there is significant variability in the criteria used by investigators to substantiate the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of carnosine or -alanine supplementation on markers of glycemic control and insulin resistance in humans and animals. We performed a systematic search of 6 electronic databases up to 31 December 2020. Primary outcomes were changes in 1) fasting glucose, 2) glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and 3) 2-h glucose following a glucose-tolerance test. A set of additional outcomes included fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment of -cell function (HOMA-) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2.0 (human studies) and the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB (animal studies) tools; and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty. We used Bayesian hierarchical random-effects models, with informative priors for human data and noninformative priors for animal data. Inferences were made on posterior samples generated by Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo using 90% credible intervals (90% CrI) and calculated probabilities. Twenty studies (n = 4 human, n = 16 rodent) were included, providing data for 2 primary outcomes (fasting glucose and HbA1c) and 3 additional outcomes (fasting insulin, HOMA-, and HOMA-IR). The model provides evidence that supplementation decreases fasting glucose [humans: mean difference (MD)0.5 = -0.95 mmol  L-1 (90% CrI: -2.1, 0.08); rodent: MD0.5 = -2.26 mmol  L-1 (90% CrI: -4.03, -0.44)], HbA1c [humans: MD0.5 = -0.91% (90% CrI: -1.46, -0.39); rodents: MD0.5 = -1.05% (90% CrI: -1.64, -0.52)], HOMA-IR [humans: standardized mean difference (SMD)0.5 = -0.41 (90% CrI: -0.82, -0.07); rodents: SMD0.5 = -0.63 (90% CrI: -1.98, 0.65)], and fasting insulin [humans: SMD0.5 = -0.41 (90% CrI: -0.77, -0.07)].

In June 2020 NAD circulated optional surveys to leads for dementia in acute hospitals and carers asking about the impact of the pandemic on the organisation and provision of hospital care. METHODS: Anonymous survey links were sent to hospital dementia leads directly and circulated to carers of people with dementia via social media and representative organisations. Dementia Leads questions included whether they and/or their team had been redeployed during the pandemic and whether wards had access to specialist services. Carers questions included whether patients needs were discussed, whether they were permitted to visit/how this was communicated, any measures to facilitate communication with their loved ones, and whether they were updated about progress and discharge. RESULTS: 53 dementia hospital leads completed the questionnaire. 32% had been redeployed to other clinical areas during the pandemic, 45% said the same for members of the dementia team. Specialist support for people with dementia on both Covid and Non-Covid wards was significantly compromised. 32 carers completed the questionnaire. 48% were not asked about the needs of the patient they cared for, 90% not allowed to visit, 43% were not given any explanation about visiting and 48% not given support to keep in touch with their loved one. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical priorities inevitably meant redeployment of dementia specialist staff, and changes to visiting. However, continuation of specialist support is a requirement for people with dementia admitted to hospital. Liaison with carers/families must be a priority, including facilitating remote support.

The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a multi-modal quality improvement (QI) strategy to promote resource stewardship by reducing routine day 3 (d3) bloodwork and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for patients undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) and timed intercourse (IC) treatment cycles. METHODS: After literature review, clinic stakeholders at an academic fertility centre met to discuss d3 testing utility and factors contributing to d3 bloodwork/TVUS in IC/IUI treatment cycles. Consensus was reached that it was unnecessary in patients taking oral/no medications. The primary intervention changed the default setting on the electronic order set to exclude d3 testing for IC/IUI cycles with oral/no medications. Exceptions required active test selection. Protocols were updated and education sessions were held. The main outcome measure was the proportion of cycles receiving d3 bloodwork/TVUS during the 8-week post-intervention period compared with the 8-week pre-intervention period. Balancing measures included provider satisfaction, pregnancy rates, and incidence of cycle cancellation. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the proportion of cycles receiving d3 TVUS (57.2% vs 20.8%, p < 0.001) and &#8805; 1 blood test (58.6% vs 22.8%, p < 0.001) was observed post-intervention. There was no significant difference in cycle cancellation or pregnancy rates pre- and post-intervention (p = 0.86). Treatment with medications, cyst history, prescribing physician, and treatment centre were associated with receiving d3 bloodwork/TVUS. 74% of providers were satisfied with the intervention. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in IC/IUI treatment cycles that received d3 bloodwork/TVUS was achieved without measured negative treatment impacts. During a pandemic, eliminating routine d3 bloodwork/TVUS represents a safe way to reduce monitoring appointments and exposure.","output":"Reducing day 3 baseline monitoring bloodwork and ultrasound for patients undergoing timed intercourse and intrauterine insemination treatment cycles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While inquiry in operations research (OR) modeling of urban planning processes is long-standing, on the whole, the OR discipline has not influenced urban planning practice, teaching and scholarship at a level of other domains such as public policy and information technology. Urban planning presents contemporary challenges that are complex, multi-stakeholder, data-intensive, and ill structured. Could an OR approach which focuses on the complex, emergent nature of cities, the institutional environment in which urban planning strategies are designed and implemented and which puts citizen engagement and a critical approach at the center enable urban planning to better meet these challenges?

We discuss recent work in transportation, housing, and community development that illustrates the benefits of embracing an enhanced OR modeling approach both in the framing of the model and in its implementation, while bringing to the fore three cautionary themes. First, a mechanistic application of decision modeling principles rooted in stylized representations of institutions and systems using mathematics and computational methods may not adequately capture the central role that human actors play in developing neighborhoods and communities. Second, as innovations such as the mass adoption of automobiles decades ago led to auto-centric city design show, technological innovations can have unanticipated negative social impacts. Third, the current COVID pandemic shows that approaches based on science and technology alone are inadequate to improving community lives.

Novel coronavirus (nCoV), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease.

Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network, using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions.

These proteins are considered as potential human targets for nCoV bait proteins. A gene-ontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at 99.98% specificity threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently identified using the SIS model.

The breaking of contagion chains relies on two complementary strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews and a digital (app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing. We compare their effectiveness using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure. This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic hybrid protocols.","output":"Stochastic sampling effects favor manual over digital contact tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of oral ribavirin (RBV) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections is not well studied. With the drastic increase in the cost of aerosolized RBV, we aimed to compare outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients treated with oral or aerosolized RBV for RSV infections. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 124 HCT recipients with RSV infections treated with oral or aerosolized RBV from September 2014 through April 2017. An immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) was used to classify patients as low, moderate, or high risk for progression to lower respiratory infection (LRI) or death. RESULTS: Seventy patients (56%) received aerosolized RBV and 54 (44%) oral RBV. Both groups had a 27% rate of progression to LRI (P = 1.00). Mortality rates did not significantly differ between groups (30-day: aerosolized 10%, oral 9%, P = 1.00; 90-day: aerosolized 23%, oral 11%, P = .10). Classification and regression tree analysis identified ISI 7 as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality. For patients with ISI 7, 30-day mortality was significantly increased overall, yet remained similar between the aerosolized and oral therapy groups (33% for both). After propensity score adjustment, Cox proportional hazards models showed similar mortality rates between oral and aerosolized therapy groups (30-day: hazard ratio [HR], 1.12 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .345C3.65, P = .845).

HCMV vaccine has emerged as an effective approach to prevent HCMV infection particularly for the development of multiple viral antigens vaccination and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted polyepitope technology. As the Chinese population makes up more than one fifth of the population worldwide, it is important to develop HCMV vaccines more specific for the Chinese population by targeting Chinese-restricted HLA alleles and antigens. In the present study, we designed a novel chimeric polyepitope vaccine based on the replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5F35, which encodes 83 HCMV T cell epitopes from 15 different HCMV antigens, restricted to 14 HLA I and 7 HLA II alleles that cover 92% of the Chinese population.

The effect of lockdown measures on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is currently uncertain. In this article, we analyse the effects of the lockdown measures on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in one of the epicentres in SA. OBJECTIVES: To measure the effects of lockdown measures introduced in SA on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates (ARs, the percentage of individuals who tested positive in a specified time period) in Gauteng Province during a 4-month period (March - June 2020). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive database from an independent pathology laboratory in Gauteng. We analysed trends of positivity rates of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests done during the 4-month period. The ARs are reported over time (unweighted and age-weighted 14-day moving averages) by age groups, gender, and different regions/districts in Gauteng. RESULTS: A total of 162 528 tests were performed at a private laboratory between 5 March and 30 June 2020, of which 20 574 were positive (overall AR 12.7%). These positive tests constituted 44.8% of all positive cases in the province (20 574/45 944). Sixty-two percent of all tests were done in June during lockdown level 3. There was an exponential increase in the AR in June (18.3%) when lockdown was eased to level 3, in comparison with 4.2% (March), 2.2% (April) and 3.3% (May). The increase in June was seen in all the age groups, although it was more pronounced in the 21 - 60 years age groups than the younger (0 - 20 years) and older (&gt;60 years) age groups. The AR was significantly higher in males (13.2%) compared with females (12.1%) (&#967;2 test, p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study testify to the rapid increase in ARs resulting from easing of the lockdown regulations, especially to level 3 in June. Of concern is the upward trend in the AR across all age groups, especially &lt;20 years (15.9%), which was not reported in other parts of the world. Population age dynamics should therefore be considered when taking future decisions about lockdown regulations.","output":"The effect of lockdown regulations on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Gauteng Province, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For years, the USMLE Step 1 has acted as an unofficial concours for medical students applying to residency positions in the United States. The three-digit numeric score has been used to rank thousands of applicants without any evidence of validity. The USMLE will soon change score reporting to a pass/fail outcome. The main reason given was to address the concerns about its effects on the well-being of the students and medical education. It is argued that time for change has come. The authors discuss the various viewpoints of the stakeholders and the effects of this change on applicants and potential changes on the undergraduate medical curriculum. Furthermore, this article discusses several metrics that can be utilized in the application process in lieu of the USMLE Step 1. Additionally, some novel key metrics in the application process are identified, and their unique dynamic and adaptive characteristics are deliberated. Finally, the benefits of a transparent and holistic process are strongly advocated.","output":"Perspectives on Transitioning Step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination to a Pass/Fail Scoring Model: Defining New Frameworks for Medical Students Applying for Residency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on our present knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is collectively summarized in this work, it is shown that water plays a crucial role in stabilizing the virus, in such a way that its viability may reduce from a few days to a few seconds in the absence of water layer. Water not only provides a protective shell for the virus in which it is enveloped, but enhances its binding with the human cell. Therefore, one may conclude that the dehydration of the hydrated virus makes it much more vulnerable, due to the fact that if it is exposed to many chemicals it will be deactivated; even by particles in air, such as ozone, singlet oxygen and pollutants. Thermodynamically, the dehydration may be facilitated at higher temperature, low humidity, and exposure to deliquescent materials. We have concluded that if the contaminated air passes over or through some water absorbents, like calcium chloride, with enough time contact, the virus is expected to become dehydrated and deactivated shortly afterward. If the time contact is not enough for the deactivation, the air may be exposed to the blue or UVC lights as well. The conclusion is based on the hydratedCdehydrated equilibrium of the coronavirus introduced in this work.","output":"Vital role of water in longevity of SARS-CoV-2 and enhancing its binding with human cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleoside analogues are reagents that resemble the structure of natural nucleosides and are widely applied in antiviral and anticancer therapy.

Even before the notification of the first autochthonous cases, the SARS-CoV-2 associated syndrome (COVID-19) had raised an intense attention in the public opinion (3), with a counterproductive over-abundance of mixed quality information. As even Italian healthcare workers (HCWs) were not spared by subsequent misunderstandings and knowledge gaps during the previous influenza pandemic of 2009 (4), we performed a web-based survey (Google? Modules), specifically aimed to characterize knowledge status and risk perceptions in a sample from participating to 6 Facebook discussion groups (181,684 total unique members at the time of the study). The questionnaire was made available between February 1st and 7th, 2020, i.e. around 2 weeks before the first COVID-19 was officially diagnosed in Italian residents. Overall, the sampled population included 2106 respondents (Table 1), and 39.3% were HCWs. Even though HCWs were more likely to exhibit a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 related issues (aOR 2.195, 95%CI 1.809 to 2.664), they were not exempt for misunderstandings, particularly on actual incidence and lethality of COVID-19. Interestingly, most of respondents were aware of the main clinical features of COVID-19, with HCWs more frequently acknowledging that the COVID-19 may run pauci- or even asymptomatic (86.3% vs. 79.1%), resembling an Influenza-Like Illness (i.e. fever, cough, headache, etc.), with a potential latency up to 14 days (859% vs 803%), eventually spreading by droplets (98.5% vs. 92.7%) rather through running water (92.3% vs 79.8%), or blood/body fluids (88.0% vs. 70.4%). Retrospectively, the assessment of preventive measures and risk perception appears somewhat worrisome. For instance, while HCWs were more likely to acknowledge as an appropriate preventive measure wearing a filtering mask (i.e. N95/FFP2/3 mask; aOR 2.296, 95%CI 1.507 to 3.946), around ? of HCWs failed to recognize the importance of such personal protective equipment, while 7.4% felt as appropriate the wearing of a surgical mask. Moreover, not only COVID-19 was appropriately acknowledged as a severe disease by only 62.0% of respondents, with no differences between HCWs and non-HCWs, but an even smaller share (i.e. 8.0%) reported any concern for being infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. In fact, at the time of the survey SARS-CoV-2 was more properly associated with international travelers (26.7%). Our results are therefore of certain interests for several reasons. First at all, early epidemiological reports on the Italian cases of COVID-19 hint towards some failures in the initial management of incident cases (5-6). In fact, in our survey a large share of respondents substantially overlooked the risk to interact with SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects, that was otherwise perceived as a not-so-severe disease (i.e. \\"nothing more than a seasonal flu\\", as often described in some social media) (7). Moreover, around a 1/3 of HCWs participating to the study presumptively did not use proper personal protective equipment for the airways interacting with possible COVID-19 cases, either underestimating the infection risk or being unable to recognize early symptoms. Actually, the base of evidence shared by participants at the time of the study substantially ignored that COVID-19 may be characterized by dermatologic and gastro-intestinal symptoms (8-9). As most of infections may be actually pauci- or asymptomatic, such early exposure in the healthcare settings may have contributed to the quick spreading of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Northern Italy. Therefore, despite the intrinsic limits of a convenience sampling, web-based survey (10), our study stresses the importance to improve the overall quality of information on COVID-19 conveyed not only in HCWs, but also in the general population. Moreover, our data may contribute to clarify the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy.","output":"Inappropriate risk perception for SARS-CoV-2 infection among Italian HCWs in the eve of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of the pandemic, humanitarian medicine has been discontinued. Until now, there have been no general recommendations on how humanitarian surgical missions should be organized. METHODS: Based on our experience in the field of humanitarian surgical missions to Sub-Saharan Africa, a panel of recommendations in times of COVID-19 was developed. The fields under study were as follows: (1) Planning of a multidisciplinary project; (2) Organization of the infrastructure; (3) Screening, management and treatment of SARS-COV-2; (4) Diagnostic tests for SARS-COV-2; (5) Surgical priorization and (6) Context of patients during health-care assistance. We applied a risk bias measurement to obtain a consensus among humanitarian health-care providers with experience in this field. RESULTS: A total of 94.36% of agreement were reached for the approval of the recommendations. Emergency surgery must be a priority, and elective surgery adapted. For emergency surgery, we established a priority level 1a (< 24 h) and 1b (< 72 h). For an elective procedure, according our American College of Surgeon adaptation score, process with more than 60 points should be reconsidered. Due to the low life expectancy in many African countries, we consider 45-50 years as age of risk. In case of SARS-COV-2 active infection or high clinical suspicion, the screening, management and treatment should be following the international guidelines adapted to duration of the stay, available infrastructure, size of the cooperation team and medical resources.

The previous literature rarely solved this real-time issue, and there is a lack of public research proposing an effective way forward on it. However, the study examines the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on energy consumption and CO(2) emission. The design of the study is quantitative, and the data is acquired from different online databases. The model of the study is inferred by using panel unit root test and ARDL test. The robustness of study findings was checked through panel quantile regression. The findings highlighted that the COVID-19 outbreak is negatively significant with energy consumption and CO(2) emission. The study suggested revising the energy consumption patterns by developing and implementing the national action plan for energy consumption and environmental protection. The study also contributed in knowledge by suggesting the novel insight into CO(2) emission and energy consumption patterns during COVID-19 pandemic and recommended to consider renewable energy transition methods as an opportunity for the society. For a more effective management of energy consumption and environmental pollution, country-specific measures are suggested to be taken, and the national government should support the concerned public departments, ministries and private organizations on it.

Understanding the incidence of secondary pulmonary infections and the associated bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified can improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review aims to determine the incidence of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and describe the bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified. METHOD: We perform a literature search and select articles with confirmed diagnoses of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections that occur 48 h after admission, using respiratory tract cultures in hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. We exclude articles involving co-infections defined as infections diagnosed at the time of admission by non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses, bacteria, and fungal microorganisms. RESULTS: The incidence of secondary pulmonary infections is low at 16% (4.8-42.8%) for bacterial infections and lower for fungal infections at 6.3% (0.9-33.3%) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Secondary pulmonary infections are predominantly seen in critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The most common bacterial microorganisms identified in the respiratory tract cultures are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common microorganism identified to cause secondary fungal pulmonary infections. Other rare opportunistic infection reported such as PJP is mostly confined to small case series and case reports. The overall time to diagnose secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections is 10 days (2-21 days) from initial hospitalization and 9 days (4-18 days) after ICU admission. The use of antibiotics is high at 60-100% involving the studies included in our review. CONCLUSION: The widespread use of empirical antibiotics during the current pandemic may contribute to the development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, and antimicrobial stewardship programs are required for minimizing and de-escalating antibiotics. Due to the variation in definition across most studies, a large, well-designed study is required to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of secondary pulmonary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","output":"State-of-the-art review of secondary pulmonary infections in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The necessity of hybrid and more accessible options for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) has taken on increased urgency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and its lasting impacts.

Nonclinical safety studies with nirmatrelvir are essential in informing benefit-risk of Paxlovid and were conducted to support clinical development. In vivo safety pharmacology assessments included a nervous system/pulmonary study in rats and a cardiovascular study in telemetered monkeys. Potential toxicities were assessed in repeat dose studies of up to 1 month in rats and monkeys. Nirmatrelvir administration (1,000 mg/kg, p.o.) to male rats produced transient increases in locomotor activity and respiratory rate but did not affect behavioral endpoints in the functional observational battery. Cardiovascular effects in monkeys were limited to transient increases in blood pressure and decreases in heart rate, observed only at the highest dose tested (75 mg/kg per dose b.i.d; p.o.). Nirmatrelvir did not prolong QTc-interval or induce arrhythmias. There were no adverse findings in repeat dose toxicity studies up to 1 month in rats (up to 1,000 mg/kg daily, p.o.) or monkeys (up to 600 mg/kg daily, p.o.). Nonadverse, reversible clinical pathology findings without clinical or microscopic correlates included prolonged coagulation times at 60 mg/kg in rats and increases in transaminases at 600 mg/kg in monkeys.

The cardiovascular system is a main target of the inflammatory process that frequently causes myocardial dysfunction, myopericarditis, coronary artery dilation, hypotension, and shock. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children-associated myocarditis is usually characterized by fever, tachycardia, non-specific electrocardiogram abnormalities, and left ventricular dysfunction, but serious tachyarrhythmias may also occur. We report two cases of patients with MIS-C-associated myocarditis who developed severe bradycardia. Case summary Two female adolescents with recent history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were initially hospitalized for long-lasting high-grade fever and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Both patients were diagnosed with MIS-C-associated myocarditis for elevation of markers of myocardial injury (mean highly-sensitive cardiac troponin 2663 pg/mL, mean N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide 5097 pg/mL) and left ventricular dysfunction, which was subsequently confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance. Both patients developed a severe sinus bradycardia (lowest heart rate 36 and 42, respectively), which appeared refractory to the treatment with intravenous Methylprednisolone and Immunoglobulins, despite a clinical and biochemical improvement. The use of Anakinra (a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist), was associated with a rapid improvement of cardiac rhythm and excellent clinical outcome at 6 months of follow-up. Discussion In patients with MIS-C-associated myocarditis, a continuous cardiac monitoring is mandatory to promptly identify potential conduction abnormalities. Adolescents may present bradycardia as a rhythm complication. We experienced a rapid recovery after treatment with Anakinra, to be considered as add-on therapy in cases refractory to standard anti-inflammatory treatment.","output":"Bradycardia associated with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A total of 123 community paediatricians and 23 microbiology laboratories studied the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in Italy.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are still unclear. The Euro-COVIMID study aimed to determine the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as factors associated with COVID-19 occurrence and the impact of the pandemic in its management. METHODS: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj?gren's syndrome, or giant cell arteritis were recruited from six tertiary referral centres in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Demographics, comorbidities, treatments, and recent disease flares, as well as information on COVID-19 symptoms, were collected through a questionnaire completed by participants. SARS-CoV-2 serology was systematically tested. The main outcome was the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were assessed by multivariable logistic regression, and incidence of recent disease flares, changes in treatments for underlying disease, and the reasons for treatment changes were also assessed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04397237. FINDINGS: Between June 7 and Dec 8, 2020, 3136 patients with an immune-mediated inflammatory disease answered the questionnaire. 3028 patients (median age 58 years [IQR 46C67]; 2239 [739%] women and 789 [261%] men) with symptomatic COVID-19, serological data, or both were included in analyses. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 166 (55% [95% CI 47C64]) of 3018 patients who had serology tests. Symptomatic COVID-19 occurred in 122 (40% [95% CI 34C48]) of 3028 patients, of whom 24 (197%) were admitted to hospital and four (33%) died. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (odds ratio 118, 95% CI 105C133; p=00063), and higher numbers of recent disease flares (127, 102C158; p=0030), whereas use of biological therapy was associated with reduced risk (051, 032C082; p=00057). At least one disease flare occurred in 654 (216%) of 3028 patients. Over the study period, 519 (206%) of 2514 patients had treatment changes, of which 125 (241%) were due to the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: This study provides key insights into the epidemiology and risk factors of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Overall, immunosuppressants do not seem to be deleterious in this scenario, and the control of inflammatory activity seems to be key when facing the pandemic.

Here, we report the experience of one clinic that converted its outpatient care from personal appointments to telemedicine services. METHODS: Documentations of telephone contacts and telemedicine consultations at the Epilepsy Center Frankfurt Rhine-Main were recorded in detail between March and May 2020 and analyzed for acceptance, feasibility, and satisfaction of the conversion from personal to telemedicine appointments from both patients' and medical professionals' perspectives. RESULTS: Telephone contacts for 272 patients (mean age: 38.7 years, range: 17C79 years, 55.5% female) were analyzed. Patient-rated medical needs were either very urgent (6.6%, n = 18), urgent (23.5%, n = 64), less urgent (29.8%, n = 81), or nonurgent (39.3%, n = 107). Outpatient service cancelations resulted in a lack of understanding (9.6%, n = 26) or anger and aggression (2.9%, n = 8) in a minority of patients, while 88.6% (n = 241) reacted with understanding, or relief (3.3%, n = 9). Telemedicine consultations rather than a postponed face-to-face visit were requested by 109 patients (40.1%), and these requests were significantly associated with subjective threat by SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0.004), urgent or very urgent medical needs (p = 0.004), and female gender (p = 0.024). Telemedicine satisfaction by patients and physicians was high. Overall, 9.2% (n = 10) of patients reported general supply problems due to SARS-CoV-2, and 28.4% (n = 31) reported epilepsy-specific problems, most frequently related to prescriptions, or supply problems for antiseizure drugs (ASDs; 22.9%, n = 25). CONCLUSION: Understanding and acceptance of elective ambulatory visit cancelations and the conversion to telemedicine consultations was high during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. Patients who engaged in telemedicine consultations were highly satisfied, supporting the feasibility and potential of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-related rapid reorganization of an epilepsy outpatient clinic from personal appointments to telemedicine services: A German single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As nations struggle to restart their economy after COVID-19 lockdowns, calls to include green investments in a pandemic-related stimulus are growing.

The objectives are to be delivered through preventive health checks in patients aged 20C65 years, predefined chronic disease management programmes, as well as coordination and monitoring of care carried out by primary care teams.

On the positive side, POZ Plus improves patient experience and seems to be a promising preventive tool. During the first 14 months of programme life, 10,956 health checks resulted in 13,361 new diagnoses. The critics of the programme point out that the scope of care is too wide and unnecessary in general population, and the health checks are too long, given the scarcity of medical professionals in Poland. The programme requires significant up-front investment of time and resources, thus favouring big clinics from densely populated areas. Financing may be sufficient during the pilot phase, but the programme may turn out to be too costly for country-wide implementation. The programme is a promising start toward achieving better primary care coordination in Poland.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and can be considered as a predictor of cardiovascular risk (CVR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between CIMT-determined vascular age (VA), CVR scores, and thyroid function in asymptomatic patients with T2DM. Patients and Methods Clinical laboratory and CIMT parameters were measured in 154 asymptomatic patients with T2DM. The Framingham risk score (FRS) was performed with chronological age (CA) and with VA. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to analyze variables related to CVR reclassification. Results The use of CIMT-determined VA led to the reclassification of 54 (35.52%) out of 152 asymptomatic T2DM patients, being 20 (37.03%) to a lower categorical risk and 34 (62.96%) to a higher categorical risk according to FRS. The variables that were associated to reclassification to a higher categorical risk were positive family history (FH) of premature coronary artery disease (p=0.046), FH of thyroid disease (p=0.010), use of statins (p=0.027), and free T4 levels (p=0.009). Conclusion VA determined from CIMT allowed the reclassification of the CVR in asymptomatic T2DM patients. FH of premature CAD, FH of known thyroid disease, use of statins, and free T4 levels were associated to a reclassification into a higher risk category. The use of doppler to perform CIMT measure is currently more accessible, especially in a low-middle income country like Brazil. However, further prospective studies must be performed to establish the predictive values of CIMT on atherosclerosis and how thyroid function acts like cardiovascular risk marker on CVR scores.","output":"Vascular Age as a Cardiovascular Risk Marker in Asymptomatic Patients with Type 2 Diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical models have been widely used to understand the dynamics of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as well as to predict future trends and assess intervention strategies. The asynchronicity of infection patterns during this pandemic illustrates the need for models that can capture dynamics beyond a single-peak trajectory to forecast the worldwide spread and for the spread within nations and within other sub-regions at various geographic scales. Here, we demonstrate a five-parameter sub-epidemic wave modeling framework that provides a simple characterization of unfolding trajectories of COVID-19 epidemics that are progressing across the world at different spatial scales. We calibrate the model to daily reported COVID-19 incidence data to generate six sequential weekly forecasts for five European countries and five hotspot states within the United States. The sub-epidemic approach captures the rise to an initial peak followed by a wide range of post-peak behavior, ranging from a typical decline to a steady incidence level to repeated small waves for sub-epidemic outbreaks. We show that the sub-epidemic model outperforms a three-parameter Richards model, in terms of calibration and forecasting performance, and yields excellent short- and intermediate-term forecasts that are not attainable with other single-peak transmission models of similar complexity. Overall, this approach predicts that a relaxation of social distancing measures would result in continuing sub-epidemics and ongoing endemic transmission. We illustrate how this view of the epidemic could help data scientists and policymakers better understand and predict the underlying transmission dynamics of COVID-19, as early detection of potential sub-epidemics can inform model-based decisions for tighter distancing controls.","output":"Sub-epidemic model forecasts for COVID-19 pandemic spread in the USA and European hotspots, February-May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"16 I Ibid i 17 European Patent Office and IEA (n 13), 2 18 I Ibid i , 3 19 IEA, \\"A Rapid Rise in Battery Innovation\\" (n 3) 20 IEA, \\"Innovation in Batteries and Electricity Storage\\", (September 2020) https://www iea org/reports/innovation-in-batteries-and-electricity-storage accessed 13 April 2021 Rapid growth in the development and deployment of energy storage technologies, long described as the '\\"holy grail\\" of energy's future',[1] is essential in the years ahead if there is any chance of the world meeting sustainable energy and international climate goals 27 I Ibid i 28 Ewa Krukowska, \\"EU Battery Ambitions to Get $1 1 Billion Research Boost\\" I Bloomberg Law i (12 March 2021) 29 'The Biden Plan to Build a Modern, Sustainable Infrastructure and an Equitable Clean Energy Future' https://joebiden com/clean-energy/ accessed 27 March 2021 [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Journal of Energy & Natural Resources Law is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Developing and deploying energy storage technologies: a 'holy grail' effort on which the world cannot afford to fail"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radical-mediated difunctionalization of alkenes provides a promising approach to introduce one alkenyl or alkynyl group to target compounds.

OBJECTIVE To investigate drug survival of adalimumab biosimilars in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and factors associated with its discontinuation. METHODS We carried out a retrospective observational study including all consecutive patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who initiated adalimumab biosimilar MSB11022 (Idacio), ABP501 (Amgevita), or SB5 (Imraldi) between 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2021. The 1-year drug survival of adalimumab biosimilar and independent factors associated with its discontinuation were investigated. Cox regression models were fit to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of adalimumab discontinuation. A propensity score matching (PSM) model was adopted as sensitivity analysis. RESULTS The study involved a total of 410 patients with follow-up of 549.84 person-years, 271 (66.1%) men, a mean (SD) age of 51.8 (14.5) years, and a baseline PASI of 14.54 (5.02). Among adalimumab biosimilars, 250 (61%) patients received MSB11022, 98 (24%) received ABP501, and 62 (15%) received SB5. Drug survival of adalimumab biosimilars at 1 year was 81.5% in the overall study population. Obesity was associated with increased risk of adalimumab discontinuation (HR = 2.01; 95% CI 1.33-3.03), whereas psoriatic arthritis (aHR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.16-0.64) and receiving adalimumab as first systemic treatment (aHR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.27-0.70) were associated with lower risk.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study of PED visits during January through April, 2016-2020. Data included: total PED visits, emergency severity index (ESI), disposition, chief complaint, age (months), time from first provider to disposition (PTD), and PED length of stay (PED-LOS). P-value <0.01 was statistically significant. RESULTS: In total, 67,499 visits were reported. There was a significant decrease in PED visits of 24-71% from March to April 2020. Chief complaints for fever and cough were highest in March 2020; while April 2020 had a shorter mean PED-LOS (from 158 to 123 min), an increase of admissions (from 8% to 14%), a decrease in ESI 4 (10%), and an increase in ESI 3 (8%) (P < 0.001).

In pandemic conditions like today, dentists can be the first people to contact with an infected person; these people can become carriers and infect others. COVID-19 transmission during dental treatment can occur through aerosol inhalation or direct contact with saliva, contaminated instruments and surface, especially for children patient in pediatric dentistry. Objective: To review the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric dentistry. Literature Review: In the dental environment associated with pediatric dental care, oral fluids from patients or contaminated dental instruments or environmental surfaces create a potential pathway to spread the virus. Dental care procedures which include the use of instruments such as high-speed turbine handpieces and scalers for oral hygiene are associated with the formation of aerosols and large droplets of saliva and blood from patients. Discussion: For children able to split, pre-procedural mouth rinse with 0.5%C1% hydrogen peroxide should be used, as it has non specific virucidal activity against corona viruses. Dentists should avoid or minimize operations that can produce droplets or aerosols. Conclusion: On the other hand, if faced with a dental emergency, immediate intervention is needed, adherence to the strict protection protocols of each individual involved and environmental disinfection is very important to minimize the risk of cross infection.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 in pediatric dentistry: A literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the likely impact of Brexit on UK higher education.

Such information could help to guide health authorities in providing informed interventions and clear communications. OBJECTIVES: To document the initial knowledge about COVID-19 and recommended health behaviors; to assess worries (ie, ones perception of the influence of the worries of others on oneself), social appraisal, and preventive behaviors, comparing respondents from areas under different movement restrictions during the first week after the outbreak; and to understand how worries, perceived risk, and preventive behaviors were associated with quality of life and individual characteristics among Italian adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This convenience sample, nonprobablistic survey study recruited adult participants with a snowballing sampling method in any Italian region during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy from February 26, 2020, to March 4, 2020. Data were analyzed from March 5 to 12, 2020. EXPOSURES: Information was collected from citizens living in the quarantine zone (ie, red zone), area with restricted movements (ie, yellow zone), and COVID-19Cfree regions (ie, green zone). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Levels of knowledge on the virus, contagion-related worries, social appraisal, and preventive behaviors were assessed with ratings of quality of life (measured using the Short Form Health Survey). Additionally, some individual characteristics that may be associated with worries and behaviors were assessed, including demographic characteristics, personality traits (measured using Big Five Inventory-10), perceived health control (measured using the internal control measure in the Health Locus of Control scale), optimism (measured using the Revised Life Orientation Test), and the need for cognitive closure (measured using the Need for Closure Scale). RESULTS: A total of 3109 individuals accessed the online questionnaire, and 2886 individuals responded to the questionnaire at least partially (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [13.2] years; 2203 [76.3%] women). Most participants were well informed about the virus characteristics and suggested behaviors, with a mean (SD) score of 77.4% (17.3%) correct answers. Quality of life was similar across the 3 zones (effect size = 0.02), but mental health was negatively associated with contagion-related worries ( = C0.066), social appraisal ( = C0.221), and preventive behaviors ( = C0.066) in the yellow zone (R(2) = 0.108). Social appraisal was also associated with reduced psychological well-being in the green zone ( = C0.205; R(2) = 0.121). In the yellow zone, higher worries were negatively correlated with emotional stability ( = C0.165; R(2) = 0.047). Emotional stability was also negatively associated with perceived susceptibility in the yellow ( = C0.108; R(2) = 0.040) and green ( = C0.170; R(2) = 0.087) zones. Preventative behaviors and social appraisal were also associated with the need for cognitive closure in both yellow (preventive behavior:  = 0.110; R(2) = 0.023; social appraisal  = 0.115; R(2) = 0.104) and green (preventive behavior:  = 0.174; R(2) = 0.022; social appraisal: 0.261; R(2) = 0.137) zones. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, people were well informed and had a relatively stable level of worries. Quality of life did not vary across the areas, although mental well-being was challenged by the social appraisal and worries related to the contagion. Increased scores for worries and concerns were associated with more cognitive rigidity and emotional instability.","output":"Knowledge, Concerns, and Behaviors of Individuals During the First Week of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antagonistic muscular co-activation can compensate for movement variability induced by motor noise at the expense of increased energetic costs. Greater antagonistic co-activation is commonly observed in older adults, which could be an adaptation to increased motor noise. The present study tested this hypothesis by manipulating motor noise in 12 young subjects while they practiced a goal-directed task using a myoelectric virtual arm, which was controlled by their biceps and triceps muscle activity. Motor noise was increased by increasing the coefficient of variation (CV) of the myoelectric signals. As hypothesized, subjects adapted by increasing antagonistic co-activation, and this was associated with reduced noise-induced performance decrements. A second hypothesis was that a virtual decrease in motor noise, achieved by smoothing the myoelectric signals, would have the opposite effect: co-activation would decrease and motor performance would improve. However, the results showed that a decrease in noise made performance worse instead of better, with no change in co-activation. Overall, these findings suggest that the nervous system adapts to virtual increases in motor noise by increasing antagonistic co-activation, and this preserves motor performance. Reducing noise may have failed to benefit performance due to characteristics of the filtering process itself, e.g., delays are introduced and muscle activity bursts are attenuated. The observed adaptations to increased noise may explain in part why older adults and many patient populations have greater antagonistic co-activation, which could represent an adaptation to increased motor noise, along with a desire for increased joint stability.","output":"Neural Control Adaptation to Motor Noise Manipulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of the main elements of the development of the New Silk Road project continue.

METHODS: Rheumatology patients and clinicians completed surveys (patients n = 1543, clinicians n = 111) and interviews (patients n = 41, clinicians n = 32) between April 2021 and August 2021. A cohort (n = 139) of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease patients was also followed up from March 2020 to April 2021. Analyses used sequential mixed methods. Pre-specified outcome measures included the WarwickCEdinburgh Mental wellbeing score (WEMWBS), satisfaction with care and healthcare behaviours. RESULTS: We identified multiple ongoing pandemic-induced/increased barriers to receiving care. The percentage of patients agreeing they were medically supported reduced from 74.4% pre-pandemic to 39.7% during-pandemic. Ratings for medical support, medical security and trust were significantly (P <0.001) positively correlated with patient WEMWBS and healthcare behaviours, and decreased during the pandemic. Healthcare-seeking was reduced, potentially long-term, including from patients feeling abandoned by clinicians, and a burden from government messaging to protect the NHS. Blame and distrust were frequent, particularly between primary and secondary care, and towards the UK government, who <10% of clinicians felt had supported clinicians during the pandemic. Clinicians efforts were reported to be impeded by inefficient administration systems and chronic understaffing, suggestive of the pandemic having exposed and exacerbated existing healthcare system weaknesses.

To address this challenge, a thorough examination of the pandemics influence on four SDGs in Egypt is presented in a system dynamic model. The addressed goals are related to no poverty (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and climate action (SDG 13). The model is simulated over 35 years extending from 2015 to 2050. Furthermore, a web-based interactive learning environment is developed to analyze the interdependencies among public health activities and study the impacts of possible intervention countermeasures or prevention policies. Indicators including poverty line, food insecurity, gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are evaluated to track Egypts performance in relation to SDGs 1, 2, 8, and 13. According to the simulation model, the poverty line will continue to decline until it reaches around 16% by 2050. According to the significant governmental efforts to follow its vision of 2030, Egypt can achieve a decreasing percentage of food insecurity, reaching 3% in 2030, and this percentage will continue to decrease until it reaches full sufficiency by 2050.

METHODS: We estimated age and sex-specific excess mortality risk and deaths above a baseline adjusted for seasonality with a systematic comparison of four different models using data from the Office for National Statistics. We additionally provide estimates of life expectancy at birth and lifespan inequality defined as the SD in age at death. RESULTS: There have been 57 419 (95% prediction interval: 54 197, 60 752) excess deaths in the first 47 weeks of 2020, 55% of which occurred in men. Excess deaths increased sharply with age and men experienced elevated risks of death in all age groups.

EXPERT OPINION The landscape of polyQ SCAs therapeutic targets and strategies includes (1) the mutant genes and proteins themselves, (2) enhancement of endogenous protein quality control responses, (3) abnormal protein-protein interactions of the mutant proteins, (4) disturbed neuronal function, (5) mitochondrial function, energy availability and oxidative stress, and (6) glial dysfunction, growth factor or hormone imbalances. Challenges include gaining a clearer definition of therapeutic targets for the drugs in clinical development, the discovery of novel drug-like molecules for challenging key targets, and the attainment of a stronger translation of preclinical findings to the clinic.","output":"Polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias: emerging therapeutic targets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Well before COVID-19, there was growing excitement about the potential of various digital technologies such as tele-health, smartphone apps, or AI chatbots to revolutionize mental healthcare. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread across the globe, clinicians warned of the mental illness epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Now, funding for digital mental health technologies is surging and many researchers are calling for widespread adoption to address the mental health sequelae of COVID-19. Reckoning with the ethical implications of these technologies is urgent because decisions made today will shape the future of mental health research and care for the foreseeable future. We contend that the most pressing ethical issues concern (1) the extent to which these technologies demonstrably improve mental health outcomes and (2) the likelihood that wide-scale adoption will exacerbate the existing health inequalities laid bare by the pandemic. We argue that the evidence for efficacy is weak and that the likelihood of increasing inequalities is high. First, we review recent trends in digital mental health. Next, we turn to the clinical literature to show that many technologies proposed as a response to COVID-19 are unlikely to improve outcomes. Then, we argue that even evidence-based technologies run the risk of increasing health disparities. We conclude by suggesting that policymakers should not allocate limited resources to the development of many digital mental health tools and should focus instead on evidence-based solutions to address mental health inequalities.","output":"Is There an App for That?: Ethical Issues in the Digital Mental Health Response to COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has spread around the world and poses a challenge to clinical frontline nursing staff.

Although over 150 million people around the world have recovered from this disease, the long term effects of the disease are still under study. A year after the start of the pandemic, data from COVID-19 recovered patients shows multiple organs affected with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes fatigue, chest pain, cellular damage, and robust innate immune response with inflammatory cytokine production. More clinical studies and clinical trials are needed to not only document, but also to understand and determine the factors that predispose certain people to the long term side effects of his infection. In this manuscript, our goal was to explore the multidimensional landscape of infected lung tissue microenvironment to better understand complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, immune response and the lungs microbiome of COVID-19 patients. Each sample was analyzed with several machine learning tools allowing simultaneous detection and quantification of viral RNA amount at genome and gene level; human gene expression and fractions of major types of immune cells, as well as metagenomic analysis of bacterial and viral abundance. To contrast and compare specific viral response to SARS-COV-2 we have analyzed deep sequencing data from additional cohort of patients infected with NL63 strain of corona virus. Our correlation analysis of three types of measurements in patients i.e. fraction of viral RNA (at genome and gene level), Human RNA (transcripts and gene level) and bacterial RNA (metagenomic analysis), showed significant correlation between viral load as well as level of specific viral gene expression with the fractions of immune cells present in lung lavage as well as with abundance of major fractions of lung microbiome in COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study has provided novel insights into complex regulatory signaling interactions and correlative patterns between the viral infection, inhibition of innate and adaptive immune response as well as microbiome landscape of the lung tissue. These initial findings could provide better understanding of the diverse dynamics of immune response and the side effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Computational genomic analysis of the lung tissue microenvironment in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first lockdown in 2020, video conferencing tools have been becoming increasingly important for employment, education, and social interaction.

METHODS: In this systematic review the international search databases following PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and Embase and Google scholar were searched. All articles were reviewed by two independent researchers until 10 April 2020. After quality assessment of included studies the finding reported in 2 sections obstetrics and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: The sixteen studies with a sample size of 123 pregnant women with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 and their neonates were evaluated. The range of gestational age was 25C40 weeks. There was no death associated with COVID-19 in pregnant women. The obstetric outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 include decreased fetal movement, intrauterine fetal distress, anemia, PROM, preterm labor, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) and etc. The most common delivery mode in women affect with COVID-19 was cesarean section. Expect for one case with MODS, in the majority of the studies reviewed, no severe morbidity or mortality occurred. The neonatal outcomes were stillbirth, prematurity, asphyxia, fetal distress, low birth weight, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and neonatal death. In addition, five neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, the studies report these outcomes but the exact causes of theme are not known. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review, we summarize the diverse results of studies about the obstetrics and neonatal outcomes following COVID-19.

Development of vaccines can be the most prominent approach to prevent the virus to cause COVID-19 and hence will play a vital role in controlling the spread of the virus and reducing mortality. The virus uses its spike proteins for entering into the host by interacting with a specific receptor called angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) present on the surface of alveolar cells in the lungs. Researchers all over the world are targeting the spike protein for the development of potential vaccines. Here, we discuss the immunopathological basis of vaccine designing that can be approached for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 infection and different platforms that are being used for vaccine development. We believe this review will increase our understanding of the vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently contribute to the control of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

This qualitative study identified multi-level drivers of shifts in inhaled tobacco product use and access patterns during the initial COVID-19 \\"lockdown\\" period in the United States. METHODS: Between April and May 2020, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 44) with adults who use cigarettes and/or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transcripts were thematically analyzed using a socioecological framework. RESULTS: Nearly all participants reported changes in their product use during lockdown, though patterns varied. Increased use was most common and was predominantly driven by individual-level factors: pandemic-related anxiety, boredom, and irregular routines. Decreased use was common among social users who cited fewer interpersonal interactions and fear of sharing products. At the community level, retail access impacted cigarette and ENDS use differently. While cigarettes were universally accessible, ENDS access was more limited, driving some to purchase products online. Delayed deliveries led some ENDS users to compensate with readily-available cigarettes. CONCLUSION: To mitigate ways that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate an existing public health crisis, multi-level policy strategies, such as expanded virtual cessation services and implementation and enforcement of smoke-free home rules, can better support population health during this critical period.

With an increased focus on online and virtual programming, there has been an uptick in social media usage by orthopaedics residencies as a means of communicating with applicants. This study investigated the growth in utilization of social media platforms by residency programs since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Instagram and Twitter were queried for each orthopaedic surgery residency program. It was determined if each program with a corresponding social media account was created before or after March 1, 2020. The number of posts per month were tabulated for accounts that existed prior to March 1, 2020. Results 187 orthopaedic surgery residency programs were identified using the AAMC ERAS database. Of these programs, 74 (41.6%) were found to have an Instagram profile, and 50 (26.7%) were found to have a Twitter page. Of the 74 Instagram profiles, 45 were created after March 1, 2020, representing a 155% increase. Of the 50 Twitter pages, 15 were created after March 1, 2020, representing a 43% increase. Instagram accounts that were active before the pandemic had a 96% increase in the number of posts per month, on average, after March 1, 2020. Conclusion Over one-third of programs are utilizing social media for recruitment purposes. There has been an 155% increase in Instagram and 43% increase in Twitter usage by residency programs since March 1, 2020.

We believe this can be achieved through an artificial intelligence agent that helps the patient in understanding key individual adherence risk factors and designing an appropriate intervention plan. The incidence of hypertension in Sweden is estimated at approximately 27%. Although blood pressure control has increased in Sweden, barely half of the treated patients achieved adequate blood pressure levels. It is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke as well as heart failure. MA is a key factor for good clinical outcomes in persons with hypertension. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study is to design, develop, test, and evaluate an adaptive digital intervention called iMedA, delivered via a mobile app to improve MA, self-care management, and blood pressure control for persons with hypertension. METHODS: The study design is an interrupted time series. We will collect data on a daily basis, 14 days before, during 6 months of delivering digital interventions through the mobile app, and 14 days after. The effect will be analyzed using segmented regression analysis. The participants will be recruited in Region Halland, Sweden. The design of the digital interventions follows the just-in-time adaptive intervention framework. The primary (distal) outcome is MA, and the secondary outcome is blood pressure. The design of the digital intervention is developed based on a needs assessment process including a systematic review, focus group interviews, and a pilot study, before conducting the longitudinal interrupted time series study. RESULTS: The focus groups of persons with hypertension have been conducted to perform the needs assessment in a Swedish context. The design and development of digital interventions are in progress, and the interventions are planned to be ready in November 2020. Then, the 2-week pilot study for usability evaluation will start, and the interrupted time series study, which we plan to start in February 2021, will follow it.

Thus, effective public health interventions are urgently introduced. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission probability and evaluate the influence of environmental parameters and individual intervention on the epidemic prevention. For this purpose, (1) we estimate the virus emission rate with Diamond Princess Cruise Ship infection data by Monte Carlo simulation and the improved Wells-Riley model, and (2) employ the reproductive number R to quantify diverse mitigation strategies. Different determinants are examined such as the duration of exposure, the number of passengers combined with individual interventions such as mask type and mask-wearing rate. The results show that the SARS-CoV-2 quantum generation rate is 185.63. The R shows a stronger positive correlation with the exposure time comparing to the number of passengers. In this light, reducing the frequency of long-distance journeys on crowded public transportation may be required to reduce the spread of the virus during the pandemic.

We then performed sequencing on the positive samples. RESULTS: We detected SARS-CoV-2 in 7 specimens from 6 patients, dating back to mid-January. The earliest positive patient, with a sample collected on January 13, 2020 had no relevant travel history but did have a sibling with similar symptoms. Sequencing of these SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that the virus was introduced into the LA area from both domestic and international sources as early as January. CONCLUSIONS: We present strong evidence of community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the LA area well before widespread diagnostic testing was being performed in early 2020. These genomic data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 was being introduced into Los Angeles County from both international and domestic sources in January 2020.","output":"Retrospective Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Symptomatic Patients prior to Widespread Diagnostic Testing in Southern California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimating the time-varying reproductive number, R(t), is critical for monitoring transmissibility of an infectious disease.

Material and Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study of the period in which all patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 from February to April 2020 were analysed. Sociodemographic characteristics, sample characterization and a set of variables related to the death process were collected in the death event. Results: A total of 16 deaths were recorded out of a total of 103 admissions positive for SARS-CoV-2. Limitation of therapeutic effort was decided in 68.8% of the patients, and admission to the intensive care unit was refused in 56.3%. Support devices had not been removed in any of the cases on the day of death, 43.8% had palliative sedation, and 18.8% were in induced coma. Conclusions. Quality standards were maintained in the death process in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2, although there were aspects that could be improved.

Critically ill patients often suffer from systemic inflammatory conditions and concurrently experience short-lived hypoxia. We evaluated the effects of short-term hypoxia on systemic inflammation, and show that it potently attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during murine endotoxemia. These effects are independent of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), but involve augmented adenosine levels, in turn resulting in an adenosine 2B receptor-mediated post-transcriptional increase of interleukin (IL)-10 production. We translated our findings to humans using the experimental endotoxemia model, where short-term hypoxia resulted in enhanced plasma concentrations of adenosine, augmentation of endotoxin-induced circulating IL-10 levels, and concurrent attenuation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Again, HIFs were shown not to be involved. Taken together, we demonstrate that short-term hypoxia dampens the systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine response through enhanced purinergic signaling in mice and men. These effects may contribute to outcome and provide leads for immunomodulatory treatment strategies for critically ill patients.","output":"Short-Term Hypoxia Dampens Inflammation in vivo via Enhanced Adenosine Release and Adenosine 2B Receptor Stimulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complexity of breast cancer includes many interacting biological processes, and proteasome alpha (PSMA) subunits are reported to be involved in many cancerous diseases, although the transcriptomic expression of this gene family in breast cancer still needs to be more thoroughly investigated. Consequently, we used a holistic bioinformatics approach to study the PSMA genes involved in breast cancer by integrating several well-established high-throughput databases and tools, such as cBioPortal, Oncomine, and the KaplanCMeier plotter. Additionally, correlations of breast cancer patient survival and PSMA messenger RNA expressions were also studied. The results demonstrated that breast cancer tissues had higher expression levels of PSMA genes compared to normal breast tissues. Furthermore, PSMA2, PSMA3, PSMA4, PSMA6, and PSMA7 showed high expression levels, which were correlated with poor survival of breast cancer patients. In contrast, PSMA5 and PSMA8 had high expression levels, which were associated with good prognoses. We also found that PSMA family genes were positively correlated with the cell cycle, ubiquinone metabolism, oxidative stress, and immune response signaling, including antigen presentation by major histocompatibility class, interferon-gamma, and the cluster of differentiation signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that PSMA genes have the potential to serve as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on a web-based survey applied to physiotherapists living in Portugal. The survey included sociodemographic, health status and clinical practice questions. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (personal, work- and patient-related burnout), the Resilience Scale, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. RESULTS: A total of 511 physiotherapists (median 33 years old, 82% females) completed the survey. The participants worked mainly in private practice (50%) and wards (35%). During COVID-19, 52% were working directly with patients, but only 18% were working with COVID-19 patients. Personal (42%), work- (42%) and patient-related burnout (25%) was observed. Three significant models explained personal- (R2 = 51%), work- (R2 = 31%) and patient-related burnout (R2 = 16%). Lower levels of resilience and higher levels of depression and stress were significantly associated with personal, work- and patient-related burnout. Being female and working directly with patients were additionally associated with both personal and work-related burnout. Having health problems and working with COVID-19 patients were only associated with personal burnout. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of physiotherapists experienced personal and work-related burnout and 25% patient-related burnout, with resilience, depression and stress having a relevant role in the three burnout dimensions.

Delayed primary excision (DPE) after induction chemotherapy allows for a reduction in adjuvant radiation dose, but with the risk of potential surgical morbidity. The objectives of this study were to compare outcomes in children with group III RMS who did and did not undergo DPE and to assess surgical morbidity. METHODS The study included 369 patients who had clinical group III RMS at sites amenable to DPE from intermediate-risk Children's Oncology Group studies D9803 (encouraged DPE) and ARST0531 (discouraged DPE). RESULTS The primary tumor site was bladder/prostate (136 patients; 37%), extremity (97 patients; 26%), trunk (24 patients; 7%), retroperitoneum (91 patients; 25%), or intrathoracic/perineum/perianal (21 patients; 6%). In total, 112 patients (53.9%) underwent DPE in D9803, and 26 patients (16.2%) underwent DPE in ARST0531 (P < .001), with loss of vital organ or function in 30 of 138 patients (22%). DPE allowed for a reduced radiation dose in 110 of 135 patients (81%; 51% were reduced to 36 Gy, and 30% were reduced to 42 Gy). Patients who underwent DPE had improved unadjusted overall survival (P = .013). In adjusted regression analysis, the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI 0.43-1.16) was similar for patients who did and did not undergo DPE and was improved for the subset of patients who had tumors of the trunk and retroperitoneum (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.97). CONCLUSIONS Children with group III RMS have equivalent or improved outcomes with DPE and can receive a decreased radiation dose for definitive local control.

Chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were collected and analyzed using one-group meta-analysis. RESULTS: Our search identified 15 eligible studies with follow-up period in a range of 1-6 months. A total of 3066 discharged patients were included in these studies. Among them, 1232 and 1359 patients were evaluated by chest CT and PFT, respectively. The approximate follow-up timing on average was 90 days after either symptom onset or hospital discharge. The frequency of residual CT abnormalities after hospital discharge was 55.7% (95% confidential interval (CI) 41.2-70.1, I2 = 96.2%). The most frequent chest CT abnormality was ground glass opacity in 44.1% (95% CI 30.5-57.8, I2 = 96.2%), followed by parenchymal band or fibrous stripe in 33.9% (95% CI 18.4-49.4, I2 = 95.0%).

A virtual meeting was convened on May 9, 2020 with a panel of international neuro-oncology experts with hands-on experience using Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). The objective was to assess the risk-to-benefit and to provide guidance for using TTFields in GBM during the COVID-19 pandemic. PANEL DISCUSSION: Topics discussed included support and delivery of TTFields during the COVID-19 pandemic, concomitant use of TTFields with chemotherapy, and any potential impact of TTFields on the immune system in an intrinsically immunosuppressed GBM population. Special consideration was given to TTFields use in elderly patients and in combination with radiotherapy regimens (standard versus hypo-fractionated). Finally, we discussed the need to better capture COVID-19 positive brain tumor patients to analyze longitudinal outcomes and subtle changes in treatment decision-making during the pandemic. EXPERT CONSENSUS: TTFields is a portable home-use device which can be managed via telemedicine and safely used in GBM patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. TTFields has no known immunosuppressive effects and is a reliable treatment modality with a relatively favorable side-effect profile. This is important during a crisis where other treatment methods might be limited, especially for elderly patients and patients with multiple co-morbidities.

In this retrospective, single-centre cohort study, we included some adult inpatients (18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University who had been discharged or had died by Apr. 8, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at admission were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable analysis, Cox proportional hazard model analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to explore the early warning factors associated with in-hospital death. A total of 159 patients were included in this study, of whom 86 were discharged and 73 died in hospital. Hypertension (52.1% vs. 29.1%, P=0.003) and coronary heart disease (28.8% vs. 12.8%, P=0.012) were more frequent among non-survived patients than among survived patients.

The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. RECENT FINDINGS There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained.

The results of the published studies mainly report on the role of the prior medication, but not how to treat severe acute flare of IBD patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 68-year-old patient with a long history of ulcerative colitis. He was initially admitted to an external hospital because of severe acute flare. The initiation of a high-dose oral cortisone therapy did not improve the clinical symptoms. During the inpatient treatment, he was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. At admission to our hospital the patient showed severe flare of his ulcerative colitis and increased Covid-19 symptoms. A cortisone-refractory course was noticed. After detailed multidisciplinary riskCbenefit assessment, we initiated an intravenous tacrolimus therapy and dose of prednisolone was tapered gradually. After clinical response, the therapy was adjusted to infliximab. Additionally, the Covid-19 pneumonia was kept under control despite immunosuppression and the patient could be discharged in clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggest the use of tacrolimus as a bridging therapeutic option for severe acute, cortisone refractory ulcerative colitis in Covid-19 patients. Nevertheless, the best treatment strategy for IBD patients presenting a flare during the outbreak has yet to be defined.

Manual muscle testing, load cell coupled with a signal conditioner, and handheld dynamometry are three widely used techniques for measuring isometric muscle strength. Recently, there is a proliferation of low-cost tools that have potential to be used to measure muscle strength. This study examined both the criterion validity, inter-day reliability and intra-day reliability of a microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for quantifying muscle strength. To do so, a low-cost microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for measuring lower and upper limb maximal voluntary isometric muscular force was compared to a commercial grade signal conditioner and to a handheld dynamometer. The results showed that the microcontroller-based load cell amplifier correlated nearly perfectly (Pearson's R-values between 0.947 to 0.992) with the commercial signal conditioner and the handheld dynamometer, and showed good to excellent association when calculating ICC scores, with values of 0.9582 [95% C.I.: 0.9297-0.9752] for inter-day reliability and of 0.9269 [95% C.I.: 0.8909-0.9533] for session one, intra-day reliability. Such results may have implications for how the evaluation of muscle strength measurement is conducted in the future, particularly for offering a commercial-like grade quality, low cost, portable and flexible option.","output":"Assessing the Validity and Reliability of A Low-Cost Microcontroller-Based Load Cell Amplifier for Measuring Lower Limb and Upper Limb Muscular Force."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cardiothoracic training programs quickly transitioned midinterview season toward a virtual format.

Those who are clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality due to living with long term conditions (LTCs) are at greater risk of negative impacts on their health and wellbeing, and of disruption in management of their LTCs. This study explores how people with LTCs managed their health and wellbeing under social distancing restrictions and self-isolation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examines why some people were more able to manage than others. Interviews were conducted between May and July 2020 with people (n = 44) living in North East England, who had one or more LTCs and were recruited via a social prescribing intervention. Data were analysed using a social constructivist thematic analysis. We present our analysis of the possibilities afforded to people to manage the impacts of lockdown on their health and wellbeing. We find that while some people deployed a range of capitals and/or etched out tactics to make life habitable, others experienced zones of impossibility requiring that they rely on contingent events or formal support. Our analysis highlights inequalities amongst people with LTCs, particularly regarding access to and deployment of important resources for health and wellbeing under COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, including outdoor space or greenspace, exercise and social connection. The study is novel in showing the mechanisms for coping with a significant period of disruption in the life-course whilst highlighting that although resilience was common in people with LTCs, this was sometimes at detrimental costs to themselves.","output":"Managing disruption at a distance: Unequal experiences of people living with long-term conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are currently no validated pharmacotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related insomnia.

This study plans to enroll 1224 patients from 34 VA Medical Centers into a 12- week prospective, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing trazodone, eszopiclone, and gabapentin. The primary outcome measure is insomnia, assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. A novel aspect of this study is its adaptive design.

Effective communication regarding technical issues between disaster experts and the residents is key to averting such secondary impacts. However, misconceptions about scientific issues and mistrust in experts frequently occur even with intensive and sincere communications. This miscommunication is usually attributed to residents conflicts with illiteracy, emotion, value depositions and ideologies. However, considering that communication is an interactive process, there are likely to be additional factors attributable to experts. This article aims to summarize the gaps in rationality between experts and residents observed after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster to describe how residents perceived experts. There were discrepancies in the perception of facts, the perception of probability, the interpretation of risk comparison, what were included as risk trade-offs, the view of the disaster, whose behavior would be changed by the communication and whether risk should be considered a science. These findings suggest that there was a non-scientific rationality among residents, which often exercised a potent influence on everyday decision-making. It might not be residents but experts who need to change their behavior. The discrepancies described in this article are likely to apply to communications following any CBRNE disasters that affect peoples lives, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently, eicosanoids are widely involved in regulating immunity and inflammation for COVID-19 patients. Rats were intravenously administered remdesivir at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and series of blood samples were collected before and after treatment. Targeted metabolomics regarding the eicosanoid profile were investigated and quantitated simultaneously using the previously reported reliable HPLC-MS/MS method. Additionally, interplay relationship between metabolomics and pharmacokinetic parameters was performed using the Pearson correlation analysis and PLS model. For the longitudinal metabolomics of remdesivir, metabolic profiles of the same rat were comparatively substantial at discrete sampling points. The metabolic fingerprints generated by individual discrepancy of rats were larger than metabolic disturbance caused by remdesivir. As for the transversal metabolomics, the prominent metabolic profile variation was observed between the baseline and treatment status. Except for TXB2, the inflammatory- and immunology-related eicosanoids of resolvin D2, 5-HEPE, 5-HETE, and DHA were significantly disturbed and reduced after single administration of remdesivir (p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Moreover, the metabolite of PGE2 correlated with GS-441524 (active metabolite of remdesivir) concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters of C(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), and CL significantly.

During the biosensor fabrication, the G-rich hairpin DNA H1 was immobilized on the surface of SiNPs which was doped with the europium(III) complex Eu(III)(EDTA)(DPA). The dsDNA (S1/S2) contains TF recognition site, and one of its ssDNA S2 is protected by TF from the digestion of exonuclease III (Exo III). The survived S2 starts a signal amplification process at the aid of Exo III, then a lot of G4 DNA was generated which can be recognized by the G4-selective iridium(III) complex (Ir(III)-2G). So, the emission intensity of Ir(III)-2G is enhanced with the increase of TF concentration, while the emission of Eu(III)(EDTA)(DPA) keeps stable. Ascribed to the long lifetimes of both metal complexes, the constructed detection platform can perform time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) measurement in complicated biological systems. The ratiometric TF detection platform not only can detect NF-B P50 in buffered system in the linear range of 0.05-5 nM with the limit of detection (LOD) 0.014 nM, but also is able to monitor NF-B P50 in 10% human serum in the linear range of 0.05-5 nM with the LOD of 0.010 nM through TRES measurement.

METHODS: A total of 179 convalescent plasma units were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the Beckman-Coulter chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) platform. The equipment-derived numerical values (S/Co ratio) were recorded. Aliquots from the same units were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. The relationship between ELISA titers and CLIA S/Co values was analyzed using linear regression and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Twenty-one samples (11.7%) had S/Co values of less than 1.0 and were deemed negative for antibodies and convalescent plasma had S/Co values between >1.0 and 5.0 (70/179, 39.1%). Fifteen units (8.4%) had negative ELISA titer. The majority of the units (95/179. 53.1%) had titers 1:1024. The sensitivities of ELISA to CLIA were comparable (90.5% vs 88.3%, respectively; p=0.18). There was positive linear correlation between CLIA S/Co values and ELISA IgG titer (Rho = 0.75; Spearmans rank = 0.82, p-value = <0.0001). The agreement between the two methods was fair, with a  index of 0.2741. Using the ROC analysis, we identified a CLIA S/Co cutoff value of 8.2, which gives a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 82% in predicting a titer dilution of 1:1024. CONCLUSION: The utility of automated antibody detection systems can be extended from simply a screening method to a semi-quantitative and quantitative functional antibody analysis. CLIA S/Co values can be used to reliably estimate the ELISA antibody titer. Incorporation of chemiluminescent-based methods can provide rapid, cost-effective means of identifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in donated plasma for use in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Correlation of Automated Chemiluminescent Method with Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Antibody Titers in Convalescent COVID-19 Plasma Samples: Development of Rapid, Cost-Effective Semi-Quantitative Diagnostic Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This comprehensive study reviews the technological impact during the COVID-19 pandemic and elucidates technology usage to technology-enhanced learning which assisted in enhancing the behavioral intention to use technologies among undergraduates.

It evoked a vigorous response in clinical medicine, as it required rapid development and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year (Le et al., 2020). Similarly, medical education also adapted with the same rate and intensity as its clinical counterparts. Infection control and mitigation measures evolved to limit viral spread. The CDC issued stay-at-home orders and directives to close non-essential places. This included medical schools, which are considered high population density (CDC, 2021). Consequently, traditional in-person didactics were compromised;educational delivery went to socially-distanced online modes. Remote online-learning of medical education includes video conferences for lectures, assessments of diagnostic and clinical skills via online modes, and virtual-simulation use to aid problem-based learning. Adaptive online-learning for medical education boosts strong cooperation from faculty and students to meld curriculum to retain competency and accreditation requirements for students to graduate and become physicians. This study examines online lecture effectiveness during COVID-19, specifically pathology, as medical students shift to optimize learning for board exam preparation and transition to clinical settings. Methods In this preliminary study, second year medical students at a US osteopathic medical school were anonymously surveyed in 2020-2021 academic year. Target demographic was medical students required to use online learning due to COVID-19;students had live, in-person instruction in previous academic year, 2019-2020, until the shift to online learning started March 2020. Data from survey included quantitative data on effectiveness of online learning versus in-person lecture for medical students, impact of online learning on students? foundational pathology preparation for board exams, and students' abilities to apply pathology knowledge with diagnostic reasoning in a clinical setting. Preliminary results show online learning of pathology in preparation for board exams elicited moderate confidence from 58% of second-year medical students;a majority of students to report online learning as quite effective. Ninety-two percent of students used external pathology resources (review books, video series, etc.) with online learning. However, more than half of students report low confidence in applying pathology knowledge in a clinical setting. Discussion Overall, medical students showed moderate confidence in pathology board exam preparation via online learning. A study conducted by Mukhtar et al. (2020) supported online learning in medical schools due to increased student-centered learning. Students using external board review resources found online learning provides efficient pathology curriculum management with time for board exam review during the pandemic. Most students reported low confidence in applying pathology knowledge in a clinical setting because online learning constraints include lack of integration of clinical pathology and clinical competency skills.

Cox proportional hazards were used to compare COVID-19 mortality in LTC residents to community dwelling older adults, controlling for age, gender, race, and pre-existing chronic health conditions. Until early January of 2021, significantly greater incidence rates of infection (116.2 per 10,000 per month) and hazard of death after infection (HR=1.83, 95% CI: 1.70-1.98) were experienced among LTC residents as compared to older adults in the community even after statewide mask mandates and visitation guidance. Since vaccine availability, COVID incidence rates among LTC residents fell by half (59.5 per 10,000 per month after vaccines), and the relative hazard of death compared to older adults in the community was diminished (HR=1.44, 95% CI:1.29-1.61). Reducing the gap between LTCF and community-wide infection and mortality rates suggests that vaccination against COVID-19 is correlated with reduced disease spread in the greater community and in LTCF.

Therefore, the CCC separation guided by virtual screening is a promising method for the targeted isolation of enzyme inhibitors from medicinal herbs.","output":"Precise separation of lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitors from Corydalis yanhusuo using multi-mode counter-current chromatography guided by virtual screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 entry requires sequential cleavage of the spike glycoprotein at the S1/S2 and the S2' cleavage sites to mediate membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic insertion (PRRAR) at the S1/S2 cleavage site that can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with an S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion endows SARS-CoV-2 with a selective advantage in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cells, but impairs replication in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. Using engineered spike variants and live virus competition assays and by measuring growth kinetics, we find that the selective advantage in lung and primary human airway epithelial cells depends on the expression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, which enables endosome-independent virus entry by a route that avoids antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin cleavage site was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals, unlike wild-type virus. Analysis of 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from patients and 24 human postmortem tissues showed low frequencies of naturally occurring mutants that harbour deletions at the polybasic site. Taken together, our findings reveal that the furin cleavage site is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"The furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is required for transmission in ferrets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suffered both high thrombotic and bleeding risk.

Coagulation standard parameters were also evaluated. Forty patients were enrolled into the study. The ICU and the hospital mortality were 10% and 12.5%, respectively. On ICU admission, prothrombin time was slightly reduced and it increased significantly at T10 (T0 = 65.1  9.8 vs T10 = 85.7  1.5, p = 0.002), while activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen values were higher at T0 than T10 (32.2  2.9 vs 27.2  2.1, p = 0.017 and 895.1  110 vs 332.5  50, p = 0.002, respectively); moreover, whole blood thromboelastometry profiles were consistent with hypercoagulability characterized by an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation [i.e., CFT below the lower limit in INTEM 16/40 patients (40%) and EXTEM 20/40 patients (50%)] and significant higher clot strength [MCF above the upper limit in INTEM 20/40 patients (50%), in EXTEM 28/40 patients (70%) and in FIBTEM 29/40 patients (72.5%)]; however, this hypercoagulable state persists in the first five days, but it decreases ten day after, without returning to normal values.

In this review, we present the outstanding potential of the stilbene-based derivatives. Naturally occurring stilbenes, together with powerful synthetic chemistry possibilities, may offer an excellent approach for discovering new structures and identifying their therapeutic targets. With the development of scientific tools, sophisticated equipment, and a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis at the molecular level, the stilbene scaffold has moved innovation in science. This paper mainly focuses on the stilbene-based compounds beyond resveratrol, which are particularly attractive due to their biological activity. Given the fresh outlook about different stilbene-based compounds starting from stilbenoids with particular regard to isorhapontigenin and methoxy- and hydroxyl- analogues, the update about the combretastatins, and the very often overlooked and underestimated benzanilide analogues, we present a new story about this remarkable structure.","output":"More Than Resveratrol: New Insights into Stilbene-Based Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased volumes of stroke admissions and mechanical thrombectomy were reported. The study's objective was to examine whether subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions demonstrated similar declines. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study across 6 continents, 37 countries and 140 comprehensive stroke centres. Patients with the diagnosis of SAH, aneurysmal SAH, ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions and COVID-19 were identified by prospective aneurysm databases or by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes. The 3-month cumulative volume, monthly volumes for SAH hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm coiling procedures were compared for the period before (1 year and immediately before) and during the pandemic, defined as 1 March-31 May 2020. The prior 1-year control period (1 March-31 May 2019) was obtained to account for seasonal variation. FINDINGS: There was a significant decline in SAH hospitalisations, with 2044 admissions in the 3 months immediately before and 1585 admissions during the pandemic, representing a relative decline of 22.5% (95% CI -24.3% to -20.7%, p<0.0001). Embolisation of ruptured aneurysms declined with 1170-1035 procedures, respectively, representing an 11.5% (95%CI -13.5% to -9.8%, p=0.002) relative drop. Subgroup analysis was noted for aneurysmal SAH hospitalisation decline from 834 to 626 hospitalisations, a 24.9% relative decline (95% CI -28.0% to -22.1%, p<0.0001). A relative increase in ruptured aneurysm coiling was noted in low coiling volume hospitals of 41.1% (95% CI 32.3% to 50.6%, p=0.008) despite a decrease in SAH admissions in this tertile. INTERPRETATION: There was a relative decrease in the volume of SAH hospitalisations, aneurysmal SAH hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm embolisations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the factors influencing the use of reproductive health services among young women in Nepal. METHODS: Data have been extracted from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) datasets wherein the weighted sample population size was restricted for modern contraceptive use to 1593 whereas for the antenatal care and skilled birth attendants to1606. This study has selected three reproductive health indicators as outcome variables of reproductive health service utilization for the analysis viz, modern contraceptive use, at least four antenatal care visits, and use of skilled birth attendants. Likewise, all calculations are based on standard sample weight of NDHS. RESULTS: The study has found that 21% of young women used modern contraception, 71% attended at least four ANC visits, and 67% utilized a skilled birth attendant at delivery. Young Janajati women, women having 1-2, and 3 or more living children, women participating household decision-making, and the ones having exposure to media were more likely to use modern contraceptives, whereas the women who want more children were less likely to use them. Higher education attainments, higher wealth quintile, and lower birth order were associated with higher level of receiving at least four ANC visits and SBAs. However, the young women willing to have more children and having access to media have higher odds of receiving at least four ANC visits; and the women attending four and more ANC visits have higher odds of using SBAs. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve the use of reproductive health services among young women, efforts should be made to enrich the young women of lower educational level, lower economic status, higher birth order, and lower exposure to media.

Specifically, we focused on the relationships between ICT use and perceived importance of social connectedness and future anxiety, while considering relevant personality and psychosocial factors. A U.S. sample of 394 adults answered questions about ICT use, pandemic-related reactions and actions, demographics, and psychosocial factors via an online survey. Using logistic regression, findings indicated that personality (extraversion and conscientiousness) and psychosocial (need to belong and perceived attachment to phone) factors, types of ICT as news source, and gender were associated with perceived importance of social connectedness. Neuroticism, time spent on ICT for social purposes, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were associated with future anxiety. In addition, using Mann-Whitney U test, people who rated higher on importance of social connectedness had higher ICT use, both in terms of types and time spent on ICT. Overall, results are consistent with the idea that technology is a coping tool during the pandemic and balanced use can lead to feelings of social connectedness and less future anxiety. Therefore, it is important for authorities to align their messaging and outreach with people's psychosocial, personality, and health considerations through ICT channels while empowering ICT users to be responsible for their interactions with the technology.","output":"Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Usage during COVID-19: Motivating Factors and Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUD: Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a rare complication of influenza infection that has substantial morbidity. We report the first case of OP associated with avian influenza H7N9 infection that had significant improvement with corticosteroid treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old male admitted to intensive care unit because of respiratory failure. He was diagnosed as severe pneumonia caused by avian influenza H7N9 viral infection. After initial clinical improvement supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the patients condition worsened with persistent fever, refractory hypoxemia. Chest x-rays and computed tomographies showed areas of consolidation and ground glass opacification. Although OP was suspected and 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone was used, the patients condition didnt improved considerably. An open lung biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the specimen was compatible with OP. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg for 5 days. ECMO was weaned on day 15, and he was discharged on day 71 with good lung recovery. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of successful management of refractory severe respiratory failure caused by avian influenza H7N9 infection complicated with OP.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the best-characterized entry receptor for the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV-2, is highly expressed in the aforementioned tissues. However, the pathways that underlie the disease are still poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly found that the complement system was one of the intracellular pathways most highly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells. Infection of respiratory epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 generated activated complement component C3a and could be blocked by a cell-permeable inhibitor of complement factor B (CFBi), indicating the presence of an inducible cell-intrinsic C3 convertase in respiratory epithelial cells. Within cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients, distinct signatures of complement activation in myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells tracked with disease severity. Genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the drugs that could normalize these genes both implicated the interferon-JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system and NF-&#954;B as the main drivers of their expression. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, normalized interferon signature genes and all complement gene transcripts induced by SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cell lines, but did not affect NF-&#954;B-regulated genes. Ruxolitinib, alone or in combination with the antiviral remdesivir, inhibited C3a protein produced by infected cells.

This protocol describes the process to co-producewith patient partners and other key stakeholdersa multi-stakeholder derived Core Outcome Set for distal Tibia and Ankle fractures (COSTA). The scope of COSTA will be for clinical trials. METHODS: The study will have five-stages which will include the following: (i) systematic reviews of existing qualitative studies and outcome reporting in randomised controlled trial studies to inform a developing list of potential outcome domains; (ii) qualitative interviews (including secondary data) and focus groups with patients and healthcare professionals to explore the impact of ankle fracture and the outcomes that really matter; (iii) generation of meaningful outcome statements with the study team, international advisory group and patient partners; (iv) a multi-round, international e-Delphi study to achieve consensus on the core domain set; and (v) an evidence-based consensus on a core measurement set will be achieved through a structured group consensus meeting, recommending best assessment approaches for each of the domains in the core domain set.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the world to pause. One hundred and eighty-eight countries have imposed countrywide school closures, affecting more than 1.5 billion children and youths. The majority of academic leaders are currently encouraging online education to resolve this crisis. This study aimed to investigate international medical students (IMS) experiences of online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected online using a validated questionnaire and one open-ended question, presented on the Google forms platform. The study attracted responses from 1,107 IMS volunteer participants. IBM SPSS v. 25, GraphPad Prism v. 9, and MindManager v. 2018 were used for data analysis. All variables were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. The MannCWhitney U test was used in subgroup analysis and the Kruskal-Wallis test was also applied for year-wise comparisons. Open-ended text responses were analyzed qualitatively, extracting themes by which responses were classified. RESULTS: Among 1,107 respondents, a total of 67.8% were males, and the majority (63.1%) of the IMS were in the age group of 21C23 years. The results show that more than half of the respondents reported their Internet connection quality as poor to average. Poor Internet connection severely affected IMS online learning experience. Persistent and recurrent issues with Internet access became a significant concern for IMS. Lack of electricity is one of the factors that can contribute to poor learning output and dissatisfaction with online teaching. IMS perceive online medical education as unhelpful in several phases of the training, such as improving their clinical skills, knowledge, and discussion skills. CONCLUSIONS: During these unprecedented periods, online teaching has allowed medical education to continue. However, IMS are generally dissatisfied with online teaching. Medical students must visualize the human body, so supportive technologies are important to compensate for the lack of clinical practices. Medical institutions may need to invest in faculty training programs and continually adjust to enhance the content of online training and international partnerships. A switch from conventional face-to-face teaching to a fully functional virtual education framework in the medical education field will take time and experience.","output":"Experiences of international medical students enrolled in Chinese medical institutions towards online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite emerging evidence on safety and efficacy, most countries do not offer COVID-19 vaccines to pregnant women even though they are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19.

Of the top 20 countries affected by COVID-19, 11 allow vaccination of pregnant women, of which two have deemed it safe to vaccinate pregnant women as a high-risk group. In contrast, only five of the 20 countries with high under-five mortality and maternal mortality allow vaccination of pregnant women and none of these countries has included them as part of a high-risk group that should be vaccinated. India and Indonesia, with one-fifth of the world's population, fall under both categories but do not include pregnant women as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. To prevent COVID-19 from further aggravating the already heavy burden of maternal and under-five mortality, there is a strong case for including pregnant women as a high-priority group for COVID-19 vaccination.

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from December 01, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid Medline databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included articles with cases of COVID-19 where neurological involvement was evident. RESULTS: We were able to identify 82 cases of COVID-19 with neurological complications. The mean age was 62.3 years. 37.8% of the patients were women (n = 31). 48.8% of the patients (n = 40) had cerebrovascular insults, 28% (n = 23) had neuromuscular disorders, and 23% of the patients (n = 19) had encephalitis or encephalopathy.

Although there are some doubts about the reporting of cases and deaths in China, it seems that this country was able to control the epidemic more effectively than many other countries. In this paper, we would like to analyze the measures taken in China and compare them with other countries in order to find out what they can learn from China. METHODS: We develop a system dynamics model of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. Based on a number of simulations we analyze the impact of changing parameters, such as contact rates, on the development of a second wave. RESULTS: Although Chinas health care system seems to be poorly financed and inefficient, the epidemic was brought under control in a comparably short period of time and no second wave was experienced in Wuhan until today. The measures to contain the epidemic do not differ from what was implemented in other countries, but China applied them very early and rigorously. For instance, the consequent implementation of health codes and contact-tracking technology contributed to contain the disease and effectively prevented the second and third waves. CONCLUSIONS: Chinas success in fighting COVID-19 is based on a very strict implementation of a set of measures, including digital management. While other countries discuss relaxing the lock-down at a rate of 50 per 100,000 inhabitants, China started local lock-downs at a rate of 3 per 100,000.

This is the study to assess the licensing program impact on the professional qualities of UAE teachers. The perception survey was piloted with a group of teachers from random UAE schools. A survey method with valid tests and descriptive statistics were used to determine the self-evaluation of teachers in a wide range of competencies related to licensing. Teacher self-evaluate themselves during the test accentuates strong social competence, while professional qualities and professional growth received significantly lower scores. A strong direct correlation was found between test size and participants' experience. There was no correlation between the quality of the assessment and gender or age factors. The results of the study are aimed at helping government and academic policymakers to obtain feedback from teachers on educational reforms.

This pattern of infection is quite distinct from the acute/resolving nature of other human pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 furthermore occurs irrespective of disease severity or development of virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 possesses an intensely structured RNA genome, an attribute shared with other human and veterinary coronaviruses and with other mammalian RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus. These are capable of long-term persistence, possibly through poorly understood RNA structure-mediated effects on innate and adaptive host immune responses. The assumption that resolution of COVID-19 and the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies represents virus clearance and protection from reinfection, implicit for example in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model used for epidemic prediction, should be rigorously re-evaluated.","output":"Understanding the outcomes of COVID-19 - does the current model of an acute respiratory infection really fit?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prior epidemics of high-mortality human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-1) in 2003, have driven the characterization of compounds that could be possibly active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Presently, no approved treatment or prophylaxis is available for COVID-19. We comment on the existing COVID-19 research methodologies in general and the published reporting.

PURPOSE: To describe a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service practice model to improve medication safety in a population of rheumatology patients and evaluate its initial impact on guideline compliance. SUMMARY: Optimal pharmacologic care of patients with rheumatologic conditions often revolves around the use of specialty medications such as self-injectable biologics and infused therapies, including biologic response modifiers (BRMs), nearly all of which carry risks of serious adverse events due to their immune-suppressive properties. Possible adverse events include serious infections such as reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis B (HBV). This articles describes a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service introduced by a large university-affiliated health system in 2018 to integrate clinical, specialty pharmacy, and therapeutic infusion services for proactive medication and safety management for patients with rheumatologic conditions requiring specialty or infused medications. During a 4-month evaluation period, 157 referrals were sent to the consult service; of 137 consults included in the analysis, 42% were for self-injectable biologic medications, 28% were for intra-articular injections, 26% were for infusions, and 4% were for oral specialty medications. Forty-one percent of the pharmacy benefit consult orders required an intervention prior to submission of prior authorization requests. Most interventions (61%) were clinical in nature and involved the pharmacists ensuring that necessary laboratory work, clinical disease activity scoring, or radiographic imaging were completed prior to submission of the consult results for insurer approval. CONCLUSION: National rates of HBV screening and TB screening for patients prescribed BRMs continue to be suboptimal. The pharmacist-managed virtual consult service is a novel practice model to increase the screening rate to 100% to ensure the safety and appropriate monitoring of patients who are starting or continued on these complex medications.","output":"A pharmacist-managed virtual consult service to improve tuberculosis screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses the state of democracy in 2020 The world is still more democratic than it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but a trend of autocratization is ongoing and affecting 25 countries in 2020, home to 34% of the worlds population At the same time, the number of democratizing countries has dwindled by nearly half, reducing to 16 countries, home to a mere 4% of the global population Freedom of expression, deliberation, rule of law and elections show the most substantial net declines in the last decade A major change is that India, formerly the worlds largest democracy, turned into an electoral autocracy The V-Dem data suggests that direct effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on levels of liberal democracy were limited in 2020 Still, the longer-term consequences may be worse and must be monitored closely Due to the pandemic and state restrictions on the freedom of assembly, mass mobilization declined to its lowest level in over a decade, yet the decline in pro-democracy protests in 2020 may well prove to be short-lived once the pandemic subdues [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Democratization is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"State of the world 2020: autocratization turns viral"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attempts to control the epidemic spread of COVID19 in the different countries often involve imposing restrictions to the mobility of citizens.

METHODS: A total of 45 endodontic procedures were sampled, including full pulpotomy (n = 15), pulpectomy (n = 15), and NSRCT (n = 15). Samples were collected during room resting and after treatment. The passive air sampling technique using settle plates was applied. Agar plates were set at different locations in the operatory. The colony-forming unit (CFU) was counted in brain-heart infusion blood agar plates. A set of agar plates containing selective chromogenic culture media was used for the isolation and presumptive identification of target microorganisms. Fungi were investigated using Sabouraud dextrose agar. RESULTS: Pulpotomy generated the lowest mean CFU count (P < .05). There was no difference between the mean CFU counts found in pulpectomy and NSRCT (P > .05). A higher mean CFU count was found close to the patient's mouth (0.5 m) than at a 2-m distance in pulpectomy and NSRCT (P < .05). There was no difference between the mean CFU count found in front of the patient's mouth versus diagonal in pulpectomy and NSRCT (P > .05). Staphylococcus aureus (22/45, 48.8%) was the most frequent bacteria species. Longer treatment times were associated with higher CFU counts.

NHs used an online portal to report urine culture and antibiotic treatment data over a 6-month pre-intervention period (Jan-June 2019), a pre-COVID 8-month post intervention period (July 2019-Feb 2020) and an 8-month post-COVID intervention period (Mar-Oct 2020). Study outcomes included urine culture (UC), antibiotic start (AS), and antibiotic days of therapy (DOT) rates per 1,000 resident days. A generalized estimating equation model for panel data was used to assess differences in study outcomes between treatment arms before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. STATA 16.1 was used for all analyses. RESULTS: A total of 802 UCs (457 pre-COVID, 345 post-COVID), 724 AS (401 pre-COVID, 323 post-COVID), and 6,454 DOT (3553 pre-COVID and 2901 post-COVID) were reported over the 16-month intervention period.

The economic recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the food and nutrition security challenge to the higher priority. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of encouraging a healthy eating plan by taking into account two important elements, food cost and nutrient intake, to help tackle the food and nutrition insecurity challenges at the individual level. METHOD AND MATERIALS: This study used a goal programming model with dietary intake data from Malaysian Adult Nutrition Survey reports to develop food plans that can improve nutrition quality without increasing food cost. Missing data, such as nutrient compositions and food prices, were collected separately from existing governmental and non-governmental sources. Benchmark nutrient intakes were derived from Malaysian Dietary Guidelines and Malaysian Recommended Nutrient Intakes reports, whereas benchmark costs were estimated by mapping food prices to dietary intake. The cost of healthier diets was also assessed to examine the acceptability of dietary changes for the low-income population. RESULTS: The results showed that healthier diets following national dietary guidelines are achievable with reasonable food choices shift without changing the cost of meal plan. Greater intake of milk and vegetables (for more calcium) and smaller intake of seafood and egg products (for less protein) will contribute to raise diet quality and achieve more adequate nutrition. However, the cost attached to healthier food plan is still likely to be burdensome for the food-insecure and low-income population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that policymakers should implement income-relevant laws to cut poverty and improve the populations dietary intake.

To protect public health, we designed and fabricated electrospun nanofibrous air filters that hold promise for applications in personal protective equipment and indoor environment. Due to ultrafine nanofibers (~300 nm), the electrospun air filters had a much smaller pore size compared to the surgical mask and cloth masks (a couple of microns versus tens to hundreds of microns). A coronavirus strain was used to generate aerosols for filtration efficiency tests, which can better represent SARS-CoV-2 than other agents used for aerosol generation in previous studies. The electrospun air filters showed excellent performance by capturing up to 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols, which outperformed many commercial face masks. In addition, since NaCl aerosols have been widely used in filtration tests, we compared the filtration efficiency obtained from the coronavirus aerosols and the NaCl aerosols. The NaCl aerosols were demonstrated as an eligible surrogate for the coronavirus aerosols in the filtration tests, when air filters and face masks with diverse pore sizes, morphologies, and efficiencies were used. Our work paves a new avenue for advancing air filtration by developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission.

Notably, due to both its high infective and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause a severe sometimes fatal respiratory disease. A specific vaccine, which relies on the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein-derived antigenic peptides, is indispensable for restraining the spread and reducing the mortality of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infections activate cytototxic, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, as well as natural killer, B, helper T, and regulatory T cells, thus further stimulating innate and antigen-specific immune responses. Nevertheless, many immune effector cells cause hyperinflammation and pulmonary immunopathology by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interferon (IFN)-&#945;, IFN-?, IFN-?3, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, MIP1B, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, and induced protein 10.

However, acknowledging that public discourse around COVID-19 is multi-faceted and evolves over time poses both analytical and ontological challenges. Studies that use text-mining approaches to analyse responses to major events commonly treat public discourse on social media as an undifferentiated whole, without systematically examining the extent to which that discourse consists of distinct sub-discourses or which phases characterize its development. They also confound structured behavioural data (i.e., tagging) with unstructured user-generated data (i.e., content of tweets) in their sampling methods.

In this article, we review findings of how aging alters immunity to respiratory viral infections to identify age-impacted pathways common to several viral pathogens, permitting us to speculate about potential mechanisms of age-enhanced mortality to COVID-19. Aging generally leads to exaggerated innate immunity, particularly in the form of elevated neutrophil accumulation across murine and large animal studies of influenza infection. COVID-19 patients who succumb exhibit a 2-fold increase in neutrophilia, suggesting that exaggerated innate immunity contributes to age-enhanced mortality to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation in relevant experimental models will elucidate the mechanisms by which aging impacts respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

We investigated the performance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on blood in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia among children from 7 low- and middle-income countries. METHODS. We tested blood by PCR for the pneumococcal autolysin gene in children aged 1C59 months in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study. Children had World Health OrganizationCdefined severe or very severe pneumonia or were age-frequencyCmatched community controls. Additionally, we tested blood from general pediatric admissions in Kilifi, Kenya, a PERCH site. The proportion PCR-positive was compared among cases with microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (MCPP), cases without a confirmed bacterial infection (nonconfirmed), cases confirmed for nonpneumococcal bacteria, and controls. RESULTS. In PERCH, 7.3% (n = 291/3995) of cases and 5.5% (n = 273/4987) of controls were blood pneumococcal PCR-positive (P < .001), compared with 64.3% (n = 36/56) of MCPP cases and 6.3% (n = 243/3832) of nonconfirmed cases (P < .001). Blood pneumococcal PCR positivity was higher in children from the 5 African countries (5.5%C11.5% among cases and 5.3%C10.2% among controls) than from the 2 Asian countries (1.3% and 1.0% among cases and 0.8% and 0.8% among controls). Among Kilifi general pediatric admissions, 3.9% (n = 274/6968) were PCR-positive, including 61.7% (n = 37/60) of those with positive blood cultures for pneumococcus. DISCUSSION. The utility of pneumococcal PCR on blood for diagnosing childhood pneumococcal pneumonia in the 7 low- and middle-income countries studied is limited by poor specificity and by poor sensitivity among MCPP cases.","output":"Detection of Pneumococcal DNA in Blood by Polymerase Chain Reaction for Diagnosing Pneumococcal Pneumonia in Young Children From Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serotonin type-3 receptor (5-HT3R) antagonists show potential as a treatment for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. CVN058, a brain-penetrant, potent and selective 5-HT3R antagonist, shows efficacy in rodent models of cognition and was well-tolerated in Phase-1 studies. We evaluated the target engagement of CVN058 using mismatch negativity (MMN) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Subjects were stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with antipsychotics. Subjects were not permitted to use other 5-HT3R modulators or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Each subject received a high (150 mg) and low (15 mg or 75 mg) oral dose of CVN058 and placebo in a randomized order across 3 single-day treatment visits separated by at least 1 week. The primary pre-registered outcome was amplitude of duration MMN. Amplitude of other MMN deviants (frequency, intensity, frequency modulation, and location), P50, P300 and auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were exploratory endpoints. 19 of 22 randomized subjects (86.4%) completed the study. Baseline PANSS scores indicated moderate impairment. CVN058 150 mg led to significant improvement vs. placebo on the primary outcome of duration MMN (p = 0.02, Cohen's d = 0.48). A significant treatment effect was also seen in a combined analysis across all MMN deviants (p < 0.001, d = 0.57). Effects on location MMN were independently significant (p < 0.007, d = 0.46).

METHODS: The risk of transmission of MERS-CoV infection to healthcare workers (HCWs) was assessed in an outbreak in Riyadh. All HCWs with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24 h of exposure. Two negative results for MERS-CoV obtained 3 days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to end the isolation of the HCWs and allow their return to duty. RESULTS: Overall 17 out of 879 HCWS with different levels of exposure tested positive for MERS-CoV. Of the 15 positive HCWS with adequate follow-up, 40% (6/15 HCWs) tested positive on the first sampling and 53% (8/15) tested positive on the second sampling. The time to negative results among the 15 positive HCWs ranged between 4 and 47 days (average 14.5 days) and the infected HCWs needed on average two samples for clearance. All positive HCWs were either asymptomatic or had mild disease. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained in this study support the widespread testing of all close contacts of MERS-CoV cases, regardless of the significance of the contact or presence or absence of symptoms.

We performed a meta-analysis examining risk factors for intracranial aneurysm growth in longitudinal studies and examined the association between aneurysm growth and rupture. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched the literature for longitudinal studies of patients with unruptured aneurysms. We examined the associations of demographics, multiple aneurysms, prior subarachnoid hemorrhage, family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, smoking, and hypertension; and aneurysm shape, size, and location with aneurysm growth. We studied the association between aneurysm growth and rupture. A meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model by using summary statistics from included studies. RESULTS Twenty-one studies including 3954 patients with 4990 aneurysms with 13,294 aneurysm-years of follow-up were included. The overall proportion of growing aneurysms was 3.0% per aneurysm-year (95% CI, 2.0%-4.0%). Patient risk factors for growth included age older than 50 years (3.8% per year versus 0.9% per year, P < .01), female sex (3.2% per year versus 1.3% per year, P < .01), and smoking history (5.5% per year versus 3.5% per year, P < .01). Characteristics associated with higher growth rates included cavernous carotid artery location (14.4% per year), nonsaccular shape (14.7% per year versus 5.2% per year for saccular, P < .01), and aneurysm size (P < .01). Aneurysm growth was associated with a rupture rate of 3.1% per year compared with 0.1% per year for stable aneurysms (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Observational evidence provided multiple clinical and anatomic risk factors for aneurysm growth, including age older than 50 years, female sex, smoking history, and nonsaccular shape.

Methods: Students participated in a survey that included the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS), and two questions requiring them to define and explain the relevance of OH. The transcripts of the OH responses underwent thematic analysis. Role theory was used to explain the variation in how students from these different programmes viewed the concept. Results: The responses of the MD and DVM students in contrast to the dual degree MPH students reflected gaps in their understanding of the concept that pertained to the specific health impacts of global warming; antimicrobial resistance, food security; social, cultural and environmental determinants of zoonoses occurrence, and health policy formation. Discussion: Mitigation of the global risks to public health require a collaborative approach by health professionals. Our findings suggest that MD and DVM students are unaware of many factors that impact patient health outside of their own discipline.

Forty Bama mini-pigs were randomly allocated into two groups and fed a basal diet (control group) and basal diet with 3.50 kg ton-1 betaine hydrochloride (betaine group) from day 3 after mating to day 21 of lactation. After 21 days of the delivery, 12 suckling piglets from each group with similar body weight were selected for sample collection. RESULTS The results showed that maternal betaine hydrochloride addition decreased (P < 0.05) the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- in suckling piglets. Furthermore, dietary betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets increased (P < 0.05) the villus height (VH) and VH to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum and ileum of suckling piglets. In the piglets' intestinal microbiota community, the relative abundances of Roseburia (P < 0.05) and Clostridium (P = 0.059) were lower in the betaine group than those in the control group.

The CoV and CoV2 Mpro are 97% identical at the sequence level, with 12 variable residues, and their X-ray structures appear similar.

The treatment consisting of a combination of phosphate buffer, dithiothreitol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and proteinase K, and an additional 95 C heating yielded the lower LOD 95 and the sensitivity ranged from 100% in patients with RT-PCRs NPS of Ct<20 to 47.8% in patients with Cts>30. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the importance for an adequate sample treatment in saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and describes a cheap and flexible procedure that can be adapted to-point-of-care and, although its sensitivity is lower than RT-PCRs, can contribute to the Covid-19 control by the detection of individuals able to transmit the disease.","output":"Evaluation of different sample treatments options in a simple and safe procedure for the detection of SARS-COV-2 in saliva"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure, and it is the main cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19.1,2 This article is protected by copyright.

Recent studies show that with appropriate education, nurses and midwives can provide abortions as safely as medical practitioners. AIMS To examine the attitudes and practices of registered midwives (RMs) and sexual health nurses (SHNs) in Queensland toward abortion. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional mixed-methods questionnaire was distributed to RMs and SHNs from the Queensland Nursing and Midwifery Union. Data were described and analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS There was a 20% response rate (n = 624) to the survey from the overall study population. There were 53.5% who reported they would support the provision of abortion in any situation at all; 7.4% held views based on religion or conscience that would make them completely opposed to abortion. There were 92.9% who felt that education surrounding abortion should be part of the core curriculum for midwifery and/or nursing students in Australia. The qualitative responses demonstrated a variety of views and suggestions regarding the practice of abortion. CONCLUSIONS There was a wide variation in views toward induced abortion from RMs and SHNs in Queensland. While a proportion of respondents opposed abortion in most circumstances, a significant group was in support of abortion in any situation and felt involvement in initiating and/or performing abortion would be within the scope of RMs and SHNs.","output":"Views and practice of abortion among Queensland midwives and sexual health nurses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We would like to share ideas on the report on \\"Hydroxychloroquine in Patients with Rheumatic Disease Complicated by COVID-19: Clarifying Target Exposures and the Need for Clinical Trials [1].\\"Balevic noted that \\"well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine [1].\\"","output":"Evidence of protective effect of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Factors affecting outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people living with HIV are unclear. We assessed the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and severe outcomes among people living with HIV. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study using data from the PISCIS cohort of people with HIV in Catalonia (Spain) between March 1 and Dec 15, 2020. We linked PISCIS data with integrated health-care, clinical, and surveillance registries through the Public Data Analysis for Health Research and Innovation Program of Catalonia (PADRIS) to obtain data on SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, chronic comorbidities, as well as clinical and mortality outcomes. Participants were aged at least 16 years in care at 16 hospitals in Catalonia. Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses and severe outcomes were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. We estimated the effect of immunosuppression on severe outcomes (hospital admission for >24 h with dyspnoea, tachypnoea, hypoxaemia, asphyxia, or hyperventilation; or death) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. FINDINGS: We linked 20 847 (728%) of 28 666 participants in the PISCIS cohort with PADRIS data; 13 142 people had HIV. 749 (57%) people with HIV were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2: their median age was 435 years (IQR 370C527), 131 (175%) were female, and 618 (825%) were male. 103 people with HIV (138%) were hospitalised, seven (09%) admitted to intensive care, and 13 (17%) died. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was more common among migrants (adjusted hazard ratio 155, 95% CI 131C183), men who have sex with men (142, 109C186), and those with four or more chronic comorbidities (146, 109C197). Age at least 75 years (52, 18C153), non-Spanish origin (21, 13C34), and neuropsychiatric (169, 107C269), autoimmune disease (192, 114C323), respiratory disease (184, 109C309), and metabolic disease (259, 159C423) chronic comorbidities were associated with increased risk of severe outcomes. A Kaplan-Meier estimator showed differences in the risk of severe outcomes according to CD4 cell count in patients with detectable HIV RNA (p=0039) but no differences were observed in patients with undetectable HIV RNA (p=015). INTERPRETATION: People living with HIV with detectable HIV viraemia, chronic comorbidities, and some subpopulations could be at increased risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. These groups should be prioritised in clinical management and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes. FUNDING: Fundaci la Caixa.

To do that, we first survey two well studied RdRps from Polio virus and hepatitis C virus in regard to structural motifs and key residues that have been identified for the nucleotide selectivity. Then we focus on related structural and biochemical characteristics discovered for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. To further compare, we summarize what we have learned computationally from phage T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) on its stepwise nucleotide selectivity, and extend discussion to a structurally similar human mitochondria RNAP, which deserves special attention as it cannot be adversely affected by antiviral treatments. We also include viral phi29 DNA polymerase for comparison, which has both helicase and proofreading activities on top of nucleotide selectivity for replication fidelity control.

The sample consisted of 4661 adults aged 30 years or above, and was chosen from the 2017 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data. Of all the subjects, 14.6% engaged in high-intensity DWPA and 6.25% in moderate-intensity DWPA; while 11.68% and 24.80% engaged in high- and moderate-intensity LTPA, respectively. The effects of both types of physical activities on the risk of diabetes were analyzed using a Bayesian ordered probit model. For those with high-intensity DWPA, the probability of the FBG level being normal was 5.10% (SE = 0.25) lower than for those with non-high-intensity DWPA, and the probabilities of IFG and diabetes were 3.30% (SE = 0.15) and 1.79% (SE = 0.09) higher, respectively. However, for those with high-intensity LTPA, the probability of the FBG level being normal was 2.54% (SE = 0.09) higher, and the probabilities of IFG and diabetes were 1.74% (SE = 0.07) and 0.80% (SE = 0.03) lower, respectively, than those with non-high-intensity LTPA. Likewise, for moderate-intensity DWPA and LTPA, the results were the same compared to low-intensity physical activities though the magnitude of the effects were smaller than for high-intensity. Thus, the activities related to work have a negative effect and those related to leisure have a positive effect. The criteria for physical activities to reduce the risk of diabetes should be set by separating these domains of physical activity, and new management strategies for diabetes are needed for people with moderate- or high-intensity DWPA.","output":"Opposite Effects of Work-Related Physical Activity and Leisure-Time Physical Activity on the Risk of Diabetes in Korean Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At calcium-specific ionophore A23187 concentrations of approximately 0.25 microM [which still allow assembly and release of fowl plague virus (FPV) particles] post-translational proteolytic cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin precursor HA into the fragments HA1 and HA2 is inhibited.

Unfortunately, many front-line treatment providers do not utilize CM, likely due to contextual barriers that limit effective training and ongoing support for evidence-based practices. This study applied user-informed approaches to adapt a multi-level implementation strategy called the Science to Service Laboratory (SSL) to support CM implementation. METHODS Leaders and treatment providers working in community-based opioid treatment programs (OTPs; N = 43) completed qualitative interviews inquiring about their preferences for training and support implementation strategies (didactic training, performance feedback, and external facilitation). Our team coded interviews using a reflexive team approach to identify common a priori and emergent themes. RESULTS Leaders and providers expressed a preference for brief training that included case examples and research data, along with experiential learning strategies. They reported a desire for performance feedback from internal supervisors, patients, and clinical experts. Providers and leaders had mixed feelings about audio-recording sessions but were open to the use of rating sheets to evaluate CM performance. Finally, participants desired both on-call and regularly scheduled external facilitation to support their continued use of CM. CONCLUSIONS This study provides an exemplar of a user-informed approach to adapt the SSL implementation support strategies for CM scale-up in community OTPs.

DESIGN: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, WHO COVID-19 database and Google Scholar were used to identify articles published up to 20 July 2021. Peer-reviewed studies reporting adjusted estimates of the association between overweight or obesity and COVID-19 outcomes were included. Three authors reviewed the articles and agreed. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the combined effects. RESULTS: A total of 208 studies with 3 550 997 participants from over 32 countries were included in this meta-analysis. Being overweight was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisations (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.28, n=21 studies), but not death (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.13, n=21). However, patients with obesity were at increased risk of both COVID-19-related hospitalisations (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.62 to 1.84, n=58) and death (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.32, n=77).

Due to disparate national regulations on various ethical aspects, such as informed consent, there is the risk of ethical compromises when involving human subjects in research. Although the Declaration of Helsinki is the point of reference for ethical conduct of research on humans, national normative requirements may diverge from its provisions. The aim of this research is to examine requirements on informed consent in biomedical research in Germany, Poland, and Russia to determine how each national regulatory framework relates to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. METHODS: For this analysis, we conducted a search of the legal databases Gesetze im Internet for Germany, Internetowy System Aktow Prawnych for Poland, and APAHT C Garant for Russia. The search was complemented by a review of secondary literature contained in the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, Polish National Library, and eLibrary.ru. We have identified 21 normative regulations containing provisions on informed consent in clinical research in all three countries. The content of these documents was systematically categorized and analyzed. RESULTS: The normative framework in all three countries shows a strong commitment towards the core ethical principles of research envisaged in the Declaration of Helsinki. Nevertheless, provisions on informed consent vary between these three countries. The differences range from the method and language in which information should be provided, through the amount of information required to be disclosed, to the form of documenting consent or withdrawal. In the case of research on vulnerable groups, these differences are particularly visible. CONCLUSIONS: The identified differences can negatively impact the ethical conduct of international clinical studies. Attention needs to be paid that flexibilities within national regulations are not misused to undermine the protection of research subjects.

Cellular receptor ACE2, serine protease TMPRSS2 and exopeptidase CD26 (also known as DPP4) are the three membrane bound proteins potentially implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesised that common variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 may play critical role in infection susceptibility of predisposed population or group of individuals. Coding (missense) and regulatory variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 were studied across 26 global populations. Two missense and five regulatory SNPs were identified to have differential allelic frequency. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) signature was observed in different populations. Modelled protein?protein interaction (PPI) predicted strong molecular interaction between these two receptors and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 domain). However, two missense SNPs, rs12329760 (TMPRSS2) and rs1129599 (CD26), were not found to be involved physically in the said interaction. Four regulatory variants (rs112657409, rs11910678, rs77675406 and rs713400) from TMPRSS2 were found to influence the expression of TMPRSS2 and pathologically relevant MX1. rs13015258 a 5 UTR variant from CD26 have significant role in regulation of expression of key regulatory genes that could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Overexpression of CD26 through epigenetic modification at rs13015258-C allele was found critical and could explain the higher SARS-CoV-2 infected fatality rate among type 2 diabetes.

A primary-care-based integrated mobile health intervention (SINEMA intervention) has been implemented and evaluated via a 1-year-long cluster-randomized controlled trial. This study reports the findings from the trial implementation and process evaluation that investigate the implementation of the intervention and inform factors that may influence the wider implementation of the intervention in the future. Methods: We developed an evaluation framework by employing both the RE-AIM framework and the MRC process evaluation framework to describe the implementation indicators, related enablers and barriers, and illustrate some potential impact pathways that may influence the effectiveness of the intervention in the trial. Quantitative data were collected from surveys and extracted from digital health monitoring systems. In addition, we conducted quarterly in-depth interviews with stakeholders in order to understand barriers and enablers of program implementation and effectiveness. Quantitative data analysis and thematic qualitative data analysis were applied, and the findings were synthesized based on the evaluation framework. Results: The SINEMA intervention was successfully implemented in 25 rural villages, reached 637 patients with stroke in rural Northern China during the 12 months of the trial. Almost 90% of the participants received all follow-up visits per protocol, and about half of the participants received daily voice messages. The majority of the intervention components were adopted by village doctors with some adaptation made. The interaction between human-delivered and technology-enabled components reinforced the program implementation and effectiveness. However, characteristics of the participants, doctor-patient relationships, and the healthcare system context attributed to the variation of program implementation and effectiveness. Conclusion: A comprehensive evaluation of program implementation demonstrates that the SINEMA program was well implemented in rural China. Findings from this research provide additional information for program adaptation, which shed light on the future program scale-up.

ANIMALS 229 lactating and nonlactating adult cattle (125 case and 104 control cattle) selected from 12 dairy herds. PROCEDURE A case-control study, using multivariate conditional logistic regression and controlling for herd effects, was used to develop a model for risk factors associated with disease for each cow. RESULTS Likelihood of developing disease increased as the ELISA value for bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen detectable in feces increased (odds ratio [OR] = 2.94 for each 0.100 increase in BCV antigen ELISA value). Pregnant cattle were less likely to develop WD, compared with nonpregnant herdmates. Cows with high acute BCV antibody titers that seroresponded had greater odds of developing disease, compared with seroresponding cows with low acute titers. However, among those cows that did not serorespond, high acute antibody titers were associated with lower odds of developing the disease. CONCLUSION In herds affected by WD, ill cows were more likely to shed detectable amounts of BCV antigen in their feces, and pregnancy appeared to protect cattle from the disease. The measured interaction between BCV seroresponse and acute BCV antibody titer may be evidence of an immunopathologic condition, but could also have been attributable to dynamics of the ELISA or study design. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Factors that explained a cow's risk for illness within WD-affected herds may have been surrogate measures for that cow's nonspecific and BCV-specific immune profile.","output":"Evaluation of cow-level risk factors for the development of winter dysentery in dairy cattle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To date, there is no consensus on the selection of type and size of prosthetic valve for aortic valve replacement (AVR).

METHODS A total of 92 patients with serious aortic valve stenosis, who underwent AVR between March 2001 and June 2008 using mechanical valves of different sizes, were retrospectively analysed. The sizes of the mechanical valves were 19, 21, 23 and 25 mm. All patients were assessed preoperatively, and at six months and in the first, third and fifth years postoperatively. The left ventricle was assessed with electrocardiography, echocardiography and telecardiography and compared in the four patient groups, constituted according to the mechanical valve size used. RESULTS In all groups, left ventricular mass and mass index, transvalvular aortic gradient, thicknesses of the interventricular septum and posterior wall, and left ventricular endsystolic and end-diastolic diameters had decreased significantly post surgery. Left ventricular ejection fraction and exercise capacity had increased significantly (p < 0.001). The most noteworthy anatomical and functional improvements were seen in patients who had received 23- and 25-mm mechanical valves.

However, the screening of arthropods, including Culicoides biting midges collected within the same surveillance program, tested negative for Letea virus infection and could not confirm the arthropod vector of the virus. The study provided complete genome sequences for nine Letea virus strains and new information about orbivirus diversity, host range, ecology and evolution.

A preoperative ostomy education program was developed to meet this need, and we conducted a qualitative study with participating patient-caregiver dyads to evaluate the educational and psychosocial impacts of the program and examine alignment with program objectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted utilizing a thematic analysis approach. Sixteen patients, eighteen caregivers, and three program educators completed semi-structured interviews from 3 to 18 months post the program. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thirteen end-of-course surveys from the initial educational program cohort were transcribed, coded, analyzed; this data was triangulated with patient, caregiver, and educator interviews. RESULTS: Analysis uncovered three themes: (1) Patient and caregiver motivation to attend the program, (2) attitudes toward this life-changing event, and (3) education. For theme 1, patients and caregivers cited lack of knowledge, fear, and concern about ostomy surgery and care as motivation. For theme 2, there were a variety of attitudes toward the ostomy, ranging from avoidance to acceptance, and a similar breadth of attitudes toward caregiving, with some patients and caregivers describing ongoing dependence and other patients seeking complete independence. For theme 3, the interactive curriculum was determined to be effective, and the patient advocate was cited as the most memorable program component. CONCLUSIONS: A formal preoperative ostomy education program employing an interactive educational approach and featuring a patient advocate can prepare bladder cancer patients and caregivers for ostomy self-management and post-ostomy life.","output":"A qualitative evaluation of a nurse-led pre-operative stoma education program for bladder cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severely ill COVID\\\\19 patients have a high risk of admission to the intensive\\\\care unit (ICU) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV), with in\\\\hospital mortality reported as 18\\\\79% globally.(1\\\\4).

Currently, popular testing methods such as reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can have high false negative rates. Consequently, COVID-19 patients are not accurately identified nor treated quickly enough to prevent transmission of the virus. However, the recent rise of medical CT data has presented promising avenues, since CT manifestations contain key characteristics indicative of COVID-19. Findings: This study aimed to take a novel approach in the machine learning-based detection of COVID-19 from chest CT scans. First, the dataset utilized in this study was derived from three major sources, comprising a total of 17,698 chest CT slices across 923 patient cases. Additionally, image preprocessing algorithms were developed to reduce noise by excluding irrelevant features. Transfer learning was also implemented with the EfficientNetB7 pre-trained model to provide a backbone architecture and save computational resources. Lastly, several explainability techniques were leveraged to qualitatively validate model performance by localizing infected regions and highlighting fine-grained pixel details. The proposed model attained an overall accuracy of 92.71% and a sensitivity of 95.79%. Explainability measures showed that the model correctly distinguished between relevant, critical features pertaining to COVID-19 chest CT images and normal controls. Conclusions: Deep learning frameworks provide efficient, human-interpretable COVID-19 diagnostics that could complement a radiologists decision or serve as an alternative screening tool. Future endeavors could provide insight into infection severity, patient risk stratification, and more precise visualizations.","output":"A Novel Implementation of Machine Learning for the Efficient, Explainable Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in children and adolescents are often underestimated due to asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections. Seroprevalence studies can reveal the magnitude of silent infections in this age group and help to assess the risk of infection for children but also their role in spreading the disease. In total, 2045 children and their parents from the Ruhr region were finally included after the exclusion of drop-outs. Seroconversion rates among children of all age groups increased from 0.5% to 8% during the study period and were about three to fourfold higher than the officially registered PCR-based infection rates. Only 41% recalled symptoms of infection; 59% were asymptomatic. In 51% of the infected children, at least one parent also developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Depending on local incidences, the rates of seroconversion rose to different levels during the study period. Although the dynamics of infection within the study cohort mirrors local incidence, the figure of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and adolescents appears to be high.

Then, the recombinant fragment in pMD18-T was subcloned into corresponding sites of prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1 after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI to construct a recombinant fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-M. Then, the verified recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rossetta (DE3), and the expression of M fusion protein was induced by using isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) as inducer. The results showed that the gene fragment of M at a length of 789 bp was amplified and cloned into the vector pMD18-T successfully, and sequence comparison with that reported in GenBank revealed that the M gene complete sequence shares more than 94% homology in nucleotide. The result of SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant membrane protein had a molecular mass of approximately 56 kDa, which was the same as the expected results. It was proven by Western blotting that the recombinant membrane protein had strong positive reactions with TGEV-specific antibody. Therefore, the expressed fusion protein has a good antigenicity.

Its practice and history have been researched in the context of experiential learning, but few studies have explicitly examined how solo experiences can affect dimensions of well-being. This study investigated a broad range of well-being pathways provided by being solo, based on data from Norway, Germany, and New Zealand. Methods: Using qualitative content analysis (QCA), the solo debrief responses of 40 participants (26 females, age: 19C64 years) were analysed, applying the PERMA-V framework (emotions, engagement, relationship, meaning, achievement, and vitality). Variations in the reports were explored as a function of the national sample, gender, age, prior solo experiences and expectations. Results: The study suggests that hedonic and eudemonic well-being pathways, represented by the six PERMA-V pillars, interrelate strongly. The experience of a range of positive emotions and connecting process during solo highlights two of the most frequent findings related to well-being pathways. The secondary findings suggest minor variations in the well-being pathways for the different national samples, gender and age. Expectations and prior experiences with solo were identified as context factors with minor impact. Further, the data-driven analysis identified specific physical activities, landscape features, sense-activation, perception of time and good weather as relevant to the specific experience. Conclusions: Solo experiences provide for well-being-related pathways in a multitude of ways, which highlights the well-being potential of solo implementation across practical fields beyond outdoor education, such as wilderness therapy, and environmental and planetary health initiatives.

We investigated whether whole-genome sequencing enhanced the epidemiological investigation of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Methods: From 17-November-2020 to 5-January-2021, 803 inpatients and 329 staff were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at four Oxfordshire hospitals. We classified cases using epidemiological definitions, looked for a potential source for each nosocomial infection, and evaluated genomic evidence supporting transmission. Results: Using national epidemiological definitions, 109/803(14%) inpatient infections were classified as definite/probable nosocomial, 615(77%) as community-acquired and 79(10%) as indeterminate. There was strong epidemiological evidence to support definite/probable cases as nosocomial. Many indeterminate cases were likely infected in hospital: 53/79(67%) had a prior-negative PCR and 75(95%) contact with a potential source. 89/615(11% of all 803 patients) with apparent community-onset had a recent hospital exposure. Within 764 samples sequenced 607 genomic clusters were identified (>1 SNP distinct). Only 43/607(7%) clusters contained evidence of onward transmission (subsequent cases within 1 SNP). 20/21 epidemiologically-identified outbreaks contained multiple genomic introductions. Most (80%) nosocomial acquisition occurred in rapid super-spreading events in settings with a mix of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.

When close others misbehave, it generates a powerful conflict between observers' moral values and their cherished relationships. Previous research has almost exclusively studied moral perception in a social vacuum by investigating responses to the transgressions of strangers; therefore, little is known about how these responses unfold in the context of intimate bonds. Here we systematically examine the impact of having a close relationship with a transgressor on perceptions of that transgressor, the relationship, and the self. We predicted less negative emotional and evaluative responses to transgressors and smaller consequences for the relationship, yet more negative emotional and evaluative responses to the self when close others, compared with strangers or acquaintances, transgress. Participants read hypothetical wrongdoings (Study 1), recalled unethical events (Study 2), reported daily transgressions (Study 3; preregistered), and learned of novel immoral behavior (Study 4) committed by close others or comparison groups. Participants reported less other-critical emotions, more lenient moral evaluations, a reduced desire to punish/criticize, and a smaller impact on the relationship (compared with acquaintances) when close others versus strangers or acquaintances transgressed. Simultaneously, participants reported more self-conscious emotions and showed some evidence of harsher moral self-evaluations when close others transgressed. Underlying mechanisms of this process were examined. Our findings demonstrate the deep ambivalence in reacting to close others' unethical behaviors, revealing a surprising irony-in protecting close others, the self may bear some of the burden of their misbehavior.

In GBM, each of these cellular fractions was shown to harbor cardinal features of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, we focus on the comparison of these cells and present evidence of great phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in brain cancer cell populations with stemness properties, especially between slow-cycling cells (SCCs) and cells phenotypically defined based on the expression of markers commonly used to enrich for CSCs. Here, we present an integrative analysis of the heterogeneity present in GBM cancer stem cell populations using a combination of approaches including flow cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing, and single cell transcriptomics completed with functional assays. We demonstrated that SCCs exhibit a diverse range of expression levels of canonical CSC markers. Importantly, the property of being slow-cycling and the expression of these markers were not mutually inclusive. We interrogated a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset and defined a group of cells as SCCs based on the highest score of a specific metabolic signature. Multiple CSC groups were determined based on the highest expression level of CD133, SOX2, PTPRZ1, ITGB8, or CD44. Each group, composed of 22 cells, showed limited cellular overlap, with SCCs representing a unique population with none of the 22 cells being included in the other groups. We also found transcriptomic distinctions between populations, which correlated with clinicopathological features of GBM.

BACKGROUND Live teleophthalmology using video conferencing allows real-time, three-way consultation between secondary care, community providers and patients, improving interpretation of slit lamp findings and potentially reducing referrals to secondary care. NHS Forth Valley implemented live teleophthalmology in March 2019. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created urgency to deliver ophthalmic care while minimising the risk of contracting or spreading the disease. We aim to compare the uptake and two outcomes (number of avoided secondary care referrals; pattern of presenting conditions) of live teleophthalmology consultations in NHS Forth Valley before and during the COVID-19 national lockdown. METHODS An NHS secure video conferencing platform connected the video slit lamps of optometrists, or an iPad mounted on a slit lamp and viewing through the eyepieces, to a secondary care ophthalmologist via a virtual live clinic/waiting area. Data about avoiding a secondary care referral were extracted from a post-consultation ophthalmologist survey for 14 months of data. Pre- and during-lockdown intervals were before/after 23 March 2020, when routine eyecare appointments were suspended. Numbers of avoided referrals to secondary care and patterns of presenting conditions were compared for pre- and during-lockdown periods.

It was found that SARS-CoV M(pro) exists in solution as an equilibrium of both monomeric and dimeric forms, and the dimeric form is the enzymatically active form. However, the mechanism of SARS-CoV M(pro) dimerization, especially the roles of its N-terminal seven residues (N-finger) and its unique C-terminal domain in the dimerization, remain unclear. Here we report that the SARS-CoV M(pro) C-terminal domain alone (residues 187 to 306; M(pro)-C) is produced in Escherichia coli in both monomeric and dimeric forms, and no exchange could be observed between them at room temperature. The M(pro)-C dimer has a novel dimerization interface. Meanwhile, the N-finger deletion mutant of SARS-CoV M(pro) also exists as both a stable monomer and a stable dimer, and the dimer is formed through the same C-terminal-domain interaction as that in the M(pro)-C dimer. However, no C-terminal domain-mediated dimerization form can be detected for wild-type SARS-CoV M(pro). Our study results help to clarify previously published controversial claims about the role of the N-finger in SARS-CoV M(pro) dimerization. Apparently, without the N-finger, SARS-CoV M(pro) can no longer retain the active dimer structure; instead, it can form a new type of dimer which is inactive. Therefore, the N-finger of SARS-CoV M(pro) is not only critical for its dimerization but also essential for the enzyme to form the enzymatically active dimer.","output":"Without its N-finger, the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus can form a novel dimer through its C-terminal domain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many countries including Jordan have implemented strict lockdowns. These lockdowns were associated with temporary suspension of all outpatient clinics and all elective (Non emergent, non-oncologic) surgical procedures. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to report the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on otolaryngology practice in Jordan. METHODS: Retrospectively we reviewed all admissions to the otolaryngology wards of King Abdullah University Hospital during the lockdown and for the same dates for the year 2019, results were compared. Additionally, an online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian otolaryngologists in June 2020. The questionnaire was comprised of a series of multiple choice questions regarding each physician's participation in the treatment or screening of COVID-19 patients, the number of consultations during the lockdown, the numbers of elective and emergency surgical procedures performed during the lockdown and the effects the lockdown had on their practices, their patients conditions and teaching and training processes. The study was done in line with the criteria set by the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (OBrien et al., September 2014) [12]. STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: In our study, we aimed to include the experience of all otolaryngology practitioners in Jordan, providing a comprehensive view of the lockdown effects on practice in the region. The data found is likely representative of lockdown effects on all departments, not just otolaryngological practice, and may be beneficial in providing a pathway to minimize any negative impact on patient care. However, our data may be limited due to its dependence on responses through a Whatsapp questionnaire, with no guarantee that the answers provided are fully accurate. It also may have a certain degree of sampling bias, as while the questionnaire was sent to all ENT practitioners in Jordan, answering it was totally optional, and so people who did not respond to the survey were not accounted for. RESULTS: During the lockdown period in Jordan all outpatient clinics were closed, and all elective surgical procedures (non-emergency and non-oncologic procedures) were suspended. During the lockdown it was observed that there was a reduction in the number of admissions related to post-operative complications, head and neck abscesses & infections and foreign bodies related admission when compared to the same period of 2019. A total of 144 otolaryngologists have participated in the questionnaire part of the study. More than half of the participants (n = 80, 55.6%) reported providing 10 or less consultations during the lockdown, more than half of the them have not performed any emergency surgical procedures during the lockdown, and a total of 110 (76.4%) of the 144 participants reported having at least 1 patient whose condition worsened during the lockdown due to lack or delay in medical care. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resultant lockdown period in Jordan has caused a significant shift in otolaryngological practice throughout the country, with a complete cessation of all outpatient clinics and elective surgical procedures and admissions, with activity being limited to oncological and emergency procedures only. These changes have already impacted the dynamics of patient care and might lead to a risk of diagnostic delays which will have severe impacts on patient's health.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 outbreak on otolaryngology practice, jordanian experience: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought social injustice and inequalities to the forefront of global public health. Members of marginalised communities, such as racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, and persons with disabilities, have been shown to be more vulnerable to certain consequences of the pandemic. Research suggests a protective role of social support in health and wellness promotion, yet little is known about the disparities in specific social support sources (i.e., family, friends, and a significant other) between marginalised populations and their counterparts. Also unclear is the role of intersections of these marginalised identities in social support structures affected by the pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to capture and characterise such differences and intersectionality in order to address social inequalities in a time of global crisis. To that end, we surveyed U.S. adults across 45 states to examine their social support from family, friends, and a significant other. Results revealed the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on social support among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities and persons with disabilities. Additionally, we found that White individuals with a marginalised identity received less social support than their White counterparts but received a similar level of social support when compared with racial/ethnic minorities without additional marginalised identities. This article seeks to elucidate the social support disparities associated with disproportionately increased social isolation for marginalised populations due to socioeconomic disadvantages. Specific recommendations are provided for addressing issues around social disparities and inequalities. With the experience and awareness attained working with marginalised populations, mental health professionals, public health officials, and community stakeholders should be poised to attend to social capital inequalities for diversity, equity, and inclusion now and in the post-pandemic era.","output":"Disparities and intersectionality in social support networks: addressing social inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Implant rehabilitation of the atrophic right posterior mandible in a 48-year-old woman using dehydrated homologous bone block, shaped with a computer aided design-computer aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) system, to avoid harvesting of autologous bone block and to assure a perfect fitting of the block above the alveolar crest.

METHODS: This retrospective study was done on patient admissions (>18 years) between 20(th) June- 30(th) October 2020 with previously diagnosed CKD and hospitalised with COVID-19 infection. The demographic details, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, medications, laboratory, radiological profile and outcomes were studied. RESULTS: A total of 213 adults (62% males) with CKD were admitted during this period with a median (IQR) age of 52 (42, 60) years; 75 (35.2%) had associated diabetes mellitus, 83.1% hypertension, 5.2% hypothyroidism and 7% coronary artery disease. 165 (77.5%) were on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD), and 72.8% had arteriovenous fistula as vascular access at presentation. Most (84.5%) patients were symptomatic for COVID-19, and about 2/3 diarrhoea had moderate to severe disease. Oxygen therapy was needed in 62.9%, and medications used were hydroxychloroquine in 84.5%, azithromycin in 21.6%, ivermectin in 82.6%, steroids in 63.8% and Low molecular weight heparin in 59.2%. A further comparison of patients with CKD5D and CKDND revealed similar parameters except for a higher incidence of diarrhoea, acute kidney injury (AKI) and a shorter period to RTPCR negativity (12.5 vs 15 days; P = 0.038) in CKDND. The overall mortality was 24.4%, with similar mortality rates in both groups (P = 0.709) and 20.7% needed ICU transfer.

Previous studies indicated that this dominant theory applies in Korea as well. However, we find that this dominant theory does not apply in Korea. Based on an analysis of survey data, we find that beliefs in conspiracy theories have positive impact on preventive actions and vaccination intentions. In addition, beliefs in conspiracy theories play indirect roles in these two responses to COVID-19. Specifically, when perceived benefits and trust in the government or science enhance preventive actions or increase vaccination intentions, strong beliefs in conspiracy theories promote this effect.

Based on the beneficial effects of the AFO-202 strain of black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans-produced beta 1,3-1,6 glucan in balancing of blood glucose and immune enhancement, and that of the N-163 strain of the same species in lipid metabolism and immune modulation, in this pilot study, we have evaluated their specific benefits in healthy human subjects. Methods: Sixteen healthy Japanese male volunteers (aged 40 to 60 years) took part in this clinical trial. They were divided into four groups (n = 4 each): Group I consumed AFO-202 beta glucan (2 sachets of 1 g each per day), IA for 35 days and IB for 21 days; Group II consumed a combination of AFO-202 beta glucan (2 sachets of 1 g each) and N-163 beta glucan (1 sachet of 15 g gel each per day), IIA for 35 days and IIB for 21 days. Investigations for immune stimulation, anti-glycaemic, and anti-cholesterolemia biomarkers were undertaken in all four groups. Results: In terms of metabolic control of glucose, the decrease in HbA1C and glycated albumin (GA) was significantly better in Group I compared with the other groups. Immune enhancement in terms of a significant increase of eosinophils and monocytes and marginal decrease in D-dimer levels, decrease in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with an increase in the lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCR) and leukocyte-to-CRP ratio (LeCR) was observed in Group I. Regulation of lipids by decrease in total and LDL cholesterol was better in Group II, and immunomodulation of coagulation-associated and anti-inflammatory markers by a decrease of CD11b, serum ferritin, galectin-3, fibrinogen was profound in Group II. Conclusion: A. pullulans, a polythermotolerant black yeast - produced AFO-202 beta glucan has balanced blood glucose with marginal immune enhancement in healthy individuals, which when combined with N-163 beta glucan, balanced the lipid profile and immunomodulation. This outcome warrants larger clinical trials to understand the mechanisms and explore the potentials of these safe food supplements in prevention and prophylaxis of diseases due to dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, such as fatty liver disease, and infections such as COVID-19 in which a balanced immune activation and immunomodulation are of utmost importance, besides their administration as an adjunct to existing therapeutic approaches of both communicable and non-communicable diseases.","output":"Immune and metabolic beneficial effects of Beta 1,3-1,6 glucans produced by two novel strains of Aureobasidium pullulans in healthy middle-aged Japanese men: An exploratory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background New endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December 2019.

Results: A low binding affinity was observed between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (protein S, M and 6YLA) and ACE2. Coronaviruses are also reported to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is a network protein of ACE2. Network analysis showed five membrane proteins associated with ACE2. The ACE2 network proteins were assessed for their binding affinity with all known SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins showed preferential binding to network proteins such as DPP4 and Meprin A alpha but not ACE2. The binding efficacy (affinity (-5.86 to -7.10 Kcal/mol), Ki (6.32 C 22.04 mM) and IC50 (12.63 C 113.71 mM) values) of DPP4 inhibitors (saxagliptin and sitagliptin) against SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, was observed to be at a therapeutically feasible concentration to prevent SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry into host cells. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins has better interactions with DPP4 and Meprin A alpha host cells receptors rather than ACE2. DPP4 inhibitors (saxagliptin and sitagliptin) by binding with SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins may be helpful in preventing the virus entry into the host cells.","output":"Network proteins of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but not angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 itself are host cell receptors for SARS-Coronavirus-2 attachment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with a high rate of morbidity and elevate mortality, has emerged as one of the most important threats to humankind in the last centuries.

To gain an understanding of the role Black racial identity may have on postpartum mental health, the researchers performed a secondary data analysis to examine the relationship between six Black racial identity clusters (Low Race Salience, Assimilated and Miseducated, Self-Hating, Anti-white, Multiculturalist, and Conflicted) and postpartum maternal functioning in Black women living in Georgia. METHODS: Black women completed Crosss Racial Identity Scale, the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning, and demographic questionnaires online via Qualtrics?. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample of 116 self-identified Black postpartum women were included in the analysis. Women ranged in age from 18 to 41 years (M = 29.5  5.3) and their infants were 1 to 12 months old (M = 5.6  3.5). The majority of women were married/cohabitating with their partner (71%), had a college degree (53%), and employed (69%). RESULTS: It was determined through Kruskal Wallis test, (2)(5) = 20.108, p < 0.05, that the women belonging to the Assimilated and Miseducated cluster had higher levels of maternal functioning when compared to the women in the Self-Hating and Anti-white clusters.

Objective: The objective was to analyze the patients' characteristics, hematological, biochemical, and chest imaging findings among the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Egypt and also to shed light on the predictors of COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 66 patients with COVID-19 in Egypt. Medical history, imaging data (CT chest findings), and measured hematological and biochemical parameters at diagnosis were recorded in the form of complete blood counts and differential counts; CRP, ESR, serum ferritin, creatinine, and liver function tests . Results of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at diagnosis and during follow up of these patients were also recorded. Results: The study included 36 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and 30 patients with severe/critical infection. There was a significant older age among severe (62.6 years old 10.1SD) than mild to moderate infection (55.5  10.1) (p??0.05). Fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and sore throat malaise were highly frequent among COVID-19 patients, while headache and diarrhea were the least frequently occurring manifestations. All included cases (30 patients, 100%) with severe COVID-19 showed crazy-paving appearance (in the form of reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening) with or without GGO.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES COVID-19 testing, approaches to personal protective equipment (PPE), and features of respiratory isolation units (RIUs). RESULTS Fifty-one of 72 sites responded (71%) between April 3 and April 5, 2020. At the time of our survey, only 15 (30%) reported COVID-19 test results being available in less than 6 hours. Half of sites with PPE data available reported PPE stockpiles of 2 weeks or less. Nearly all sites (90%) reported implementation of RIUs. RIUs primarily utilized attending physicians, with few incorporating residents and none incorporating students. Isolation and room-entry policies focused on grouping care activities and utilizing technology (such as video visits) to communicate with and evaluate patients. The vast majority of sites reported decreases in frequency of in-room encounters across provider or team types. Forty-six percent of respondents reported initially unrecognized non-COVID-19 diagnoses in patients admitted for COVID-19 evaluation; a similar number reported delayed identification of COVID-19 in patients admitted for other reasons. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has required medical wards to rapidly adapt with expanding use of RIUs and use of technology emerging as critical approaches.

Women make up 80% of those receiving weight loss surgery and they experience improvements in fertility. Unfortunately, bariatric surgery in the context of pregnancy is associated with complications, including growth restriction and small-for-gestational age offspring (SGA). SGA offspring have a greater risk for obesity in adulthood, although the mechanism for this SGA-induced obesity is unknown. In a rat model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), we previously identified reductions during pregnancy in ghrelin, a stomach-derived hormone that increases appetite and induces growth hormone secretion. Here, we hypothesise that VSG offspring will have altered ghrelin signalling compared to offspring of Sham dams as a result of reduced in utero ghrelin. At postnatal day (PND)21, male and female offspring of dams that have previously received VSG have an increase in mRNA expression for the ghrelin receptor in the hypothalamus compared to Sham offspring, and the expression of GOAT is lower in females compared to males. Liver expression of endogenous ghrelin antagonist, LEAP2, is elevated at PND60 in VSG offspring. Expression of other genes in the growth hormone system (growth hormone-releasing hormone and growth hormone) were not altered. Plasma levels of total ghrelin at PND21 are also not different between VSG and Sham pups. In adult pups, 1-hour chow intake of male but not female VSG offspring given is less than Sham offspring when given 50 g kg-1 of exogenous ghrelin by i.p. injection. These results indicate that maternal VSG surgery has an impact on ghrelin signalling in offspring and that, as adults, male VSG offspring may be functionally less responsive to ghrelin than controls.","output":"Ghrelin signalling is dysregulated in male but not female offspring in a rat model of maternal vertical sleeve gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute viral hepatitis in the world with an estimated 20 million infections per year.

Additionally, chronic hepatitis E has increasingly become a significant clinical problem in immunocompromised individuals. Effective antivirals against HEV are needed. AREAS COVERED This review article addresses the current state of knowledge of HEV infections with regard to animal and cell culture model systems that are important for antiviral discovery and testing, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of virus replication, our understanding of how each viral protein functions, and areas that can potentially be exploited as therapeutic targets. EXPERT OPINION Lack of an efficient cell culture system for HEV propagation, the limited knowledge of HEV lifecycle, and the inherent self-limiting infection within the normal populace make the development of new therapeutic agents against HEV challenging.

During the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, VAERS got more attention as its important role in monitoring the safety of the vaccines. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate VAERS patterns, reported AEFIs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), impact of different pandemics since its inception, and surveillance rate of serious vs nonserious AEFIs. MethodsThis was an observational study using VARES data from 2/7/1990 to 12/11/2021. Patterns of reports over years were first described, followed by a comparison of reports statistics per year. Furthermore, a comparison of incidents (death, ER visits, etc.) statistics over years, in addition to statistics of each vaccine were calculated. Moreover, each incidents statistics for each vaccine were calculated and top vaccines were reported. Finally, survival analysis utilizing cox regression was done, in addition to AESIs distribution stratified by age groups and gender. All analyses were conducted using R (Version 1.4.1717) and Excel for Microsoft 365. ResultsThere were 1,396,280 domestic and 346,210 non-domestic reports during 1990-2021, including 228 vaccines. For both domestic and non-domestic reports, year of 2021 had the highest reporting rate (48.52% and 70.33%), in addition a notable changes in AEFIs patterns were recorded during 1991, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2017. AEFIs were as follow: deaths (1.00% and 4.08%), ER or doctor visits (13.37% and 2.27%), hospitalizations (5.84% and 27.78%), lethal threat (1.42% and 4.38%), and disabilities (1.4% and 7.96%). Pyrexia was the top reported symptom during the past 31 years, except for 2021 where headache was the top one. COVID-19 vaccines namely Moderna, Pfizer-Biontech, and Janssen were the top 3 reported vaccines with headache, pyrexia, and fatigue as the top associated AEFIs. Followed by Zoster, Seasonal Influenza, Pneumococcal, and Human papillomavirus vaccines. Myocarditis or Pericarditis were the top reported AESIs (26.95% and 25.84%). Male (HR:1.15, 1.14 - 1.16) for domestic (HR:1.23, 1.22 -1.25) for nondomestic have a higher probability of having serious AEFIs. In addition, age group [] 5 years old in domestic and >84 years old in nondomestic have a higher probability of having AEFIs compared to other age groups. ConclusionsThe large data available in VARES make it a useful tool for detecting and monitoring vaccine AEFIs. However, its usability relies on understating the limitations of this surveillance system, the impact of governmental regulations, availability of vaccines, and public health recommendations on the reporting rate.","output":"Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): Evaluation of 31 Years of Reports and Pandemics' Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DNA vaccination has been of great interest since its discovery in the 1990s due to its ability to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses.

We use the individual-level data to assess how estimates of PFR and life-expectancy loss vary with age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socio-economic status. COVID PFR over March 2020-June 2021 for the three Midwest areas is 0.17% and decedents lose about 12 expected life-years. Life expectancy loss (LEL) is 0.17% * 12 years = 0.021 years (8 days);but can be as high as 3 months for some persons. Mean LEL is higher for men (0.025 years) than for women (0.018 years), and substantially higher for Blacks and Hispanic (0.030 years) than for Whites (0.018 years). We also provide national estimates using aggregate data. Life expectancy losses due to COVID exceed the annual gains in life expectancy over 2008-2018 for persons above ages 62-69 (depending on gender and race/ethnicity).

Given previous successes in treating gram-positive and -negative infections with cell wall degrading enzymes, we investigated such approach for Mtb. Objectives (i) Development of an Mtb microtiter growth inhibition assay that allows undisturbed cell envelope formation, to overcome the invalidation of results by typical clumped Mtb-growth in surfactant-free assays. (ii) Exploring anti-Mtb potency of cell wall layer-degrading enzymes. (iii) Investigation of the concerted action of several such enzymes. Methods We inserted a bacterial luciferase-operon in an auxotrophic Mtb strain to develop a microtiter assay that allows proper evaluation of cell wall degrading anti-Mtb enzymes. We assessed growth-inhibition by enzymes (recombinant mycobacteriophage mycolic acid esterase (LysB), fungal -amylase and human and chicken egg white lysozymes) and combinations thereof, in presence or absence of biopharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. Results Our biosafety level-2 assay identified both LysB and lysozymes as potent Mtb-inhibitors, but only in presence of surfactant. Moreover, most potent disruption of the mycolic acid hydrophobic barrier was obtained by the highly synergistic combination of LysB, -amylase and polysorbate 80.

MethodsFollowing a cohort of 21,242 HCWs in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for 20 months since the pandemic started, we used Cox regression and test-negative-design to examine differences in SARS-COV-2 infection rates compared to community counterparts, and within the HCW workforce, assessing the role of occupation, testing accessibility, vaccination rates, and vaccine effectiveness over time. ResultsNurses, allied health professionals and medical staff in this jurisdiction had a significantly lower rate of infection compared to their age-group community counterparts, at 47.4, 41.8, and 55.3% reduction respectively; controlling for vaccine-attributable reductions, the protective impact was still substantial, at 33.4, 28.0, and 36.5% respectively. Licensed practical nurses and care aides had the highest risk of infection among HCWs, more than double that of medical staff. However, even considering differences in vaccination rates, no increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection was found compared to community rates, with combined protective measures beyond vaccination associated with a 17.7% reduced SARS-COV-2 rate in the VCH workforce overall. There was also no evidence of waning immunity within at least 200 days after second dose. ConclusionRigorously implemented occupational health, public health and infection control measures results in a well-protected healthcare workforce with infection rates at or below rates in community counterparts. Greater accessibility of vaccination worldwide is essential; however, as implementing measures to protect this workforce globally also requires considerable health system strengthening in many jurisdictions, we caution against overly focusing on vaccination to the exclusion of other crucial elements for wider protection of HCWs, especially in facing ongoing mutations which may escape current vaccines.

Participation in UFM programs, including through CEP, could reduce meal costs due to economies of scale and a lower administrative burden. We analyzed the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS) data from 508 UFM-eligible schools (103 UFMs) to evaluate whether meal costs varied by UFM status. We used school-level data to address the non-random selection to UFMs with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). We estimated a generalized linear model with a log link and gamma distribution to predict meal costs by UFM status and school size. Full costs among medium and large schools were marginally lower in UFM schools for lunch (?$0.673; 95% CI: ?1.395, 0.0499; p = 0.068) and significantly lower for breakfast (?$0.575; 95% CI: ?1.077, ?0.074; p = 0.025). UFM was not associated with meal costs among smaller schools. Healthy Eating Index scores did not vary significantly by UFMs, suggesting that lower costs could be achieved without an adverse effect on nutritional quality. This analysis is limited by the lack of identified student percentage (ISP) data needed to definitively identify CEP eligibility, although results were robust to sensitivity analyses addressing the lack of ISP data.

There has been an associated proliferation of resources and online initiatives to support frontline workers, however, few of these are directly targeted at the care home workforce. Care home workers are highly skilled in caring for people with complex needs, but have very variable levels of formal training, and just over half of care homes in Scotland include registered nurses. This project will rapidly collate existing resources and identify, direct from care home workers, their best practice, initiatives, and resources used to support resilience and retention during this pandemic and moving forward. METHODS: 1) Rapid review of care home specific evidence and resources (including published research and social media); 2) Online survey of Enabling Research in Care Homes (ENRICH) members across Scotland (n = 55); 3) Case studies within six care homes to identify what is working well and what is not in terms of promoting resilience and emotional support. RESULTS: The rapid review has identified a wide range of resources directed at supporting staff working in care homes; the survey and case studies will provide data on the key learning and resources that have supported staff, and outline the challenges identified. There are many resources available but staff do not access these. The role of the care home manager is key.

Here we adapted the approach to search for medications that cause false positives on UDS assays lacking confirmation data. From our institution's EHR data, we used our previous dataset of 698,651 UDS and confirmation results. We also collected 211,108 UDS results for acetaminophen, ethanol, and salicylates. Both datasets included individuals' prior medication exposures. We hypothesized that the odds of a presumptive positive would increase following exposure to an interfering medication independently of exposure to the assay's target drug(s). For a given assay-medication pair, we quantified potential interference as an odds ratio from logistic regression. We evaluated interference of selected compounds in spiking experiments. Compared to the approach requiring confirmation data, our adapted approach showed only modestly diminished ability to detect interfering medications.

Early observations in West Africa, bolstered by later data from Indonesia and the Asian subcontinent, showed that smallpox did not spread rapidly, and outbreaks could be quickly controlled by isolation of patients and vaccination of their contacts. Contacts were usually easy to find because transmission of smallpox usually required prolonged face-to-face contact. The emphasis therefore shifted to active searches to find cases, coupled with contact tracing, rigorous isolation of patients, and vaccination and surveillance of contacts to contain outbreaks.

Results identified a high hemodynamic response in the right anterior insula (AI) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the FoG group when an APA was required. The nFoG had stronger connectivity between the right and left insulae than the FoG group. The strength of this connectivity was negatively correlated with the severity of FoG. Both groups showed different brain network organizations comprising the SMA and the bilateral AI. The SMA was found to be a hub in patients with FoG when an APA was required for the task.

The major critical function of PCSK9 deduced from human and mouse studies, as well as cellular and structural analyses, is its role in increasing the levels of circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDLc), via its ability to enhance the sorting and escort of the cell surface LDL receptor (LDLR) to lysosomes. This implicates the binding of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 to the EGF-A domain of the LDLR. This also requires the presence of the C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain (CHRD), its binding to the secreted cytosolic cyclase associated protein 1 (CAP-1), and possibly another membrane-bound \\"protein X\\". Curiously, in PCSK9-deficient mice, an alternative to the downregulation of the surface levels of the LDLR by PCSK9 is taking place in the liver of female mice in a 17-estradiol-dependent manner by still an unknown mechanism. Recent studies have extended our understanding of the biological functions of PCSK9, namely its implication in septic shock, vascular inflammation, viral infections (Dengue; SARS-CoV-2) or immune checkpoint modulation in cancer via the regulation of the cell surface levels of the T-cell receptor and MHC-I, which govern the anti-tumoral activity of CD8 + T cells. Because PCSK9 inhibition may be advantageous in these processes, the availability of injectable safe PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) that reduces by 50-60% LDLc above the effect of statins is highly valuable.

However, the small sample size of infected patients enrolled in most studies did not allow to draw robust conclusions on the COVID-19 impact in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in PD patients are different from those observed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting data on PD patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (PD-COVID+). We extracted prevalence, clinical-demographic data, outcome, and mortality. We also analyzed risk or protective factors based on comparisons between PD-COVID+ and control populations with PD without COVID-19 or without PD with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 16 studies reporting on a total of 11,325 PD patients, 1,061 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median infection prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 8.5%. PD-COVID+ patients had a median age of 74 and a disease duration of 9.4 years. Pooling all PD-COVID+ patients from included studies, 28.6% required hospitalization, 37.1% required levodopa dose increasing, and 18.9% died. The case fatality was higher in PD-COVID+ patients than the general population, with longer PD duration as a possible risk factor for worse outcome. Amantadine and vitamin D were proposed as potential protective factors. CONCLUSION: Available studies indicate a higher case fatality in PD patients affected by COVID-19 than the general population.

Comparing H1N1 in 2009 and COVID-19 prompts reflection on why anthropologists must transcend this foundational divide to tackle pandemic complexities.","output":"Beyond the Linguistic/Medical Anthropology Divide: Retooling Anthropology to Face COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study the role of cyclinD1 and CDK4 in malignant transformation of human fetal lung diploid fibroblast cell line (2BS) induced by silica. METHODS Recombination vectors with sense and antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 were constructed, and then transfected into the malignant transformed cells induced by silica, respectively. At the same time, pXJ41-neo was used as the control. RESULTS During the progress of the malignant transformation of 2BS cells induced by silica, cyclinD1 and CDK4 were overexpressed. Antisense RNA suppressed cyclinD1 and CDK4 gene expression in the antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 transfected cells. Antisense RNA led to cell cycle arrest, resulting in lengthened G1 phase (the percentages of cells in the G1 phase changed from 45.1% to 52.7% and 58.0% for cyclinD1 and CDK4 transfected cells, respectively), and eventually attenuated the increase of the proliferation of malignant transformed cells induced by silica. Compared with malignant transformed cells induced by silica, cells transfected with antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 showed obviously reduced growth rates. On the 8th day, the suppression rates were 58.69 and 77.43% (the growth rate of malignant transformed cells induced by silica was 100%), doubling time changed from 21.0 h to 31.4 h and 21.0 h to 42.7 h, respectively, the growth capacities on soft agar of cells transfected by antisense pXJ41-cyclinD1 and pXJ41-CDK4 decreased obviously. CONCLUSION CyclinD1 and CDK4 play an important role in maintaining transformed phenotype of the cancer cells.","output":"Role of cyclinD1 and CDK4 in the carcinogenesis induced by silica."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Road traffic accident (RTA) fatalities account for a significant number of unnatural deaths in Pakistan. Hence, it is necessary to investigate RTA fatalities in order to implement measures to reduce them. In the present study, we aimed to assess the detailed epidemiological characteristics of RTA fatalities by analyzing the data obtained from medico-legal autopsies performed at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in 2019 and 2020. We assessed age- and gender-based variations in the pattern of RTA fatalities and determined the anatomical cause of death and sites of fractures among the fatalities. Moreover, we assessed the monthly distribution of cases in 2019 and 2020 to determine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the number of RTA fatalities reported each month. Methodology In this retrospective study, data obtained from medico-legal autopsies of all RTA victims in 2019 and 2020 (n = 246) were collected from the Forensic Department of JPMC, Karachi. The data were then entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) for analysis. Results The highest number of fatalities was recorded in the age group of 18-40 years (54.5%), while the lowest number was recorded in the age group of 60 years (8.5%). The male:female autopsy ratio was 6.03:1. Most fatalities were recorded from 6:00 am to 11:59 am (41.9%), followed by 12:00 pm to 5:59 pm (37.4%). Moreover, most victims (76.8%) died instantaneously within seconds to minutes of the incident. The number of RTA fatalities reported in 2019 (50.4%) was similar to that reported in 2020 (49.6%). However, the number of RTA fatalities reported in March-July 2020 was 35.6% lower than that reported in the same period in 2019, possibly because of the restrictions (such as lockdowns) that were imposed to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of RTA fatalities reported in March-July 2020 and that reported in the remaining months of 2019 and 2020 (p = 0.006). The cause of death was head injury in 159 (64.6%) cases and multiple traumatic injuries in 65 (26.4%) cases. Injury to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis caused death in 11 (4.5%), nine (3.7%), and two (0.8%) cases, respectively. Assessment of the site of fractures revealed skull fractures to be the most common type of fractures (53%), followed by rib/sternal fractures (19%). Upper limb and lower limb fractures occurred in 10% and 9% of the cases, respectively, while pelvic and neck fractures occurred in 6% and 3% of the cases, respectively. Conclusions Efforts need to be made at both government and individual levels to reduce RTA fatalities. Strict implementation of traffic laws is necessary. Although we noted a male preponderance, the reluctance to get females autopsied should not be disregarded. The significant decrease in RTA fatalities during March-July 2020 could be attributed to the reduced traffic burden due to the restrictions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures taken, such as staying at home, to avoid contracting the virus.","output":"Analysis of Road Traffic Accident Fatalities in Karachi, Pakistan: An Autopsy-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Provision of human milk is crucial for maternal and infant health. However, exclusive breastfeeding may exacerbate mood disorders in women unable to achieve this goal. A nuanced approach that considers all aspects of maternal and infant health is needed. In this paper, we bring attention to the potentially negative consequences on maternal and infant health that may be associated with exclusive breastfeeding in the setting of significant challenges. We discuss recent literature exploring the relationship between breastfeeding and maternal mental health, and contextualize it with our first-hand experiences as healthcare professionals who aimed to exclusively breastfeed and encountered difficulties. Given existing evidence and our collective anecdotal experience, we advocate for a balanced approach when supporting parents struggling to breastfeed. Timely recommendations are offered for healthcare providers, medical educators and hospital administrators seeking to balance maternal and infant child health considerations while continuing to promote breastfeeding. PRCIS STATEMENT: Exclusively promotion of breastfeeding impacts maternal mental health and consequently, infant health. We advocate for balanced considerations of maternal and infant child health while promoting breastfeeding. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Singular promotion of exclusive breastfeeding may exacerbate adverse maternal mental health outcomes. A balanced consideration of maternal and infant child health is vital as breastfeeding is encouraged. Clinicians who provide front-line support to breastfeeding parents must be taught and expected to provide nuanced breastfeeding support that anticipates both physical and mental health challenges.","output":"Exclusive breastfeeding promotion policies: whose oxygen mask are we prioritizing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with individuals wearing facial masks and individuals who do not.

We determine the fraction of individual who wear masks by a maximum likelihood estimation, which maximizes the transition probability of a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model. The transition probability is numerically difficult to compute if the number of infected individuals is large. We develop an approximation for the transition probability based on central limit theorem and mean field approximation. We show through numerical study that our approximation works well.

Methods: To uncover more about the probable gastrointestinal transmission and its clinical manifestations, we reviewed all research publications with keywords including: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus, outbreak, ARAS-CoV in Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar as well as all news in social media about novel COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 40 recent publications, 10 articles were studied by 2 authors. Results: Although the SARS-CoV-2 tends to infect respiratory epithelial cells through the respiratory tracts, recent investigations detected the virus in the stool specimen, raising the question of the fecal-oral transmission route. Different studies showed that almost all gastrointestinal signs and symptoms were seen in elderly patients (more than 65 years old). including anorexia (40%), nonspecific abdominal pains (8%), diarrhea (10%) and nausea and Vomiting in about 8% of patients. Anorexia and generalized abdominal pain suffer many treated cases even 10-20 days after negative blood tests (like CRP, lymphopenia) and negative PCR of respiratory samples. The main reason for this prolonged anorexia and abdominal pain may be due to the long persistence of COVID-19 in the gastrointestinal tracts after primary treatment. Conclusions: Comparing to SARS, patients with COVID-19 showed less diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort before respiratory symptoms. Feces as a potential contagious source of Viral RNA can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. We strongly recommend all cured patients of COVID-19 to disinfect and clean their toilets until 17-20 days after negative blood tests and solving their respiratory disorders.

More recently SG was proposed as an stand alone procedure in the treatment of morbidly obese patients. The aim of this study is to analyze perioperative outcome of morbid obese patients after SG. METHODS 301 patients, 201 women and 100 men, undergoing SG were retrospectively analyzed. SG was performed by 17 surgeons all member of the Club Coelio. The mean BMI was 44.7kg/m2 (27.4-70.3 kg/m2). 34 patients (11.3%) of our series had SG as revisional surgery. These revisional procedures consisted of 32 conversions from gastric banding, 1 conversion from vertical gastroplasty (VBG) and 1 from transoral endoscopic gastroplasty. Among the 32 patients that had revisional SG after a gastric banding, 13 bands were removed at least 3 months before the revisional SG and 19 bands were removed during the SG procedure. Endpoints were perioperative morbidity and mortality and potential risk factors for complications, mainly per or postoperative bleeding or leakage. RESULTS Overall mortality was 0% and morbidity was 10.3%. Perioperative bleeding occurred in 10 patients (3.3%), leakage in 12 patients (4%) patients and stenosis in 3 patients (1%). The risk of leakage was significantly higher after revisional bariatric surgery and in case of gastric perforation during surgery (p = 0.0001). Previous gastric banding is also associated with a higher risk of postoperative bleeding (p = 0.0006).

Commercial kits that specifically detect avian influenza A (H7N9) virus RNA are urgently required to prepare for the emergence and potential pandemic of this novel influenza virus. The safety and effectiveness of three commercial molecular diagnostic assays were evaluated using a quality-control panel and clinical specimens collected from over 90 patients with confirmed avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infections. The analytical performance evaluation showed that diverse influenza H7N9 viruses can be detected with high within- and between-lot reproducibility and without cross-reactivity to other influenza viruses (H1N1 pdm09, seasonal H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and influenza B). The detection limit of all the commercial assays was 2.83 Log(10) copies/l [0.7 Log(10)TCID(50)/mL of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus strain A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013], which is comparable to the method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, using a WHO-Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) method as a reference for clinical evaluation, positive agreement of more than 98% was determined for all of the commercial kits, while negative agreement of more than 99% was observed.

There is now extensive literature on its presentation and initial management. There is no literature however on what happens to these patients following discharge. MethodsWe collected clinical data and samples from seven patients presenting with VITT and followed them up for 82-145 days. We also collected clinical samples from them at last follow-up. Testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies was done using an anti-PF4/heparin enzymatic immunoassay. Flow Cytometry was used to look at Fc{gamma}RIIa levels on patient platelets. Light Transmission Aggregometry with patient serum and healthy donor / patient platelets was used to analyse platelet responsiveness, in the presence and absence of PF4. FindingsAll patients were discharged on direct oral anticoagulants. Two patients remain completely symptom free, three have ongoing headaches, two have residual neurological deficits. Two patients developed mild thrombocytopenia and worsening headache (but without cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) and were retreated, one of these with rituximab. All patients, except the one treated with rituximab, had similar anti-PF4 antibody titres at 80-120 days to their levels at diagnosis. Platelets from patients at follow-up had normal levels of Fc{gamma}RIIa and had normal responses to thrombin and collagen-related-peptide. Patient serum from diagnosis strongly activated healthy donor platelets in the presence of PF4. Serum from follow-up was much weaker at stimulating platelets, even in the presence of PF4. InterpretationThis study shows that despite similar PF4 antibody titres at diagnosis and during follow-up, there are further differences in patient serum, that are not apparent from currently used testing, that result in lower levels of platelet activation during the follow-up period.

This study aimed to summarize the blood biochemistry characteristics of COVID-19 patients by performing a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Methods Comprehensive studies were screened from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through March 11, 2020. The inclusion criteria included studies investigating the biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19. The statistical software R3.6.3 was used for meta-analysis. Results Ten studies including 1745 COVID-19 patients met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 16% and 20% of patients with COVID-19 had alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels higher than the normal range, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients showed albumin (ALB) levels lower than the normal range, and 6% of patients showed abnormal total bilirubin (TBil) levels. The levels of creatinine (CRE) were increased in 8% of patients. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 13% of patients exceeded the normal range, and 52% of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, six studies met the inclusion criteria for the systemic review evaluating the relevance between LDH levels and the severity of COVID-19, and all six studies showed a positive association between these two factors. Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 had different degrees of blood biochemical abnormalities, which might indicate multiple organ dysfunction. Some biochemical indexes, such as abnormal ALB and LDH, could reflect the severity of the disease to a certain extent.

Despite this need, few studies have compared the effectiveness of clinic-based versus web-based or telehealth services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of clinic-based multidisciplinary therapy in an integrated practice unit (C-IPU) model with online integrated multidisciplinary therapy (O-IPU) in individuals undergoing conservative care for LBP. METHODS: A total of 1090 participants were prospectively recruited to participate in a clinical trial registry (NCT04081896) through the SpineZone rehabilitation IPU program. All participants provided informed consent. Participants were allocated to the C-IPU (N=988) or O-IPU (N=102) groups based on their personal preferences. The C-IPU program consisted of a high-intensity machine-based core muscle resistance training program, whereas the O-IPU program consisted of therapist-directed home core strengthening exercises through a web-based platform. Changes in LBP symptom severity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), goal achievement (Patient-Specific Functional Scale), and frequency of opioid use were compared between the C-IPU and O-IPU groups using multivariate linear regression modeling adjusted for age, gender, treatment number, program duration, and baseline pain and disability. RESULTS: Approximately 93.03% (1014/1090) of the participants completed their recommended programs, with no group differences in dropout rates (P=.78). The C-IPU group showed greater pain relief (P<.001) and reductions in disability (P=.002) than the O-IPU group, whereas the O-IPU group reported greater improvements in goal achievement (P<.001). Both programs resulted in reduced opioid use frequency, with 19.0% (188/988) and 21.5% (22/102) of participants reporting cessation of opioid use for C-IPU and O-IPU programs, respectively, leaving only 5.59% (61/1090) of participants reporting opioid use at the end of their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both in-clinic and web-based multidisciplinary programs are beneficial in reducing pain, disability, and opioid use and in improving goal achievement. The differences between these self-selected groups shed light on patient characteristics, which require further investigation and could help clinicians optimize these programs.

Literature reveals that despite multifaceted challenges in the development of mRNA vaccines, the promising and durable efficacy of the RNA in pre-clinical and clinical studies deserves consideration. The introduction of mRNA-transfected DC vaccine is an approach that has gained interest for cancer vaccine development due to its ability to circumvent the necessity of DC isolation, ex vivo cultivation and re-infusion. The selection of appropriate antigen of interest remains one of the major challenges for cancer vaccine development.

Patients and methods: We report a 26-patient case series performed following national lockdown. Patients were initially screened for COVID-19 symptoms and later all patients required a negative swab pre-operatively. Personal protective equipment using aerosol precautions was used for all cases. A post-operative cold COVID-19 critical-care ward was created. Patients who developed possible symptoms of COVID-19 were isolated and swabbed. A telephone questionnaire was completed two weeks following discharge. Results: Three out of 26 patients developed post-operative pyrexia, but all tested negative for COVID-19. Non-COVID-19-related complication rates were consistent with our previous results. Telephone follow-up confirmed that none had experienced symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. Overall, patient satisfaction with hospital COVID-19 precautions was high. All patients were satisfied with their decision to undergo surgery during the pandemic.

We investigated whether CCR5 plays a role in MS progression using a murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in CCR5 deficient (CCR5(?/?)) mice. CCR5(?/?) and CCR5(+/+) (wild-type) mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG(35-55)) followed by pertussis toxin, after which EAE paralysis was scored for 28 days. We found that clinical scoring and EAE neuropathology were lower in CCR5(?/?) mice than CCR5(+/+) mice. Immune cells (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), B cell, NK cell and macrophages) infiltration and astrocytes/microglial activation were attenuated in CCR5(?/?) mice. Moreover, levels of IL-1, TNF-, IFN- and MCP-1 cytokine levels were decreased in CCR5(?/?) mice spinal cord.

In order to optimize the operating conditions of the electrolytic flocculation process and to quantify the amount of flocculants added, aluminum electrodes were first used in the process. It was found that under optimal conditions, the microalgae removal efficiency using aluminum electrodes could reach 98.5%, while 34.2 mg L-1 of aluminum ions were released during the process. Different metal electrodes were also studied, but high microalgae removal efficiency was witnessed only using aluminum electrodes, indicating the influence of the aluminum ion in flocculation. When non-sacrificial graphite electrodes were used in the electrolytic flocculation process, the corresponding amount of aluminum sulfate was added so that the aluminum ion concentration in water was also equal to 34.2 mg L-1. The result showed that the microalgae removal efficiency of graphite electrodes could reach above 90% after aluminum sulfate was added. In contrast, using graphite electrodes alone and using the metal salt alone only yielded 22.9% and 7.1% of microalgae removal efficiency, respectively. These results indicated that the presence of metal ions is necessary in the electrolytic flocculation process. The energy consumption of the process was found to be 0.3 kW h m-3 or 0.88 kW h kg-1, which is considered to be low energy consumption. The total cost of the process, including energy and chemicals, was found to be $ 0.21 m-3, proving a cost competitive method in microalgae harvesting.","output":"Investigation of electrolytic flocculation for microalga Scenedesmus sp. using aluminum and graphite electrodes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host responses can contribute to the severity of viral infection, through the failure of innate antiviral mechanisms to recognize and restrict the pathogen, the development of intense systemic inflammation leading to circulatory failure or through tissue injury resulting from overly exuberant cell-mediated immune responses.

Delirium is associated with future dementia progression. Yet whether this occurs subclinically over months and years, or persistent delirium merges into worsened dementia is not understood. Methods We adopted an identical approach to a previous systematic review, only including studies using a recognised diagnostic framework for ascertaining delirium at follow-up (persistent delirium). We applied risk of bias assessments based on Standards of Reporting of Neurological Disorders criteria. Estimates were pooled across studies using random-effects meta-analysis, and we estimated associations with age and follow-up duration using meta-regression. Results We identified 13 new cohorts, which we added to 8 from the previous systematic review (21 relevant studies reporting persistent delirium over 37 time points). Studies were mainly at low risk of bias. Pooled delirium prevalence estimates at discharge were 40% (95% CI 24% to 54%, 10 studies). Meta-regression showed variation in prevalence of persistent delirium over time (0.6% per week, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.1, p=0.02). Older study sample age was associated with higher prevalence of persistent delirium (8.8% per SD age, 95% CI 1.1% to 17%). The rate of improvement was the same regardless of age, but the overall burden was higher with older age such that 44% (95% CI 11% to 76%) of 95-year-olds would be expected to have persistent delirium at 12 months. Conclusions This systematic review emphasises the key importance of delirium as a persistent and extensive problem, particularly in the oldest-old.

Protoplasts inoculated with transcripts derived from a PVX cDNA clone or from clones containing mutations in their 5' nontranslated regions (NTRs) were assayed for RNA production by S1 nuclease protection assays. A time course of plus- and minus-strand-RNA accumulation indicated that both minus- and plus-strand PVX RNAs were detectable at 0.5 h postinoculation. Although minus-strand RNAs accumulated more rapidly than plus-strand RNAs, maximum levels of plus-strand RNAs were 40- to 80-fold higher. On the basis of these data, time points were chosen for determination of RNA levels in protoplasts inoculated with PVX clones containing deletions or an insertion in their 5' NTRs. Deletions of more than 12 nucleotides from the 5' end, internal deletions, and one insertion in the 5' NTR resulted in substantially decreased levels of plus-strand-RNA production. In contrast, all modified transcripts were functional for minus-strand-RNA synthesis, suggesting that elements in the 5' NTR were not essential for minus-strand-RNA synthesis. Further analysis of the 5' NTR deletion mutants indicated that all mutations that decreased genomic plus-strand-RNA synthesis also decreased synthesis of the two major subgenomic RNAs. These data indicate that cis-acting elements from different regions of the 5' NTR are required for plus-strand-RNA synthesis and that this process may be linked to synthesis of subgenomic RNAs.","output":"The 5' nontranslated region of potato virus X RNA affects both genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines how economic and social activities in Asia were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, using the emissions of various air pollutants as representative measures of those activities.

The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients. METHODS: Review of the main recommendations of national and international scientific societies, decisions by government agencies and class councils. The topics will be related to the general aspects of COVID-19, personal protective equipment, care in patient assistance, endoscopic exam routines and the management of sinonasal, otological and pediatric evaluations related to COVID-19. RESULTS: The use of personal protective equipment is considered crucial in routine ENT care. We recommend postponing appointments, exams and elective surgeries to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, we recommend changing routines in several areas of otolaryngology. Additionally, guidance is provided on the use of telemedicine resources during the pandemic period.

It is important to recognize the potential numerous symptoms and clinical findings, urgently investigate with the proper neuroimaging tests, and coordinate care with the appropriate specialists without delay. PURPOSE This study aimed to describe a patient with worsening headache and ophthalmoparesis attributable to pituitary apoplexy who initially had reportedly a normal neuroimaging result and were diagnosed with migraine. CASE REPORT A 39-year-old Hispanic man with a history of migraine developed a new and worsening headache. He presented to a hospital emergency department where he underwent a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography and MRI, whose results were subsequently interpreted as normal. His headache was attributed to migraine, and he was medicated as such and discharged. Three days later, he developed horizontal and vertical diplopia and sought a second opinion. His visual acuity and visual fields were normal. He manifested a right pupil-sparing, external partial cranial nerve III palsy and concurrent right sixth nerve palsy. He also complained of worsening headache and lethargy. He was immediately referred for contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance angiography with suspicion of pituitary apoplexy. Subsequent imaging revealed a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma consistent with pituitary apoplexy that was expanding laterally into the right cavernous sinus. He underwent immediate neurosurgical surgical repair. CONCLUSIONS New or worsening headache with signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism should immediately be investigated for pituitary apoplexy. Other possible findings include involvement of cranial nerves III through VI because of cavernous sinus involvement and visual deficits if the optic chiasm or intracranial portion of the optic nerve is involved. However, growth may be lateral, and no visual deficits may be found, as in this case.

BACKGROUND: Studies have focused on persistent symptoms of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the medium term. Thus, long-term studies of nonhospitalised patients are urgently required. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: In 102 nonhospitalised COVID-19 patients, we collected symptoms at 3 months (baseline) and at 6-7 months (follow-up) from diagnosis (dyspnoea, fatigue/muscle weakness and chest/joint pain), HRQoL, psychological state, cognitive function, pulmonary and physical function. This study adhered to the STROBE statement. RESULTS: HRQoL was impaired in almost 60% of the sample and remained impaired 6-7 months. At 3 months, more than 60% had impaired physical function (fatigue/muscle weakness and reduced leg and inspiratory muscle strength). About 40%-56% of the sample showed an altered psychological state (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety/depression), cognitive function impairment and dyspnoea. At 6-7-months, only a slight improvement in dyspnoea and physical and cognitive function was observed, with a very high proportion of the sample (29%-55%) remained impaired. Impaired HRQoL at 6-7 months was predicted with 82.4% accuracy (86.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity) by the presence at 3 months of muscle fatigue/muscle weakness (OR = 5.7 (1.8-18.1)), PTSD (OR = 6.0 (1.7-20.7)) and impaired HRQoL (OR = 11.7 (3.7-36.8)). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of nonhospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience an impaired HRQoL, cognitive and psychological function at long-term. HRQoL, PTSD and dyspnoea at 3 months can identify the majority of patients with COVID-19 who will have impaired quality of life at long-term. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Treatments aimed at improving psychological state and reducing the fatigue/muscle weakness of post-COVID-19 patients could be necessary to prevent the patients' HRQoL from being impaired at 6-7 months after their reported recovery.","output":"Longitudinal study of changes observed in quality of life, psychological state cognition and pulmonary and functional capacity after COVID-19 infection: A six- to seven-month prospective cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first report of the isolation of a coronavirus from elk calves.

OBJECTIVES: To delineate clinical features of COVID-19 patients with different severities and prognoses and clarify the risk factors for disease progression and death at an early stage. METHODS: Medical history, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome data from 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Eastern Campus of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University in China were collected from 30 January 2020 to 20 February 2020, and risk factors associated with clinical deterioration and death were analysed. The final date of follow-up was 21 March 2020. RESULTS: Age, comorbidities, higher neutrophil cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts and subsets, impairment of liver, renal, heart, coagulation systems, systematic inflammation and clinical scores at admission were significantly associated with disease severity. Ten (16.1%) moderate and 45 (47.9%) severe patients experienced deterioration after admission, and median time from illness onset to clinical deterioration was 14.7 (IQR 11.3-18.5) and 14.5 days (IQR 11.8-20.0), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed increased Hazards Ratio of disease progression associated with older age, lymphocyte count <1.1  109/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)> 9.5 mmol/L, lactate dehydrogenase >250 U/L and procalcitonin >0.1 ng/mL at admission. These factors were also associated with the risk of death except for BUN. Prediction models in terms of nomogram for clinical deterioration and death were established to illustrate the probability.

Some of its prototypes are being built. The peculiarities of building promising information systems was analyzed, the purpose of which is to identify, localize the spread and complete elimination of source of viral infections with the active use of methods, tools and techniques inherent in modern information technology. A prototype of the model-monitoring complex system information-technological platform has been formed, which is designed to effectively implement the functions of identification, monitoring, modelling and forecasting of the spread of viral infections in society. The basic characteristic by which the authors propose to identify the infected is thehuman body temperature. The paper deals with the construction of an effective temperature screening module, which is based on remote mobile temperature measuring devices, which are installed on unmanned aerial vehicles or installed in the equipment of law enforcement officers (helmets, goggles, etc.). The authors formed a prototype of the hardware of the complex, which in a systematic combination can effectively implement the functions of identification and monitoring of large groups of people who may be carriers, distributors and potentially infected in large crowds, in particular, during various concerts, festivals, rallies, mass festivities, demonstrations, religious ceremonies, sports competitions, etc. The authors developed and tested this model-prognostic complex on real data, which is based on ensembles of mathematical models belonging to the molecular dynamics category. New original results have been obtained, which can be used for further expansion of the functionality proposed by the authors of the innovative class of information systems, which in the future should acquire the status of systems and means of daily use by various target groups, in particular, such as health care workers law and order and power structures.

We explored womens responses to the proposed interval extension. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured phone/video interviews with 22 women aged 25C49 years. Participants were selected to vary in age, socioeconomics and screening history. We explored attitudes to the current 3-year interval, then acceptability of a 5-year interval. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Attitudes to the current 3-year interval varied; some wanted more frequent screening, believing cancer develops quickly. Some participants worried about the proposed change; others trusted it was evidence based. Frequent questions concerned the rationale and safety of longer intervals, speed of cancer development, the possibility of HPV being missed or cell changes occurring between screens. Many participants felt reassured when the interval change was explained alongside the move to HPV primary screening, of which most had previously been unaware. CONCLUSIONS: Communication of the interval change should be done in the context of broader information about HPV primary screening, emphasising that people who test negative for HPV are at lower risk of cell changes so can safely be screened every 5 years. The long time needed for HPV to develop into cervical cancer provides reassurance about safety, but it is important to be transparent that no screening test is perfect.","output":"Acceptability of extending HPV-based cervical screening intervals from 3 to 5 years: an interview study with women in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a hypercoagulable state. Several autopsy studies have found microthrombi in pulmonary circulation. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase II study, we randomized COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation to receive either therapeutic enoxaparin or the standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. We evaluated the gas exchange over time through the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at baseline, 7, and 14 days after randomization, the time until successful liberation from mechanical ventilation, and the ventilator-free days. RESULTS: Ten patients were assigned to the therapeutic enoxaparin and ten patients to prophylactic anticoagulation. There was a statistically significant increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio over time in the therapeutic group (163 [95% confidence interval C CI 133C193] at baseline, 209 [95% CI 171C247] after 7 days, and 261 [95% CI 230C293] after 14 days), p = 0.0004.

The cases were performed by beginning urology residents over the course of their first 2 years of urology residency training. RESULTS A total of 200 ureteroscopy cases were reviewed. The mean stone diameter was 7.1 (3.2) mm. Forty-three percent of cases were performed for renal stones and 58 % for ureteral stones. The mean operative time was 80.2 (36.9) min. The mean fluoroscopy time was 69.1 (38.2) s. No significant differences existed between cases performed by each of the two residents, and no statistical differences in case difficulty were observed throughout the study period. Linear regression analysis revealed the strongest association with lower fluoroscopy time to be increasing resident experience (p < 0.001). By the end of the 2-year review, fluoroscopy time decreased by 79 % from 135 to 29 s per case. Other significant factors associated with increasing fluoroscopy time were placement of a postoperative stent under fluoroscopic guidance (p < 0.001), utilization of a flexible ureteroscope as opposed to a semirigid ureteroscope (p < 0.001), and balloon dilation of the ureteral orifice (p < 0.001).

Spike trafficking to lysosomes is an endocytosis-independent, V-ATPase-dependent process, and spike-containing lysosomes drive lysosome clustering but display poor lysotracker labeling and reduced uptake of endocytosed materials.

We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. The primary population included 652 individuals who had a positive symptomatic test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 5,946 individuals with at least one negative symptomatic test after full vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 120 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-7.74). Importantly, the odds of infection were still lower 150 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45), when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of experiencing a non-COVID-19 hospitalization decreased with time since vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection by this approach due to confounding factors.

Trade barriers, seasonal labor shortages, food loss and waste, and food safety concerns combine to engender vulnerabilities in food systems. A variety of actors-from academics to policy-makers, community organizers, farmers, and homesteaders-are considering the undertaking of creating more resilient food systems. Conventional approaches include fine-tuning existing value chains, consolidating national food distribution systems and bolstering inventory and storage. This paper highlights three alternative strategies for securing a more resilient food system, namely: (i.) leveraging underutilized, often urban, spaces for food production;(ii.) rethinking food waste as a resource;and (iii.) constructing production-distribution-waste networks, as opposed to chains. Various food systems actors have pursued these strategies for decades. Yet, we argue that the COVID-19 pandemic forces us to urgently consider such novel assemblages of actors, institutions, and technologies as key levers in achieving longer term food system resilience. These strategies are often centered around principles of redistribution and reciprocity, and focus on smaller scales, from individual households to communities.

Despite the development of effective vaccine(s) and direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as tenofovir and entecavir, the eradication of chronic HBV remains a distant dream in endemic regions. Factors such as treatment naivety, longer duration of disease, late diagnosis, family history of liver disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma, fatty liver disease, multiple comorbidities, alcoholism, use of tobacco products, noncompliance to drugs, and loss to follow-up all contribute to disease progression and development of complications. In order to promote a better understanding of the treatment initiation, duration, and eventual outcomes, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) updated its guidelines in 2017 and introduced a new staging system for chronic HBV. Since these guidelines are relatively recent, data regarding the new staging is virtually absent in local/regional settings. Moreover, it has been observed that patients presenting to secondary care setups at major urban centers have disease characteristics quite distinct from those of their rural counterparts or patients presenting to tertiary care setups, even in the same cities. Additionally, there is scarce published data with regard to this aspect. With this study, we hope to make progress on all of those fronts. Objective We aimed to evaluate the demographics, biochemical characteristics, and phases of chronic HBV at the secondary care level. Methods This was a retrospective observational cohort conducted at the Sindh Government Hospital, Liaquatabad from January to December 2020. Patients of either gender who were aged 12 years, and diagnosed as a case of chronic HBV were eligible to be enrolled in the study. Only treatment-naive patients were enrolled in the study. Demographics, biochemical characteristics, and phases of HBV (in light of the updated guidelines issued by EASL in 2017 with respect to HBV) were recorded and analyzed. Patient confidentiality was ensured at all times. Results A total of 102 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age of our cohort was 34.31 12.42 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 3:2. All referrals were made from within the city district. Housewives and laborers made up the majority of our patients. The mean alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were 39.83 21.33 IU/L; otherwise, the biochemical profile of the patients was unremarkable. Phase III was the most frequently recorded stage of chronic HBV; 41 (40.19%) of the patients were diagnosed with it. However, nearly half of the patients had chronic active hepatitis (phases II and IV). Only a single case each of hepatitis Delta virus and decompensated liver disease (DCLD) was recorded. Conclusions All patients of chronic HBV presenting at the secondary care level were referred locally, were relatively older, and exhibited a higher frequency of chronic active hepatitis (phases II and IV). This corresponded to borderline elevations of ALT. But the remainder of the biochemical profile was largely unremarkable due to the very low prevalence of cirrhosis among these patients.","output":"Demographics, Biochemical Characteristics, and Phases of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection: Retrospective Analysis From a Secondary Care Setup"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics, such as the COVID-19 crisis, are very complex emergencies that can neither be handled by individuals nor by any single municipality, organization or even country alone.

These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020. Results Guangzhou patients were younger and had better prognosis than Wuhan patients. The Wuhan patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23% vs 5%) and had a higher mortality rate (11% vs 0%). Cases in Guangzhou tended to be more community clustered. Diarrhea and vomiting were more common among Guangzhou patients and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in feces. Fecal SARA-CoV-2 RNA remained positive when nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative in some patients. Conclusions This study indicates possible diminishing virulence of the virus in the process of transmission. Yet persistent positive RNA in feces after negative nasopharyngeal swabs suggests a possible prolonged transmission period that challenges current quarantine practices.","output":"A cross-sectional comparison of epidemiological and clinical features of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and outside Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has triggered an avalanche of research publications, the various aspects of which need to be assessed. The objective of this study is to determine the scientific communitys response patterns to COVID-19 through a bibliometric analysis of the time-trends, global contribution, international collaboration, open-access provision, science domains of focus, and the behavior of journals. METHODS: The bibliographic records on COVID-19 literature were retrieved from both PubMed and Scopus. The period for searching was set from November 1, 2019, to April 15, 2021. The bibliographic data were coupled with COVID-19 incidence to explore possible association, as well as World Bank indicators and classification of economies. RESULTS: A total of 159132 records were included in the study. Following the escalation of incidences of COVID-19 in late 2020 and early 2021, the monthly publication count made a new peak in March 2021 at 20505. Overall, 125155 (78.6%) were national, 22548 (14.2%) were bi-national, and 11429 (7.2%) were multi-national. Low-income countries with 928 (66.8%) international publications had the highest percentage of international. The open-access provision decreased from 85.5% in February 2020 to 62.0% in April 2021. As many as 82841 (70.8%) publications were related to health sciences, followed by life sciences 27031 (23.1%), social sciences 20291 (17.3%), and physical sciences 15141 (12.9%). The top three medical subjects in publications were general internal medicine, public health, and infectious diseases with 28.9%, 18.3%, and 12.6% of medical publications, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the incidence and publication count indicated the scientific communitys interest in the ongoing situation and timely response to it. Only one-fifth of publications resulted from international collaboration, which might lead to redundancy without adding significant value. Our study underscores the necessity of policies for attraction of international collaboration and direction of vital funds toward domains of higher priority.","output":"How the scientific community responded to the COVID-19 pandemic: A subject-level time-trend bibliometric analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) population is growing in size and complexity. This study evaluates whether present ambulatory care adequately detects problems and considers costs. Methods: A UK single-centre study of clinic attendances amongst 100 ACHD patients (40.4 years, median ACHD AP class 2B) between 2014 and 2019 and the COVID-19 restrictions period (March 2020CJuly 2021). Results: Between 2014 and 2019, there were 575 appointments. Nonattendance was 10%; 15 patients recurrently nonattended. Eighty percent of appointments resulted in no decision other than continued review. Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were frequent, but new findings were rare (5.1%, 4.0%). Decision-making was more common with the higher ACHD AP class and symptoms. Emergency admissions (n = 40) exceeded elective (n = 25), with over half following unremarkable clinic appointments. Distance travelled to the ACHD clinic was 14.9 km (1.6C265), resulting in 433C564 workdays lost. During COVID 19, there were 127 appointments (56% in-person, 41% telephone and 5% video). Decisions were made at 37% in-person and 19% virtual consultations. Nonattendance was 3.9%; there were eight emergency admissions. Conclusion: The main purpose of the ACHD clinic is surveillance. Presently, the clinic does not sufficiently predict or prevent emergency hospital admissions and is costly to patient and provider.

A southward flow of warm, salty water had maximum current velocities along the eastern channel slope, while northward outflows of freshened ice shelf meltwater spread at intermediate depth above the western slope. The inflow correlated with the local ocean surface stress curl. At the western slope, meltwater outflows followed the warm influx along the eastern slope with a ~2-3 month delay. Ocean circulation near Dotson Ice Shelf, affected by sea ice distribution and wind, appears to significantly control the inflow of warm water and subsequent ice shelf melting on seasonal time-scales.","output":"Seasonal variability of ocean circulation near the Dotson Ice Shelf, Antarctica."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Qatar experienced a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic that disproportionately affected the craft and manual worker (CMW) population who comprise 60% of the total population. This study aimed to assess the proportions of ever and/or current infection in this population. Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted during July 26-September 09, 2020 to assess both anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity through serological testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity through PCR testing. Associations with antibody and PCR positivity were identified through regression analyses. Results: Study included 2,641 participants, 69.3% of whom were <40 years of age. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity was estimated at 55.3% (95% CI: 53.3-57.3%) and was significantly associated with nationality, geographic location, educational attainment, occupation, presence of symptoms in the two weeks preceding the survey, and previous infection diagnosis. PCR positivity was assessed at 11.3% (95% CI: 9.9-12.8%) and was significantly associated with geographic location, contact with an infected person, and reporting two or more symptoms. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) was assessed at 60.6% (95% CI: 9.9-12.8%). The proportion of antibody-positive CMWs that had a prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was 9.3% (95% CI: 7.9-11.0%). Only seven infections were ever severe and one was ever critical - an infection severity rate of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0%). Conclusions: Six in every 10 CMWs have been infected, suggestive of reaching the herd immunity threshold.

Airborne virus transmission by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is considered to be a major contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of face masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures in many countries. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the filtration of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In particular, in most end-to-end models for airborne virus transmission, it is neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face masks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic person to a healthy person, both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor environment. By framing the end-to-end virus transmission as a Molecular Communications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description of the number of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations of the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and inhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on the stochastic filtering of IAs by the face masks. Furthermore, we show that the fit of the face mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability. We conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as it encompasses the randomness of the transmission process and enables comprehensive risk analysis beyond statistical averages.","output":"Statistical Modeling of Airborne Virus Transmission Through Imperfectly Fitted Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell-penetrating peptide-mediated delivery of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) has shown great promise for exon-skipping therapy of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Pip6a-PMO, a recently developed conjugate, is particularly efficient in a murine DMD model, although mechanisms responsible for its increased biological activity have not been studied. Here, we evaluate the cellular trafficking and the biological activity of Pip6a-PMO in skeletal muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate that Pip6a-PMO is taken up in the skeletal muscle cells by an energy- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, its cellular distribution is different in undifferentiated and differentiated skeletal muscle cells (vesicular versus nuclear). Likewise, Pip6a-PMO mainly accumulates in cytoplasmic vesicles in primary cardiomyocytes, in which clathrin-mediated endocytosis seems to be the pre-dominant uptake pathway. These differences in cellular trafficking correspond well with the exon-skipping data, with higher activity in myotubes than in myoblasts or cardiomyocytes. These differences in cellular trafficking thus provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the variations in exon-skipping activity and restoration of dystrophin protein in heart muscle compared with skeletal muscle tissues in DMD models. Overall, Pip6a-PMO appears as the most efficient conjugate to date (low nanomolar EC(50)), even if limitations remain from endosomal escape.","output":"Cellular trafficking determines the exon skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO in mdx skeletal and cardiac muscle cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Effective prevention-focused, value-based strategies are needed to improve oral health.

DESIGN Phase II, stratified, permuted block randomized, controlled, two-arm, parallel groups, prevention trial. SETTING Study visits occur at three Los Angeles, CA health clinics. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and forty-four parent-child dyads with a child aged 6-48 months. INTERVENTIONS Eligible dyads were randomized in equal allocation to one of two groups: lottery incentive group or waitlist (delayed incentive) control group. Weekly lottery incentives were offered for 6 months based on Bluetooth-recorded toothbrushing frequency. Both groups received weekly text message feedback on toothbrushing performance. OUTCOMES The primary outcome was toothbrushing performance from baseline to 6 months, measured as the mean number of qualifying half-day Bluetooth-recorded episodes per week when the child's teeth were brushed. Secondary outcomes included toothbrushing performance sustainability through 12 months and dental caries status.

METHODS A dual-species film, Enterococcus faecalis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, was cultivated on root canal dentin for 7 days. The canal wall was irrigated with 0.5% or 3% sodium hypochlorite (n = 8 each), with a control group (n = 2) irrigated with sterile saline. The roots were then split horizontally at 5-, 7-, and 9-mm levels from root apex and examined under confocal laser scanning microscope and then scanning electron microscope. The proportions of viable cells situated on different depths into root canal dentin were compared at a significance level of P = .05. RESULTS Both concentrations of sodium hypochlorite significantly reduced the amount of live bacteria in the most superficial layer (first 0.1 mm) of root canal dentin, compared with the control; however, the difference was not significant between the 2 concentrations. For the next 2 layers (0.1-0.3 mm into dentinal tubules), irrigation with 3% hypochlorite resulted in significantly lower amounts of viable bacteria than 0.5% hypochlorite or saline. No significant difference between 0.5% or 3% sodium hypochlorite and the positive control was observed in deeper (>0.3 mm) regions into the root canal wall.

Ideally, such objects are removed in the emergency department utilizing a combination of local anesthesia, sedation, minimal instrumentation, and manual extraction. In some instances, simple manual extraction is unsuccessful and general anesthesia may be necessary. We describe a novel approach to retrieval and removal of a rectal foreign body utilizing a SILS port. CASE DESCRIPTION A 31-y-old male presented to the emergency department approximately 12 h after transanal insertion of a plastic cigar case. Abdominal examination revealed no evidence of peritonitis. On rectal examination, the tip of the cigar case was palpable. The foreign body, however, was unable to be removed manually in the emergency department. In the operating room, with the patient under general anesthesia, multiple attempts to remove the object were unsuccessful. A SILS port was inserted transanally. The rectum was then insufflated manually by attaching the diaphragm of the rigid sigmoidoscope to the SILS insufflation port. A 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope was placed through the SILS port. An atraumatic laparoscopic grasper was then placed through the port and used to grasp the visible end of the cigar case. The rectal foreign body was removed expeditiously. Direct visualization of the rectum revealed no evidence of mucosal injury. The patient was discharged home shortly after the procedure. DISCUSSION The SILS port allows minimally invasive extraction of rectal foreign bodies not amenable to simple manual extraction.

In addition to wearing masks and maintaining safe distances, regular ventilation in enclosed spaces where several people are gathered has proven to be an effective protective measure as advised by the World Health Organization. Additionally, as has been shown in a recent study of other airborne viruses, there is a strong correlation between the CO(2)level and aerosol content in a confined space under the assumption humans are the only CO(2)source. This can be exploited by means of a low-cost infrared CO(2)sensor to indirectly monitor the aerosol content and to provide targeted ventilation if predefined thresholds are exceeded. The distributed CO(2)monitoring network presented in this paper extends that idea and provides an inexpensive, comprehensive and modular monitoring network based on readily available components and 3D printing.

SGM had significantly higher levels of depression and PTSD symptoms as well as COVID-19-related worries and grief than non-SGM, even after controlling for family support, lifetime discrimination, and pre-existing mental health diagnoses. These findings suggest that not only has the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted SGM mental health, but that minority stress factors cannot fully explain this impact. Thus, clinicians and societal stakeholders (schools, employers, policymakers) must think beyond traditional minority stress factors (family support, discrimination) and pre-pandemic disparities to support this vulnerable population as the pandemic progresses.","output":"Psychiatric impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic on U.S. sexual and gender minority young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Besides respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 disease has a wide range of clinical, subclinical, and atypical presentations reported previously.

Consequently, the question of whether immune parameters may drive or associate with delayed unfavorable outcome in these critically ill patients remains unsolved. METHODS: We present a dynamic description of immuno-inflammatory derangements in 64 critically ill COVID-19 patients including plasma IFN&#945;2 levels and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) score measurements. RESULTS: ARDS patients presented with persistently decreased lymphocyte count and mHLA-DR expression and increased cytokine levels. Type-I IFN response was initially induced with elevation of IFN&#945;2 levels and ISG score followed by a rapid decrease over time. Survivors and non-survivors presented with apparent common immune responses over the first 3 weeks after ICU admission mixing gradual return to normal values of cellular markers and progressive decrease of cytokines levels including IFN&#945;2. Only plasma TNF-&#945; presented with a slow increase over time and higher values in non-survivors compared with survivors. This paralleled with an extremely high occurrence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of ARDS in response to SARS-CoV2 infection appears to be strongly associated with the intensity of immune alterations upon ICU admission of COVID-19 patients. In these critically ill patients, immune profile presents with similarities with the delayed step of immunosuppression described in bacterial sepsis.","output":"Longitudinal assessment of IFN-I activity and immune profile in critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) may expose health care workers (HCWs) to pathogens causing acute respiratory infections (ARIs), but the risk of transmission of ARIs from AGPs is not fully known. We sought to determine the clinical evidence for the risk of transmission of ARIs to HCWs caring for patients undergoing AGPs compared with the risk of transmission to HCWs caring for patients not undergoing AGPs. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, University of York CRD databases, EuroScan, LILACS, Indian Medlars, Index Medicus for SE Asia, international health technology agencies and the Internet in all languages for articles from 01/01/1990 to 22/10/2010.

The outcome of interest was risk of ARI transmission. The quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE system. We identified 5 case-control and 5 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of SARS to HCWs. Procedures reported to present an increased risk of transmission included [n; pooled OR(95%CI)] tracheal intubation [n = 4 cohort; 6.6 (2.3, 18.9), and n = 4 case-control; 6.6 (4.1, 10.6)], non-invasive ventilation [n = 2 cohort; OR 3.1(1.4, 6.8)], tracheotomy [n = 1 case-control; 4.2 (1.5, 11.5)] and manual ventilation before intubation [n = 1 cohort; OR 2.8 (1.3, 6.4)]. Other intubation associated procedures, endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebulizer treatment, administration of O2, high flow O2, manipulation of O2 mask or BiPAP mask, defibrillation, chest compressions, insertion of nasogastric tube, and collection of sputum were not significant. Our findings suggest that some procedures potentially capable of generating aerosols have been associated with increased risk of SARS transmission to HCWs or were a risk factor for transmission, with the most consistent association across multiple studies identified with tracheal intubation.","output":"Aerosol Generating Procedures and Risk of Transmission of Acute Respiratory Infections to Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the dynamic interaction between antibody and antigen, Fan et al. rationally designed a triangular DNA origami framework to spatially organize the antigenic epitopes at the nanoscale and thus to monitor the transient binding kinetics of the dynamic antigen-antibody complexes at room temperature.

Socio-demographic recording of HIV patients was conducted to gain a better knowledge of the disease profile, and to aid into the development of more effective HIV prevention and care strategies. Demographic studies of pregnant women who test positive for HIV can serve as proxies for targeted HIV interventions in a wider community as well as mother-to-child transmission prevention. Material and methods: A total of 607 pregnant women, aged 15-49 years, who first visited ANC clinic during a period of January-March 2020 were enrolled. Samples were gathered for three months, or until target sample size was met. Chi-square test was performed to determine various age factors. Link between demographic characteristics and risk of HIV infection was determined using logistic regression approach with SPSS version 26.0. Results: Overall, no demographic variables were found to be substantially associated with HIV prevalence. However, research on demographic characteristics, history of HIV testing, and COVID-19 pandemic revealed that the most conducted tests were among young, less educated, primigravida, and rural women with poor socio-economic status. Conclusions: There is a relationship between parity, employment status, education level, and age and HIV testing among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

One month later, the number of COVID-19 patients in Lombardy exceeded 17000 and about 3500 had died. Because of this rapid increase in infected people scientists wonder whether SARS-CoV-2 was already highly circulating in Lombardy before such date. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were shown to be highly increased in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring their levels in Emergency Room patients during the months preceding February 20th, 2020, might shade light on the prevalence of the disease in the pre-COVID-19 period. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the AST and LDH levels from more than 30.000 patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital Emergency Room (ER) between September 2019 and May 2020 as well as between September 2018 and May 2019. The number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were also analyzed. RESULTS: Data showed that the ER averaged AST and LDH levels are highly sensitive to the presence of COVID-19 patients. During, the months preceding February 20th, 2020, AST and LDH levels, as well as the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were similar to their 2019 counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: No significant evidence showing that a large number of COVID-19 patients were admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital ER before February 20th, 2020, was found. Thus, the virus was likely circulating, within the Hospital catchment area, either in low amounts or through asymptomatic individuals.

No prospective study has focused on the physical health complaints among HCWs engaged in the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of various physical symptoms experienced by HCWs following their exposure to COVID-19 patients and investigate the association between occupation and the manifestation of physical symptoms among HCWs at a tertiary hospital in Japan during the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A twice-weekly questionnaire targeting HCWs who care for COVID-19 patients was performed at Osaka City University Hospital from April 30 to May 31, 2020. The demographic characteristics of the participants, frequency of exposure to at-risk care, and physical complaints were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-six HCWs participated in this study, of whom 24 (31.6%) were doctors, 43 (56.6%) were nurses, and 9 (11.8%) were technicians. The frequency of experiencing any physical symptom was 25.0% among HCWs. Exposure to at-risk care was significantly higher among nurses than among doctors (p < 0.001). Notably, the frequency of physical symptoms among the nurses was very high at 39.5% and obviously higher than that of physical symptoms among the doctors (p < 0.01).

Accordingly, European environmental policy aims at eliminating SUP. Recently, we presented a model of plastic governance that derives from a circular economy approach identifying and taking into consideration perspectives of different actors in the plastic governance, such as producers, wholesalers, shop keepers, consumers, citizen scientists, and academia. Our results illustrate that the vast majority of stakeholders cared for the natural environment and understood the need to phase out SUP from the global economy. We proposed that a knowledge brokerage, undertaken by scientists via means of citizen science, as the most effective method to implement elimination policy, as it provides stakeholders with knowledge on why and how to handle SUP issues. However, at the time of the global COVID-19 pandemic, a plastic governance model required a re-assessment. The perceived role of SUP has changed, as it reflects the health emergency. Namely, due to the health safety reasons stakeholders and consumers are requesting even more SUP than previously. Following up on our data gathered prior to the pandemic, we suggest that under the new circumstances health concerns outweigh the environmental concerns being determined by a shift in the value hierarchization.

This has contributed to a higher rate of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections amongst unvaccinated individuals as compared to vaccinated individuals. It is important to understand how low vaccination rates directly impact deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infections in unvaccinated populations across the United States. ObjectiveTo estimate a lower bound on the number of vaccine-preventable deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections under various scenarios of vaccine completion, for every state of the United States. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis counterfactual simulation study varies the rates of complete vaccination coverage under the scenarios of 100%, 90% and 85% coverage of the adult (18+) population of the United States. For each scenario, we use U.S. state-level demographic information in conjunction with county-level vaccination statistics to compute a lower bound on the number of vaccine-preventable deaths for each state. ExposuresCOVID-19 vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 infection Main Outcomes and MeasuresDeath from SARS-CoV-2 infection ResultsBetween January 1st, 2021 and April 30th, 2022, there were 641,305 deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States. Assuming each state continued peak vaccination capacity after initially achieving its peak vaccination rate, a vaccination rate of 100% would have led to 322,324 deaths nationally, that of 90% would have led to 415,878 deaths, and that of 85% would have led to 463,305 deaths. As a comparison, using the state with the highest peak vaccination rate (per million population each week) for all the states, a vaccination rate of 100% would have led to 302,344 deaths nationally, that of 90% would have led to 398,289 deaths, and that of 85% would have led to 446,449 deaths. Conclusions and RelevanceOnce COVID-19 vaccine supplies peaked across the United States, if there had been 100% COVID-19 vaccination coverage of the over 18+ population, a conservative estimate of 318,981 deaths could have been potentially avoided through vaccination. For a 90% vaccination coverage, we estimate at least 225,427 deaths averted through vaccination, and at least 178,000 lives saved through vaccination for an 85% vaccination coverage.","output":"Estimating Vaccine-Preventable COVID-19 Deaths Under Counterfactual Vaccination Scenarios in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent restrictions on dental services have had a significant impact on the provision of dental care in Australia and around the world. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on medications prescribed by dentists under the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). METHODS: Data on the number of dental prescriptions dispensed for all medications listed on the PBS Dental Schedule, from January 2019 to June 2020, were extracted from publicly available data sets. Analysis of prescription trends was performed for 1) total medications, 2) each major medication class, and 3) individual medications. The number of prescriptions dispensed in each month from January 2020 to June 2020 was compared to the same month in 2019 to determine the relative (percentage) change, and z statistics were used to determine whether changes were statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in dental prescriptions in April 2020 compared to April 2019 (14,785, 18%; P < 0.05). Decreases in prescriptions for antibiotics (10,512, 16%; P < 0.05) and opioid analgesics (3,129, 18%; P < 0.05) were smaller compared to other major medication classes. There was a significant increase in June 2020, compared with June 2019, for prescriptions of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (4,903, 20%; P < 0.05), tramadol (89, 46%; P < 0.05), and oxycodone (381, 73%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dental service restrictions during COVID-19 likely drove an unmet need for routine dental treatment, which had significant implications for public oral health following easing of restrictions. During the initial surge and subsequent lockdown, antibiotics and opioid analgesics may have been used an as alternative to routine operative treatment. Continued professional guidance is required to ensure dental prescribing remains evidence based during the pandemic period. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions on dental practice have had a profound impact on the provision of dental care in Australia and elsewhere in the world. In this context, population-level medication surveillance is important to identify and respond to changes in prescribing patterns that have arisen due to COVID-19 and restrictions on the provision of dental care.

Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction is thought to play a major role, resulting in a failure of weaning. Stimulation of the phrenic nerves and resulting diaphragm contraction could potentially prevent or treat this atrophy. The subject of this study is to determine the effectiveness of diaphragm stimulation in preventing atrophy by measuring changes in its thickness. METHODS: A total of 12 patients in the intervention group and 10 patients in the control group were enrolled. Diaphragm thickness was measured by ultrasound in both groups at the beginning of study enrollment (hour 0), after 24 hours, and at study completion (hour 48). The obtained data were then statistically analyzed and both groups were compared. RESULTS: The results showed that the baseline diaphragm thickness in the interventional group was (1.98  0.52) mm and after 48 hours of phrenic nerve stimulation increased to (2.20  0.45) mm (p=0.001). The baseline diaphragm thickness of (2.00  0.33) mm decreased in the control group after 48 hours of mechanical ventilation to (1.72  0.20) mm (p<0.001).

During the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, it was observed that influenza was associated with bacterial co-infections. However, empirical or prophylactic antibiotic use during viral pandemics should be balanced against the associated adverse drug events. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated bacterial co-infections in adults with COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Notably, at the time of writing this report, patients with varying disease severities were isolated in hospitals until confirmatory evidence of virological clearance or immunity was available. The study included adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a single hospital cluster between 8 January 2020 and 1 May 2020. We obtained data regarding patient demographics, clinical presentations, blood test results, treatment, and outcomes. Bacteriological profiles and risk factors for co-infections were investigated. Antibiotic prescription practices were also reviewed. Results: Of the 147 patients recruited, clinical disease was suspected in 42% (n = 62) of patients who underwent testing for other respiratory infections. Notably, 35% (n = 52) of the patients were prescribed empirical antibiotics, predominantly penicillins or cephalosporins. Of these, 35% (n = 18) received more than one class of antibiotics and 37% (n = 19) received empirical antibiotics for over 1 week. Overall, 8.2% (n = 12) of patients developed bacterial co-infections since the detection of COVID-19 until discharge. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative pathogen identified. Although 8.2% (n = 12) of patients developed hypoxia and required oxygen therapy, no mortality was observed. Multivariate analysis showed that pneumonic changes on chest radiography at the time of admission predicted bacterial co-infections. Conclusion: These findings emphasise the importance of judicious administration of antibiotics throughout the disease course of COVID-19 and highlight the role of antimicrobial stewardship during a pandemic.","output":"Bacterial co-infections and antibiotic prescribing practice in adults with COVID-19: experience from a single hospital cluster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephrotic syndrome (NS) are uncommon manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mononucleosis.

METHODS Stable delivery of sevoflurane was administered to 30 elective cardiac surgery patients at 1.8 vol% (inspiratory) via the anaesthetic circuit and ventilator. During CPB, sevoflurane was administered in the oxygenator fresh gas supply (Compactflo Evolution?; Sorin Group, Milano, Italy). Sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) was measured using gas chromatography. Changes were correlated with bispectral index (BIS), patient temperature, haematocrit, plasma albumin concentration, oxygenator fresh gas flow, and the sevoflurane concentration in the oxygenator exhaust at predefined time points. RESULTS The mean SPC pre-bypass was 54.9 g ml(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI): 50.6-59.1]. SPC decreased to 43.2 g ml(-1) (95% CI: 40.3-46.1; P<0.001) after initiation of CPB, and was lower still during rewarming and weaning from bypass, 39.4 g ml(-1) (95% CI: 36.6-42.3; P<0.001). BIS did not exceed a value of 55. SPCs were higher during hypothermia (P<0.001) and with an increase in oxygenator fresh gas flow (P=0.015), and lower with haemodilution (P=0.027). No correlation was found between SPC and the concentration of sevoflurane in the oxygenator exhaust gas (r=-0.04; 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.09; P=0.53). CONCLUSIONS The uptake of sevoflurane delivered via the membrane oxygenator during CPB seems to be affected by hypothermia, haemodilution, and changes in the oxygenator fresh gas supply flow. Measuring the concentration of sevoflurane in the exhaust from the oxygenator is not useful for monitoring sevoflurane administration during bypass.","output":"Changes in sevoflurane plasma concentration with delivery through the oxygenator during on-pump cardiac surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the SARS-CoV pandemic has gone well beyond health concerns, reaching the maritime industry. The study on the environmental impact of shipping industry during COVID-19 pandemic can provide useful insights to propose new management policies regarding shipping operations, both in-port and on the route. We present a case study centred in the Port of Barcelona covering a 30 nautical miles range in the period March to July 2020, during which different levels of restrictions and stringent lockdown measures were enforced. In this paper, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on maritime traffic and its related emissions in port cities using real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Interestingly, results show that the decline in maritime traffic is not correlated with a decrease in maritime emissions due to changes in vessel operation. During lockdown (March to June 2020), we observed a 27.9% reduction in the number of port calls compared to the pre-lockdown scenario, whereas pollutant emissions show a moderate decrease (1.8% for CO(2)), no significant reduction (SO(2) and PM) or a slight increase (1.3% for NO(x)). This can be directly assigned to changes in vessel operation mode, i.e. vessels switched from Underway to At Anchor or Moored status, during which auxiliary engines are used at higher loads.","output":"COVID-19 impact on maritime traffic and corresponding pollutant emissions.

This study compares retinal toxicity and ocular survival between two formulations, with and without propylene glycol (Alkeran vs. Evomela, respectively). METHODS A retrospective cohort study of retinoblastoma patients who received intravitreal injections of Alkeran and Evomela at 30 g from September 2012 to January 2019 at a single tertiary care center were enrolled. Retinal toxicity was measured using electroretinogram (ERG) and compared using a multivariate analysis of 338 injections in 101 eyes of 96 patients. Ocular survival of 163 eyes in 150 patients was compared across formulations using Cox proportional hazards model. Eyes were censored at the time a patient received a dose other than 30 g. RESULTS Overall, ERG decline (mean, 95% CI) for each injection was -5.58 V (-7.17, -3.99). No significant differences in ERG decrement were found between Alkeran (with alcohol) -5.52uV (-6.99, -4.05). and Evomela (without alcohol) -5.65uV (-8.31 to -2.98) formulations (p = 0.93). Ocular survival at 24 months was 93.6% (95% CI 86.2, 97.1) with alcohol and 91.7% (95% CI 53.9, 98.8) without alcohol. The hazard ratio (HR) for without vs with alcohol was 0.50 (95% CI 0.06 to 4.07); no significant difference in ocular survival was found between formulations (p = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No differences were found in retinal toxicity and ocular survival between 30 g intravitreal injections of Alkeran or Evomela for intraocular retinoblastoma. Given the increased stability of Evomela, intravitreal treatment could be expanded to centers without the ability to supply Alkeran due to its shorter safety window; however, Alkeran is less expensive.

Although MERS has low overall human-to-human transmission potential, there is occasional amplification in the healthcare setting, a pattern reminiscent of the dynamics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. Here we provide a head-to-head comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters of MERS and SARS, including the most recent South Korean outbreak of MERS in 2015. METHODS: To assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial outbreak of MERS and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters, we compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital clusters of MERS and SARS, based on individual-level data and transmission tree information. We carried out simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data, and inferred the probability and characteristics of large outbreaks. RESULTS: A significant fraction of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting, ranging from 43.5 % for the nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013 and the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Both MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks are characterized by early nosocomial super-spreading events, with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease generations. There was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of MERS and SARS: a majority of MERS cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same facilities as the index case, whereas there was a greater concentration of SARS cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak. Exposure patterns differed slightly by disease generation, however, especially for SARS. Moreover, the distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across individual hospital outbreaks (KruskalCWallis test; P < 0.0001), with significantly higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for MERS than SARS. Simulations indicate a 2-fold higher probability of occurrence of large outbreaks (>100 cases) for SARS than MERS (2 % versus 1 %); however, owing to higher transmission heterogeneity, the largest outbreaks of MERS are characterized by sharper incidence peaks. The probability of occurrence of MERS outbreaks larger than the South Korean cluster (n = 186) is of the order of 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the South Korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses, with early super-spreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections, and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations. Differences in relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of MERS and SARS could point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses.

In total, 314, 697 and 426 upregulated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 131, 263 and 342 downregulated DEPs were identified at 12, 24 and 36 hpi, respectively.

The results reveal that the DEPs were mainly involved in host innate and adaptive immune responses in the early and middle stages of SVA infection, while the DEPs mainly participated in various metabolic processes in the late stage of infection. Finally, we demonstrated that Mx1 protein exerts antiviral activity against SVA by interacting with VP1 and VP2 proteins dependent on its GTPase, oligomerization and interaction activities, while Mx1 interacts with VP3 only depending on its oligomerization activity.

Most URTIs are short, mild, and self-limiting, but some can lead to serious complications, resulting in heavy social and economic burden on individuals and society. AREAS COVERED This article presents the management guidelines and consensus established through the Delphi method during an expert roundtable conducted in November 2020 and results of a targeted literature review. EXPERT OPINION There is currently no available cure for acute URTI and management strategies aim towards symptom alleviation and prevention of URTI virus transmission. The effectiveness of these strategies is highly increased with early intervention, administered prior to the peaking of viral shedding. This reduces the chances of developing a full-blown acute URTI, decreases symptom severity, and reduces viral transmission. Mucoadhesive gel nasal sprays have shown promising results for early intervention of acute URTI. They act by creating a barrier that can trap virus particles, thereby preventing invasion of the mucosa by the virus. Additionally, they deliver broad spectrum activity that is effective against a wide variety of pathogens that cause acute URTI. Acute URTI warrants greater attention and proactive management in reducing its burden.","output":"Management of acute upper respiratory tract infection: the role of early intervention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CRISPR-Cas12a is a leading technology for development of model organisms, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

We evaluated the accuracy of the point estimates and the accuracy of the uncertainty estimates of the model predictions. First, we compared the \\"ground truth\\" data sources on daily deaths against which these models were trained. Three different data sources were used by these models, and these had substantial differences in recorded daily death counts. Two additional data sources that we examined also provided different death counts per day. For accuracy of prediction, all models fared very poorly. Only 10.2% of the predictions fell within 10% of their training ground truth, irrespective of distance into the future. For accurate assessment of uncertainty, only one model matched relatively well the nominal 95% coverage, but that model did not start predictions until April 16, thus had no impact on early, major decisions. For ICU bed utilisation, the IHME model was highly inaccurate; the point estimates only started to match ground truth after the pandemic wave had started to wane. We conclude that trustworthy models require trustworthy input data to be trained upon.

To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. The objective of this study was to measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact-tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE)-the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Among 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% completed a questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation-related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded 'no', 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact-tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6/10 (OR for 1-2/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48-0.67]; OR for 3-4/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64-0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase.

Here, we intend to review this field from a global perspective by considering and linking the two sides of the problem. In the first part, we present the theoretical model used to study interfacial flows arising in droplet-based microfluidics, paying attention to three elements commonly present in applications: viscoelasticity, electric fields and surfactants. We review both classical and current results about the stability of jets affected by these elements. Mechanisms leading to the breakup of jets to produce drops are reviewed as well, including some recent advances in this field. We also consider the relatively scarce theoretical studies on the emergence and stability of tip streaming flows. In the second part of this review, we focus on axisymmetric microfluidic configurations which can operate on the dripping and jetting modes either in a direct (standard) way or via tip streaming. We present the dimensionless parameters characterizing these configurations, the scaling laws which allow predicting the size of the resulting droplets and bubbles, as well as those delimiting the parameter windows where tip streaming can be found. Special attention is paid to electrospray and flow focusing, two of the techniques more frequently used in continuous drop production microfluidics.

Improving health system efficiency could mitigate these outcomes and, in the COVID-19 era, reduce risks of viral exposure. OBJECTIVE: As part of a system-wide transformation to improve healthcare value among populations with high healthcare utilization and morbidity, UCLA Health evaluated a new patient-centered approach that we hypothesized would reduce inpatient utilization for CKD patients. DESIGN: For 18 months in 2015-2016 and 12 months in 2017, we conducted an interrupted time series regression analysis to evaluate the intervention's impact on inpatient utilization. We used internal electronic health records and claims data across six payers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1442 stage 4-5 CKD patients at a large academic medical center. INTERVENTION: Between October and December 2016, the organization implemented a Population Health Value CKD intervention for the CKD stages 4-5 population. A multispecialty leadership team risk stratified the population and identified improvement opportunities, redesigned multispecialty care coordination pathways across settings, and developed greater ambulatory infrastructure to support care needs. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes included utilization of hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient bed days, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. KEY RESULTS: During the 12 months following intervention implementation, the monthly estimated rate of decline for hospitalizations was 5.4% (95% CI: 3.4-7.4%), which was 3.4 percentage points faster than the 18-month pre-intervention decline of 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0-2.2%) per month (p = 0.004). Medicare CKD patients' monthly ED visit rate of decline was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.2-4.8%) after intervention, which was 2.6 percentage points faster than the pre-intervention decline of 0.4% (95% CI: - 0.8 to 1.6%) per month (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: By creating care pathways that link primary and specialty care teams across settings with increased ambulatory infrastructure, healthcare systems have potential to reduce inpatient healthcare utilization.","output":"A System-Wide Population Health Value Approach to Reduce Hospitalization Among Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: an Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores how some Italian HR managers narrate the changes imposed by the COVID-19 threat in the workplace.

To systematically address this issue, we have established a microscopy-based quantitative assay and identified 23 miRNAs that induced contractile phenotypes when over-expressed. These were then correlated to miRNAs identified from RNA-sequencing when comparing cells in the contractile and synthetic states. Using both approaches, six miRNAs (miR-132-3p, miR-138-5p, miR-141-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-22-3p) were filtered as candidates that induce the phenotypic switch from synthetic to contractile. To identify potentially common regulatory mechanisms of these six miRNAs, their predicted targets were compared with five miRNAs sharing ZBTB20, ZNF704, and EIF4EBP2 as common potential targets and four miRNAs sharing 16 common potential targets. The interaction network consisting of these 19 targets and additional 18 hub targets were created to facilitate validation of miRNA-mRNA interactions by suggesting the most plausible pairs. Furthermore, the information on drug candidates was integrated into the network to predict novel combinatorial therapies that encompass the complexity of miRNAs-mediated regulation.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which has placed additional and substantial pressure on frontline healthcare professionals, gives added urgency to the topic. While numerous, and successful, interventions have been developed to address compromised well-being among healthcare professionals, they have not always been able to support the needs of frontline staff, specifically those working in high-pressure environments. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents findings of an evaluative research study of an intervention, named the Resilience and Well-being Training Programme, developed and implemented within an Acute Assessment Unit in a hospital in the UK. The 8 week-long programme followed a combined approach (both person-directed and work-directed), with mindfulness training as well as lectures and discussions to deepen participants understanding of organisational life. The training, delivered from January to July 2018, involved a total of 72 healthcare professionals from a wide range of levels (UK bands 2-8), trained in three cohorts. DESIGN: The research followed a pre-post design to explore participants experiences of working on the Unit, the programme and its impact on themselves and their working life. SETTING: The study was conducted in a large NHS district general hospital in South London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included healthcare assistants and nurses who had completed their preceptorship, worked in the hospitals acute assessment unit, and had undertaken the resilience and well-being training programme. METHODS: The study employed mixed methods (online questionnaire, face-to-face focus groups/ interviews) to collect data. RESULTS: Findings showed participants positive experience with the programme, however it had limited positive impacts on aspects of compromised well-being at the personal level and a statistically significant enhancement of the quality of relationships and communication on the Unit, with medium effect size (Cohens D). The programme had a positive impact on the culture of the Unit. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the demand for and value of programmes designed in ways that enable this group of professionals to take part, because these professionals are often not able to participate in such programmes. A strong commitment from the leadership to enable staff attendance in time-protected programmes is one approach that works well in the short-term. However, this may be challenging to accomplish and raises issues of sustainability. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: ? Combining person- and work-directed interventions are an effective way to enhance healthcare professionals well-being. ? Frontline ward-based staff are often under-represented in combined interventions (i.e. comprising both person and work-directed elements) due to time pressures and lack of autonomy. ? The impact of well-being interventions on healthcare professionals in high-pressure environments is unclear. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: ? Combined interventions have the potential to positively impact the well-being of nurses in high-pressure environments. ? Positive impact on well-being depends on leadership commitment to provide protected time to nurses to attend sessions during work-hours.","output":"Enhancing the well-being of front-line healthcare professionals in high pressure clinical environments: a mixed-methods evaluative research project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are considered to be 'vulnerable' to COVID-19 infection due to immunosuppression To date, there are no studies that compared the disease severity of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with non-SOT COVID-19 patients We characterized COVID-19 illness and clinical course among SOT recipients and compared the COVID-19 outcomes between SOT recipients and matched non-SOT patients Methods: In this case-control study, we compared the outcomes of COVID-19 between SOT recipients (cases: N=41) and their matched non-SOT (controls: N=121) patients from our center between 3/10/20 and 5/15/20 SOT recipients with COVID-19 were matched with up to three non-SOT COVID-19 controls on age (5years), race, and admission status Patients were followed up until death or June 10, 2020 The primary outcome was death and secondary outcomes were severe diseasedefined as transfer to the intensive care unit and requiring at least humidified high flow oxygen), intubation and renal replacement therapy (RRT) use Results: The SOT recipients had the following transplants: 9 heart, 3 lung, 16 kidney, 8 liver and 5 dual organ (2 kidney-pancreas,1 heart-kidney, 1 liver-kidney, 1 kidney after liver) with a median age of 60 years (54-69), 80% male, 67% Black, 92% hypertension, 51% diabetes and 80% chronic kidney disease (CKD) Median time from transplant to COVID-19 was 9 years (5-16) Fortyfour percent of SOT COVID-19 had severe disease (61% renal replacement therapy [RRT], 61% intubation and 11% ECMO) The overall (14 6% vs 11 4%, P=NS) and severe disease (33% vs 29%;p=NS) case fatality rates were similar in SOT and non-SOT with COVID-19 Organ type did not predict the severe disease or death in SOT-recipients Risk of death was similar between SOT and non-SOT matched COVID-19 patients (HR=0 84[0 32, 2 20]) after adjusting for disease severity RRT use was higher in SOT recipients than matched non-SOT with COVID-19 (adjusted OR=5 32 [1 26, 22 42]) after adjusting for baseline CKD Tocilizumab use was higher in SOT than non-SOT COVID-19 patients (27% vs 9%, P=0 01) Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use for COVID-19 was similar (28% vs 29%;p=0 89) in both the groups Among SOT recipients, those treated with HCQ for COVID-19 had a ten-fold higher hazard of death compared to those who did not receive HCQ (HR=10 62[1 24, 91 09]) (Figure 1) This effect was not seen in non-SOT matched controls with COVID-19 Conclusion: Blacks and Males SOT recipients affected disproportionately with COVID-19 Black constitute one-tenth of all SOT in our center yet they represented two-thirds of COVID-19 cases Despite high RRT use in SOT recipients, the severe disease and short-term death were similar in both groups HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients was associated with high mortality and therefore, its role as a treatment modality requires further scrutiny(Figure Presented)","output":"COVID-19 outcomes among solid organ transplant recipients: A matched case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new Coronavirus discovered in 2019 in Wuhan has sickened more than three million people in worldwide.

Dogs were examined on admission to the shelter and those without respiratory signs of disease were assigned daily, on a rotating basis, to receive one of three vaccines. We enrolled 972 healthy dogs. Dogs were monitored for up to 30 days post-vaccination for coughing and other clinical signs of respiratory disease. Thirty-three (10.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.2, 14.2) dogs in the IN-BP group, 36 (10.2%; 95% CI: 7.0, 13.4) dogs in the IN-BPA group, and 42 (13.5%; 95% CI: 9.7, 17.3) dogs in the IN-P group coughed spontaneously for 1 day within 30 days of vaccination (P=0.37). The IN-BP and IN-BPA vaccines were 20.7 and 24.4% effective, respectively, in reducing coughing compared with a placebo vaccine. The strongest prognostic factor for coughing (regardless of vaccine group) was the number of days spent at the shelter, with each additional day increasing the risk of coughing by 3% (95% CI: 0.5, 6.3). The low incidence of coughing in the shelter during this study precluded observation of differences in vaccine effectiveness.

There are only two studies which investigated the association of Rh blood groups in addition to ABO with COVID-19; however, in the statistical analysis ABO and Rh blood groups have been considered separately. Therefore, the present case-control study was performed to determine the association of COVID-19 with ABO blood groups considering the Rh blood groups simultaneously. The study was conducted in Kunduz COVID-19 treatment specific center, Spin-Zar Hospital (Kunduz Province, North East Afghanistan). A total of 301 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1039 healthy blood donors as control group were included in the study. RESULTS: The Rh(?) phenotype strongly increased the risk of COVID-19 (OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.86C3.89, P < 0.001). Although blood group A increased the risk of developing COVID-19, the association did not reach statistical significance. In analysis of the combination phenotypes, the A(?) blood group remarkably increased the risk of COVID-19 (OR = 7.24, 95% CI 3.62C14.4, P < 0.001).

METHODS We performed an adaptive, phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous sarilumab 200 mg or 400 mg in adults hospitalized with Covid-19. The phase 3 primary analysis population (cohort 1) was patients with critical Covid-19 receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) randomized to sarilumab 400 mg or placebo. The primary end point for phase 3 was the proportion of patients with []1-point improvement in clinical status from baseline to day 22. RESULTS Four-hundred fifty-seven (457) and 1365 patients were randomized and treated in phases 2 and 3, respectively. Among phase 3 critical patients receiving MV (n=289; 34.3% on corticosteroids), the proportion with []1-point improvement in clinical status (alive not receiving MV) at day 22 was 43.2% in sarilumab 400 mg and 35.5% in placebo (risk difference [RD] +7.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 7.4 to 21.3; P=0.3261), representing a relative risk improvement of 21.7%. Day 29 all-cause mortality was 36.4% in sarilumab 400 mg versus 41.9% in placebo (RD - 5.5%; 95% CI, -20.2 to 8.7; relative risk reduction 13.3%). In post hoc analyses pooling phase 2 and 3 critical patients receiving MV, the hazard ratio (HR) for death in sarilumab 400 mg compared with placebo was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.13) overall, improving to 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.94) in patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline.

The clinical features were severe thrombocytopenia, secondary septic shock, cerebral edema, pericardial effusion, fluid overload that exhibited bipalpebral edema in all four extremities, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), coronary artery ectasia (CAE), multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and probable COVID-19 pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that triggered patient intubation. The patient presented unusual symptomatology according to the literature. After 15 days of intubation and 15 more days under surveillance, he was released without respiratory sequelae and without treatment after major clinical improvement.

An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepImmuno-CNN correctly predicts which residues are most important for T-cell antigen recognition and predicts novel impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physicochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens.

With the COVID-19 crisis, depression in dementia patients, especially those living in long term care facilities, has increased. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) is the gold standard for assessing depression in dementia patients, but is lengthy, taking nearly 20 minutes to administer3. The SLU AMSAD is a previously validated depression tool which consists of 5-items and takes less than 2 minutes to administer3. The objective of this study was to compare this short tool with the lengthier gold standard, the CSDD, to diagnose depression in cognitively impaired patients. METHOD: 44 patients, 65years and older were enrolled in the study from an out-patient clinic setting. A St. Louis University Mental Status Exam (SLUMS) score of less than 25 was used to include the eligible patients. All enrolled subjects were administered the SLUMS, SLU AMSAD and the CSDD. The SLUMS score was used to classify the patients as having mild, moderate and severe dementia RESULT: The preliminary data set analyzed data for N=44 cases of which 54.5% were female and 88.6% Caucasian with a mean age of 79.9. The average SLUMS score was 14.3 (6.5). For the total sample, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity values exceeded 0.82, with a maximum sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.84 (for an optimal cut-off score of 4/5). CONCLUSION: The SLU AMSAD had a very strong correlation with the CSDD as shown by the above results in this preliminary data sample of 44 patients.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the clinical features of mask-induced dermatoses and recommend prevention and treatment options. METHODS: From April to August 2020, questionnaires including preexisting skin disorders, patients' reported mask-related symptoms, their daily mask wearing duration and frequency, types of masks used, whether they are health care workers, and demographic information were distributed to patients of 12 hospitals. Dermatologists assessed skin lesions, confirmed diagnosis, and recorded treatment modalities. RESULTS: Itchiness was the most frequent symptom, mostly affecting the cheeks. Most common skin disease was new-onset contact dermatitis (33.94%), followed by new-onset acne (16.97%) and aggravation of preexisting acne (16.97%). Daily wearing (p=0.018) was significantly associated with new-onset contact dermatitis. More than half of the patients with preexisting skin problems experienced aggravation while wearing masks. Longer duration (more than 6 hours/day, p=0.043) and cotton masks (p<0.001) significantly increased acne flare-up. Healthcare workers had a higher incidence of skin disease. Skin lesions were generally mild and well tolerated with topical agents. LIMITATIONS: Effect of seasonal characteristics and other risk factors were not assessed.

Critically, elderly individuals, especially those with underlying disease, poor nutritional and immune functions, are highly susceptible. Therefore, we analyzed the epidemiological features in elderly COVID\\\\19 patients. METHODS: In total, 126 patients were recruited in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat\\\\sen University, China from January 2020 to March 2020 (including 103 confirmed COVID\\\\19 patients and 23 elderly suspected cases). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. We assessed nutritional risks in elderly patients by calculating the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). RESULTS: When compared with young patients, elderly patients were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and received nutritional support and intensive care unit treatment. Elderly patients had significantly lower levels of the following: lymphocyte percentages, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, and serum albumin values. When compared with suspected COVID\\\\19 elderly cases, elderly patients had significantly lower red blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels. The average GNRI of suspected cases and confirmed patients indicated no nutritional risk. There were no marked differences in GNRI values between groups. CONCLUSION: Nutritional risk assessments may provide valuable information for predicting a COVID\\\\19 prognosis, especially in elderly patients.

While popular susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models of EID focus on transmission factors, such as contact rates, SES drivers focus on the broader economic, ecological, and social factors that can enable EID. While STM has been applied to disease propagation aspects of EID, no current models attempt to model the multi-scalar interactions between health systems, economics, and the environment in rural settings where virus hosts and humans come into contact. Systems Dynamics Modelling (SDM) tools, such as causal loop diagrams (CLD) and Archetype diagrams can visualise the complex and multi-scalar panarchic interactions influencing outbreaks of EID. In this chapter, we show that such multi-scalar CLD models can articulate the economic, environmental, social and health interactions that perpetuate unsustainable development and contribute to potential EID.

S. viridis was unable to survive exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl) levels higher than 100 mM, in contrast, S. alterniflora could tolerate NaCl up to 550 mM, with negligible effect on gas exchange related parameters and conductance of electrons transport chain (gETC). Under salt, the prompt fluorescence (OJIP-curves) exhibits an increase in the O- and J-steps in S. viridis and much less for S. alterniflora. Flowing NaCl stress, a dramatic decline in the photosystem II (PSII) primary photochemistry was observed for S. viridis, as reflected by the drastic drop in Fv/Fm, Fv/Fo and PSII; however, no substantial change was recorded for these parameters in S. alterniflora. Interestingly, we found an increase in the primary PSII photochemistry (PSII) for S. alterniflora with increasing either NaCl concentration or NaCl treatment duration. The NPQ magnitude was strongly enhanced for S. viridis even at a low NaCl (50 mM); however, it remains unchangeable or slightly increased for S. alterniflora at NaCl levels above 400 mM. After NaCl treatment, we found an increase in both the proportion of oxidized P700 and the amount of active P700 in S. viridis and almost no change for S. alterniflora. Under salt, the net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) measurements demonstrate that A decreases earlier in S. viridis, even after one week exposure to only 50 mM NaCl; in contrast, in S. alterniflora, the effect of NaCl on A and gs was minor even after exposure for two weeks to high NaCl levels. For S. viridis exposed to 50 mM NaCl for 12 d, carbon dioxide (CO2) at a concentration of 2000 L L-1 could not fully restore A to the control (Ctrl) level. Conversely, in S. alterniflora, high CO2 can fully restore A for all NaCl treatments except at 550 mM. RNA-seq data shows a major impact of NaCl on metabolic pathways in S. viridis and we found a number of transcription factors potentially related to NaCl responses. For S. alterniflora, no major changes in the transcriptomic levels were recorded under NaCl stress. To confirm our data analysis of RNA-seq, we performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for randomly selected four genes for each species (8 genes in total) and we found that our results (up- and/or down-regulated genes) are fully consistent and match well our RNA-seq data. Overall, this study showed drastically different photosynthetic and transcriptomic responses of a salt-tolerant C4 grass species and one salt-sensitive C4 grass species to NaCl stress, which suggests that S. alterniflora could be used as a promising model species to study salt tolerance in C4 or monocot species.","output":"Photosynthetic and transcriptomic responses of two C4 grass species with different NaCl tolerance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe and quantify the extent of wildlife and environment sector inclusion in country evaluation and prioritization tools for health security, and to provide practical recommendations for global and national action to improve pandemic prevention and preparedness.

We extracted information on stated coverage gaps, wildlife surveillance systems and priority diseases. We also searched National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans published by 125 countries to assess whether disease surveillance or prevention activities were included. FINDINGS: We noted that the occurrence frequency of keywords indicative of wildlife, environment, biodiversity and climate factors varied with type of report and between countries.

The lack of a regular primary physician is associated with inferior health outcomes. One strategy to address this shortage is to increase the proportion of medical students selecting a Family Medicine (FM) or PC career. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify whether pre-clerkship general practice placements increase students' interest in, and selection of FM or PC residencies. METHODS Three databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science) searched for interventional studies of pre-clerkship generalist placements in medical school. Pooled statistical analysis and meta-analysis were performed, along with narrative summaries when possible. Intervention participants (IP) were compared to controls matched (MC) for baseline interest in FM and an unmatched sample (UC) of contemporary students. FINDINGS 11 studies were identified including a total of 5430 students (2428 intervention participants and 3002 controls). IPs were more likely to match to FM than both MC (Risk Ratio: 1.62 [95% CI: 1.03-2.55]) and UC (RR: 2.04 [1.46-2.86]). Participation in long interventions (4-11 weeks) matched to FM at higher rates than short (25-40 hours) interventions (RR: 3.15 [2.28-4.35]). The percentage of students with FM/PC as their top specialty of interest increased after the placements (mean difference: +12.8%, n=586). CONCLUSIONS Medical students who participated in pre-clerkship general practice placements were more likely to match to a FM residency.

Animal models properly matched to the clinical form of CVST are necessary for elucidating the pathophysiology of the disease. In this study, we aimed to establish a rat model that accurately recapitulates the clinical features of CVST in human patients. METHODS: This study consisted of a clinical analysis and animal experiments. Clinical data for two centres obtained between January 2016 and May 2021 were collected and analysed retrospectively. In addition, a SpragueCDawley rat model of CVST was established by inserting a water-swellable rubber device into the superior sagittal sinus, following which imaging, histological, haematological, and behavioural tests were used to investigate pathophysiological changes. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering heatmaps were used to evaluate the similarity between the animal models and human patients. RESULTS: The imaging results revealed the possibility of vasogenic oedema in animal models. Haematological analysis indicated an inflammatory and hypercoagulable state. These findings were mostly matched with the retrospective clinical data. Pathological and serological tests further revealed brain parenchymal damage related to CVST in animal models. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully established a stable and reproducible rat model of CVST. The high similarity between clinical patients and animal models was verified via cluster analysis. This model may be useful for the study of CVST pathophysiology and potential therapies.

These variants are categorized as the variant of interest (VOI), variant of concern (VOC), and variant under monitoring (VUM). As of September 15, 2021, there are four SARS-CoV-2 lineages designated as the VOC (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants). VOCs have increased transmissibility compared to the original virus, and have the potential for increasing disease severity. In addition, VOCs exhibit decreased susceptibility to vaccine-induced and infection-induced immune responses, and thus possess the ability to reinfect previously infected and recovered individuals. Given their ability to evade immune responses, VOC are less susceptible to monoclonal antibody treatments. VOCs can also impact the effectiveness of mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines, although the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are still effective in preventing infection and severe disease. Current measures to reduce transmission as well as efforts to monitor and understand the impact of variants should be continued.

However, the extent to which reductions in COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) are attributable to mass vaccination in the real world remains unclear. This study evaluated the association of COVID-19 vaccine coverage with CFR on a global scale. METHODS: The sample was a longitudinal data set of 90 countries over 25 weeks, from the first week of November 2020 to the third week of April 2021. CFR was measured in deaths per 100 COVID-19 confirmed cases; vaccine coverage was defined as the number of people who received at least one vaccine dose per 10 people in the total population. Data were retrieved from open-access databases, including Our World in Data and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. A country-level random effects model was used; a comprehensive set of variables for country characteristics and nonpharmaceutical interventions were included. RESULTS: A 10% increase in vaccine coverage was associated with a 7.6% reduction in the CFR (95% confidence interval (CI = -12.6 to -2.7%, P = 0.002). This association was stronger in countries with more effective governments (-8.3%; 95% CI = -13.6 to -3.1%, P = 0.002) and higher transport infrastructure quality (-8.1%; 95% CI = -13.3 to -2.9%, P = 0.002). Moreover, the vaccine coverage was associated with a reduced CFR in a dose-dependent manner. When vaccine coverage achieved 0.8 to 1.6, 1.6 to 3.2 and 3.2 per 10 people, the CFR reduced by 12.7% (95 CI = -21.8 to -3.6%, P = 0.006), 21.2% (95 CI = -33.9 to -8.5%, P = 0.001) and 31.3% (95 CI = -51.5 to -11.0%, P = 0.002), respectively as compared with no vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide supporting evidence that vaccination is critical to preventing deaths among infected people. Vaccination programmes have yielded significant health benefits in certain countries. However, globally, a large gap remains between observed and achievable fatality reductions.

Ticks in Slovakia were found to harbour and transmit zoonotic and/or potentially zoonotic agents such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, the relapsing fever sprirochaete Borrelia miyamotoi, bacteria belonging to the orders Rickettsiales (Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Neoehrlichia mikurensis), Legionellales (Coxiella burnetii), and Thiotrichales (Francisella tularensis), and Babesia spp. parasites (order Piroplasmida). Ixodes ricinus is the principal vector of the largest variety of microorganisms including viruses, bacteria and piroplasms. TBEV, B. burgdorferi s.l., rickettsiae of the spotted fever group, C. burnetii and F. tularensis have been found to cause serious diseases in humans, whereas B. miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, N. mikurensis, Babesia microti, and B. venatorum pose lower or potential risk to humans. Distribution of TBEV has a focal character. During the last few decades, new tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) foci and their spread to new areas have been registered and TBE incidence rates have increased. Moreover, Slovakia reports the highest rates of alimentary TBE infections among the European countries. Lyme borreliosis (LB) spirochaetes are spread throughout the distribution range of I. ricinus. Incidence rates of LB have shown a slightly increasing trend since 2010. Only a few sporadic cases of human rickettsiosis, anaplasmosis and babesiosis have been confirmed thus far in Slovakia. The latest large outbreaks of Q fever and tularaemia were recorded in 1993 and 1967, respectively. Since then, a few human cases of Q fever have been reported almost each year.

Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy. However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments. A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment (PPE); local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity. An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible due to many unknown and complex factors. However, this is the overriding principle: If the risk of illness or death to a health care worker or patient from health care-acquired COVID-19 is greater than the risk of illness or death from delaying radiology care, the care should be delayed; however, if the opposite is true, the radiology care should proceed in a timely fashion.","output":"ACR Statement on Safe Resumption of Routine Radiology Care During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, between March and May 2020 the stay-at-home order and contacts of people in Germany were severely restricted. Studies worldwide allow the assumption that social isolation ordered by the crisis can have a significant influence on the well-being of those affected. To better understand the health consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown and to be able to counteract them preventively, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adults living in Germany was investigated in connection with the housing situation and the subjectively perceived household environment during this period. METHODS: A sample of n = 541 adults (M = 34 years; 67% female), recruited nationwide by four different strategies, was interviewed with standardized instruments on HRQoL and household environment during the lockdown using an online survey. RESULTS: In the investigated sample, an overall moderate HRQoL during the lockdown was found, which was significantly predicted by the subjectively perceived household environment (p < 0.001). Participants living alone reported significantly lower HRQoL than participants living with other people in the same household. The household environment predicted 26% of the variance in HRQoL; sociodemographic characteristics clarified an additional 5% variance. CONCLUSION: The evidence that a better perceived household environment was associated with higher HRQoL during the lockdown emphasizes the importance of the domestic environment during social isolation.

Here, we characterized the humoral responses following 3 months after mRNA/BNT162b2 vaccine in institutionalized elders. MethodsPlasma levels of specific SARS-CoV-2 total IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies were measured before and 3 months after vaccination in elders living in LTCF. Neutralization capacity was assessed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay against WH1 (original) and B.1.617.2/Delta variants. A group of younger adults was used as reference group. ResultsThree months after vaccination, uninfected-elders presented reduced specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels and significantly lower neutralization capacity against the WH1 and Delta virus compared to vaccinated uninfected younger individuals. In contrast, COVID-19 recovered elders showed significantly higher specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels after vaccination than younger counterparts, while showing similar neutralization activity against WH1 virus and increased neutralization capacity against Delta variant. Despite previously infected elders elicit potent cross-reactive immune responses similarly to younger individuals, higher quantities of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are required to reach the same neutralization levels. ConclusionsWhile hybrid immunity seems to be active in previously infected elders after three months from mRNA/BNT162b2 vaccination, humoral immune responses are diminished in COVID-19 uninfected vaccinated residents living in LTCF. These results suggests that a vaccine booster dose should be prioritized for this particularly vulnerable population.

METHODS: The adverse drug reaction database of the Paul-Ehrlich Institute was queried for TTS cases following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination from February 1, until May 21, 2021. Cases with reports from the Greifswald laboratory were analysed in detail. FINDINGS: PF4 antibody tests were available for 69 suspected TTS cases reported to the Paul-Ehrlich Institute, of whom 52 patients fulfilled the BC case definition; 37 (71%) women, 15 (29%) men, median age 460 years (interquartile range 310-603 years). Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was confirmed in 37 (71%), (additional) multiple thromboses in 19 (37%) patients. Twelve patients died. Non-survivors showed lower platelet counts compared to survivors (median nadir 15,000/L vs 49,000/L; p<00001). Combined anti-PF4/heparin IgG ELISA and PF4-dependent platelet activation testing yielded sensitivity of 96% (95% confidence interval 87-100%) and specificity of 77% (50-93%) for TTS. Four patients with thrombocytopenia but without thrombosis presented with severe headache or cerebral bleeding, explaining the lower specificity.

The molecular spectrum (i.e., the relative frequency of the twelve types of base substitutions) of mutations acquired by the progenitor of Omicron was significantly different from the spectrum for viruses that evolved in human patients, but was highly consistent with spectra associated with evolution in a mouse cellular environment. Furthermore, mutations in the Omicron spike protein significantly overlapped with SARS-CoV-2 mutations known to promote adaptation to mouse hosts, particularly through enhanced spike protein binding affinity for the mouse cell entry receptor.

During this time, some centers were transformed into \\"emergency childcare services\\" available to parents considered to be essential workers. Therefore, few children attended, and most educators worked remotely. In May 2020, 372 educators completed an online questionnaire regarding their emotional state, challenges, and learning opportunities. Results indicate that half of the respondents reported a decrease in their level of well-being at work and an increase in their stress level. Educators working remotely were more likely to report a lower level of stress than when working with children at daycare (36.1% vs 19.7%). Despite these findings, educators estimated that the parents who used their emergency childcare service presented either high (37.7%) or average (32.2%) levels of wellbeing. The factors that educators identified as facilitating their interactions with families included parental recognition of their work (11.68%) and direct contact with them (12.62%). While many tasks accomplished at home were done for the first time during this period (i.e., creating video capsules for children and parents, virtual meetings with children and colleagues), a large majority of respondents reported that these tasks made them feel useful.

We attempted to determine whether the CT findings correlated with age and clinical variables, as well as whether the need for mechanical ventilation correlated with the extent of the pulmonary involvement. Results: On average, the patients with COVID-19 were older than were those without (mean age, 54.8 years vs. 45.5 years; p = 0.031). The most common CT finding (seen in 88.6%) was ground-glass opacity, which correlated significantly with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.0001). The CT findings that correlated most strongly with the need for mechanical ventilation were parenchymal bands (p = 0.013), bronchial ectasia (p = 0.046), and peribronchovascular consolidations (p = 0.012).

During pressure support ventilation (PSV), a mismatch between demand and assist could increase work of breathing and limit exercise. A better exercise tolerance is possible with a proportional mode of ventilation (Proportional Assist Ventilation, PAV+ and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist, NAVA). We examined whether, in critically ill patients, PSV and proportional ventilation have different effects on respiratory muscles unloading and work efficiency during exercise. METHODS Prospective pilot randomized cross-over study performed in a medico-surgical ICU. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation >48 h were enrolled. At initiation, the patients underwent an incremental workload test on a cycloergometer to determine the maximum level capacity. The next day, 2 15-min exercise, at 60% of the maximum capacity, were performed while patients were randomly ventilated with PSV and PAV+ or NAVA. The change in oxygen consumption (VO2, indirect calorimetry) and the work efficiency (ratio of VO2 per mean power) were computed. RESULTS Ten patients were examined, 6 ventilated with PSV/PAV+ and 4 with PSV/NAVA. Despite the same mean inspiratory pressure at baseline between the modes, baseline VO2 (median, IQR) was higher during proportional ventilation (301 ml/min, 270-342) compared to PSV (249 ml/min, 206-353). Exercise with PSV was associated with a significant increase in VO2 (VO2, median, IQR) (77.6 ml/min, 59.9-96.5), while VO2 did not significantly change during exercise with proportional modes (46.3 ml/min, 5.7-63.7, p < 0.05). As a result, exercise with proportional modes was associated with a better work efficiency than with PSV. The ventilator modes did not affect patient's dyspnea, limb fatigue, distance, hemodynamics and breathing pattern. CONCLUSIONS Proportional ventilation during exercise results in higher work efficiency and less increase in VO2 compared to ventilation with PSV. These preliminary findings suggest that proportional ventilation could enhance the training effect and facilitate rehabilitation.","output":"Can proportional ventilation modes facilitate exercise in critically ill patients?

Subsequently, questions arose whether these vaccines pose an increased risk for intolerance reactions and whether allergic patients may be at higher risk for this. RESULTS: Allergic reactions following COVID-19 vaccinations have been reported, but mostly of mild severity and at normal (Moderna?) or only slightly increased frequency (BioNTech/Pfizer?) compared to established conventional vaccines. The risk of allergic reaction to the newly licensed vector vaccines (AstraZeneca?, Johnson&Johnson?) cannot be conclusively assessed yet, but also appears to be low. There is currently no evidence that patients with allergic diseases (atopic patients) react more frequently or more severely to these vaccines. It is currently assumed that intolerance reactions of the immediate-type are either type I allergic (IgE-mediated) reactions or occur via complement activation (CARPA, complement activation-related pseudoallergy). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate, which are present as stabilizers in the vaccines, are suspected as triggers for this. CONCLUSION: The data available so far do not show a significantly increased risk of immediate-type allergic reactions in atopic persons. In almost all cases, atopic patients can be vaccinated without problems. Standardized follow-up tests after suspected allergic reactions or CARPA-mediated reactions are currently limited.","output":"Answers to burning questions for clinical allergologists related to the new COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obesity has been described as a protective factor in cardiovascular and other diseases being expressed as 'obesity paradox'. However, the impact of obesity on clinical outcomes including mortality in COVID-19 has been poorly systematically investigated until now. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients divided into three groups according to the body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We retrospectively collected data up to May 31st, 2020. 3635 patients were divided into three groups of BMI (<25 kg/m2; n = 1110, 25-30 kg/m2; n = 1464, and >30 kg/m2; n = 1061). Demographic, in-hospital complications, and predictors for mortality, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis were analyzed. RESULTS: The rate of respiratory insufficiency was more recorded in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2 (22.8% vs. 41.8%; p < 0.001), and in BMI > 30 kg/m2 than BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (22.8% vs. 35.4%; p < 0.001). Sepsis was more observed in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (25.1% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.02) and (25.1% vs. 32.5%; p = 0.006). The mortality rate was higher in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (27.2% vs. 39.2%; p = 0.31) (27.2% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.004). In the Cox multivariate analysis for mortality, BMI < 25 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 did not impact the mortality rate (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.889-1.508; p = 0.27) (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.893-1.479; p = 0.27). In multivariate logistic regression analyses for respiratory insufficiency and sepsis, BMI < 25 kg/m2 is determined as an independent predictor for reduction of respiratory insufficiency (OR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.538-1.004; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HOPE COVID-19-Registry revealed no evidence of obesity paradox in patients with COVID-19.

This viral-load protective effect has been waning with time post the second vaccine and later restored with a booster shot. It is currently unclear though for how long this regained effectiveness lasts. Analyzing Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR tests of over 22,000 infections during a Delta-variant-dominant period in Israel, we find that this viral-load reduction effectiveness significantly declines within months post the booster dose. Adjusting for age, sex and calendric date, Ct values of RdRp gene initially increases by 2.7 [CI: 2.3-3.0] relative to unvaccinated in the first month post the booster dose, yet then decays to a difference of 1.3 [CI: 0.7-1.9] in the second month and becomes small and insignificant in the third to fourth months. The rate and magnitude of this post-booster decline in viral-load reduction effectiveness mirror those observed post the second vaccine.

The Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory was used to assess importance of preferences among persons with CI at baseline and follow-up (mean 486 days). Care partners separately completed concurrent proxy assessments. Mixed random and fixed effects longitudinal models were used to evaluate changes in ratings and concordance levels between persons with CI and care partners. RESULTS There were significant gender differences regarding importance ratings of \\"autonomous choice\\" and \\"social engagement\\" preferences over time: women with CI rated these preferences as more important across time as a whole. Higher levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with less importance of \\"social engagement\\" preferences across time as a whole for persons with CI and a more negative discrepancy between persons with CI and care partner proxy assessments as time went on.

Reports from cities and states have suggested a discordant impact on black Americans, but no nationwide study has yet been performed. We sought to understand the differential outcomes for black and white Americans infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We obtained case-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 76,442 white and 48,338 non-Hispanic Black patients diagnosed with COVID-19, ages 0 to >80+, outlining information on hospitalization, ICU admission, ventilation, and death outcomes. Multivariate Poisson regressions were used to estimate the association of race, treating white as the reference group, controlling for sex, age group, and the presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: Black patients were generally younger than white, were more often female, and had larger numbers of comorbidities. Compared to white patients with COVID-19, black patients had 1.4 times the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.42, p < 0.001), and almost twice the risk of requiring ICU care (RR 1.68, p < 0.001) or ventilatory support (RR 1.81, p < 0.001) after adjusting for covariates. Black patients saw a 1.36 times increased risk of death (RR 1.36, p < 0.001) compared to white. Disparities between black and white outcomes increased with advanced age. CONCLUSION: Despite the initial descriptions of COVID-19 being a disease that affects all individuals, regardless of station, our data demonstrate the differential racial effects in the United States.

As many as half of all HCWs will exhibit clinically significant distress. This distress may endure for years, and health care institutions must respond to these emotional needs. We propose the Matched Emotional Supports in Health Care (MESH) Framework to guide institutions in implementing a tiered, or \\"stepped care\\" model for deploying sustainable emotional support programs for HCWs for COVID-19 and beyond. Recognizing the variability in HCWs' response to stress, MESH outlines a continuum of services, including universal (e.g., self-help), selected (e.g., support from trained volunteers), and indicated (e.g., professional therapy, psychotropic medication management) interventions matched to individual need. We provide a targeted review of evidence-based resources available at each level of care and potential processes for determining when higher levels of care are needed. Finally, we delineate key implementation factors for institutions to consider in developing, implementing, and sustaining services for HCWs.

However, no study to date has investigated the risk and protective characteristics associated with practicing proper hand washing or social distancing. The present study examined the effects of such characteristics among 2,509 adults from the United States, Italy, Spain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and India. In the overall sample, age was significantly associated with social distancing (b = 0.07,  = 0.36, p = .001) but not hand washing. Lesbian women and gay men were less likely to engage in social distancing (b = -0.92,  = -0.07, p = .001) and hand washing (b = -0.39,  = -0.08, p <.001) relative to their heterosexual peers. No significant differences were found in the overall sample with regard to education level or employment status, but rural (b = -0.45,  = -0.07, p = .003) respondents were significantly less likely to practice social distancing compared to their urban counterparts. Furthermore, both suburban (b = -0.12,  = -0.06, p = .014) and rural (b = -0.13,  = -0.05, p = .022) respondents were significantly less likely to practice appropriate hand washing compared to their urban peers. Taken together, the results suggest multiple nuanced disparities exist regarding social distancing and hand washing among adults internationally. As such, more tailored and culturally-responsive clinical and community-based interventions may be needed to promote preventive measures to mitigate existing COVID-related disparities.","output":"Predictors of Social Distancing and Hand Washing among Adults in Five Countries during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, users are increasingly turning to online services.

While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","output":"Estimating the overdispersion in COVID-19 transmission using outbreak sizes outside China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the uncertainties of COVID-19, people infected by coronavirus present with diverse psychiatric presentations.

Material and Methods: Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) from across five continents were approached to provide their perspective on the management of psychiatric conditions in patients with COVID-19 and during the current pandemic. Results: We collected information about the experiences from ten countries. Commonalities were similar psychiatric presentations and poor preparedness across countries. Differences were varying innovations and adjustments made in the management of psychiatric conditions coexisting with COVID-19. Good practices which can be adopted by other countries are novel approaches such as telepsychiatry, proactive consultation-liaison units and enhanced community services targeted at circumventing challenges faced yet providing mental health services. Conclusions: This publication highlights the need for global preparedness in the mental health sector during outbreaks of infectious diseases.

STUDY DESIGN Systematic Review and Population analysis. METHODS A systematic review was performed to identify CRS clinical trials, conducted in the U.S. and published between 2010 and 2020 in which patients were prospectively enrolled. Pooled racial and ethnicity data were compared to national and corresponding regional census data. RESULTS Eighty-three studies were included, comprising 12,027 patients. 50.4% were male and the average age was 49.2 years. 8,810 patients underwent a surgical procedure. Of the 12,027 patients, 81.67% were identified as White, 5.35% as Black, 1.27% as Asian, 0.02% as Pacific Islander, 0.12% as American Indian, and 11.57% were classified as Other. The racial and ethnic composition of the pooled study population differs significantly from the national U.S. census data with the underrepresentation of each minority population (P  .0002). Regional sub-analyses yield variable results. In the Northeast and West, there was an underrepresentation of all minority populations. In the South and Midwest, Black enrollment was similar to the U.S. census data, while all other minorities were underrepresented.

METHODS: Serum HCY concentration was statistically compared between 24 healthy dogs and 29 dogs with immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy. Correlation analyses between serum total protein, albumin (ALB), C-reactive protein (CRP), folate and cobalamin, and serum HCY concentration were performed in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs. RESULTS: The associations between serum HCY concentration and clinical, histological, endoscopic scores and follow-up were evaluated. Mean serum HCY concentration was higher in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs compared to control dogs (30.22  8.67 mol/L vs. 5.26  2.78 mol/L; p < 0.0001).

Forty-six patients (17.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 infection. There were no significant differences in age or Charlson comorbidity score between those with or without COVID-19. Those with COVID-19 infection were more likely to be male (p = 0.01). Patients with COVID-19 had a 30-day mortality of 35% versus 10% in patients without (p < 0.01). One hundred twenty-day mortality was also greater in those with COVID-19 infection at 63% compared to those without at 17% (p < 0.01).

The present study is the first survey to be carried out in Latin America (in Santiago, the capital of Chile). It aims to (a) explore the perceived psychological impact and future concerns; (b) evaluate vulnerability factors; (c) describe the perceived psychological impacts on participants whose psychological help and actual online psychotherapy was interrupted; and (d) explore the future need for psychological help. Procedure: An online survey was carried out (the first 2 weeks of lockdown in Santiago), which included sociodemographic data, perceived psychological impact, future concerns, and questions about psychological support. Participants: A total of 3,919 subjects answered, mostly women (80%). Results: The main perceived psychological impacts were concern (67%) and anxiety (60%). Future concerns were: general health (55.3%), employment (53.1%), and finances (49.8%). Younger participants had a greater perceived psychological impact (p's < 0.01) and concerns about employment, finances, mental health, stigma, and general health (p's < 0.001).

An e-guide was designed to provide remote support to the general public through the application of a Behavioural Activation approach. Interactive, brief evidence-based exercises were included in the e-guide, along with mood ratings after each exercise to assess any improvements observed.MethodThe e-guide was designed using the Xerte On- Line Toolkits open source software. Videos and interactive exercises were embedded within the resource, forming part of the brief intervention based on cognitivist and behaviourist principles. Information and further support was also provided for young people and parents. Videos from the public highlighting their experiences during the pandemic were also sourced and included (with consent). A pilot was launched to assess the impact of the e-guide. Participants were recruited from Cardiff University, mental health services and a local charity.ResultThe e-guide was piloted on a sample of volunteers (n = 3), who completed a brief survey after engaging with the resource. Following the results of the pilot, the e-guide was promoted by the university's marketing team and made available to the public. At the 6-month mark, the e-guide had been accessed by 3228 individuals throughout the UK.ConclusionThe e-guide has since been disseminated by support services for young people, places of employment and eduction institutions.

We described for the first time recombinant SeCoV circulating in Spain between 1993 and 2014 and its misidentification as PEDV when diagnostic assays based on the S-protein or S-gene of the PEDV were used. The complete S-gene sequence of 7 Spanish SeCoV and 30 PEDV Spanish isolates was phylogenetically analysed including the S-gene sequences of the three SeCoV and a representative selection of the PEDV strains with complete genome sequences available in the GenBank. The tree showed a common ancestor for the S-gene of the PEDV and SeCoV, but no evolution from any known PEDV clade was shown for the SeCoV strains. Moreover, complete genome sequences were obtained from 23 PEDV strains recovered in Spanish swine farms since 2014. The phylogenetic tree showed the INDEL type genogroup of these Spanish strains, supporting the lower pathogenicity of this genogroup since no significant economic losses were reported in the affected Spanish swine farms. Four subgroups were detected among PEDV strains in Spain, closely related to the recent European strains. Moreover, eight of the most recent Spanish PEDV isolates formed a subclade together with three European strains from 2015, showing a new evolution branch with a recombinant virus.","output":"A retrospective study of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) reveals the presence of swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV) since 1993 and the recent introduction of a recombinant PEDV-SeCoV in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One major limitation of neutralizing antibody-based COVID-19 therapy is the requirement of costly cocktails to reduce antibody resistance.

A total of 299 mother-infant pairs were recruited in this study and their meconium were collected. After three years, 53 children underwent the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) examinations and provided hair and fingernail specimens. The levels of As, Cd, and Pb in the meconium, hair, and fingernail were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; the median levels were the following: meconium, 42.7, 5.57, and 25.6 ng/g, respectively; hair, 0.19, 0.05, and 3.61 g/g, respectively; and fingernail, 0.29, 0.04, and 0.84 g/g, respectively.

This paper aimed to study the effectiveness of emergency measures for emergent infectious diseases to look for key measures and effective combinations. Methods: We took COVID 19 pandemic management and control measures in China as an example, and selected five high frequency emergency measures including controlling population mobility, patient admission, appropriation of pandemic prevention funds, legal regulations and resumption of production from the perspective of Epidemiology. Using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we conducted necessary condition analysis and configuration analysis on these measures using official statistical data. And robustness test was performed by changing consistency threshold. Results: We found that: (1) The consistency of the five emergency measures was less than 0.9, indicating that none of these measures can be used separately as a necessary condition for the strong pandemic prevention and control effects. (2) There were three combinations of emergency measures to achieve strong pandemic prevention and control effects, with solution consistency of 0.92 and solution coverage of 0.6: when all patients are admitted to hospitals, the government provides sufficient pandemic prevention funds, and severely crack down on criminal cases;when resume production under the measures of strictly controlling population mobility and severely cracking down on criminal cases;when strictly control population mobility and all patients are admitted to hospitals without resumption production. Conclusions: These findings suggest that fsQCA model can be applied to comprehensive effectiveness assessment of infectious diseases emergency measures.

In this study, one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays were developed to differentiate B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages. The assays were evaluated using in vitro transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R 2 =0.99), and high specificity. Using the developed rRT-PCR assays, 169 clinical specimens collected between 2010 and 2013 were then tested, resulting in the identification of 20 clinical specimens as positive for influenza B virus. Of these, 14 and 6 samples were identified as positive for the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, respectively, whereas 149 samples were negative for the influenza B virus. The rRT-PCR assays were also examined using 20 clinical isolates from 20 influenza B virus-positive specimens, revealing that there was no discrepancy between the results from the rRT-PCR assays and the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, with the exception that one clinical isolate with different antigenicity could not be discriminated by the HI test.

Since most of the identified variants are located at non-coding regions, such variants are presumed to affect the expression of neighbouring genes, thereby influencing COVID-19 disease severity. However, it remains largely unknown which genes are influenced by such COVID-19 GWAS loci. METHODS: CRISPRi (interference)-mediated gene expression analysis was performed to identify genes functionally regulated by COVID-19 GWAS loci by targeting regions near the loci (SNPs) in lung epithelial cell lines. The expression of CRISPRi-identified genes was investigated using COVID-19-contracted human and monkey lung single-nucleus/cell (sn/sc) RNA-seq datasets. FINDINGS: CRISPRi analysis indicated that a region near rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 (locus of highest significance with COVID-19 disease severity at intron 5 of LZTFL1) significantly affected the expression of LZTFL1 (P<0.05), an airway cilia regulator. A region near rs74956615 at chromosome 19p13.2 (locus located at the 3 untranslated exonic region of RAVER1), which is associated with critical illness in COVID-19, affected the expression of RAVER1 (P<0.05), a coactivator of MDA5 (IFIH1), which induces antiviral response genes, including ICAM1. The sn/scRNA-seq datasets indicated that the MDA5/RAVER1-ICAM1 pathway was activated in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19-resistant monkeys but not those of COVID-19-succumbed humans. INTERPRETATION: Patients with risk alleles of rs11385942 and rs74956615 may be susceptible to critical illness in COVID-19 in part through weakened airway viral clearance via LZTFL1-mediated ciliogenesis and diminished antiviral immune response via the MDA5/RAVER1 pathway, respectively.

Additionally, GGR holds significant potential risk for social and psychological harms. A considerable amount of research has been conducted with resultant literature and global debate on return of genetic and genomics testing results, but such investigations are limited in the African setting, including Uganda. The objective of the study was to assess perceptions of grassroots communities on if and how feedback of individual genetics and genomics testing results should be carried out in a Ugandan setting. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that employed a qualitative exploratory approach. A total of 42 individuals from grassroots communities representing three major ethnic groupings participated in five deliberative focus group discussions. Data were analysed through content analysis along the main themes of the study. NVivo software (QSR international 2020) was used to support data analysis and illustrative quotes were extracted. Results: Of the 42 respondents 23 (55%) were male with an age range of 18-77 years. Most (70%) were small scale farmers, and the majority were Christians, who were married and had children. They all lived in a rural community in one of the three regions of the country and had no prior participation in GGR. All the respondents were willing to undergo genetics testing and receive feedback of results with the main motivation being diagnostic and therapeutic benefits as well as facilitating future health planning. Content analysis identified three themes and several sub-themes including 1) the need to know ones health status; 2) ethical considerations for feedback of findings and 3) extending feedback of genetics findings to family and community Conclusion: Participation in hypothetical genetics and genomics research as well as feedback of testing results is acceptable to individuals in grassroots communities.

Among various routes of intra-abdominal access, the transvaginal method is most appealing because of its utility and proven safety. We describe a series of 4 colonic resections performed with this approach, combined with minilaparoscopy and needlescopic approaches, and discuss the technical aspects, efficacy, and applicability of this technique. METHODS Three patients were selected to undergo hybrid transvaginal natural-orifice right hemicolectomy. A fourth patient, who underwent a segmental resection of a splenic flexure carcinoma, was included. Transvaginal port access was obtained via posterior colpotomy, and was used for dissection, vascular ligation, bowel division, and anastomosis. We used a combination of standard laparoscopic, minilaparoscopic, and needlescopic instruments transabdominally, focusing on reduced size and number of access points. RESULTS Duration of laparoscopy, oncologic outcomes and rate of operative morbidity were comparable to the published literature. Early return of gastrointestinal function and low analgesic requirements was observed in all patients. No morbidity related to transvaginal access was observed and the procedure was performed without difficulty in all cases. CONCLUSION Colonic resection performed by hybrid natural-orifice technique offers several advantages over purely transabdominal laparoscopic procedures. Transvaginal access is easy to perform and offers excellent safety, efficacy, and versatility, especially for right hemicolectomy.

The current study employed a sample of adolescents (N = 580, M(age) = 16.53) enrolled in GripTape, a 10-week self-driven learning program in which youth pursue topics of their choosing. Cluster analysis classified adolescents based on their personal (e.g., resilience, competence) and ecological (e.g., adult support, safe environments) assets, resulting in two distinguishable groups. A High Asset group scored more favorably on these indicators than a Lower Asset group. Between-cluster comparisons revealed that compared to the Lower Asset group, the High Asset group reported greater levels of motivation for self-driven learning (i.e., intrinsic, extrinsic, and competence demonstration), but not engagement (i.e., positive learning experience, commitment to learning topics and activities).

Many of them chose to settle in Quebec, Canada. Years after the earthquake, many Haitians continue to migrate to the Quebec province. Several studies however have shown that this population's socioeconomic status is lower than the provincial average. Given the potential multiple stressors that affect Haitian migrants in Quebec, there are concerns about their health status. Located at the intersection of international migration studies and global public health, this paper offers an in-depth qualitative investigation of Haitian migrants representations of both their situation and self-perceived health in Montreal, Quebec. Our perspective on migrant health was inspired by the World Health Organisation's framework on the social determinants of health and recent studies in the field of migrant health. We collected and analysed qualitative data from 23 key informants (i.e., 12 women and 11 men, aged 21C76 years old) from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The analysis of the data from these people's narratives revealed the importance of structural determinants such as social position, and intermediate determinants such as living and working conditions. Our analysis also highlighted several interrelations between those determinants. Specifically, participants reported coping with issues related to migration status, income, occupation, language, challenging living and working conditions, and chronic stress. This study also shows that racism and social support each relate to both the structural and intermediate levels of the social determinants of health. The importance of social support brought by relatives, friends, as well as community-based organisations and religious practice, was underscored. Our findings were coherent with available literature looking at the determinants of health of racialized and migrant minorities in other high-income regions of the world. Our conclusive remarks featured reflections on three cross-cutting issues and their practical implications for policy and practices.","output":"What links can be made from narratives of migration and self-perceived health?

In a hospital, airborne infection isolation (AII) room is significant to prevent the spread of the virus to patients and medical personnel. This research aims to improve the design of the HVAC system of AII room used for removing contaminated air by making physical changes through the addition of heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHE). Experiments were conducted with varying fresh air inlet temperature between 30 and 45 C and velocity between 1.5 and 2.5 m/s with three configurations of HPHE to investigate the performance of the HVAC system in the AII room. To ensure the HVAC system with HPHE meets the AII room requirements, this study carried out a smoke test as well as pressure and hourly air volume measurement tests between the exhaust and supply air sides. The results showed that the design of ventilation coupled with HPHE could meet the standards for the AII room. The HPHE succeeded in reducing energy consumption through pre-cooling of fresh air before entering the cooling coil device, with the highest temperature difference of 9.4 C. The highest energy recovery was 767 W at 0.080 m3/s air volume, which can handle 46% of the total HVAC system load at operating conditions and enhance the combined efficiency of the HVAC system. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the HPHE can be coupled in the HVAC system of the hospital AII room that is safe from cross-contamination which significantly reduces the energy consumption.","output":"Utilizing heat pipe heat exchanger to reduce the energy consumption of airborne infection isolation hospital room HVAC system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Many papers considered the exposure risk to COVID-19 of general population and healthcare workers (HW).

The medical interview is still considered the most effective diagnostic tool available to physicians today, despite decades of rapid advancements in medical technology.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted using an Appreciative Inquiry approach, which seeks to uncover strengths from positive experiences. The inquiry sought to identify the elements that comprise the participating physicians most successful patient interviews. Subsequent qualitative analysis revealed eight themes: social support, mutual respect, trust, active listening, relationships, nonverbal cues, empathy, and confidentiality. These themes do not each exist separately or in a vacuum from one another; they are in fact strongly interconnected and equally important. For instance, if a physician and a patient cannot at least maintain mutual respect, then building a relationship, or even trust, is impossible. Given the qualitative nature of this study, future quantitative research should seek to validate the results.

The original neural network algorithm cannot solve the problem of data redundancy in behavior recognition, and the global search ability is weak. Based on the above reasons, this paper proposes an algorithm based on genetic algorithm and neural network to build a prediction model of behavior recognition. Firstly, genetic algorithm is used to cluster the redundant data, so that the data are in fragment order, and then it is used to reduce the data redundancy of different behaviors and weaken the influence of dimension on behavior recognition. Then, the genetic algorithm clusters the data to form subgenetic particles with different dimensions and carries out coevolution and optimal location sharing for subgenetic particles with different dimensions. Through simulation test, the algorithm constructed in this paper is better than genetic algorithm and neural network algorithm in terms of calculation accuracy and convergence speed. Finally, the prediction model is constructed by setting the initial value and threshold to predict the behavior recognition, and the results show that the accuracy of the model constructed in this paper is improved in the analysis of behavior recognition.","output":"A Prediction Model Analysis of Behavior Recognition Based on Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been exponential growth in technology use within the NHS, further accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and video consultations, e-Consults and remote monitoring are now commonplace.

Recognizing this, the Global Initiative for Asthma neither recommends SABA monotherapy nor regards this formulation as a preferred reliever. Many health systems and healthcare professionals (HCPs) experience practical issues in implementing guidelines. Clear quality standards can drive improvements in asthma care and encourage implementation of global and national medical guidelines. METHODS: A steering group of global asthma experts came together between May and September 2019 to develop quality statements codifying the minimum elements of good quality asthma care. These statements were either evidence based (when robust evidence was available) or reflected a consensus based on clinical expertise and experience of the group. RESULTS: The quality statements (and associated essential criteria) developed emphasize key elements concerning (1) objective diagnosis specific to individual symptoms, (2) treatment appropriate to the long-term management of asthma as an inflammatory disease, consistent with evidence-based recommendations, (3) controlled dispensing of SABA canisters and monitoring to prevent overuse, (4) regular review of patients after treatment initiation or change, and (5) follow-up of patients in primary care after treatment for an exacerbation in a hospital or an emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The steering group proposes quality statements that national and local clinical groups can implement as quantitative quality standards that are appropriate to their local circumstances, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. By translating these statements into locally relevant quality standards, primary care physicians and HCPs can encourage optimal management and reduce preventable healthcare interactions. The evidence-based evolution of care encapsulated in these statements will further engender high-quality, patient-centered holistic management that addresses asthma as an inflammatory disease. In particular, the statements empower self-management by patients and encourage health-promoting behaviors, which are essential to reduce exacerbations, the primary goal of asthma management.","output":"Global Quality Statements on Reliever Use in Asthma in Adults and Children Older than 5 Years of Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In long-term induced general anesthesia cases such as those uniquely defined by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic context, the clearance of hypnotic and analgesic drugs from the body follows anomalous diffusion with afferent drug trapping and escape rates in heterogeneous tissues. Evidence exists that drug molecules have a preference to accumulate in slow acting compartments such as muscle and fat mass volumes. Currently used patient dependent pharmacokinetic models do not take into account anomalous diffusion resulted from heterogeneous drug distribution in the body with time varying clearance rates. Objectives This paper proposes a mathematical framework for drug trapping estimation in PK models for estimating optimal drug infusion rates to maintain long-term anesthesia in Covid-19 patients. We also propose a protocol for measuring and calibrating PK models, along with a methodology to minimize blood sample collection. Methods We propose a framework enabling calibration of the models during the follow up of Covid-19 patients undergoing anesthesia during their treatment and recovery period in ICU. The proposed model can be easily updated with incoming information from clinical protocols on blood plasma drug concentration profiles. Already available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models can be then calibrated based on blood plasma concentration measurements. Results The proposed calibration methodology allow to minimize risk for potential over-dosing as clearance rates are updated based on direct measurements from the patient.

During follow-up examinations, we noted many patients with weight regain complaining of fatigue shortly after eating. Thus, we decided to study the glucose tolerance test (GTT) results in a cohort of post-RYGB patients. METHODS A total of 63 RYGB patients, >6 months postoperatively, were studied with a GTT and measurement of insulin levels. The mean age was 48.5  10.8 years, mean preoperative body mass index was 49.0  6.5 kg/m(2), mean percentage of excess body mass index lost was 64.5%  29.0%, mean weight regain at follow-up was 11.6  12.4 lb, and mean follow-up period was 47.9 months. RESULTS Of the 63 patients, 49 had abnormal GTT results. Of the 63 patients, 6 were diabetic; however, only 1 of these patients had an elevated fasting glucose level. All 6 patients were diabetic preoperatively. Of the 63 patients, 43 had evidence of reactive hypoglycemia at 1-2 hours after the glucose load.

CONCLUSION The results of the present study have demonstrated that an abnormal GTT result is a common finding after RYGB. Reactive hypoglycemia was found in 43 of 63 patients, with insulin values that do not support nesidioblastosis.

Open surgery to treat such aneurysms has been shown to be more durable than endovascular techniques, and durability of treatment is particularly important in the pediatric population. Over the past 2 decades, however, a marked shift in aneurysm treatment from open surgery toward endovascular procedures has occurred for adults. The authors describe their early experience in treating 3 unruptured pediatric brain aneurysms using the Pipeline embolization device (PED). The first patient, a girl with Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism Type II who was harboring multiple intracranial aneurysms, underwent two flow diversion procedures for a vertebrobasilar aneurysm and a supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm. The second patient underwent PED placement on a previously coiled but enlarging posterior communicating artery aneurysm. All procedures were uneventful, with no postsurgical complications, and led to complete angiographic obliteration of the aneurysms. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first series of flow diversion procedures in children reported in the medical literature. While flow diversion is a new and relatively untested technology in children, outcomes in adults have been promising. For challenging lesions in the pediatric population, flow diversion may have a valuable role as a well-tolerated, safe treatment with durable results.

However, the advantage of sequential processing policy is decreasing with the increasing of shuttle number, transaction arrival rate and depth/width ratio.

Therefore, it can be inferred that cardio-cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increase in the risk of severe illness and death among COVID-19 patients. This meta-analysis showed that cardio-cerebrovascular disease has a significant relation with severe and death outcomes of COVID-19.

From the perspective of the dairy industry, they are the basis for the manufacture of butter and essential ingredients in the production of cheese, yogurt, and specialty dairy produce. To provide mechanistic insight into the assembly and secretion of lipid droplets during lactation, we developed novel intravital imaging techniques using transgenic mice, which express fluorescently tagged marker proteins. The number 4 mammary glands were surgically prepared under a deep plane of anesthesia and the exposed glands positioned as a skin flap with intact vascular supply on the stage of a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Lipid droplets were stained by prior exposure of the glands to hydrophobic fluorescent BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) dyes and their formation and secretion monitored by time-lapse subcellular microscopy over periods of 1 to 2 h. Droplets were transported to the cell apex by directed (superdiffusive) motion at relatively slow and intermittent rates (0C2 m/min). Regardless of size, droplets grew by numerous fusion events during transport and as they were budding from the cell enveloped by apical membranes. Surprisingly, droplet secretion was not constitutive but required an injection of oxytocin to induce contraction of the myoepithelium with subsequent release of droplets into luminal spaces. These novel results are discussed in the context of the current paradigm for milk fat synthesis and secretion and as a template for future innovations in the dairy industry.","output":"Symposium review: Intravital imaging of the lactating mammary gland in live mice reveals novel aspects of milk-lipid secretion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the liver and the possibility of chronic liver disease (CLD) as a risk factor for COVID-19 severity is not fully understood. Our goal was to describe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 inpatients regarding the presence of abnormal liver tests and CLD. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized in a tertiary center in Portugal, was performed. Studied outcomes were disease and hospitalization length, COVID-19 severity, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, analyzed by the presence of abnormal liver tests and CLD. Results: We included 317 inpatients with a mean age of 70.4 years, 50.5% males. COVID-19 severity was moderate to severe in 57.4% and critical in 12.9%. The mean disease length was 37.8 days, the median hospitalization duration 10.0 days and overall mortality 22.8%. At admission, 50.3% showed abnormal liver tests, and 41.5% showed elevated aminotransferase levels, from which 75.4% were mild. Elevated aminotransferase levels at admission were associated with COVID-19 severity (78.7 vs. 63.3%, p = 0.01), ICU admission (13.1 vs. 5.92%, p = 0.034) and increased mortality (25.8 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.007). However, in a subgroup analysis, only aspartate transaminase (AST) was associated with these worse outcomes. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 11.4% of the patients and was associated with critical COVID-19 (21.1 vs. 9.92%, p = 0.044) and mortality (20.4 vs. 9.52%, p = 0.025), while 24.6% of the patients showed elevated -glutamyl transferase, which was associated with ICU admission (42.3 vs. 22.8%, p = 0.028). Fourteen patients had baseline CLD (4.42%), 3 with liver cirrhosis. Alcohol (n = 6) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 6) were the most frequent etiologies. CLD patients had critical COVID-19 in 21.4% (p = 0.237), mean disease length of 36.6 days (p = 0.291), median hospitalization duration of 11.5 days (p = 0.447) and a mortality rate of 28.6% (p = 0.595), which increased to 66.7% among cirrhotic patients (p = 0.176). Conclusions: Liver test abnormalities in COVID-19 patients were frequent but most commonly mild. AST, but not alanine transaminase, was associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as COVID-19 severity and mortality, probably indicating these outcomes were independent of liver injury. A low prevalence of CLD was seen, and a clear impact on COVID-19 outcomes was not seen.","output":"Impact of Liver Test Abnormalities and Chronic Liver Disease on the Clinical Outcomes of Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused the world economy to experience a sharp recession of 4.4% to 5.2%. The labor market is one affected sector marked with a high rate of layoffs. One of the governments efforts to overcome this phenomenon is by adopting a job loss insurance scheme. This research discusses the background of the job loss insurance regulation and system in Indonesia and how job loss insurance could overcome the impact of layoffs due to economic recession. The method used in this research is normative juridical legal research. In analyzing legal materials, this research uses qualitative descriptive analysis. Job loss insurance is an assurance provided to those who were affected. When workers experience layoffs, they will receive benefits of cash, access to market information, and job training. It was found that a job loss insurance scheme could accelerate former workers to find permanent employment and prevent them from losing their motivation to seek a job. Studies on the implementation of job loss insurance in other countries show that the job loss insurance scheme effectively reduces unemployment numbers, especially during the time of economic recession. As a suggestion from this research, the job loss insurance needs to be socialized, and the job training needs to be adjusted to market demand to fully benefit the workers. Pandemi COVID-19 menyebabkan pertumbuhan perekonomian dunia mengalami resesi tajam yaitu kisaran 4,4%-5,2%.

Outcomes of such policies depend on a complex combination of local epidemic conditions and demographic features as well as the intensity and timing of such policies and are therefore unclear. OBJECTIVE: To use a decision analytical model of the COVID-19 epidemic to investigate potential outcomes if actual policies enacted in March 2020 (during the first wave of the epidemic) in the St Louis region of Missouri had been delayed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A previously developed, publicly available, open-source modeling platform (Local Epidemic Modeling for Management & Action, version 2.1) designed to enable localized COVID-19 epidemic projections was used. The compartmental epidemic model is programmed in R and Stan, uses bayesian inference, and accepts user-supplied demographic, epidemiologic, and policy inputs. Hospital census data for 1.3 million people from St Louis City and County from March 14, 2020, through July 15, 2020, were used to calibrate the model. EXPOSURES: Hypothetical delays in actual social distancing policies (which began on March 13, 2020) by 1, 2, or 4 weeks. Sensitivity analyses were conducted that explored plausible spontaneous behavior change in the absence of social distancing policies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalizations and deaths. RESULTS: A model of 1.3 million residents of the greater St Louis, Missouri, area found an initial reproductive number (indicating transmissibility of an infectious agent) of 3.9 (95% credible interval [CrI], 3.1-4.5) in the St Louis region before March 15, 2020, which fell to 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.88-0.98) after social distancing policies were implemented between March 15 and March 21, 2020. By June 15, a 1-week delay in policies would have increased cumulative hospitalizations from an observed actual number of 2246 hospitalizations to 8005 hospitalizations (75% CrI: 3973-15 236 hospitalizations) and increased deaths from an observed actual number of 482 deaths to a projected 1304 deaths (75% CrI, 656-2428 deaths). By June 15, a 2-week delay would have yielded 3292 deaths (75% CrI, 2104-4905 deaths)an additional 2810 deaths or a 583% increase beyond what was actually observed. Sensitivity analyses incorporating a range of spontaneous behavior changes did not avert severe epidemic projections. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this decision analytical model study suggest that, in the St Louis region, timely social distancing policies were associated with improved population health outcomes, and small delays may likely have led to a COVID-19 epidemic similar to the most heavily affected areas in the US. These findings indicate that an open-source modeling platform designed to accept user-supplied local and regional data may provide projections tailored to, and more relevant for, local settings.","output":"Outcomes Associated With Social Distancing Policies in St Louis, Missouri, During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review seeks to clarify the factors involved in the various immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanisms that influence the development of COVID-19 with severe evolution.

Like the human gammaherpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) establishes and maintains latency in the memory B cells during infection of laboratory mice. We have previously shown that MHV68 can immortalize fetal liver-derived B cells that induce lymphomas when injected into immunodeficient mice. Here we identify interleukin 16 (IL16) as a most abundantly expressed cytokine in MHV68-immortalized B cells and show that MHV68 infection elevates IL16 expression. IL16 is not important for MHV68 lytic infection but plays a critical role in MHV68 reactivation from latency. IL16 deficiency increases MHV68 lytic gene expression in MHV68-immortalized B cells and enhances reactivation from splenic latency. Correlatively, IL16 deficiency increases the frequency of MHV68-infected plasma cells that can be attributed to enhanced MHV68 reactivation. Furthermore, similar to TPA-mediated lytic replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, IL16 deficiency markedly induces Tyr705 STAT3 de-phosphorylation and elevates p21 expression, which can be counteracted by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate. Importantly, orthovanadate strongly blocks MHV68 lytic gene expression mediated by IL16 deficiency. These data demonstrate that virus-induced IL16 does not directly participate in MHV68 lytic replication, but rather inhibits virus reactivation to facilitate latent infection, in part through the STAT3-p21 axis.","output":"Interleukin 16 contributes to gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis by inhibiting viral reactivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The iLabs platform - a low cost, highly scalable way to provide online learning for remote and virtual laboratory experiments is introduced into a classroom setting for the first time.

In recent years, it has become evident that domestic poultry play an important role in the generation of novel influenza strains with the capacity to cross the species barrier and infect and kill humans at an alarming rate. There is particular concern that avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype could cause a pandemic. METHODS A better understanding of the genetic factors that lead to interspecies transmission is essential to prevent the emergence of influenza pandemics. In addition, the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and development of vaccines against potentially pandemic viruses must be considered under the umbrella of pandemic plans. RESULTS The world is ill-prepared to face an influenza pandemic. Only a handful of countries have developed influenza pandemic plans, and even fewer are developing vaccines or stockpiling antiinfluenza drugs to ameliorate the impact of a potential pandemic. Currently the major undertaking in several at risk nations is to implement effective control measures to stop the spread of the virus at its source, that is, avian species. These measures include the culling of domestic poultry to contain the virus, a practice that could eventually bring these countries to a financial and social breaking point. CONCLUSIONS Avian influenza disease is preventable in humans and birds with the concerted effort of governments and poultry producers, large and small, to improve biosecurity and education programs.

METHODS: A rapid point-of-care test for specific IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 was offered to all workers (SD Biosensor STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Duo and STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Combo). Testing was performed and a questionnaire was completed by 4592 workers on a voluntary basis from 21 May to 31 July 2020. We computed the apparent IgM, IgG, and combined IgM or IgG prevalence, along with the true prevalence and 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) using Bayesian inference. RESULTS: We found an apparent prevalence of 3.1% for IgM, 1.0% for IgG and 3.9% for either. The estimated true prevalence was 2.0% (95% CrI 0.1% to 4.3%) for IgM, 0.6% (95% CrI 0.0% to 1.3%) for IgG, and 2.5% (95% CrI 0.1% to 5.3%) for IgM or IgG. A SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis was reported by 21 (0.5%) workers; and of these, 90.5% had a reactive IgG result. Seroprevalence was higher among those reporting contacts with confirmed cases, having been quarantined, having a previous molecular negative test or having had symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence among workers from the three public higher education institutions of Porto after the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to national estimates for the same age working population. However, the estimated true seroprevalence was approximately five times higher than the reported SARS-CoV-2 infection based on a molecular test.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among workers of the public higher education institutions of Porto, Portugal: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The provision of appropriate nutritional care in care homes is a priority for health services in England. There is limited evidence demonstrating the role of dietitians within older people care homes. This study explores the experiences of dietitians working with care homes for older people in England. METHODS: A qualitative study using semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews was conducted. Criterion and snowball purposive sampling recruited six dietitian participants. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. A reflexive diary was completed, and data analyses followed interpretative phenomenological analyses. Constant comparison, code-recode audits, independent coding by a supervisor, supervisory support and peer review were used to promote rigour. RESULTS: Two key themes and three subthemes were identified: Theme 1 is collaboration with multidisciplinary team (MDT) professionals and its two subthemes are as follows: using support strategies (pathway/standards implementation, training/education and resident dietetic assessment) and delivering value (by benefitting more residents, demonstrating unique dietetic skills, nutritional prescription savings and meeting other professional's knowledge gap). Theme 2 is communication with MDT professionals and its subtheme is the understanding of the dietitian's role and of nutritional care. CONCLUSION: Dietitians believe that they play a key role in supporting care homes with nutritional care, identifying themselves as experts and leaders, working with MDT professionals. The findings highlight the importance of a consistent approach to managing nutrition and the need for dietitians to share outcome data to improve the limited evidence-base.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity induced by PARP inhibitor olaparib in FLCN deficient RCC cells, and the interaction between FLCN and BRCA1 A complex-regulated DNA repair pathway. METHODS AND MATERIALS: FLCN expressing (ACHN and UOK257-F) and FLCN deficient (ACHN-2 and UOK257) cell lines were used in this research. Cell viability was detected by clonogenic assay and MTT assay. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to detect apoptosis. Autophagy in cells was measured by MDC assay, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and western blot experiments were performed to determine the interaction between FLCN protein and BRCA1 A complex. The in vivo experiments were performed in a xenograft model by inoculating UOK 257 in nude mice. RESULTS: RCC cells with FLCN protein deficiency were more sensitive to olaparib treatment than the cells with FLCN expression. Olaparib treatment led to more severe autophagy and apoptosis in FLCN deficient ACHN-2 and UOK257 cells compared to the FLCN expressing ACHN and UOK257-F cells. Decreased BRCA1 A complex expression and disruption of DNA repair ability were detected in FLCN-deficient cells, suggesting that FLCN deficiency impaired BRCA1 A complex expression and sensitized cells to PARP inhibitor olaparib. CONCLUSIONS: RCC cells deficient in FLCN are sensitive to olaparib treatment due to the impairment of BRCA1 A complex associated DNA repair ability. The results suggest that PARP inhibitor, such as olaparib, may be a potentially effective therapeutic approach for kidney tumors with deficiency of FLCN protein.","output":"Folliculin deficient renal cancer cells exhibit BRCA1 A complex expression impairment and sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor olaparib"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior studies have revealed that community identity promotes participation.

But they did not compare their results to each other so much either computationally or experimentally. In this study, an attempt was made to propose a set of molecular biomarkers that might be more effective for BC diagnosis, prognosis and therapies, by using the integrated bioinformatics and statistical approaches. At first, we identified 190 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BC and control samples by using the statistical LIMMA approach. Then we identified 13 DEGs (AKR1C1, IRF9, OAS1, OAS3, SLCO2A1, NT5E, NQO1, ANGPT1, FN1, ATF6B, HPGD, BCL11A, and TP53INP1) as the key genes (KGs) by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Then we investigated the pathogenetic processes of DEGs highlighting KGs by GO terms and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Moreover, we disclosed the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory factors of KGs by their interaction network analysis with the transcription factors (TFs) and micro-RNAs. Both supervised and unsupervised learnings including multivariate survival analysis results confirmed the strong prognostic power of the proposed KGs.

METHODS We examined Nielsen Retail Scanner data from September 2013 to March 2020. Inflation-adjusted sales dollars for e-liquid-containing products were classified into five flavour categories (fruit, menthol, mint, tobacco and other). RESULTS Following the Juul Labs 2019 and FDA 2020 actions, total e-cigarette sales declined; however, menthol-flavoured e-cigarette sales dollars increased, while mint-flavoured e-cigarette sales dollars decreased in both instances. Juul Labs' removal of mint-flavoured products was followed by a 59.4% increase in the market share of menthol-flavoured e-cigarettes over 4 weeks. The FDA's 2020 guidance was followed by a 54.5% increase in the market share of menthol-flavoured e-cigarettes over 4 weeks and a 82.8% increase over 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Juul Labs' self-regulation and the current FDA flavour guidance were followed by a shift towards menthol-flavoured e-cigarettes.

The decrease in economic activity in order to prevent further spread of the disease affected all economic sectors, resulting in the unprecedented loss of jobs and the weakening of the informal economy. The Emergency Aid (EA) was created with the purpose of guaranteeing a subsistence income, minimizing the economic problems brought about by the pandemic. The aim of this paper is to analyze the direct and indirect impacts of the EA income transfers on the economy of Brazilian states. Of particular interest is to assess the distribution of indirect impacts as there may be spillovers of income between regions because of inter-sector relations and production chains. Thus, given the differences in production structures, the accounting of indirect impacts can result in a structure of regional distribution of benefits that is quite different from the initial one. The aim of this study is to assess which regions are relatively more benefited by comparing the initial structure of the distribution of the EA benefits with the final structure, after accounting for the spillovers. To do so, an interregional input-output model developed by Haddad et al.

SAUD is notably characterized by an overactivation of the reflexive/reward system when confronted with alcohol-related cues. Such overreactivity generates a preferential allocation of attentional resources toward these cues, labeled as attentional biases (AB). Theoretical assumptions have been made regarding the characteristics of AB and their underlying processes. While often considered as granted, these assumptions remain to be experimentally validated. AIMS We first identify the theoretical assumptions made by previous studies exploring the nature and role of AB. We then discuss the current evidence available to establish their validity. We finally propose research avenues to experimentally test them. METHODS Capitalizing on a narrative review of studies exploring AB in SAUD, the current limits of the behavioral measures used for their evaluation are highlighted as well as the benefits derived from the use of eye-tracking measures to obtain a deeper understanding of their underlying processes. We describe the issues related to the theoretical proposals on AB and propose research avenues to test them. Four experimental axes are proposed, respectively, related to the determination of (a) the genuine nature of the mechanisms underlying AB; (b) their stability over the disease course; (c) their specificity to alcohol-related stimuli and (d) their reflexive or controlled nature. CONCLUSIONS This in-depth exploration of the available knowledge related to AB in SAUD, and of its key limitations, highlights the theoretical and clinical interest of our innovative experimental perspectives capitalizing on eye-tracking measures.","output":"Understanding Attentional Biases in Severe Alcohol Use Disorder: A Combined Behavioral and Eye-Tracking Perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leukotrienes are important pro-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from the arachidonic acid metabolism. In particular, cysteinyl leukotrienes, namely LTC(4), LTD(4), and LTE(4) are involved in many of the principal features of asthma, while more recently they have also been implicated in cardiovascular diseases. COVID-19 is characterized by an overwhelming state of inflammation, sometimes resulting in an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, severe COVID-19 patients present an endothelial cell damage characterized by a hyperinflammatory/procoagulant state and a widespread thrombotic disease. Leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast, have long been proven to have an efficacy in asthma, while more recently they have been suggested to have a protective role also in cardiovascular diseases. As elevated levels of LTE(4) have been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19 patients, and montelukast, in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested to have a protective role in cardiovascular diseases, we decided to investigate whether this drug could also affect the platelet activation characteristic of COVID-19 syndrome. In this contribution, we demonstrate that montelukast inhibits platelet activation induced by plasma from COVID-19 patients by preventing the surface expression of tissue factor (TF) and P-selectin, reducing the formation of circulating monocyteC and granulocyteCplatelet aggregates, and, finally, in completely inhibiting the release of TF(pos)-circulating microvesicles.

A commonality among prior efforts is the use of continuum mechanics approximations to evaluate this solid mechanics problem. Here we use 3D spherical shell models to demonstrate a self-organized fracture mechanism analogous to thermal expansion-driven lithospheric uplift, in which globe-spanning rifting occurs as a consequence of horizontal extension. Resultant fracture spacing is a function of lithospheric thickness and rheology, wherein geometrically-regular, polygonal-shaped tessellation is an energetically favored solution because it minimizes total crack length. Therefore, warming of the early lithosphere itself-as anticipated by previous studies-should lead to failure, propagating fractures, and the conditions necessary for the onset of multi-plate tectonics.","output":"Breaking Earth's shell into a global plate network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 is highly transmissible; however, its severity varies from one individual to another.

METHODS: We assessed the association of blood cell counts and indices with incident SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in UK Biobank and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Synthetic Derivative (VUMC SD). Since genetically determined blood cell measures better represent cell abundance across the lifecourse, we used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to assess the shared genetic architecture of baseline blood cell counts and indices on COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: We observed inconsistent associations between measured blood cell indices and both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization in UK Biobank and VUMC SD. In Mendelian randomization analyses using genetic summary statistics, no putative causal relationships were identified between COVID-19 related outcomes and hematological indices after adjusting for multiple testing. We observed overlapping genetic association signals between hematological parameters and COVID-19 traits. For example, we observed overlap between infection susceptibility-associated variants at PPP1R15A and red blood cell parameters, and between disease severity-associated variants at TYK2 and lymphocyte and platelet phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find convincing evidence of a relationship between baseline hematological parameters and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity, though this relationship should be re-examined as larger and better-powered genetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 become available.","output":"Genetic Examination of Hematological Parameters in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (AE-ILD) represent an acute, frequent and often highly morbid event in the disease course of ILD patients.

In this study, Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was carried out to generate complete genomes of PPRV from archived PPRV-positive samples collected from PPR outbreaks in goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in Tanzania during 2016 and 2018, respectively. Complete genomes of PPRV of 15,948 nucleotides long were generated within four hours of sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes revealed a high nucleotide identity (96.19C99.24%) with lineage III PPR viruses currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin. The Oxford nanopore MinION sequencer can be deployed to overcome diagnostic and surveillance challenges in developing countries in the PPR Global Control and Eradication program. However, the coverage depth was uneven across the genome and amplicon dropout was observed between the matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes. Thus, larger field studies are needed to allow the collection of sufficient data to assess the robustness of nanopore sequencing technology. ABSTRACT: Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease of sheep and goats that threatens food security, small ruminant production and susceptible endangered wild ruminants. With policy directed towards achieving global PPR eradication, the establishment of cost-effective genomic surveillance tools is critical where PPR is endemic. Genomic data can provide sufficient in-depth information to identify the pockets of endemicity responsible for PPRV persistence and viral evolution, and direct an appropriate vaccination response. Yet, access to the required sequencing technology is low in resource-limited settings and is compounded by the difficulty of transporting clinical samples from wildlife across international borders due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora, and Nagoya Protocol regulations. Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing technology has recently demonstrated an extraordinary performance in the sequencing of PPRV due to its rapidity, utility in endemic countries and comparatively low cost per sample when compared to other whole-genome (WGS) sequencing platforms. In the present study, Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was utilised to generate complete genomes of PPRV isolates collected from infected goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in the northern and southern highlands of Tanzania during 2016 and 2018, respectively. The tiling multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with twenty-five pairs of long-read primers. The resulting PCR amplicons were used for nanopore library preparation and sequencing. The analysis of output data was complete genomes of PPRV, produced within four hours of sequencing (accession numbers: MW960272 and MZ322753). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes revealed a high nucleotide identity, between 96.19 and 99.24% with lineage III PPRV currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin. The Oxford nanopore MinION sequencer can be deployed to overcome diagnostic and surveillance challenges in the PPR Global Control and Eradication program. However, the coverage depth was uneven across the genome and amplicon dropout was observed mainly in the GC-rich region between the matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes of PPRV. Thus, larger field studies are needed to allow the collection of sufficient data to assess the robustness of nanopore sequencing technology.","output":"Complete Genome Sequencing of Field Isolates of Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus from Tanzania Revealed a High Nucleotide Identity with Lineage III PPR Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Das Mnchhausen-Syndrom geh?rt zu den klinischen Erscheinungsformen der selbstverletzenden Verhaltensweisen und weist damit eine psychopathologische N?he zur offenen Autoaggression und -mutilation sowie zur bewusstseinsnahen knstlichen Erzeugung von Krankheitssymptomen (?factitious disease) auf.

Common practice includes administering neuromuscular blockade [paralytic medication] when proning this population, despite equivocal data regarding benefits of routine paralysis in ARDS. During the COVID19 pandemic, drug shortages and other factors have driven clinicians to prone patients without therapeutic paralysis. Recent publications also suggest prone positioning may be beneficial for non-intubated (non-paralyzed patients). We hypothesized that intubated patients with COVID19-related ARDS can be safely proned without therapeutic paralysis and would experience similar improvement in gas exchange (as evidenced by improved PF [Pa02/Fi02] and SF [Sp02/Fi02] ratios). Methods: Observational data on ICU patients were collected at a large tertiary university hospital from March to September 2020. Clinical teams directed use of sedatives, paralytics, mechanical ventilation settings, and timing of prone vs. supine positioning and blood draws. Comparison of demographics, gas exchange in supine and prone positions (within the same subjects), as well as oxygen requirements, ventilator settings, adverse events and hemodynamic parameters were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Among our cohort of 156 patients, a total of 15 patients were identified that changed from supine to prone position with and without the use of paralytics while in the ICU. All 15 patients had moderate to severe ARDS per the Berlin Criteria, secondary to COVID19. PF and SF ratios were compared in the same patient before and after proning with and without paralytics (within subject comparisons). All groups had an improvement in both average PF ratio (34.7% with and 24.0% without paralysis, p=0.52) and average SF ratio (5.2% with and 6.1% without paralysis, p=0.92) after proning (Figure 1). There were no serious adverse events associated with prone positioning with or without paralytics. Conclusions: When proning patients with COVID19 ARDS, we found no statistically significant difference to support routine use of paralytics when proning. Safety and efficacy were similar when COVID19 patients were being proned with or without neuromuscular blockade. Use of paralytic medication should be an individualized decision rather than given routinely. Larger randomized controlled trials comparing proning with or without paralysis are needed to identify the optimal approach in this population.","output":"The influence of paralytics on the safety and efficacy of prone positioning in COVID19 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a major global health threat.

We identified seven compounds not previously reported to have activity against SARS-CoV-2, including B02, a human RAD51 inhibitor. We further demonstrated that B02 exhibits synergy with remdesivir, the only antiviral approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, highlighting the potential for combination therapy.

The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far claimed more than 0.38 million lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus displays high transmission rates, the underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries, suggesting that its spread is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13), nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16 (ORF1b polyproteins) and in the S-protein within 10 viral isolates from the United States. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication and binding with the human receptors, indicating that the viral variants that are circulating in the population of the United States are different from those circulating in the populations of other countries. In addition, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of a U.S. isolate (GenBank accession no. MT188341.1) leading to a shift in the amino acid frame from position 2540 onward. Through comparative structural analysis of the wild-type and mutant proteins, we showed that this addition of a phenylalanine residue renders the protein in the mutant less stable, which might affect mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase function. We further analyzed the SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, which revealed that the interferon signaling pathway is targeted by orf1ab during infection and that it also interacts with NF-&#954;B-repressing factor (NKRF), which is a potential regulator of interleukin-8 (IL-8). We propose that targeting this interaction may subsequently improve the health condition of COVID-19 patients. Our analysis also emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates spliceosome machinery during infection; hence, targeting splicing might affect viral replication. In conclusion, the replicative machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is targeting interferon and the notch signaling pathway along with spliceosome machinery to evade host challenges.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic continues to storm the world, with over 6.5 million cases worldwide. The severity of the disease varies with the territories and is mainly influenced by population density and age factor. In this study, we analyzed the transmission pattern of 95 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 11 different countries. Our study also revealed several nonsynonymous mutations in ORF1b and S-proteins and the impact on their structural stability.

Rhabdomyolysis is caused by exertion, prolonged immobilization, medications, seizures, and viral infections such as influenza, leading to acute renal failure. We present a two-patient case series which describes rhabdomyolysis in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: The first case is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented with dyspnea after 6 days of subjective fevers and dry cough. Patient was intubated for hypoxia, and nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). On Hospital Day 9, he was extubated but noted to have increased creatine kinase (CK) to a peak of 12391 U/L with a concurrent rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and total bilirubin. Urinalysis was consistent with myoglobinuria. Creatinine remained below twice his baseline, and he did not require renal replacement therapy. CK and LDH downtrended with intravenous sodium bicarbonate and fluids, and hypoxia improved prior to discharge. The second case is a 59-year-old male with a history of Stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and prior intubation for influenza B. He presented with two weeks of generalized body aches and was intubated for hypoxia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by RT-PCR, before progressing to renal failure requiring hemodialysis. He was extubated on Day 16 and dialysis catheter was removed on Day 17. CK rose to a peak of 4617 U/L on Day 20 with a concurrent rise in LDH. Urinalysis showed trace protein, large blood with 4-5 red blood cells per high-powered field. Simvastatin was discontinued after CK elevation, which resolved with fluid resuscitation. DISCUSSION: These cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with late-onset rhabdomyolysis. SARS-CoV-2 may increase the incidence of rhabdomyolysis via a combination of prolonged immobilization and cytokine activation. SARS-CoV-2 may also increase the frequency of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 warrant screening for rhabdomyolysis, as early intervention likely prevented the first patient from progressing to renal failure. CONCLUSION(S): Clinicians should have an elevated suspicion for delayed rhabdomyolysis in SARS-CoV-2 patients. This suggested association warrants further investigation to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 independently contributes to the incidence of rhabdomyolysis.

Lead exposure is a serious hazard that can affect the cognitive and behavior development. People can be exposed to Pb through occupational and environmental sources. Fingerprinting based on stable Pb isotopes in environmental media is often used to trace natural and anthropogenic sources but is rarely paired with blood data. The objective of this study was to determine the main factors associated with high Blood Lead Levels (BLL). Soil, manioc tubers, food bowls, beverages, wild games, lead pellets and children blood were sampled in small villages along the Oyapock River. children BLL ranged between 5.7 and 35 g dL-1, all exceeding 5 g dL-1, the reference value proposed in epidemiologic studies for lead poisoning. Among the different dietary sources, manioc tubers and large game contained elevated Pb concentrations while manioc-based dishes were diluted. The isotopes ratios (207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb) of children blood overlapped these of lead shots and meals. These first results confirm for the first time, the diary consumption of manioc-based food as the main contributor to Amerindian children's BLL in French Guiana, but don't exclude the occasional exposure to lead bullets by hunting activities. This is a specific health concern, since previous studies have shown that these same villagers present high levels of mercury (Hg). These communities are indeed subject to a double exposure to neurotoxic metals, Hg and Pb, both through their diet.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence density of reinfection among a cohort of HCWs and estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virion vaccine BBV152 against reinfection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study among HCWs working at a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with 0, 1, or 2 doses of BBV152. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The HCWs were categorized as fully vaccinated (with 2 doses and 15 days after the second dose), partially vaccinated (with 1 dose or 2 doses with <15 days after the second dose), or unvaccinated. The incidence density of COVID-19 reinfection per 100 person-years was computed, and events from March 3, 2020, to June 18, 2021, were included for analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated vaccine effectiveness (1 ? adjusted HR) was reported. RESULTS: Among 15 244 HCWs who participated in the study, 4978 (32.7%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 36.6 (10.3) years, and 55.0% were male. The reinfection incidence density was 7.26 (95% CI: 6.09-8.66) per 100 person-years (124 HCWs [2.5%], total person follow-up period of 1696 person-years as time at risk). Fully vaccinated HCWs had lower risk of reinfection (HR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.08-0.23]), symptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.24]), and asymptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.05-0.53]) compared with unvaccinated HCWs. Accordingly, among the 3 vaccine categories, reinfection was observed in 60 of 472 (12.7%) of unvaccinated (incidence density, 18.05 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 14.02-23.25), 39 of 356 (11.0%) of partially vaccinated (incidence density 15.62 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 11.42-21.38), and 17 of 1089 (1.6%) fully vaccinated (incidence density 2.18 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.35-3.51) HCWs. The estimated effectiveness of BBV152 against reinfection was 86% (95% CI, 77%-92%); symptomatic reinfection, 87% (95% CI, 76%-93%); and asymptomatic reinfection, 84% (95% CI, 47%-95%) among fully vaccinated HCWs. Partial vaccination was not associated with reduced risk of reinfection.

The lack of highly efficacious antiviral drugs that can manage this ongoing global emergency gives urgency to establishing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We characterized the role of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating antiviral immunity. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 N resulted in the attenuation of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor-mediated interferon (IFN) production and IFN-induced gene expression. Similar to the SARS-CoV-1 N protein, SARS-CoV-2 N suppressed the interaction between tripartate motif protein 25 (TRIM25) and RIG-I. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 N inhibited polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]-mediated IFN signaling at the level of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interfered with the association between TBK1 and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), subsequently preventing the nuclear translocation of IRF3. We further found that both type I and III IFN production induced by either the influenza virus lacking the nonstructural protein 1 or the Zika virus were suppressed by the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Our findings provide insights into the molecular function of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein with respect to counteracting the host antiviral immune response.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Targets RIG-I-Like Receptor Pathways to Inhibit the Induction of Interferon Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a public health emergency and the case fatality rate in the United Kingdom is significant. Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN). METHODS: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems.","output":"Prognostic Modeling of COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence in the United Kingdom: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted healthcare provision in the UK and burns services have had to adapt to ensure the continuity of a safe care. As we return to normality we reflect on lessons learnt from our response to this pandemic. A service evaluation was performed from patient notes between March 23rd and May 8th 2020 and an anonymous survey given to patients attending outpatient appointments. 258 patients were referred to our burns service and 148 patients completed the survey. Eleven burns were caused by treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Patients delayed seeking medical attention due to concern of catching COVID-19 (36% adults, 8% children). There was a delay in referral of 17 patients despite them fulfilling the referral criteria. Infection rates were higher following delayed presentation (21% vs 6%). The majority of burns were managed conservatively (237/258). Dressing changes were performed at home by 32% of patients. The outreach team treated 22 patients. During the pandemic telemedicine has improved the efficiency of outpatient burn care and outreach nurses have enabled treatment of vulnerable patients.

Students and trainees, including those in autism research, face unique challenges to accomplishing their training and career goals during this unprecedented time. In this commentary, we, as members of the International Society for Autism Research Student and Trainee Committee, describe our personal experiences, which may or may not align with those of other students and trainees. Our experiences have varied both in terms of the ease (or lack thereof) with which we adapted and the degree to which we were supported in the transition to online research and clinical practice. We faced and continue to adjust to uncertainties about future training and academic positions, for which opportunities have been in decline and have subsequently negatively impacted our mental health. Students and trainees' prospects have been particularly impacted compared to more established researchers and faculty. In addition to the challenges we have faced, however, there have also been unexpected benefits in our training during the pandemic, which we describe here. We have learned new coping strategies which, we believe, have served us well. The overarching goal of this commentary is to describe these experiences and strategies in the hope that they will benefit the autism research community moving forward. Here, we provide a set of recommendations for faculty, especially mentors, to support students and trainees as well as strategies for students and trainees to bolster their self-advocacy, both of which we see as crucial for our future careers. LAY SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected students and trainees, including those in autism research, in different ways. Here, we describe our personal experiences. These experiences include challenges. For example, it has been difficult to move from in-person to online work. It has also been difficult to keep up with work and training goals. Moreover, working from home has made it hard to connect with our supervisors and mentors. As a result, many of us have felt unsure about how to make the best career choices. Working in clinical services and getting to know and support our patients online has also been challenging. Overall, the pandemic has made us feel more isolated and some of us have struggled to cope with that. On the other hand, our experiences have also included benefits. For example, by working online, we have been able to join meetings all over the world. Also, the pandemic has pushed us to learn new skills. Those include technical skills but also skills for well-being. Next, we describe our experiences of returning to work. Finally, we give recommendations for trainees and supervisors on how to support each other and to build a strong community.","output":"Experiences of student and trainee autism researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides empirical evidence on the reorganization of GVCs in East Asia, highlighting that structural trends explain a decrease in the fragmentation of production after 2011 but that it is not the result of rising trade costs along the value chain. Using harmonized inter-country input-output tables, the paper first analyzes the global import intensity of production to document changes in the structure of GVCs. It then calculates theory-consistent bilateral trade costs for intermediate and final products using an approach derived from the gravity literature and introduces a new index of cumulative trade costs along the value chain. These data are used to discuss whether the decrease in global imports is the consequence of shifts in demand, efficiency-enhancing strategies of firms or rising trade costs. Between 2011 and 2016, cumulative trade costs have decreased in East Asian GVCs. However, as COVID-19 is likely to intensify trade and investment uncertainties, trade costs could increase in the future.

However, a considerable group of patients does not respond to statin treatment, and the reason for this is still not completely understood. [(18)F]Atorvastatin, the (18)F-labeled version of one of the most widely prescribed statins, may be a useful tool for statin-related research. RESULTS: [(18)F]Atorvastatin was synthesized via an optimized ruthenium-mediated late-stage (18)F-deoxyfluorination. The defluoro-hydroxy precursor was produced via Paal-Knorr pyrrole synthesis and was followed by coordination of the phenol to a ruthenium complex, affording the labeling precursor in approximately 10% overall yield. Optimization and automation of the labeling procedure reliably yielded an injectable solution of [(18)F]atorvastatin in 19%  6% (d.c.) with a molar activity of 65  32 GBqmol(?1). Incubation of [(18)F]atorvastatin in human serum did not lead to decomposition. Furthermore, we have shown the ability of [(18)F]atorvastatin to cross the hepatic cell membrane to the cytosolic and microsomal fractions where HMG-CoA reductase is known to be highly expressed. Blocking assays using rat liver sections confirmed the specific binding to HMG-CoA reductase. Autoradiography on rat aorta stimulated to develop atherosclerotic plaques revealed that [(18)F]atorvastatin significantly accumulates in this tissue when compared to the healthy model. CONCLUSIONS: The improved ruthenium-mediated (18)F-deoxyfluorination procedure overcomes previous hurdles such as the addition of salt additives, the drying steps, or the use of different solvent mixtures at different phases of the process, which increases its practical use, and may allow faster translation to clinical settings. Based on tissue uptake evaluations, [(18)F]atorvastatin showed the potential to be used as a tool for the understanding of the mechanism of action of statins. Further knowledge of the in vivo biodistribution of [(18)F]atorvastatin may help to better understand the origin of off-target effects and potentially allow to distinguish between statin-resistant and non-resistant patients.","output":"[(18)F]Atorvastatin: synthesis of a potential molecular imaging tool for the assessment of statin-related mechanisms of action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study uses statistical change-point analysis to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's mobility in tourism cities Based on the collected data sample containing mobility time series of nine tourism cities on three categories of places - Retail and Recreation, Parks and Transit Stations, we find apart from the mobility reduction observed on all place categories, most cities experienced a three-phase pattern Moreover, a time lag between the mobility decrease and introduction of lockdown measures is detected, suggesting that the latter is not the reason for people to reduce movement Further, the mobility reduction is found less significant on Parks and appeared earlier on Transit Stations The findings provide useful insights on how tourism, hospitality and travel sectors are affected by crisis events ? 2021 The Authors","output":"COVID-19 and mobility in tourism cities: A statistical change-point detection approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inadequate leadership capacity compounds the world's workforce lack of preparedness for outbreaks of all sizes, as illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional human resources for health (HRH) leadership has focused on determining the health workforce requirements, often failing to fully consider the unpredictability associated with issues such as public health emergencies (PHE). MAIN ARGUMENTS: The current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that policy-making and relevant leadership have to be effective under conditions of ethical uncertainty and with inconclusive evidence. The forces at work in health labor markets (HLM) entail leadership that bridges across sectors and all levels of the health systems. Developing and applying leadership competencies must then be understood from a systemic as well as an individual perspective. To address the challenges described and to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, countries need to develop effective HRH leaderships relevant to the complexity of HLM in the most diverse contexts, including acute surge events during PHE. In complex and rapidly changing contexts, such as PHE, leadership needs to be attentive, nimble, adaptive, action oriented, transformative, accountable and provided throughout the system, i.e., authentic, distributed and participatory. This type of leadership is particularly important, as it can contribute to complex organizational changes as required in surge events associated with PHE, even in in the absence of formal management plans, roles, and structures. To deal with the uncertainty it needs agile tools that may allow prompt human resources impact assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of PHE requires transformative, authentic, distributed and participatory leadership of HRH. The unpredictable aspects of the dynamics of the HLM during PHE require the need to rethink, adapt and operationalize appropriate tools, such as HRH impact assessment tools, to redirect workforce operations rapidly and with precision.","output":"Relevant HRH leadership during public health emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number of people aged 50+ years presenting to primary care with features that could potentially indicate cancer, and to explore how reporting differed by patient characteristics and in face-to-face vs remote consultations. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of general practitioner (GP), nurse and paramedic primary care consultations in 21 practices in South-West England covering 123 947 patients. The models compared potential cancer indicators reported in April-July 2019 with April-July 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potential indicators of cancer were identified using code lists for symptoms, signs, test results and diagnoses listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suspected cancer referral guidance (NG12). RESULTS: During April-July 2019, 17% of registered patients aged 50+ years reported a potential cancer indicator in a consultation with a GP or nurse. During April-July 2020, this reduced to 11% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.67, p<0.001). Reductions in potential cancer indicators were stable across age group, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile and shielding status, but less marked in patients with mental health conditions than without (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.79, interaction p<0.001). Proportions of GP consultations with potential indicators of cancer reduced between 2019 and 2020 for face-to-face consultations (IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p<0.001) and increased for remote consultations (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p=0.001), although it remained lower in remote consulting than face-to-face in April-July 2020. This difference was greater for nurse/paramedic consultations (face-to-face: IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83, p=0.002; remote: IRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.333, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: The number of patients consulting with presentations that could potentially indicate cancer reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be encouraged to continue contacting primary care for persistent signs and symptoms, and GPs and nurses should be encouraged to probe patients for further information during remote consulting, in the absence of non-verbal cues.","output":"Changes in presentations with features potentially indicating cancer in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of public health measures during the #COVID19 pandemic may also help to reduce transmission of respiratory illnesses such as influenza https://bit.ly/2BmysRJ.","output":"Rapid decline of seasonal influenza during the outbreak of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the economic mechanisms that limited arbitrage between the cash and forward markets of agency MBS, and whether asset purchases of the Federal Reserve","output":"Cash-Forward Arbitrage and Dealer Capital in MBS Markets: COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: With the outbreak of COVID-19, residency programs for the 2020 to 2021 OMS interview cycle were forced to quickly adapt to a new method of assessing candidatesvirtual interviewingfor the first time. The purpose of this study is to describe applicants perspectives regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the virtual interview process through an online descriptive survey. METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilizes a descriptive survey sent to the 2020 to 2021 interview cycle applicants of the University of Illinois at Chicago Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (UIC OMS) residency program. The survey consisted of questions employing both scaled and open-ended designs. The questions were fabricated to extrapolate applicants perceived advantages and disadvantages of virtual interviewing compared to their expectations of in-person interviewing by focusing on interactions, number of interviews received/attended, and overall applicant satisfaction. Descriptive statistics were computed for each variable for data analysis. RESULTS: In the 2020 to 2021 UIC OMS residency cycle, there were 288 applications. A total of 102 surveys were collected (response rate = 35.4%). Respondents attended more interviews during the virtual format due to accessibility (64.7%), and cost savings (63.7%). 42.2% of applicants felt they did not present themselves as well during the virtual interview as they would have in person and 46.1% felt they did not have a good understanding of the culture of the program after the interview. 49.0% of all participants do not feel that virtual interviews should continue in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual formats would allow access to a greater number of interviews; however, they lack the ability to promote effective interaction between applicants, residents, and faculty members. The results of the study show that although applicants agreed that interviews were more accessible this year, they felt that the personal interaction was lacking and they could not present themselves effectively with the virtual format.

Wide range of cadmium concentrations, i.e., 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1M, were chronically exposed to the human BPH cells for transformation into PCa and monitored using cell and molecular biology approaches. After eight weeks of exposure, the cells showed subtle morphological changes and shifts of cell cycle in the G2M phase. Significant increase in expression of prostatic genes AR, PSA, ER-, and 5R with increased nuclear localization of AR and pluripotency markers Cmyc, Klf4 indicated the carcinogenic effect of Cd. Further, the BPH cells exposed to Cd showed a substantial increase in the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9, influencing migratory potential of the cells along with decreased expression of the p63 protein which further strengthen the progression towards carcinogenesis and aggressive tumor studies.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of the 10-item Emotional Eating Scale Adapted for Children and Adolescents (EES-C) Short-Form in a community sample of adolescents. We also sought to assess the reliability and structural validity of this measure. METHODS Participants were 128 adolescents ages 13 to 19 years (mean age = 15.10 years; SD = 2.09; 53.9% female). Most participants fell within the healthy BMI range (58.6%). Participants completed the EES-C Short-Form, the loss of control eating section of the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Adolescent Version 5, the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six-Item Form, and a demographic questionnaire. RESULTS Convergent validity of the EES-C Short-Form was supported in that adolescents who endorsed loss of control eating reported significantly greater levels of emotional eating (mean = 24.37; SD = 8.94) compared to adolescents who did not endorse loss of control eating (mean = 19.42; SD = 7.33; p  .01; d = 0.61). The EES-C Short-Form was significantly correlated with a subjective measure of loss of control eating (rs = -0.255; p = .004), further demonstrating convergent validity. The EES-C Short-Form exhibited discriminant validity as demonstrated by a small, non-significant correlation with the Gratitude Questionnaire-Six-Item Form (rs = 0.086; p = .347).

Patients were divided into one of two groups according to different treatment modalities: study group (TAE combined with RFA assisted by 3DVAPS [n = 32]); and control (RFA only [n = 30]). Oncological outcomes included ablation-related complications, local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess risk factors associated with LTP and OS. RESULTS HCC lesions (mean size, 1.9  1.0 mm in diameter) abutting the gastrointestinal tract (n = 25), heart and diaphragm (n = 21), major vessels (n = 13), and gallbladder (n = 3) were treated. A significant difference was detected in LTP between the two groups (P = 0.034), with no significant difference in OS between the two groups (P = 0.193). There were no severe complications related to ablation. Univariate analysis revealed that sex (P = 0.046) and child-turcotte-pugh (CTP) grade (P<0.001) were risk factors for OS, whereas CTP grade and treatment method (P<0.001) were risk factors for LTP.

METHODS: We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 Impact Survey collected from April to June 2020 (n=10,760). Primary exposure was a history of chronic conditions, which were defined as self-reported diagnoses of cardiometabolic, respiratory, immune-related, and mental health conditions and overweight/obesity. Primary outcomes were attitudes toward COVID-19 mHealth tools, including the likelihood of using (1) a mobile phone app to track COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations; (2) a website to track COVID-19 symptoms, track location, and receive recommendations; and (3) an app using location data to track potential COVID-19 exposure. Outcome response options for COVID-19 mHealth tool use were extremely/very likely, moderately likely, or not too likely/not likely at all. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare the likelihood of COVID-19 mHealth tool use between people with different chronic health conditions, with not too likely/not likely at all responses used as the reference category for each outcome. We evaluated the determinants of each COVID-19 mHealth intervention using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of the 10,760 respondents, 21.8% of respondents were extremely/very likely to use a mobile phone app or a website to track their COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations. Additionally, 24.1% of respondents were extremely/very likely to use a mobile phone app to track their location and receive push notifications about whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, and residence, adults with mental health conditions were the most likely to report being extremely/very or moderately likely to use each mHealth intervention compared to those without such conditions. Adults with respiratory-related chronic diseases were extremely/very (conditional odds ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.00-1.35) and moderately likely (conditional odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.45) to use a mobile phone app to track their location and receive push notifications about whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that attitudes toward using COVID-19 mHealth tools vary widely across modalities (eg, web-based method vs app) and chronic health conditions. These findings may inform the adoption of long-term engagement with COVID-19 apps, which is crucial for determining their potential in reducing disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among individuals with chronic health conditions.","output":"Attitudes Toward Using COVID-19 mHealth Tools Among Adults With Chronic Health Conditions: Secondary Data Analysis of the COVID-19 Impact Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this work is to explore how ventures have adapted their commercial proposals after the changes brought upon by Covid-19.

However, point-of-care (POC) testing in places such as emergency units, outpatient clinics, airport security points or the entrance of any public building is a major challenge. The need for thermal cycling and nucleic acid isolation hampers the use of standard PCR-based methods for this purpose. METHODS: To avoid these obstacles, we tested PCR-independent methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from primary material (nasopharyngeal swabs) including reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK). RESULTS: Whilst specificity of standard RT-LAMP assays appears to be satisfactory, sensitivity does not reach the current gold-standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays yet. We describe a novel multiplexed RT-LAMP approach and validate its sensitivity on primary samples. This approach allows for fast and reliable identification of infected individuals. Primer optimization and multiplexing helps to increase sensitivity significantly. In addition, we directly compare and combine our novel RT-LAMP assays with SHERLOCK. CONCLUSION: In summary, this approach reveals one-step multiplexed RT-LAMP assays as a prime-option for the development of easy and cheap POC test kits.","output":"Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in primary material based on a novel multiplex RT-LAMP assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tocilizumab is an interleukin\\\\6 (IL\\\\6) receptor antibody and is progressing as a viable and promising treatment option in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

This paper is aimed at estimating the first two infections waves in Italy in relation to adopted health policies. Design and methods: We moved deaths of the Italian COVID- 19 registry from recorded to infection date by the weighted moving average. We considered two infection fatality ratios related to the effective or saturated health system, we estimated the likely incidence curve from the resulting deaths and evaluated the curve shape before and after the national health policies. Results: From the 24(th) of February 2020 to the 7(th) of February 2021, we estimated 6,664,655 (4,639,221-9,325,138) cases distributed on two waves. Suitable daily infection fatality rates were 2.53% within the first wave and 1.15% within the second one. The first wave (February-July 2020) had its peak on the 14(th) of March 2020 (26,575). The second wave (August 2020-February 2021) was fatter with the peak on the 12(th) of November (60,425) and a hump in December before decreasing to 26,288 at the end. Adopted health policies were followed by changes in the curve rate. Conclusions: Tracing infection contacts and quarantining asymptomatic people reduced virus lethality in the second wave. Restriction on population mobility is effective within a suppression strategy, distance learning reduces contacts among families. Removal of restrictions should be implemented by sequential steps for avoiding a quick rising of incident cases. A reasonable public health daily goal to control both virus spread and lethality could be to find at least 87 cases for each death.","output":"The first year of COVID-19 in Italy: Incidence, lethality, and health policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite many advancements in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the procedure is still correlated with a high risk of patient complications. Simulation-based training provides the opportunity for ECMO staff to practice on real-life scenarios without exposing ECMO patients to medical errors while practicing. At Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in Qatar, there is a critical need of expert ECMO staff. Thus, a modular ECMO simulator is being developed to enhance the training process in a cost-effective manner. This ECMO simulator gives the instructor the ability to control the simulation modules and run common simulation scenarios through a tablet application. The core modules of the simulation system are placed in the patient unit. The unit is designed modularly such that more modules can be added throughout the simulation sessions to increase the realism of the simulation sessions. The new approach is to enclose the patient unit in a trolley, which is custom-designed and made to include all the components in a modular fashion. Each module is enclosed in a separate box and then mounted to the main blood simulation loop box using screws, quick connect/disconnect liquid fittings, and electrical plugs. This method allows fast upgrade and maintenance for each module separately as well as upgrading modules easily without modifying the trolleys design.

Previous studies revealed pregnant women with COVID-19 had similar clinical manifestations to nonpregnant women. However, little is known about the outcome of neonates born to infected women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective study, we studied 29 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection delivered in 2 designated general hospitals in Wuhan, China between January 30 and March 10, 2020, and 30 neonates (1 set of twins). Maternal demographic characteristics, delivery course, symptoms, and laboratory tests from hospital records were extracted. Neonates were hospitalized if they had symptoms (5 cases) or their guardians agreed to a hospitalized quarantine (13 cases), whereas symptom-free neonates also could be discharged after birth and followed up through telephone (12 cases). For hospitalized neonates, laboratory test results and chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) were extracted from hospital records. The presence of antibody of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in the serum of 4 neonates. Among 29 pregnant COVID-19-infected women (13 confirmed and 16 clinical diagnosed), the majority had higher education (56.6%), half were employed (51.7%), and their mean age was 29 years. Fourteen women experienced mild symptoms including fever (8), cough (9), shortness of breath (3), diarrhea (2), vomiting (1), and 15 were symptom-free. Eleven of 29 women had pregnancy complications, and 27 elected to have a cesarean section delivery. Of 30 neonates, 18 were admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital for quarantine and care, whereas the other 12 neonates discharged after birth without any symptoms and had normal follow-up. Five hospitalized neonates were diagnosed as COVID-19 infection (2 confirmed and 3 suspected). In addition, 12 of 13 other hospitalized neonates presented with radiological features for pneumonia through X-ray or CT screening, 1 with occasional cough and the others without associated symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 specific serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured in 4 neonates and 2 were positive. The limited sample size limited statistical comparison between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed COVID-19 or radiological features of pneumonia in some, but not all, neonates born to women with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that intrauterine or intrapartum transmission is possible and warrants clinical caution and further investigation.

In October 2019, a wider array of products, including edibles, was legalized, with entry into the legal market beginning in December. DATA AND METHODS: Three quarters (the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020) of the National Cannabis Survey were used to examine changes in cannabis use (overall use and daily or almost daily (DAD) use), consumption methods, products and sources. RESULTS: Cannabis use in the past three months was higher in late 2020 (20.0%) than in 2019 (17.5%) and 2018 (14.0%), and this was particularly the case among: females (for whom rates rose to equal male rates for the first time), adults aged 25 and older, and some provinces. Similarly, DAD use, at 7.9% also increased. Higher percentages of Canadians reported getting at least some of their cannabis from legal sources or growing it, and fewer were relying on friends and family or illegal sources in 2020. DISCUSSION: This study spans three years-from before legalization to about two years after. It provides a more complete picture of the law's impact on cannabis use and related behaviours, given the more established legal cannabis industry better equipped to compete with the black market on price, convenience and selection. Findings demonstrate that change is continuing, and, as before, some cautions and assurances remain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use continues to be difficult to measure. Monitoring remains important, given the ever-changing provincial retail landscapes; the introduction of new products; and the pressure by the industry to remove or adjust potency limits, and allow widespread delivery, farm-gate sales and cannabis lounges.","output":"Looking back from 2020, how cannabis use and related behaviours changed in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current global health threat caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

However, underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the activation and repression of the innate immune response by SARS-CoV-2. We show that SARS-CoV-2 RNA activates the RIG-I-MAVS-dependent IFN signaling pathway. We further uncover that ORF9b immediately accumulates and antagonizes the antiviral type I IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection on primary human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. ORF9b targets the nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B) essential modulator NEMO and interrupts its K63-linked polyubiquitination upon viral stimulation, thereby inhibiting the canonical I&#954;B kinase alpha (IKK&#945;)/?/?3-NF-&#954;B signaling and subsequent IFN production.

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002C2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally.

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, PsyclNFO and Cochrane Library databases were comprehensively searched to identify all eligible studies published before 31 December 2021. Studies were eligible if they were published in peer-reviewed literature and evaluated distress levels by DT. RESULTS: Ten eligible studies, including a total of 2111 patients, were included in this analysis, and their methodological quality was moderate. The pooled positive rate of distress in patients with lung cancer was 49.04% (95% CI 41.51% to 56.60%). The subgroup analysis revealed that the distress positive rate was significantly different (p<0.05) across North America, Europe and China with values of 53.33% (95% CI 45.22% to 61.37%), 43.81% (95% CI 31.57% to 56.43%) and 38.57% (95% CI 33.89% to 43.41%), respectively.

This study evaluated the relationship between brightness setting and cup/disc ratio (c/d) grading among glaucoma specialists. METHODS: Optic disc photographs obtained during routine examinations under anesthesia were collected to construct an image library. For each optic disc, photographs were obtained at 3 light intensity settings: dark, medium, and bright. From the image library, photograph triads (dark, medium and bright) of 50 eyes (50 patients) were used to construct the study set. Nine glaucoma specialists evaluated the c/d of the study set photographs in randomized order. The relationships between the brightness levels and the c/d grading as well as graders years in practice and variability were evaluated. RESULTS: The c/d were graded as significantly larger in bright photographs when compared to photographs taken at the medium light intensity (0.53 vs 0.48, P < 0.001) as well as those taken at the dark setting (0.47, P < 0.001).

However, securing reliable data can be challenging, particularly if the behaviour is illegal or otherwise sensitive. Specialised questioning methods such as Randomised Response Techniques (RRTs) are increasingly used in conservation to provide greater anonymity, increase response rates, and reduce bias. A rich RRT literature exists, but successfully navigating it can be challenging. To help conservationists access this literature, we summarise the various RRT designs available and conduct a systematic review of empirical applications of RRTs within (n = 32), and beyond conservation (n = 66). Our results show increased application of RRTs in conservation since 2000. We compare the performance of RRTs against known prevalence of the sensitive behaviour and relative to other questioning techniques to assess how successful RRTs are at reducing bias (indicated by securing higher estimates). Findings suggest that RRT applications in conservation were less likely than those in other disciplines to provide prevalence estimates equal to, or higher than those derived from direct questions. Across all disciplines, we found reports of non-compliance with RRT instructions were common, but rarely accounted for in study design or analysis. For the first time, we provide conservationists considering RRTs with evidence on what works, and provide guidance on how to develop robust designs suitable for conservation research contexts. We highlight when alternate methods should be used, how to increase design efficiency and improve compliance with RRT instructions. We conclude RRTs are a useful tool, but their performance depends on careful design and implementation.","output":"Asking sensitive questions in conservation using Randomised Response Techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Platelets exert fundamental roles in thrombosis, inflammation, and angiogenesis, contributing to different pathologies from cardiovascular diseases to cancer. We previously reported that platelets release extracellular vesicles (pEVs) which contribute to thrombus formation. However, pEV composition remains poorly defined. Indeed, pEV quality and type, rather than quantity, may be relevant in intravascular cross-talk with either circulating or vascular cells. We aimed to define the phenotypic characteristics of pEVs released spontaneously and those induced by thrombin activation to better understand their role in disease dissemination. pEVs obtained from washed platelets from healthy donor blood were characterized by flow cytometry. pEVs from thrombin-activated platelets (T-pEVs) showed higher levels of P-selectin and active form of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa than baseline non-activated platelets (B-pEVs). Following mass spectrometry-based differential proteomic analysis, significant changes in the abundance of proteins secreted in T-pEVs compared to B-pEVs were found. These differential proteins were involved in coagulation, adhesion, cytoskeleton, signal transduction, metabolism, and vesicle-mediated transport. Interestingly, release of proteins relevant for cell adhesion, intrinsic pathway coagulation, and platelet activation signalling was significantly modified by thrombin stimulation. A novel pEV-associated protein (protocadherin-4) was found to be significantly reduced in T-pEVs showing a shift towards increased expression in the membranes of activated platelets. In summary, platelet activation induced by thrombin triggers the shedding of pEVs with a complex proteomic pattern rich in procoagulant and proadhesive proteins. Crosstalk with other vascular and blood cells in a paracrine regulatory mode could extend the prothrombotic signalling as well as promote proteostasic changes in other cellular types.

We estimate a fixed effect model of housing rental and sales price equations and find that a one-standard deviation increase in the number of Airbnb listings raises house rental prices by 0.38%. This finding suggests that a substitution effect is present between Airbnb's short-term accommodation and the housing rental market. Moreover, a larger effect on rental price is found among Airbnb listings that offer an entire room or apartment. Additionally, since September 2017, multinational digital platform companies must comply with a new sales tax policy in Taiwan.

METHODS: 73 patients who died from COVID-19 were retrospectively included. The clinical and laboratory data of the patients were extracted from electronic medical records. The clinical data, inflammation-related laboratory results, and CT imaging features were summarized. The laboratory results and dynamic changes of imaging features and severity scores of lung involvement based on chest CT were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age was 6712 years. The typical clinical symptoms included fever (88%), cough (62%) and dyspnea (23%). 65% patients had at least one underlying disease. GGO with consolidation was the most common feature for the five lung lobes (47%-53% among the various lobes), with total severity score of 12.975.87 for the both lungs. The proportion of GGO with consolidation is markedly increased on follow-up chest CT compared with initial CT scans, as well as the averaging total CT scores (14.535.76 vs. 6.605.65; P<0.001).

Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach. A multi-stage model-based approach was developed to characterize % of recovery and viral load in CCoV-infected dogs, to estimate the PK of indomethacin in dog and human using published data after administration of immediate (IR) and sustained-release (SR) formulations, and to estimate the expected antiviral activity as a function of different assumptions on the effective exposure in human. Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day). The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation.

METHODS: Under the oversight of the Joint Advisory Group (JAG), a modified Delphi process was conducted with stakeholder representation from British Society of Gastroenterology, Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons, trainees and trainers. Recommendations on OGD training and certification were formulated following literature review and appraised using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. These were subjected to electronic voting to achieve consensus. Accepted statements were incorporated into the updated certification pathway. RESULTS: In total, 32 recommendation statements were generated for the following domains: definition of competence (4 statements), acquisition of competence (12 statements), assessment of competence (10 statements) and post-certification support (6 statements). The consensus process led to following certification criteria: (1) performing 250 hands-on procedures; (2) attending a JAG-accredited basic skills course; (3) attainment of relevant minimal performance standards defined by British Society of Gastroenterology/Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, (4) achieving physically unassisted D2 intubation and J-manoeuvre in 95% of recent procedures, (5) satisfactory performance in formative and summative direct observation of procedural skills assessments. CONCLUSION: The JAG standards for diagnostic OGD have been updated following evidence-based consensus. These standards are intended to support training, improve competency assessment to uphold standards of practice and provide support to the newly-independent practitioner.","output":"JAG consensus statements for training and certification in oesophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aim to explore the safety and feasibility of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC\\\\MSCs) transplantation in patients with severe and critically severe coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Transparent and accessible reporting of COVID-19 data is critical for public health efforts. Each state and union territory (UT) of India has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state and union territory governments. This assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting by other governments. Methods. We designed a semi-quantitative framework to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the states and union territories of India. This framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting - availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We then used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0 to 1) for 29 states based on the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state during the two-week period from 19 May to 1 June, 2020. States that reported less than 10 total confirmed cases as of May 18 were excluded from the study. Findings. Our results indicate a strong disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state governments in India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Only ten states provide a visual representation of the trend in COVID-19 data. Ten states do not report any data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by releasing their personally identifiable information on the official websites. Across the states, the CDRS is positively associated with the state's sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r=0.630, p=0.0003). Interpretation. The disparity in CDRS across states highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights from them, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states in India. Coordination among states is particularly important as more people start moving across states in the coming months. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence. Funding.

This previously unknown, but highly infectious virus, has rapidly spread throughout the world, causing devastation to peoples health on a global scale. The scientific and medical community have had to adapt and learn how to manage the virus, which has had knock on effects to patients suffering other diseases. Health services have been severely disrupted, so we reviewed the impact of this, specifically relating to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers. The situation is rapidly changing; therefore, we share the findings of our critical analysis of the available literature. ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has left dramatic footprints on human health and economy. Cancer, whilst not an infective disease, is prevalent in epidemic proportions and cannot be pretermitted due to the impact of COVID-19. As we emanate from the second national lockdown in the UK with mixed feelings of hope and despairdue to vaccination and new COVID-19 variant, respectivelywe reflect on the impact of the first wave on the provision on diagnosis and management of with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers. This review provides a critical analysis of available literature on COVID-19 and its impact on cancer management in general and that of UGI cancers in particular.","output":"COVID-19 and Its Impact on Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancer Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adhesion to biological tissues is a challenge especially when the adhesive is in contact with physiological fluids. Abdominal hernia is a disease that often requires the implantation of a mesh within the abdominal wall. To minimize pain and postsurgical complications, gluing the mesh appears to be a convenient method. For this purpose, a bioadhesive system based on solutions of chitosan and modified starch (oxidized maltodextrin) has been developed. Mixtures of these polysaccharides form either viscoelastic solutions or hydrogels, depending on various experimental parameters (chitosan concentration, starch degree of oxidation, molar ratio between amine and aldehyde functions, pH, etc.). An adhesion test was developed to assess the adherence of such systems under conditions similar to the intended use. The rheological behavior of each formulation was correlated to its adherence, and it was found that optimum adhesion is obtained for systems exhibiting an intermediate behavior between the viscoelastic solution and the gel.","output":"Polysaccharide-based adhesive for biomedical applications: correlation between rheological behavior and adhesion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily involves the respiratory system Consumptive coagulopathy is seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure (MOF) Usually, only severely sick patients develop mild thrombocytopenia We present a case of mildly symptomatic young adult, presenting with severe thrombocytopenia She responded well to corticosteroids","output":"Paying in Blood: A Case of Thrombocytopenia in Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To report the decrease in breast imaging after covid-19 pandemic, obtaining the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, to investigate if there was an increase in the proportion of women undergoing mammography for diagnostic purposes, with palpable lesions. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the number of mammograms performed by the Brazilian public health services, provided by DATASUS, an open access database. Mammograms from private institutions were not included. This study compares the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020, in women aged 50-69 years, stratified by month, in each federal state, and the presence of palpable lumps (physician-reported). RESULTS: In total, 1,948,471 mammograms were performed in 2019 and 1,126,688 in 2020, for the population studied. These values represent a 42% decline. Monthly, a significant decreased is observed after April 2020. The results varied slightly according to federal state; yet the entire country was affected. Rond?nia was the most affected state, with 67% decline. The proportion of women presenting palpable lumps increased from 7.06% on average in 2019 to 7.94% in 2020 (OR = 1.135, 95%CI 1.125-1.145, p = 0,001). DISCUSSION: The number of mammograms performed in 2020 declined considerably. Out of the women who presented for mammogram, the proportion of palpable lumps was significantly higher in 2020. Considering the detection rate of digital mammography, the loss of 800,000 exams means 4,000 undiagnosed breast cancer cases, by the end of 2020.","output":"Breast imaging hindered during covid-19 pandemic, in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When an infectious disease strikes a population, the number of newly reported cases is often the only available information that one can obtain during early stages of the outbreak.

Here, we report for the first time that the 11S proteasomal activator PA28?3 regulates the intracellular abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (nCoV N). Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator PA28?3 as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As a result of their interaction, nCoV N could be degraded by PA28?3-20S in vitro degradation assay. This was also demonstrated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The stability of nCoV N in PA28?3-knockout cells was greater than in PA28?3-wildtype cells. Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockout of the PA28?3 gene in cells led to the transport of nCoV N from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PA28?3 enhanced proteolysis of nCoV N compared to that in PA28?3-N151Y cells containing a dominant-negative PA28?3 mutation, which reduced this process. These results suggest that PA28?3 binding is important in regulating 20S proteasome activity, which in turn regulates levels of the critical nCoV N nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","output":"Proteasome activator PA28?3-dependent degradation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) nucleocapsid protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fecal viral concentrations of 40 patients infected with norovirus genogroup GII.4 correlated with diarrhea duration and frequency of vomiting.

IBV is responsible for causing severe losses to the commercial poultry sector globally. The objectives of this study were to identify the viruses that were causing outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in chickens in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) and to characterize the strains. Swab samples were collected from birds showing severe respiratory signs in five farms on the island of Trinidad. Samples were tested for the presence of IBV, as well as Avian Influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All samples from the five farms tested negative for AIV, NDV and aMPV; however samples from clinically affected birds in all five of the farms tested positive for IBV. Genetic data revealed the presence of TCoV in chickens on two of the farms. Interestingly, these two farms had never reared turkeys. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IBV S1 sequences formed two distinct clusters. Two sequences grouped with vaccine strains within the GI-1 lineage, whereas three sequences grouped together, but separately from other defined lineages, forming a likely new lineage of IBV. Pairwise comparison revealed that the three unique variant strains within the new lineage of IBV were significantly different in their S1 nucleotide coding regions from viruses in the closest lineage (16% difference) and locally used vaccine strains (>20% difference). Results also suggested that one of the samples was a recombinant virus, generated from a recombination event between a Trinidad virus of the GI-1 lineage and a Trinidad virus of the newly defined lineage. Many amino acid differences were also observed between the S1 coding regions of the circulating field and vaccine strains, indicating that the IBV vaccines may not be protective.

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein and the main protease Mpro, involved in the recognition of virus by host cells and in viral replication, respectively, were the main molecular targets in this study. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock, which allowed us to select the plant actives with the highest affinity towards the viral targets and to identify the interaction molecular sites with the SARS-CoV2 proteins. The best energy binding values for S protein were, in kcal/mol: -19.22 for glycyrrhizin, -17.84 for gitoxin, -12.05 for dicumarol, -10.75 for diosgenin, and -8.12 for delphinidin.

In addition, the synthetic drugs umifenovir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine were used as controls for S protein, while atazanavir and nelfinavir were used for Mpro. Key hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between natural compounds and the respective viral proteins were identified, allowing us to explain the great affinity obtained in those compounds with the lowest binding energies.

The proposed methodology (M2) uses a simple random counting method (1/4) for the partial counting of juveniles and total estimation. Chronic bioassays (21 days of exposure) were performed in tropical artificial soil (TAS) using sugarcane vinasse as a hazardous substance. Comparing the final density of juveniles recorded in M1 and M2, no statistical differences were pointed out in either one. Applying analyses based on effective concentration (EC10 and EC50), no statistical differences were identified there either. The t-test showed that there was no statistical difference between the counting methods (M1 and M2) in each treatment (control and dilutions). Moreover, we ran the Tukey test for M1 and M2 methods separately and observed that 100 % of the vinasse showed a statistical difference compared to the control treatment in both (p  0.05), affirming that independent of the counting method, the ecotoxicological outputs were similar. Therefore, the proposed alternative is a suitable method for bioassay using.

Method 87 respondents (licensed neuropsychologists = 56;others [e.g. trainees] = 31) conducting TeleNP evaluations with adult populations in the United States completed an online survey which was distributed via social media and list-servs in winter 2020C2021. Respondents were asked about their TeleNP experiences, including issues encountered and solutions to TeleNP challenges. Frequency analyses were conducted to examine the proportion of respondents endorsing specific TeleNP challenges. TeleNP advice was thematically coded to identify the most common suggestions to overcome/navigate these challenges. Results The most frequently reported TeleNP challenges included: poor internet connectivity (examinee's home: 82.8%;an unknown source 58.6%);environmental distractions in the examinee's location (78.2%);poor audio quality (55.2%);examinee's unfamiliarity with the videoconferencing technology (52.9%);inability to easily conduct visuoconstructional tasks (52.9%) or adapt tests/find TeleNP norms (47.1%);and examinees' limited access to technology (57.5%) or complete lack of access (35.6%). The most common responses to mitigate these challenges included: providing detailed instructions about the TeleNP visit and examinee expectations in advance;having a clear back-up or assistive plan (e.g. telephone call);and using TeleNP sparingly (e.g. for interview only). Conclusion These survey results reflect widely-encountered challenges with remote cognitive assessment and identify priority targets for increasing the feasibility and reliability of TeleNP.

Five hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by positive tests for SARS-CoV-2) received treatment with ribavirin for inhalation solution (ribavirin aerosol) as part of a compassionate use program. Patients included four men and one woman, with an age range of 29C72 years. Patients were managed according to international and Italian treatment guidelines for COVID-19. In addition, therapy with ribavirin aerosol 100 mg/mL was administered for 30 min twice daily for 6 days (i.e., 12 doses) in all patients. In order to address concerns about a possible increase in viral dispersal with the use of a nebulizer, healthcare providers remained outside the patient room during ribavirin aerosol administration.

Our data suggested surges of COVID-19 cases might be predicted from variant surveillance data. Despite vaccine breakthroughs by Delta VOC, death tolls were more stable in countries with better immunization coverage. Another takeaway is the urgent need to improve vaccine efficacy against Delta and emerging variants.","output":"Geographical prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, August 2020 to July 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, there are a number of emerging pathogens. For most, there are no licensed vaccines available for human use, although there is ongoing research and development. However, given the extensive and increasing list of emerging pathogens and the investment required to bring vaccines into clinical use, the task is huge. Overlaid on this task is the risk of anti\\\\microbial resistance (AMR) acquisition by micro\\\\organisms which can endow a relatively harmless organism with pathogenic potential. Furthermore, climate change also introduces a challenge by causing some of the insect vectors and environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions to begin to spread out from these traditional areas, thus increasing the risk of migration of zoonotic disease. Vaccination provides a defence against these emerging pathogens. However, vaccines for pathogens which cause severe, but occasional, disease outbreaks in endemic pockets have suffered from a lack of commercial incentive for development to a clinical standard, encompassing Phase III clinical trials for efficacy. An alternative is to develop such vaccines to request US Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), or equivalent status in the United States, Canada and the European Union, making use of a considerable number of regulatory mechanisms that are available prior to licensing. This review covers the status of vaccine development for some of the emerging pathogens, the hurdles that need to be overcome to achieve EUA or an equivalent regional or national status and how these considerations may impact vaccine development for the future, such that a more comprehensive stockpile of promising vaccines can be achieved.","output":"Vaccines for emerging pathogens: prospects for licensure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We protect the community.

Hematologists are confident with these situations requiring a prompt therapeutic approach for switching off the uncontrolled cytokine release; here, we discuss pros and cons of drugs that are already employed in hematology in the light of their possible application in COVID-19. The most promising drugs might be: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with a rapid and powerful anti-cytokine effect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with their good anti-inflammatory properties, and perhaps the anti-Cd26 antibody Begelomab. We also present immunological data from gene expression experiments where TKIs resulted effective anti-inflammatory and pro-immune drugs.

Here we analyzed the influence of thrombus length on the number of thrombectomy maneuvers needed for recanalization, intraprocedural complications, recanalization success, and clinical outcome after mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed angiographic and clinical data from 72 consecutive patients with acute occlusion of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy using stent retrievers. Successful recanalization was defined as a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or 3. Good neurological outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 2 at 90 days after stroke onset. RESULTS Mean thrombus length was 13.45.2 mm. Univariate binary logistic regression did not show an association of thrombus length with the probability of a good clinical outcome (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03, p=0.176) or successful recanalization (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05, p=0.225). There was no significant correlation between thrombus length and the number of thrombectomy maneuvers needed for recanalization (p=0.112). Furthermore, thrombus length was not correlated with the probability of intraprocedural complications (p=0.813), including embolization in a new territory (n=3). CONCLUSIONS In this study, thrombus length had no relevant impact on recanalization, neurological outcome, or intraprocedural complications following mechanical thrombectomy of middle cerebral artery occlusions.

Although there is biological plausibility for its use, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is scarce, and the risks associated with it may be significant. Thus, based on a virtual case simulation, we estimated the risks of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) and cardiac disease. METHODS: Lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of RIC were calculated for the lung, liver, esophagus, and breast of female patients. The cardiovascular risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to ischemic heart disease was also calculated. The doses received by the organs involved in the treatment were obtained from a simulation of conformal radiotherapy (RT) treatment, delivering a dose of 0.5 Gy-1.5 Gy to the lungs. We considered a LAR and REID <1% as acceptable, 1-2% cautionary, and >2% unacceptable. RESULTS: The lung was at the highest risk for RIC (absolute LAR below 5200 cases/100,000 and 2250 cases/100,000 for women and men, respectively). For women, the breast had the second-highest LAR, especially for young women. The liver and esophagus had LARs below 700/100,000 for both sexes, with a higher incidence of esophageal cancer in women and liver cancer in men. Regarding the LAR cutoff, we observed an unacceptable or cautionary LAR for lung cancer in all women and men <60 years with an RT dose >1 Gy. LAR for lung cancer with an RT dose of 1 Gy was cautionary for women >60 years of age and men <40 years of age. No LAR estimation was unacceptable for the RT dose &#8804;0.7 Gy in all groups irrespective of sex or age at exposure. Only 0.5 Gy had an acceptable REID. CONCLUSIONS: A RT dose &#8804;0.5 Gy provides an acceptable LAR estimate (&#8804;1%) for RIC and REID, irrespective of sex and age. The current ongoing trials should initially use doses &#8804;0.5 Gy to maintain the risks at an acceptable level and include only patients who fail or do not have any other treatment option.","output":"The risk of induced cancer and ischemic heart disease following low dose lung irradiation for COVID-19: estimation based on a virtual case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are living through an unprecedented crisis with the rapid spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide within a short time. The timely availability of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has enabled the scientific community to study the origin, structures, and pathogenesis of the virus. The pandemic has spurred research publication and resulted in an unprecedented number of therapeutic proposals. Because the development of new drugs is time consuming, several strategies, including drug repurposing and repositioning, are being tested to treat patients with COVID-19. Researchers have developed several potential vaccine candidates that have shown promise in phase II and III trials. As of 12 November 2020, 164 candidate vaccines are in preclinical evaluation, and 48 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, of which four have cleared phase III trials (Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273, University of Oxford & AstraZeneca's AZD1222, and Gamaleya's Sputnik V vaccine). Despite the acquisition of a vast body of scientific information, treatment depends only on the clinical management of the disease through supportive care.

Examples of serious ethical issues include sexual abuse of patients (Dubois, Walsh, Chibnall et al., 2017), criminal prescription of opioids (Johnson, 2019) and unnecessary surgical procedures (Tayade and Dalvi, 2016) or shortages in service delivery because of little knowledge or experience especially during pandemic outbreaks (Hay-David et al., 2020). In many cases involving medical ethics, patients are identified as the first victims; however, this study aimed to consider clinicians and other healthcare practitioners as other probable victims (Ozeke et al., 2019). Design/methodology/approach: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tens of millions of patients worldwide suffer disabling injuries or death every year due to unsafe medical practices and services. Nearly, one in ten patients is harmed due to preventable causes while receiving health care in well-funded and technologically advanced hospital settings (WHO, 2016). Much less is known about the burden of unsafe care in non-hospital settings, where most healthcare services are delivered (Jha et al., 2013). Furthermore, there is little evidence concerning the burden of unsafe care in developing countries, where the risk of harm to patients is likely to be greater, due to limitations in infrastructure, technologies and human resources (Elmontsri et al., 2018). Findings: While these problems are endemic in health care, they are exacerbated in times of health and social crises such as the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic has few precedents, being most closely paralleled with the global influenza pandemic of 1918 (Terry, 2020). Initially compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002C2003 (Parrym, 2003), COVID-19 is already proving much more deadly. The WHOs estimates of the number of SARS cases from the start of the outbreak in 2002, until it was brought under control in July 2003, was 8,437 cumulative cases, with 813 deaths (WHO, 2003). The European Center for disease prevention and Control estimated that as of May 15, 2020, that 4,405,680 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with 302,115 deaths (ECDC, 2020) Research limitations/implications: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared in February 2020 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and up to March 2020, the cases of morbidity reached 12,729, with 611 deaths (Bedasht, 2020). The current figure at the time of editing (May 16, 2020) is 118,392 cases, with 6,937 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). Acting in cognizance of its ethical responsibility to the citizens of Iran, the Iranian government has taken the following action to attempt to mitigate the deleterious effects of the virus: in each province, one or more hospitals have been evacuated and allocated to patients with pulmonary problems with suspected to COVID-19. Access to intensive care units and specialist equipment is a primary ethical issue that concerns the Iranian healthcare system. The issue is exacerbated by the knowledge that these facilities are not distributed equitably in the country. Therefore, equity is the first ethical concern in this situation. Practical implications: All nurses, clinicians, practitioners and specialists have been asked to volunteer their services in hospitals in the most infected areas. This raises ethical concerns about access to personal protective equipment (PPE) such as appropriate masks, gowns, gloves and other equipment to protect healthcare workers from infection. Access to PPE was restricted because of government failure to stockpile the necessary amount of disposable medical equipment. This was related to lack of domestic capacity to produce the equipment and problems accessing it internationally due to political-economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran by the USA and some European countries. Such shortages can quickly lead to a catastrophic situation; current evidence demonstrates that about 40% of healthcare workers are vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection (Behdasht, 2020). However, it should be noted that this is not a problem limited to Iran. As of March 2020, the WHO was already warning about PPE shortages and the dangers this posed for healthcare workers around the world (WHO, 2020). Social implications: A Disaster Committee was created by the Iranian Ministry of Health to take responsibility for decision-making and daily information sharing to the community. The ethical dilemma that arises in terms of reporting the situation is the conflict between transparently presenting accurate and timely information and the creation of public panic and fear that this may cause in the community. Originality/value: As a steward for public health, the Ministry of Health was afforded direct responsibility to maintain intra-sector relationships and leadership with other organizations such as political executive organizations, municipalities, military agencies, schools, universities and other public organizations to reach consensus on the best methods of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. An important ethical issue is found in potential areas of conflict between the therapeutic and preventive roles of the Ministry of Health and those related to public health and the civil administrations.","output":"Reflections on COVID-19 and the ethical issues for healthcare providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in collective accommodation centres is crucial to maintain the physical and mental health of refugees.

METHODS: Qualitative interview study with 48 representatives responsible for the reception and accommodation of refugees. Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim and evaluated using framework analysis. RESULTS: We found substantial heterogeneity of measures taken to prevent infection, inform refugees, maintain social and health services, test for SARS-CoV-2 and quarantine positive cases. Effective intersectoral cooperation proved to be particularly important for coordination and implementation of measures. Need for support was expressed with regard to the improvement of infrastructure, opportunities to work with language interpreters and stronger involvement of local health experts. CONCLUSION: Amidst multiple actors and the complexity of structures and processes, the admission authorities have been taking on essential responsibilities related to infection control on an ad hoc basis, without being sufficiently positioned to do so.

METHODS: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and parameterized it with US demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Healthcare workers and high-risk individuals were prioritized for vaccination, while children under 18 years of age were not vaccinated. We considered a vaccine efficacy of 90% against infection following 2 doses administered 28 days apart achieving 40% vaccine coverage of the overall population. We specified 10% pre-existing population immunity for the base-case scenario and calibrated to an effective reproduction number of 1.5, accounting for current COVID-19 interventions in the US. RESULTS: Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to 1.6% (95% CI: 1.3% C 1.8%) from 7.1% (95% CI: 6.3% C 7.9%) across the same period without vaccination. The highest relative reduction (83C90%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older.

In cases with a severe disease course or threatening long-term impairment due to disease, the German health care system offers insured persons the possibility of medical rehabilitation. In contrast to what was observed and expected at the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity are represented in rehabilitation. To date, there is no common consensus on the content and aftercare of rehabilitation nor is there any knowledge about the short- and long-term effects of such a rehabilitation programme. In addition, these aspects were not considered with regard to the varying severity of the course of the disease. The present research project investigates this question. METHODS: The study sample will consist of N = 350 rehabilitants after COVID-19 and a comparison group (CG) with N = 230 rehabilitants suffering from an obstructive respiratory disease. The participants will be recruited at five German rehabilitation facilities and undergo medical rehabilitation. This prospective, exploratory, multicentre, mixed-methods study will be evaluated as follows: (A) The quantitative portion includes questionnaires at different points in time (at the beginning and end of rehabilitation, after six and twelve months) and contains standardised measurement instruments. For example, participation limitations, quality of life, health status, fatigue, psychomental limitations and disorders, performance in different areas of life and ability to work are measured. (B) Qualitative interviews are held at different times (end of rehabilitation, after six and twelve months), and an expert workshop is conducted. Topics are rehabilitation content, satisfaction and aftercare as well as different outcomes on subjective health and participation impairments. DISCUSSION: Studies on other indications have already shown that pneumological rehabilitation has positive effects. Thus, it is expected that an improvement in different dimensions will be observed at the end of rehabilitation in both groups. With regard to the different severities of COVID-19, this study evaluates the long-term developments. Subsequently, the authors will elaborate concrete recommendations for medical rehabilitation after different courses of disease with regard to existing pneumological rehabilitation concepts.

We used data from the 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor to develop a comparable index of trust in science across 144 countries using confirmatory analysis models for categorical data (often referred as Item Response Models) with alignment optimisation. We use this index to provide evidence on the association between trust in science, country level mobility changes following the COVID-19 pandemic and the stringency of regulations to halt COVID-19 spread. We find that trust in science was highest in Nordic European countries, among individuals with high educational attainment and income. Differences by religiosity, gender and residency were less pronounced. Countries where individuals trust science the most enacted less stringent regulations in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic than countries where individuals trust science the least. Irrespective of country-specific trust in science, behaviors such as mobility reductions changed the most in countries with more stringent regulations. Stringent regulations were associated with large reductions in mobility irrespective of levels of trust in science. By contrast, where regulations were less stringent, mobility decreased more in countries with lower levels of trust in science. Many governments are considering relaxing regulations that were put in place following the rapid surge of cases and deaths and the risk that health care systems would be overwhelmed.

The prototypic design involves a cyclodextrin (CD) platform bearing a polycationic cluster at the primary face and a doubly-linked aromatic module bridging two consecutive monosaccharide units at the secondary face, which behaves as a topology-encoding element. Subtle differences at the molecular level then translate into disparate morphologies at the nanoscale, including rods, worms, toroids, globules, ellipsoids and spheroids. In vitro evaluation of the transfection capabilities revealed marked selectivity differences as a function of nanocomplex morphology. Remarkably high transfection efficiencies were associated to ellipsoidal or spherical shapes with a lamellar internal arrangement of pDNA chains and CD bilayers. Computational studies support that the stability of such supramolecular edifices is directly related to the tendency of the molecular vector to form noncovalent dimers upon DNA templation. Since the stability of the dimers depends on the protonation state of the polycationic clusters, the co-aggregates display pH responsiveness, which facilitates endosomal scape and timely DNA release, a key step in successful transfection.

We used descriptive and multivariate analyses to evaluate parent-stated likelihood of having their children get a COVID-19 vaccine and to assess the association between likelihood of child COVID-19 vaccination and child age, parent demographics, and parental perceptions about COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: Altogether, 1745 parents responded (87% of eligible parents, 3759 children). Likelihood of child COVID-19 vaccination was as follows: very likely (28%), somewhat likely (18%), somewhat unlikely (9%), very unlikely (33%), and unsure (12%). The stated likelihood of child vaccination was greater among parents of older children (P < .001) as well as among parents who had a bachelor's degree or higher education (P < .001), had already received or were likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (P < .001), or had Democratic affiliation (P < .001); variations existed by race and ethnicity (P = .04).

DESIGN population overall mortality data provided by the Italian National Statistical Office (Istat). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Italian residents 60 years or older from 7,357/7,904 Italian municipalities. For the included municipalities, the number of deaths from any cause from 1 January to 30 May 2020 was available for each day of the 2015-2020 period. Data were stratified by gender, 4 age categories (60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90+), week, and province. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES province- and gender-specific weekly RR curves (age category vs RR), obtained for 13 weeks between 26 February and 26 May; excess mortality; time-varying/weekly classification of provinces. RESULTS these results provide a weekly classification of the Italian provinces based on their RR curves in 5 groups, 2 of which had high and very high excess mortality during the epidemics. Most of the provinces that appeared at least once in the highest-risk group are neighbouring provinces in the Northern Regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Marche (in central Italy), where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. Temporally, most of these provinces remained in the highest-risk group for 4 or 5 weeks; those that entered the group later, improved faster. The overall RR curves for groups differed in magnitude, but also in the shape, which varied markedly also between men and women and, most importantly, in the highest-risk group. CONCLUSIONS this study gives timely re-analysis of the Istat data at weekly level and provides a classification of the geographical and temporal characteristics of the excess mortality in the Italian provinces during the COVID-19 epidemics. As expected, the used clustering method groups the provinces that have similar RR values in the two gender-specific curves.

A disproportionately higher number of African Americans are afflicted with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity), and SARS-CoV-2 has helped expose these health disparities. Several factors including socioeconomic status, inferior health care, and work circumstances contribute to these disparities. Identifying potential inflammatory biomarkers and decreasing basal levels in high-risk individuals with comorbidities through preventive measures is critical. Immune cells, particularly neutrophils, protect us against pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) through increased generation of free radicals or oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that ensnare pathogens, killing them extracellularly. However, continued generation of NETs coupled with the lack of prompt removal pose danger to host cells. NET levels are increased during pro-inflammatory diseases. COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated NET levels, depending upon disease severity. Conceivably, high-risk individuals with elevated basal NET levels would exhibit hyper-inflammation when infected with SARS-CoV-2, amplifying disease severity and deaths. Drugs inhibiting oxidant formation and vitamin supplements decreased NET formation in mice models of inflammation. Thus, preventive treatments lowering NET levels and inflammation in high-risk individuals could mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.","output":"Do free radical NETwork and oxidative stress disparities in African Americans enhance their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The field of laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery is expanding.

Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact, chi-square, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and Kaplan-Meier estimates. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Ninety-one rectal cancer patients with laparoscopic resection were included, 59% were male, and median age was 62 years. Conversion rate was 18.7%. Laparoscopic and open surgery had similar 30-day morbidity and mortality except wound infection, which was lower for the laparoscopic group (p = 0.02). Laparoscopic surgery had similar 30-day readmissions but shorter total length of hospital stay (5 versus 7 days, p < 0.01), time to first flatus (3 versus 4.5 days, p = 0.001), and time to first bowel movement (4 versus 5 days, p = 0.05) when compared with open surgery.

RESULTS There was an overall reduction in the number of admissions due to hip fractures in Period 2020 compared with homologous Period in 2019 (68 patients and 94 patients, respectively). No statistically significant differences could be found regarding age, gender, ASA grade and pre-admission residence among patients admitted during these both periods. Nursing home patients in Period 2020 had a longer hospital stay (p=0.03), independently of the functional status (p=0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in the time it took the patient to go to the emergency department after the fall, place where the fracture had occurred, waiting time to perform the surgery, type of treatment performed, post-surgical complications and mortality.

The ultimate goal of targeted immunization and other disease control strategies is to minimize the impact of outbreaks. It shares similarity with the famous influence maximization problem studied in the field of social network analysis, whose objective is to identify a group of influential individuals to maximize the influence spread over social networks. This study aims to establish the equivalence of the two problems and develop an effective methodology for targeted immunization through the use of influence maximization. METHODS: We present a concise formulation of the targeted immunization problem and show its equivalence to the influence maximization problem under the framework of the Linear Threshold diffusion model. Thus the influence maximization problem, as well as the targeted immunization problem, can be solved by an optimization approach. A Benders decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem for effective solutions. RESULTS: A comprehensive computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance and scalability of the optimization approach on real-world large-scale networks. Computational results show that our proposed approaches achieve more effective solutions compared to existing methods. CONCLUSIONS: We show the equivalence of the outbreak minimization and influence maximization problems and present a concise formulation for the influence maximization problem under the Linear Threshold diffusion model. A tradeoff between computational effectiveness and computational efficiency is illustrated.

However literature is scanty pertaining to the profile and scoring system in sarcoidosis. This study was undertaken to understand the profile of sarcoidosis and an endeavor to assess the functional status with a simplified scoring system. This was an observational study undertaken in the department of Pulmonary Medicine at a tertiary care. The profile of these patients was studied in terms of clinical features, radiological findings, the New Modified Criteria Clinical Radiological Physiological (TNMC CRP) score, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), spirometry, arterial blood gas parameters, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels and tissue biopsy histopathology. The 68 patients included 41 women and 27 men with a mean age of 42.7 years. They comprised of 18 (27%), 39 (57%), 4 (6%), 7 (10%) cases of stage 1, 2, 3, 4 sarcoidosis respectively. Most common presenting symptom and sign was progressive dyspnea 49 (72%), and peripheral lymphadenopathy 15 (22%). Serum ACE was elevated in 57 (83%). The average 6MWD was 360 meters. Most common high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) finding was mediastinal lymphadenopathy and peri-bronchovascular nodules. Spirometry was restrictive abnormality in 48 (96%) patients. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was present in 32 (47%) patients. Tissue diagnosis revealed granulomatous inflammation in 51 biopsies with a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) yield of 62%. The average TNMC CRP score was 5. There was a positive correlation between this score and 6MWD which was statistically significant. The score correlated with the functional status. Diagnosis of sarcoidosis warrants a comprehensive and multimodality approach. HRCT and tissue biopsy are the most important diagnostic armamentariums.

Participants main reasons for likely vaccination uptake/decline were also solicited. Results: 73.5% of participants (95% CI 71.2%, 75.7%) reported being likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19, 17.3% were unsure (95% CI 15.4%, 19.3%), and 9.3% (95% CI 7.9%, 10.8%) reported being unlikely to be vaccinated. The full regression model explained 69.8% of the variance in intention. Intention was associated with having been/intending to be vaccinated for influenza last winter/this winter, and with stronger beliefs about social acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine; the need for vaccination; adequacy of information about the vaccine; and weaker beliefs that the vaccine is unsafe. Beliefs that only those at serious risk of illness should be vaccinated and that the vaccines are just a means for manufacturers to make money were negatively associated with vaccination intention. Conclusions: Most participants reported being likely to get the COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and beliefs are a crucial factor underpinning vaccine intention.

One of the common pathogens involved is canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), however little is known regarding its pathogenesis and the role it plays in the development of CIRD. The pathogenesis of five geographically unrelated canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) isolates was investigated. Following experimental infection in dogs, all five CRCoV isolates gave rise to clinical signs of respiratory disease consistent with that observed during natural infection. The presence of CRCoV was associated with marked histopathological changes in the nares and trachea, with loss and damage to tracheal cilia, accompanied by inflammation. Viral shedding was readily detected from the oropharynx up to 10 days post infection, but there was little or no evidence of rectal shedding. The successful re-isolation of CRCoV from a wide range of respiratory and mucosal associated lymphoid tissues, and lung lavage fluids demonstrates a clear tropism of CRCoV for respiratory tissues and fulfils the final requirement for Koch's postulates. By study day 14 dogs had seroconverted to CRCoV and the antibodies raised were neutralising against both homologous and heterologous strains of CRCoV in vitro, thus demonstrating antigenic homogeneity among CRCoV strains from the two continents. Defining the role that CRCoV and other agents play in CIRD is a considerable, but important, challenge if the disease is to be managed, treated and prevented more successfully.

There is a great lack of research assessing the efficacy of telehealth treatment in more acute, intensive treatment settings such as a partial hospital. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of behavioral health treatment has transitioned to a virtual format. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the effectiveness of our partial hospital program (PHP). METHOD The sample included 207 patients who were treated virtually from May 2020 to September 2020 and a comparison group of 207 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program a year earlier. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction, symptoms, coping ability, functioning, and general well-being. RESULTS For both the in-person and telehealth methods of delivering partial hospital level of care, patients were highly satisfied with treatment and reported a significant reduction in symptoms and suicidality from admission to discharge. On the modified Remission from Depression Questionnaire, the primary outcome measure, both groups reported a significant (P < .01) improvement in functioning, coping ability, positive mental health, and general well-being. A large effect size of treatment (Cohen d > 0.8) was found in both treatment groups. The only significant difference in outcome between the patients treated in the different formats was a greater length of stay (mean  SD of 13.5  8.1 vs 8.5  5.0 days, t = 7.61, P < .001) and greater likelihood of staying in treatment until completion (72.9% vs 62.3%, 2 = 5.34, P < .05) in the virtually treated patients. CONCLUSIONS Telehealth partial hospital treatment was as effective as in-person treatment in terms of patient satisfaction, symptom reduction, suicidal ideation reduction, and improved functioning and well-being. The treatment completion rate was higher in the telehealth cohort, and several patients who were treated virtually commented that they never would have presented for in-person treatment even if there was no pandemic.

In this study, we tested the prophylactic effect of a new generation of probiotic like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) on acute radiation-induced colonic lesions. Experiments were carried out in a preclinical model of pelvic radiation disease. Rats were locally irradiated at 29 Gray in the colon resulting in colonic epithelial barrier rupture. Three days before the irradiation and up to 3 d after the irradiation, the F. prausnitzii A2-165 strain was administered daily (intragastrically) to test its putative protective effects. Results showed that prophylactic F. prausnitzii treatment limits radiation-induced para-cellular hyperpermeability, as well as the infiltration of neutrophils (MPO+ cells) in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, F. prausnitzii treatment reduced the severity of the morphological change of crypts, but also preserved the pool of Sox-9+ stem/progenitor cells, the proliferating epithelial PCNA+ crypt cells and the Dclk1+/IL-25+ differentiated epithelial tuft cells. The benefit of F. prausnitzii was associated with increased production of IL-18 by colonic crypt epithelial cells.

Multiple other epidemiological and immunological features are less well-defined including if obesity enhances susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, influences symptom phenotype, or impedes or alters the immune response to infection. Given the substantial global burden of obesity and given these uncertainties, we examined the epidemiology and immunology of obesity and SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Industry employees were invited to participate in a prospective SARS-CoV-2 serology-based cohort study. Blood and baseline survey measures that included demographics, comorbidities, and prior COVID-19 compatible symptoms were collected. Serological testing and interim symptom reporting were conducted monthly. SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays included an IgG ELISA targeting the spike RBD, multiarray Luminex targeting 20 viral antigens, pseudovirus neutralization, and T cell ELISPOT assays. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were used to identify differences in seroprevalence, clinical features, and immune parameters by BMI. RESULTS: Of 4469 individuals enrolled, 322 (7.21%) were seropositive. Adjusted seroprevalence was non-significantly lower with higher BMI. Obesity was associated with increased reporting of fever (OR 3.43 [95% CI 1.58-7.60]) and multiple other symptoms and aggregate measures. There were no identifiable differences in immune response between obese and non-obese individuals. DISCUSSION: We present benchmark data from a prospective serology-based cohort on the immunoepidemiology of BMI and SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest obesity is not linked to an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; that symptom phenotype is strongly influenced by obesity; and that despite evidence of obesity-associated immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, there is no evidence of a muted or suppressed immune response across multiple immune measures among non-severe infections.","output":"Epidemiological and immunological features of obesity and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To assess perception of COVID-19 exposure risk, understanding and confidence in the associated Public Health guidelines and training in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) amongst dental practitioners (DPs).

Moreover, earlier reports showed evidence of falciparum malaria/HEVcoexistence. Although the Sofosbuvir/Ribavirin combination was recently proposed in the treatment of HEV-infected patients, no specific antiviral drug has been approved so far, thereby urging the search for new therapies. Fortunately, drug repurposing offers a good alternative to this end. In this study, we report the in silico and in vitro activities of 8 licensed antimalarial drugs and two anti-hepatitis C virus agents used as references (Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin), for repurposing as antiviral inhibitors against HEV. Compounds were docked against five HEV-specific targets including the Zinc-binding non-structural protein (6NU9), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), cryoEM structure of HEV VLP, genotype 1 (6LAT), capsid protein ORF-2, genotype 3 (2ZTN), and the E2s domain of genotype 1 (3GGQ) using the iGEMDOCK software and their pharmacokinetic profiles and toxicities were predicted using ADMETlab2.0. Their in vitro effects were also assessed on a gt 3 p6Gluc replicon system using the luciferase reporter assay. The docking results showed that Sofosbuvir had the best binding affinities with 6NU9 (? 98.22 kcal/mol), RdRp (? 113.86 kcal/mol), 2ZTN (? 106.96 kcal/mol), while Ribavirin better collided with 6LAT (? 99.33 kcal/mol). Interestingly, Lumefantrine showed the best affinity with 3GGQ (-106.05 kcal/mol). N-desethylamodiaquine and Amodiaquine presented higher binding scores with 6NU9 (? 93.5 and ? 89.9 kcal/mol respectively vs ? 80.83 kcal/mol), while Lumefantrine had the greatest energies with RdRp (? 102 vs ? 84.58), and Pyrimethamine and N-desethylamodiaquine had stronger affinities with 2ZTN compared to Ribavirin (? 105.17 and ? 102.65 kcal/mol vs ? 96.04 kcal/mol). The biological screening demonstrated a significant (P < 0.001) antiviral effect on replication with 1 M N-desethylamodiaquine, the major metabolite of Amodiaquine. However, Lumefantrine showed no effect at the tested concentrations (1, 5, and 10 M). The biocomputational analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of both drugs revealed a low permeability of Lumefantrine and a specific inactivation by CYP3A2 which might partly contribute to the short half-time of this drug. In conclusion, Amodiaquine and Lumefantrine may be good antimalarial drug candidates for repurposing against HEV. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments are necessary to validate these predictions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven an patients with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARStions2 in an upper respiratory tract sample or typical chest computed tomography lesion were eligible for this caseCcontrol study. Patients meeting the criteria for hemoperfusion including clinical and laboratory indices, were evaluated for outcomes such as hospitalization length and mortality. Patients were divided into three groups, i.e., patients who received hemoperfusion without a need for mechanical ventilation (MV), patients who received hemoperfusion before MV, and patients who received hemoperfusion after MV. RESULTS: Among 37 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure, 32% were female with a mean age of 55.54 (standard deviation 14.1) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups in terms of length of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (P-tayns: 0.593 and 0.243, respectively, confidence interval [CI]: 95%).

CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old male was referred to our hospital for fever and acute pain in the left leg. At history, the same patient had endovascular procedure for a large symptomatic popliteal aneurysm, treated through release of three MFM. The pulmonary CT scan showed COVID-19 infection with confirm of rhino-laryngeal swab. Duplex ultrasound and CT-angiography showed complete thrombosis of stents. The treatment consisted of mechanical thrombectomy using an 8Fr catheter Rotarex plus release of Vibahn stent-graft. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 patients can present arterial occlusion. In literature are not reported cases about thrombosis peripheral stent. Minimally invasive approaches in redo-procedure reduce risk of infection. Rotarex device was used in revascularization of acute and subacute iliac and femoropopliteal arteries. The goal is to have a debulking, to avoid an incomplete deployment of stent-graft. In our precedent experience, MFM and stent-graft to treatment of popliteal aneurism were safe. It is important to monitor these patients for early identification of failure and rapprochement.

A series of PBPs with various polymer backbone structures were prepared and examined for their proteolytic stability and bioactivity. We discovered that an increase in the hydrophobicity of the polymer backbones is predictive of an elevation in proteolytic stability of the side-chain peptides. Computer simulations, together with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, revealed globular morphologies for these polymers, in which pendant peptides condense around hydrophobic synthetic polymer backbones driven by the hydrophobic effect. As the hydrophobicity of the polymer backbones increases, the extent of solvent exposure of peptide cleavage sites decreases, reducing their accessibility to proteolytic enzymes.

We discuss how the changing nature of screen technology might be altering how children interpret what they see, and raise the possibility that this may render prevailing evidence as historical documentation, rather than setting out established developmental milestones that transcend the period in which they were documented. We contend that recognizing the significance of historically changing contexts in developmental psychology is timely when the COVID-19 climate is pushing data collection on-line for many labs, often using tasks that were developed primarily for face-to-face contexts.","output":"Social learning from media: The need for a culturally diachronic developmental psychology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic and proliferation of misinformation regarding science highlights the importance of improving general science literacy. The continued preponderance of neuromyths among educators is of concern, especially in lower- and middle-income countries. METHOD: Using an adapted questionnaire, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among teachers in a small island developing state in the Caribbean. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the sample were unable to recognise at least 50% of the myths. Regression analysis demonstrated that higher scores in brain knowledge and exposure to prior teacher-training increased belief in neuromyths. On the other hand, specific in-service training pertaining to educational neuroscience improved scores. CONCLUSION: Neuromyths are prevalent among teachers and appear to inform their teaching practice. Further research needs to be conducted to explore not just the prevalence of these myths but in what ways they may be impacting teaching and learning outcomes in the classroom.","output":"A cross-sectional study of neuromyths among teachers in a Caribbean nation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous cross-sectional studies reported positive effects of meditation on the brain areas related to attention and executive function in the healthy elderly population. Effects of long-term regular meditation in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease dementia (AD) have rarely been studied. In this study, we explored changes in cortical thickness and gray matter volume in meditation-na?ve persons with MCI or mild AD after long-term meditation intervention. MCI or mild AD patients underwent detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessment and were assigned into meditation or non-meditation groups. High resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) were acquired at baseline and after 6 months. Longitudinal symmetrized percentage changes (SPC) in cortical thickness and gray matter volume were estimated. Left caudal middle frontal, left rostral middle frontal, left superior parietal, right lateral orbitofrontal, and right superior frontal cortices showed changes in both cortical thickness and gray matter volume; the left paracentral cortex showed changes in cortical thickness; the left lateral occipital, left superior frontal, left banks of the superior temporal sulcus (bankssts), and left medial orbitofrontal cortices showed changes in gray matter volume. All these areas exhibited significantly higher SPC values in meditators as compared to non-meditators. Conversely, the left lateral occipital, and right posterior cingulate cortices showed significantly lower SPC values for cortical thickness in the meditators. In hippocampal subfields analysis, we observed significantly higher SPC in gray matter volume of the left CA1, molecular layer HP, and CA3 with a trend for increased gray matter volume in most other areas. No significant changes were found for the hippocampal subfields in the right hemisphere. Analysis of the subcortical structures revealed significantly increased volume in the right thalamus in the meditation group. The results of the study point out that long-term meditation practice in persons with MCI or mild AD leads to salutary changes in cortical thickness and gray matter volumes. Most of these changes were observed in the brain areas related to executive control and memory that are prominently at risk in neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"Effects of Meditation on Structural Changes of the Brain in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimers Disease Dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the results obtained during the mathematical modeling of the regulatory mechanisms of pathologies in the human nervous system responsible for acute respiratory failure and smell and taste loss in patients with COVID-19 Analysis of the characteristic behaviors of solutions of the developed functional differential equations with delay shows the presence of extinction modes, stable stationary state, stable self-oscillatory behavior, irregular functioning and the effect of sharp destructive changes-the \\"black hole\\" effect in the model of central nervous system regulation ? 2020, Research Publication All rights reserved","output":"Mathematical modeling of regulatory mechanisms of the nervous system pathologies in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Professional oral care in the intensive care unit may reduce the incidence of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia, which increases the patients mortality rate. This study aimed to develop a competency for professional oral hygiene care of endotracheally-intubated intensive-care patients. METHODS: First, we developed a competency draft by reviewing the literature on oral hygiene care of patients in the intensive care unit. Next, we developed expert validity test questionnaires using this draft and conducted expert validity tests twice on 18 experts. We determined competency as a content validity index of 0.8 or more and received expert additive opinions about competency through an open-questionnaire expert validity test paper in this methodology study. RESULTS: The content validity index ranged from 0.8 ~ 1.0 for all items. The competency of professionalism comprised 2 sub-competencies with 7 behavioral indicators. POHC preparation comprised 3 sub-competencies with 10 behavioral indicators. POHC implementation comprised 3 sub-competencies with 6 behavioral indicators. POHC evaluation comprised 2 sub-competencies with 8 behavioral indicators. Lastly Cooperation among experts comprised 3 sub-competencies with 7 behavioral indicatiors.

The consequences of delayed diagnosis and failure to obtain timely intervention include significant communication impairment and negative socioeconomic effects. Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) national standards dictate that all infants should be screened and diagnosed by 3 months of age and there is a need for interventions that promote adherence to timely diagnosis. Patient navigation (PN) has been shown to be efficacious to decrease non-adherence with infant hearing diagnostic care; however, PN has yet to be tested in diverse communities or implemented into real-world settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The proposed research is a community-engaged, type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of a PN intervention aimed at decreasing infant hearing diagnosis non-adherence after failed newborn hearing screening, delivered in state-funded EHDI clinics. Guided by our community advisory board and partners, we aim to (1) test the effectiveness of PN to decrease non-adherence to receipt of infant hearing diagnosis within 3 months after birth using a stepped-wedge trial design, (2) investigate implementation outcomes and factors influencing implementation and (3) determine the cost-effectiveness of PN from the perspective of third-party payers. The study will be conducted from April 2019 until March 2024. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board. Although all research involving human subjects contains some risk, there are no known serious risks anticipated from participating in this study. We will seek to disseminate our results in a systematic fashion to patients, key stakeholder, policymakers and the scientific community. Our results will impact the field by partnering with communities to inform the scale-up of this innovative patient supportive intervention to create efficient and effective EHDI programmes and maximise public health impact.

We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. Methods: We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV, the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. Results: With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to >99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. Conclusion: To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.","output":"Testing for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in populations with low infection prevalence: the largely ignored problem of false positives and the value of repeat testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A principios de 2020, marcas de ropa y minoristas cancelaron pedidos por valor de 40 000 millones de dlares de los Estados Unidos, con consecuencias drsticas para proveedores y trabajadores.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the usability and acceptability of the VP application with a focus on exploring perspectives on accessibility. METHODS: The study used an exploratory sequential mixed method design consisting of a satisfaction survey and interviews. Survey data were analysed descriptively to assess satisfaction with the application and to identify interview discussion areas. Interview data were analysed using the Framework Approach to thematic analysis. Participants were hospital or community pharmacists, or pre-registration pharmacists. RESULTS: A total of 94 survey responses were collected and 22 respondents went on to take part in an interview. Participants reported liking the concept and delivery of the VP, particularly the high-quality technology. They also reported finding it usable, and appeared to favour its mobility and accessibility, particularly as the VP can be used on any internet accessible device, including mobile phones, with no specific requirements. Amendments that were suggested included quickening the delivery of some animations and improving navigation within the application, possibly through a button to return to the previous step should a mistake be made.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values produced from April 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021, were compared with national COVID-19 confirmed cases notifications according to their geographical and time distribution. These Ct values were evaluated against both a phase diagram predicting the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and an age-structured model estimating COVID-19 prevalence in Belgium. ResultsOver 155,811 RT-PCR performed, 12,799 were positive and 7,910 Ct values were available for analysis. The 14-day median Ct values were negatively correlated with the 14-day mean daily positive tests with a lag of 17 days. In addition, the 14-day mean daily positive tests in LHUB-ULB were strongly correlated with the 14-day mean confirmed cases in the Brussels-Capital and in Belgium with coinciding start, peak and end of the different waves of the epidemic. Ct values decreased concurrently with the forecasted phase-shifts of the diagram. Similarly, the evolution of 14-day median Ct values was negatively correlated with daily estimated prevalence for all age-classes. ConclusionWe provide preliminary evidence that trends of Ct values can help to both follow and predict the epidemics trajectory at local and national levels, underlining that consolidated microbiology laboratories can act as epidemic sensors as they gather data that are representative of the geographical area they serve.","output":"Leveraging of SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle thresholds values (Ct) to forecast COVID-19 trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded extensive impacts globally in the year of 2020 Although the mental health of children and adolescents may be particularly susceptible to stressors stemming from the pandemic and anti-contagion policies, most ongoing efforts are geared toward curbing the viral spread In the current perspective, we have identified four domains of factors corresponding to an ecological framework that may directly or indirectly influence the mental health of children and adolescents during the pandemic The evidence suggests that anti-contagion policies might trigger cascades that impact the mental health of children and their families through multiple different sectors that used to form a safety net for youths Additionally, children with neuropsychiatric disorders could experience exacerbated symptoms during the pandemic Furthermore, the risk of domestic violence has surged during the pandemic, which further compounds the imminent mental health crisis A mental health pandemic could be inevitable if no proactive prevention strategies were in place Therefore, we recommend understanding each individual mental health risk pathway via the ecological framework in order to develop integrative prevention and intervention strategies","output":"A Framework-Based Approach to Assessing Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children and Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents an overview of studies of the factors that affect health in the contemporary city The increase in the urban population makes it necessary to analyze factors (environmental, social, etc ) and features of the urban structure in terms of their impact on the quality and standards of living However, assessments of the city in the study of healthy lifestyle are contradictory On the one hand, researchers emphasize the availability of medical care, effective fight against infectious diseases, and numerous attempts to transform the visual urban space On the other hand, researchers stress the spatial inequality of the urban structure (for example, in access to health care), the spread of noncommunicable and lifestyle diseases in cities, the destruction of social ties and the problem of loneliness Therefore, it is necessary to systematize the current research, identify the main risks of urban lifestyle, and discuss the role of social sciences in such interdisciplinary studies The proposed typology of health research in the contemporary city is based on Yu P Lisitsyns ratio of factors that determine the level of health Although many studies claim an integrated approach, the analysis showed that most of them present one of three approaches: the study of sanitary-hygienic features of the urban space (or its medical aspects);the study of ecology and architecture of the urban space;the study of social-psychological features of the urban lifestyle The systematization of the main risks of the urban lifestyle allowed the author to identify the priority areas of its study Thus, based on the features of the covid-19 pandemic in cities, the author argues that there is a need for more active participation of sociologists in the discussion of both infectious and non-communicable diseases, which should focus on social factors of their spread, course, prevention and control ?

Disruption of several genes has been shown to dramatically lower plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in mice as well as non-human primates. More precise modification of cardiovascular targets has also been achieved through homology-directed repair or base editing. Improved viral vectors and nanoparticle delivery systems are addressing important delivery challenges and helping to mitigate safety concerns.

Our analyses demonstrate sufficient conditions on the model parameters to ensure long-term stability of the HJB solutions and stable growth rates for the optimal portfolios. To gauge how these optimal portfolios behave in practice, we perform backtests on historical stock prices of the S&P 500 constituents from year 2000 through year 2021. These backtests suggest three key conclusions: that the proposed co-integrated model with eigenportfolios being factors can generate a large number of co-integrated stocks over a long time horizon, that the optimal portfolios are sensitive to parameter estimation, and that the statistical arbitrage strategies are more profitable in periods when overall market volatilities are high.","output":"Statistical Arbitrage for Multiple Co-Integrated Stocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are a group of social scientists from Austria, Germany and Switzerland who drew attention to the care crisis in a cross-national 'Care manifesto' as early as 2013.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted in Tertiary Multi-disciplinary Endometriosis Care Hospital over a period of 8 months which included 50 patients who underwent a planned laparoscopic endometriosis excisional surgery after a dedicated USG assessment using International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) protocol and #ENZIAN score (updated ENZIAN classification), between Feb 2021 and Sept 2021 at Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. The pre-operative USG findings were reported in a structured reporting format and intraoperative findings were classified using the standard #ENZIAN classification. No prospective interventions were done. A review of pre-operative ultrasound and laparoscopic findings as per the #ENZIAN was done. RESULTS: Sensitivity and the negative predictive value of ultrasound were 86% and 84.2% for peritoneal lesions, 97% and 93.3% for left ovarian lesions, 93% and 91.6% for right ovarian lesions, 91% and 84% for left tubal lesions, 90% and 86.3% for right tubal lesions, 93% and 75% for uterosacral ligaments, 93.3% and 97% for rectal lesions and sensitivity and negative predictive values were 100% for rectovaginal lesions, adenomyosis, and ureteric lesions as confirmed on laparoscopy.

From a clinical perspective, a uniform and shared reporting system across imaging and therapeutic modalities will simplify communication, improving patient management by conservative or surgical treatments, avoiding multiple repeat surgeries, and improving quality of treatment.","output":"Pre-operative mapping and structured reporting of pelvic endometriotic lesions on dynamic ultrasound and its correlation on laparoscopy using the #ENZIAN classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosing the early stages of canine Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is complicated by day-to-day arrhythmia variability, and absence of reliable, transthoracic echocardiographic features. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic identification of transmural fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricle. Reduction of immunofluorescent signal for plakoglobin (PG) at the intercalated disc (ID) is reported in ARVC-affected humans and boxers. Our objective was to determine whether reduced immunofluorescent signal for PG in endomyocardial biopsy samples (EMBs) correspond with a histopathologic diagnosis of ARVC. Here, 49 dogs were evaluated: 43 with advanced cardiac disease and 6 non-clinical boxers with mild to moderate ventricular arrhythmia (VA) burden. EMBs were obtained from all dogs; samples were prepared with antibodies recognizing cadherin (PC) and PG and evaluated with confocal microscopy. Investigators were blinded to breed and clinical status. ARVC was histopathologically diagnosed in 8 out of 49 dogs. Of these, three out of eight had clinical signs consistent with ARVC (two boxers, one English bulldog) and reduced PG signal at ID; five out of eight were non-clinical boxers with moderate VA and no reduction in PG. A total of 41 out of 49 dogs were histopathologically diagnosed with non-ARVC cardiac disease; 1 out of 41 showed reduction of PG at ID, while 40 out of 41 had no PG reduction. These results suggest that EMB PG signal is reduced in dogs with advanced ARVC, but not in the occult phase of the disease. Additionally, presence of PG at ID supports a diagnosis of non-ARVC cardiac disease in dogs with clinical signs. These results may offer an additional test that helps differentiate advanced ARVC from other myocardial diseases.","output":"Immunofluorescent Localization of Plakoglobin Is Altered in Endomyocardial Biopsy Samples from Dogs with Clinically Relevant Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lymphedema is a chronic disease that results in swelling and decreased function due to abnormal lymphatic fluid clearance and chronic inflammation.

The students were assessed on measures (including validated psychometric instruments) of perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived sufficiency of resources, sources of COVID-19 information, perceived satisfaction with support, anxiety and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Local students had higher susceptibility to COVID-19 (p<0.001) but decreased sufficiency with resources (p<0.001) and anxiety (p<0.001) compared with international students. Staying with family members, satisfaction with support, and information seeking were the factors that predicted anxiety among international students (all p-values<0.05), while information seeking predicted local students anxiety (p<0.001). Furthermore, staying with family members, susceptibility to COVID-19, and sufficiency with resources were the factors that predicted suicidal ideation among international students (all p-values<0.05), while being a male and satisfaction with support predicted suicidal ideation among local students (all p-values<0.05).

SETTING: The survey was initiated by the Education Committee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (EACTAIC) PARTICIPANTS: EACTAIC fellows, EACTAIC and non-EACTAIC subscribers to the EACTAIC newsletter and EACTAIC followers on different social media platforms. INTERVENTIONS: After obtaining the consent of participants, we assessed the peri-operative management of COVID-19 patients, infrastructural aspects of the workplace, local routines for preoperative testing, the perceived availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the impact of COVID-19 on fellowship training. In addition participants rated suggested solutions by the investigators to cope with the interruption of fellowship training using a traffic light signal scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected 193 responses from 54 countries. 82.4% of respondents reported cancelling or postponing elective cases during the first wave. Of the respondents, 89.7% had provided care for COVID-19 patients, 75.1% reported staff in their center being reassigned to work in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 45% perceived a shortage of PPE at their centers. Most respondents reported the termination of local educational activities (79.6%) and fellowship assessments (51.5%) because of the pandemic (although 84% of them reported having time to participate in online teaching), and 83% reported a definitive psychological impact. More than 90% of the respondents chose green and/or yellow traffic lights to rate the importance of the suggested solutions to cope with the interrupted fellowship training during the pandemic.

Currently, representatives from industry, academia, and governments across the world are working to build the educational structures needed to produce the quantum workforce of the future. Less attention has been paid to growing quantum computing capacity at the high school level. This article details work at The University of Texas at Austin to develop and pilot the first full-year high school quantum computing class. Over the course of two years, researchers and practitioners involved with the project learned several pedagogical and practical lessons that can be helpful for quantum computing course design and implementation at the secondary level. In particular, we find that the use of classical optics provides a clear and accessible avenue for representing quantum states and gate operators and facilitates both learning and the transfer of knowledge to other Science, Technology, and Engineering (STEM) skills. Furthermore, students found that exploring quantum optical phenomena prior to the introduction of mathematical models helped in the understanding and mastery of the material.","output":"Piloting a full-year, optics-based high school course on quantum computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of primary and revision arthroplasties of the hip and knee joint. Methods: This study compared the data on knee and hip arthroplasty procedures from 2 hospitals (primary and revision) conducted in two periods: the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland (from 4 March 2020 to 15 October 2020) and the corresponding period prior to the pandemic (from 4 March 2019 to 15 October 2019). We compared the epidemiological data, demographic data, and hospital stay duration data from these two periods. Results: Our analysis demonstrated that the total number of hip arthroplasties conducted in 2020 decreased by 26% in comparison with 2019. In the case of knee arthroplasties, the total number of procedures in the evaluated period in 2020 decreased by 44%. Our study also showed that the mean time of hospital stay for orthopedic patients following hip or knee arthroplasty was 22.87% shorter. The female-to-male patient ratio decreased between the analyzed periods, and this was 22.96% lower during the pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic in these two hospitals in Poland led to reduced numbers of hip and knee replacement procedures, shorter hospital stays, and a decreased female-to-male patient ratio.

METHODS: A longitudinal data collection method was adopted to verify the mood of the participants before and after walking. The survey was conducted with 100 participants in a walking path in Shiraz, Iran, on Jan 2021. The quantitative analysis methods were performed in SPSS to examine the mental wellbeing outcomes of walking in the outdoor walking path when considering the psychological impacts of the pandemic and the quantity. RESULTS: The result affirms the positive contribution of walking in the improvement of mental-wellbeing-mood during the pandemic; though, such a mood boost is in a direct relationship with the quantity of the activity within a week. Moreover, other factors can play a significant role, including the mood before walking, and the age of the participants.

In many instances, a careful evaluation of the tissue reactions will result in a specific diagnosis or at least in a narrow range of differentials, which will assist the clinician to arrive at a definite diagnosis, when combining our interpretation with the clinical presentation of the patient and high-resolution computed tomography. In this review, we will exclude granulomatous pneumonias as well as vascular diseases (primary arterial pulmonary hypertension and vasculitis); however, pulmonary hypertension as a complication of interstitial processes will be mentioned. Few entities of pneumoconiosis presenting as an interstitial process will be included, whereas those with granulomatous reactions will be excluded. Drug reactions will be touched on within interstitial pneumonias, but will not be a major focus. In contrast to the present-day preferred descriptive pattern recognition, it is the authors strong belief that pathologists should always try to dig out the etiology from a tissue specimen and not being satisfied with just a pattern description. It is the difference of sorting tissue reactions into boxes by their main pattern, without recognizing minor or minute reactions, which sometimes will guide one to the correct etiology-oriented interpretation. In the authors personal perspective, tissue reactions can even be sorted by their timeliness, and therefore, ordered by the time of appearance, providing an insight into the pathogenesis and course of a disease.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, patients still needed therapy, but in-person therapy sessions became unsafe. The current study measured how many therapists are using online therapy before vs. during COVID-19, how much training they have received, and their knowledge about legal restrictions on using telepsychology. A sample of 768 U.S.A. mental health professionals completed a 29-item online survey. Results show that before COVID-19, most therapists only saw their patients in person (e.g., at the therapists office), but during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all therapists used a wide range of telecommunication technologies to communicate with their quarantined patients, including texting, telephones, video conferences, and even virtual reality. According to within-subject related samples comparisons, 39% of survey respondents used telepsychology before COVID-19, vs. 98% during COVID-19 ((2) = 450.02, p< 0.001). Therapists reported high treatment effectiveness using telepsychology (7.45 on 0C10 scale). However, overall, on a 0C10 scale, therapists reported a significant increase in feeling burned out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mean = 3.93 (SD = 1.93) before vs. 6.22 (SD = 2.27) during the pandemic (Z = ?18.57, p < 0.001). Although the APA ethics guidelines encourage therapists to use telepsychology with their patients during the crisis, gaps in respondents knowledge identify a need for increased specialized training and education. Although the current study showed that virtual reality is rarely used by the therapists surveyed, virtual reality is a promising new telepsychology technology. Billions of dollars are currently being invested in mass producing immersive virtual reality systems. In the future, as networked immersive Virtual Reality becomes more widely available, therapists and patients in physically different locations will be able to meet in a shared computer-generated world designed for therapy sessions, potentially including group sessions. Telepsychology and virtual reality have the potential to be increasingly valuable tools to help therapists mitigate the consequences of COVID-19.

Herein, a robust and general bottom-up biofunctionalization approach via surface engineering is reported aiming at providing the bases for the fabrication of the first 3D-printed COVID-19 immunosensor prototype with electronic readout. The 3D-printed COVID-19 immunosensor was constructed by covalently anchoring the COVID-19 recombinant protein on a 3D-printed graphene-based nanocomposite electrode surface.

In some countries, the governments also subsidized consumer spending on part of retail services to help struggling businesses. To evaluate the costs and benefits of government interventions in retail services, it is necessary to measure the infectiousness of each type of consumer activity. METHODS: This study regresses the log difference over seven days in the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan on lagged values of household expenditures per household on eating out, traveling, admissions to entertainment facilities, clothing and footwear, and the other items, as well as a measure of mobility in public transportation in the past 14 days. The sample period of the dependent variable is set from March 1, 2020, to February 1, 2021, in order to avoid a possible structural break due to the spread of mutant strains in 2021. The regression model is estimated by the Bayesian method with a non-informative (improper) prior. The estimated model is evaluated by out-of-sample forecast performance from February 2, 2021, onward. RESULTS: The out-of-sample forecasts of the regression by the posterior means of regression coefficients perform well before the spread of the Delta variant in Japan since June 2021. R(2) for the out-of-sample forecasts from February 2, 2021, to June 30, 2021, is 0.60. The dependent variable of the regression overshot the out-of-sample forecasts from mid-June to August 2021. Then, the out-of-sample forecasts overpredicted the dependent variable for the rest of 2021.

It is important to determine the performance of such systems in specific patient populations. We aimed to validate and determine within-day reliability of an IMU system for measuring lower limb gait kinematics and temporal-spatial parameters (TSP) in people with and without HIV. METHODS Gait was recorded in eight adults with HIV (PLHIV) and eight HIV-seronegative participants (SNP), using IMUs and optical motion capture (OMC) simultaneously. Participants performed six gait trials. Fifteen TSP and 28 kinematic angles were extracted. Intraclass correlations (ICC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess concurrent validity of the IMU system (relative to OMC) separately in PLHIV and SNP. IMU reliability was assessed during within-session retest of trials. ICCs were used to assess relative reliability. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and percentage SEM were used to assess absolute reliability. RESULTS Between-system TSP differences demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent ICCs (0.71-0.99), except for double support time and temporophasic parameters (< 0.60). All TSP demonstrated good mean absolute percentage errors (7.40%). For kinematics, ICCs were acceptable to excellent (0.75-1.00) for all but three range of motion (ROM) and four discrete angles. RMSE and bias were 0.0-4.7 for all but two ROM and 10 discrete angles. In both groups, TSP reliability was acceptable to excellent for relative (ICC 0.75-0.99) (except for one temporal and two temporophasic parameters) and absolute (%SEM 1.58-15.23) values. Reliability trends of IMU-measured kinematics were similar between groups and demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent relative reliability (ICC 0.76-0.99) and clinically acceptable absolute reliability (SEM 0.7-4.4) for all but two and three discrete angles, respectively. Both systems demonstrated similar magnitude and directional trends for differences when comparing the gait of PLHIV with that of SNP. CONCLUSIONS IMU-based gait analysis is valid and reliable when applied in PLHIV; demonstrating a sufficiently low precision error to be used for clinical interpretation (< 5 for most kinematics; < 20% for TSP).

SEMs typically represent counts of individuals in discrete infection states using Markov jump processes (MJPs), but are computationally challenging as imperfect surveillance, lack of subject-level information, and temporal coarseness of the data obscure the true epidemic. Analytic integration over the latent epidemic process is impossible, and integration via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is cumbersome due to the dimensionality and discreteness of the latent state space. Simulation-based computational approaches can address the intractability of the MJP likelihood, but are numerically fragile and prohibitively expensive for complex models.

We used an endangered soaring migrant, the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, as an example species to assess important threats in 13 countries along the eastern Mediterranean flyway. We tracked 71 birds using satellite telemetry to quantify mortalities, surveyed 4198 km of powerlines to detect dead birds, conducted 910 interviews to quantify the prevalence of poison use, and assessed the magnitude of direct persecution by surveying markets and hunters. We lost 44 birds (50% in Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, 16% in the Middle East, and 34% in Africa), and mortality causes varied geographically.

In this report, we assess the role of the MHV receptor (MHVR) in controlling this variable virus-induced cytopathology. We developed human (HeLa) cell lines in which the MHVR was produced in a regulated fashion by placing MHVR cDNA under the control of an inducible promoter. Depending on the extent of induction, MHVR levels ranged from less than approximately 1,500 molecules per cell (designated R(lo)) to approximately 300,000 molecules per cell (designated R(hi)). Throughout this range, the otherwise MHV-resistant HeLa cells were rendered susceptible to infection. However, infection in the R(lo) cells occurred without any overt evidence of cytopathology, while the corresponding R(hi) cells died within 14 h after infection. When the HeLa-MHVR cells were infected with vaccinia virus recombinants encoding MHV spike (S) proteins, the R(hi) cells succumbed within 12 h postinfection; R(lo) cells infected in parallel were intact, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. This acute cytopathology was not due solely to syncytium formation between the cells producing S and MHVR, because fusion-blocking antiviral antibodies did not prevent it. These findings raised the possibility of an intracellular interaction between S and MHVR in the acute cell death. Indeed, we identified intracellular complexes of S and MHVR via coimmunoprecipitation of endoglycosidase H-sensitive forms of the two proteins.

Although most clinical efforts within hospitals were diverted towards the care of virally infected patients, therapies for patients with cancer, including radiotherapy (RT), have continued. During both the first and second pandemic waves, several national and regional organizations provided Italian and Lombardian RT departments with detailed guidelines aimed at ensuring safe treatments during the pandemic. The spread of infection among patients and personnel was limited by adopting strict measures, including triage procedures, interpersonal distance, and adequate implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE). Screening procedures addressed to both the healthcare workforce and patients, such as periodic nasopharyngeal swabs, have allowed the early identification of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 cases, thus reducing the spread of the infection. Prevention of infection was deemed of paramount importance to protect both patients and personnel and to ensure the availability of a minimum number of staff members to maintain clinical activity. The choice of treating COVID-19-positive patients has represented a matter of debate, and the risk of oncologic progression has been weighted against the risk of infection of personnel and other patients. Such risk was minimized by creating dedicated paths, reserving time slots, applying intensified cleaning procedures, and supplying personnel and staff with appropriate PPE. Remote working of research staff, medical physicists, and, in some cases, radiation oncologists has prevented overcrowding of shared spaces, reducing infection spread.","output":"Almost one year of COVID-19 pandemic: how radiotherapy centers have counteracted its impact on cancer treatment in Lombardy, Italy.

We investigated the potential indirect and direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human pancreatic islets in 10 patients who became hyperglycemic after COVID-19. While there was no evidence of peripheral anti-islet autoimmunity, the serum of these patients displayed toxicity on human pancreatic islets, which can be abrogated by the use of anti-IL1?, anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF-, cytokines known to be highly upregulated during COVID-19. Interestingly, the receptors of those aforementioned cytokines were highly expressed on human pancreatic islets. An increase in peripheral unmethylated INS DNA, a marker of cell death, was evident in several patients with COVID-19. Pathology of the pancreas from deceased hyperglycemic patients who had COVID-19, revealed mild lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets and pancreatic lymph nodes. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific viral RNA, along with the presence of several immature insulin granules or proinsulin, were detected in post-mortem pancreatic tissues, suggestive of ?-cell altered proinsulin processing, as well as ?-cell degeneration and hyperstimulation. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 may negatively affect human pancreatic islets function and survival by creating inflammatory conditions and possibly with a direct tropism, which may in turn lead to metabolic abnormalities observed in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Indirect and Direct Effects of SARS-CoV-2 on Human Pancreatic Islets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health programs began as an attempt to fight infectious diseases that are difficult to address without collective action.

No country was fully prepared to face this global pandemic, and Indonesia is no exception. For Indonesia, this pandemic shook not only the public health service system but also the economy. This study makes projections related to the impact of this pandemic on the Indonesian economy by utilising a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Additionally, we calculate the land needed to cover the demand for agricultural products, as well as the level to which emissions can be reduced. Our simulation shows that, along with every shock caused by COVID-19 to national supply and demand, Indonesia will be experiencing economic stagnation by 2021, with the gross domestic product (GDP) level 4%C8% lower than the business as usual (BAU) level during the pandemic (2020C2021). The two sectors that will be hit hardest are the transportation and tourism sectors, making up a GDP loss ranging from 30%C50%. During this stagnation, the agricultural sector is a potential sector for accommodating workers who have been laid off. The model also predicts that there will be a temporary land-use change that the farmers will prefer to use their land for food and horticultural commodities. As for emissions, our calculations show that the potential for emission reductions will be up to 8% by 2021, compared to the BAU level. However, the source of this emission reduction is not positive as it comes from the restriction of economic activity, and the growth in emissions from the industrial and waste sectors are still increasing rapidly, even during the pandemic. Thus, it is feared that there will be a very high spike in emissions when the pandemic ends, making the situation more challenging for Indonesia to achieve its emission mitigation targets. Furthermore, once the government introduces fiscal incentives to support the economy during the pandemic, the economic condition will be improved, although still not fully recovered. The model predicts that the government fiscal incentives may help to improve the GDP by around 1%C3%, compared to when no incentive is introduced.","output":"An Assessment of the Short-Term Impact of COVID-19 on Economics and the Environment: A Case Study of Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection. This paper compares the dynamics of virus-receptor interactions for SARS-CoV (CoV1) and CoV2. At low (endosomal) pH, the binding free energy landscape of CoV1 and CoV2 interactions with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is almost the same. However, at neutral pH the landscape is different due to the loss of a pH-switch (His445Lys) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV2 relative to CoV1. Namely, CoV1 stabilizes a transition state above the bound state. In situations where small external strains are applied by, say, shear flow in the respiratory system, the off rate of the viral particle is enhanced. As a result, CoV1 virions are expected to detach from cell surfaces in time scales that are much faster than the time needed for other receptors to reach out and stabilize virus attachment. On the other hand, the loss of this pH-switch, which sequence alignments show is unique to CoV2, eliminates the transition state and allows the virus to stay bound to the ACE2 receptor for time scales compatible with the recruitment of additional ACE2 receptors diffusing in the cell membrane. This has important implications for viral infection and its pathology. CoV1 does not trigger high infectivity in the nasal area because it either rapidly drifts down the respiratory tract or is exhaled. By contrast, this novel mutation in CoV2 should not only retain the infection in the nasal cavity until ACE2-rich cells are sufficiently depleted, but also require fewer particles for infection. This mechanism explains observed longer incubation times, extended period of viral shedding, and higher rate of transmission. These considerations governing viral entry suggest that number of ACE2-rich cells in human nasal mucosa, which should be significantly smaller for children (and females relative to males), should also correlate with onset of viral load that could be a determinant of higher virus susceptibility. Critical implications for the development of new vaccines to combat current and future pandemics that, like SARS-CoV2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates by viral retention in nasal epithelium are also discussed.","output":"Loss of pH switch unique to SARS-CoV2 supports unfamiliar virus pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, covid-19 has spread and had a profound effect on the lives and health of people around the globe.

Our aim was to gauge peoples beliefs about medicines reuse, in an experiment, with or without sensor technology and with or without the promise of visual checks completed by a pharmacist, as experimental conditions, should the practice be sanctioned in the UK in the future. Methods: A between participant study was designed with two independent factors testing the hypothesis that sensors and visual checks would increase pro-medicines-reuse beliefs. A questionnaire was used to measure medicines reuse beliefs and collect qualitative comments. Results: Eighty-one participants took part. Attitudes toward medication offered for reuse, participants perceived social pressure to accept the medication, and their intention to take part in medicines reuse all increased with the presence of sensors on packaging and with the promise of pharmacist visual checking, with the former causing a greater increase than the latter, and the combination of both making the greatest increase.

METHODS: In AprilCMay 2020, representatives from 103 independent abortion clinics (i.e., those not affiliated with Planned Parenthood) completed a survey that included close\\\\ended questions about how the pandemic, the public health response, and designations of abortion as a nonessential service had affected their clinic, as well as open\\\\ended questions about the pandemic's impact. Analyses were primarily descriptive but included an exploration of regional variation. RESULTS: All U.S. regions were represented in the sample. At 51% of clinics, clinicians or staff had been unable to work because of the pandemic or public health responses. Temporary closures were more common among clinics in the South (35%) and Midwest (21%) than in the Northeast and West (5% each). More than half of clinics had canceled or postponed nonabortion services (e.g., general gynecologic care); cancelation or postponement of abortion services was less common (25C38%, depending on type) and again especially prevalent in the South and Midwest. Respondents reported the pandemic had had numerous effects on their clinics, including disrupting their workforce, clinic flow and work practices; increasing expenses; and reducing revenues. State laws (including designations of abortion as nonessential) had exacerbated these difficulties.

Systems biology approaches promise to shed new light on the regulation of innate immunity through the analysis and modelling of these networks.

InnateDB (http://www.innatedb.com) is a molecular interaction and pathway database developed to facilitate systems-level analyses of innate immunity. RESULTS: Here, we describe the InnateDB curation project, which is manually annotating the human and mouse innate immunity interactome in rich contextual detail, and present our novel curation software system, which has been developed to ensure interactions are curated in a highly accurate and data-standards compliant manner. To date, over 13,000 interactions (protein, DNA and RNA) have been curated from the biomedical literature. Here, we present data, illustrating how InnateDB curation of the innate immunity interactome has greatly enhanced network and pathway annotation available for systems-level analysis and discuss the challenges that face such curation efforts. Significantly, we provide several lines of evidence that analysis of the innate immunity interactome has the potential to identify novel signalling, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of innate immunity. Additionally, these analyses also provide insight into the cross-talk between innate immunity pathways and other biological processes, such as adaptive immunity, cancer and diabetes, and intriguingly, suggests links to other pathways, which as yet, have not been implicated in the innate immune response.

Several factors that vary across geographies, such as age, existing disease prevalence, medical resource availability and deprivation, can trigger adverse effects on the National Health System during a pandemic. In this paper, we present data on these factors and combine them to create an index to show which areas are more exposed. This technique can help policy makers to moderate the impact of similar pandemics. DESIGN: We combine several sources of data, which describe specific risk factors linked with the outbreak of a respiratory pathogen, that could leave local areas vulnerable to the harmful consequences of large-scale outbreaks of contagious diseases. We combine these measures to generate an index of community-level vulnerability. SETTING: 91 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We merge 15 measures spatially to generate an index of community-level vulnerability. These measures cover prevalence rates of high-risk diseases; proxies for the at-risk population density; availability of staff and quality of healthcare facilities. RESULTS: We find that 80% of CCGs that score in the highest quartile of vulnerability are located in the North of England (24 out of 30). Here, vulnerability stems from a faster rate of population ageing and from the widespread presence of underlying at-risk diseases. These same areas, especially the North-East Coast areas of Lancashire, also appear vulnerable to adverse shocks to healthcare supply due to tighter labour markets for healthcare personnel. Importantly, our index correlates with a measure of social deprivation, indicating that these communities suffer from long-standing lack of economic opportunities and are characterised by low public and private resource endowments. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based policy is crucial to mitigate the health impact of pandemics such as COVID-19. While current attention focuses on curbing rates of contagion, we introduce a vulnerability index combining data that can help policy makers identify the most vulnerable communities. We find that this index is positively correlated with COVID-19 deaths and it can thus be used to guide targeted capacity building. These results suggest that a stronger focus on deprived and vulnerable communities is needed to tackle future threats from emerging and re-emerging infectious disease.","output":"Measuring geographical disparities in England at the time of COVID-19: results using a composite indicator of population vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Evaluate safety and efficacy of the pose? procedure for obesity treatment.

We aimed to investigate the effect of certification on vaccine uptake. METHODS: We designed a synthetic control model comparing six countries (Denmark, Israel, Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland) that introduced certification (AprilCAugust, 2021), with 19 control countries. Using daily data on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and country-specific information, we produced a counterfactual trend estimating what might have happened in similar circumstances if certificates were not introduced. The main outcome was daily COVID-19 vaccine doses. FINDINGS: COVID-19 certification led to increased vaccinations 20 days before implementation in anticipation, with a lasting effect up to 40 days after. Countries with pre-intervention uptake that was below average had a more pronounced increase in daily vaccinations compared with those where uptake was already average or higher. In France, doses exceeded 55 672 (95% CI 49 668C73 707) vaccines per million population or, in absolute terms, 3 761 440 (3 355 761C4 979 952) doses before mandatory certification and 72 151 (37 940C114 140) per million population after certification (4 874 857 [2 563 396C7 711 769] doses). We found no effect in countries that already had average uptake (Germany), or an unclear effect when certificates were introduced during a period of limited vaccine supply (Denmark). Increase in uptake was highest for people younger than 30 years after the introduction of certification. Access restrictions linked to certain settings (nightclubs and events with >1000 people) were associated with increased uptake in those younger than 20 years. When certification was extended to broader settings, uptake remained high in the youngest group, but increases were also observed in those aged 30C49 years.

We calculated the equivalent annual cost of RAS implementation per child under 5 at risk of severe malaria, from a health system perspective, separating neglected routine health system components from incremental RAS introduction costs. Findings The largest baseline gaps were irregular health worker supervisions, inadequate referral facility worker training, and inadequate malaria commodity supplies. Health worker training and behaviour change campaigns were the largest startup costs, while supervision and supply chain management accounted for most annual routine costs. The equivalent annual costs of preparing the health system for treating severe malaria with RAS were $2.31, $2.20 and 4.15 per child at risk in Uganda, Nigeria and DRC.

OUTCOME MEASURES: The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to measure depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a cut-off point of 13 or more. We estimated the adjusted OR (AOR) using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 151 (6.6%) of respondents newly developed depressive and anxiety symptoms. Participants who experienced a shortage of relaxation time (AOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.47), increased difficulty in child rearing (AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.70), increased partner aggression (AOR 2.93, 95% CI 1.42 to 6.05) and an increased sense of unfairness (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73) were more likely to develop these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in circumstances and perceptions during COVID-19 outbreak were significantly related to the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms among mothers of young children.

Proinflammatory mediators released by damaged liver after liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury might contribute to this form of ALI, but the underlying mechanisms have not been well characterized. High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), a recently identified proinflammatory cytokine, was found to be significantly higher in the serum after liver I/R injury. This study investigated whether HMGB1 was involved as a stimulating factor, and whether its downstream Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways act as mediators in the development of liver I/R injury-induced ALI. Extensive ALI and lung inflammation was induced in a rat model of liver I/R injury. Serum HMGB1 was significantly higher after liver I/R injury, and more importantly, expression of HMGB1 mRNA and protein in the lung tissue was also significantly increased. We further found that liver I/R injury enhanced the expression of TLR4 mRNA and protein, and the activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. Inhibition of TLR4 expression in the lung tissue by infection with pGCSIL-GFP-lentivirus-expressing small hairpin RNAs targeting the TLR4 gene (TLR4-shRNA lentivirus) significantly attenuated ALI, lung inflammation, and activity of p38MAPK and AP-1 in the lung tissue. These findings indicate that HMGB1 might contribute to the underlying mechanism for liver I/R injury-induced ALI and that its downstream TLR4, p38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways are potentially important mediators in the development of ALI.","output":"TLR4 as receptor for HMGB1-mediated acute lung injury after liver ischemia/reperfusion injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contagious disease pandemics present a significant threat worldwide in terms of both human health and economic damage New diseases emerge annually and place enormous burdens on many countries Additionally, using humans to handle pandemic situations increases the chances of disease spreading Therefore, various technologies that do not directly involve humans should be employed to handle pandemic situations The Internet of Drones (IoDT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain are emerging technologies that have revolutionized the modern world This article presents a blockchain-based AI-empowered pandemic situation supervision scheme in which a swarm of drones embedded with AI is engaged to autonomously monitor pandemic outbreaks, thereby keeping human involvement as low as possible A use case based on a recent pandemic (i e , COVID-19) is discussed Two types of drone swarms are used to handle multiple tasks (e g , checking face masks and imposing lockdowns) A lightweight blockchain is considered to handle situations in remote areas with poor network connectivity Additionally, a two-phase lightweight security mechanism is adopted to validate the entities in the proposed scheme A proof of concept is established using an experimental environment setup and dataset training An analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed scheme IEEE","output":"A Blockchain-Based Artificial Intelligence-Empowered Contagious Pandemic Situation Supervision Scheme Using Internet of Drone Things"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Care of the pregnant patient during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic presents many challenges, including creating parallel workflows for infected and noninfected patients, minimizing waste of materials, and ensuring that clinicians can seamlessly transition between types of anesthesia. The exponential community spread of disease limited the time for development and training. METHODS: The goals of our workflow and process development were to maximize safety for staff and patients, minimize the risk of contamination, and reduce the waste of unused supplies and materials. We used a cyclical improvement system and the plus/delta debriefing method to rapidly develop workflows consisting of sequential checklists and procedure-specific packs. RESULTS: We designed independent workflows for labor analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, conversion of labor analgesia to cesarean anesthesia, and general anesthesia. In addition, we created procedure-specific material packs to optimize supplies and prevent wastage. Finally, we generated sequential checklists to allow staff to perform standard operating procedures without extensive training. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these workflows and tools allowed our staff to urgently care for patients in high-risk situations without prior experience. Over time, we refined the workflows using a cyclical improvement system. We present our checklists and workflows as well as the system we used for their development, so that others may use them to their benefit.","output":"Adaptation of an Obstetric Anesthesia Service for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Pandemic: Description of Checklists, Workflows, and Development Tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epic Covid sickness 2019 (COVID-19) has turned into the significant danger to humankind in year 2020 The pandemic COVID-19 flare-up has influenced more than 2 7 million individuals and caused around 187 thousand fatalities worldwide[1] inside scarcely any months of its first appearance in Wuhan city of China and the number is developing quickly in various pieces of world As researcher everywhere on the world are battling to discover the fix and treatment for COVID-19, the urgent advance fighting against COVID-19 is the screening of immense number of associated cases for disconnection and isolate with the patients One of the key methodologies in screening of COVID-19 can be chest radiological imaging The early investigations on the patients influenced by COVID-19 shows the attributes variations from the norm in chest radiography pictures This introduced a chance to utilize distinctive counterfeit clever (AI) frameworks dependent on profound picking up utilizing chest radiology pictures for the recognition of COVID-19 and numerous such framework were proposed indicating promising outcomes In this paper, we proposed a profound learning based convolution neural organization to characterize COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal cases from chest radiology pictures The proposed convolution neural organization (CNN) grouping model had the option to accomplish exactness of 94 85% on test dataset The trial was completed utilizing the subset of information accessible in GitHub and Kaggle","output":"Convolutional Neural Network Use Chest Radiography Images for Identification Of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces respiratory symptoms, predominantly of the upper airways, which can progress to pneumonia after 7 days with persistent fever, cough and dyspnea, and even develop a syndrome of acute respiratory distress (ARDS), multi-organ failure and death Since COVID-19 disease was declared by the WHO there has been a redistribution of the healthcare system for these types of patients, especially in the front line, which is, in primary care, emergencies and in intensive care units (ICU) In primary care, the fundamental role is the diagnosis of the suspected patients, follow-up mainly by telemedicine (specially telephone calls) to detect warning signs in case of worsening and subsequent referral to the emergency department;as well as explaining home isolation measures In the emergency department, it is included the management of suspicious cases and, if it any risk factor is found, complementary tests are carried out for precise diagnosis and admission assessment;In case of oxygen saturation &amp;lt;95% and poor general condition, valuation is requested for admission to the ICU Depending on the severity of the patient, he/she would be or not a candidate for invasive mechanical ventilation, which must be performed by trained personnel to prevent the spread of the infection minimizing the risk of contagion ARDS&#039;s treatment strategies include pulmonary protection ventilation, prone position, recruitment maneuvers and, less frequently, oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane Among the specific treatments for COVID-19 stand out mainly drugs to reduce viral load, although sometimes specific drugs will be needed to treat hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability and concomitant infections One of the goals to be achieved is for patients to recover and be able to successfully return to work;for this purpose, an adequate physical and psychological rehabilitation program is essential, as about 50% have symptoms of anxiety and depression","output":"The Covid-19 pandemic seen from the frontline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States and around the world, COVID\\\\19 represents a mass fatality incident, as there are more bodies than can be handled using existing resources.

Then, relationships between patterns of inflammatory responses and clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 were assessed in a discovery and validation cohort. Unbiased clustering analysis grouped 105 patients of a discovery cohort into three distinct clusters. Cluster 1 (hyper-inflammatory immune response) was characterized by high CRP levels, high ANC, and low ALC, whereas Cluster 3 (hypo-inflammatory immune response) was associated with low CRP levels and normal ANC and ALC.

However, it remains unclear whether patients can breathe independently at the PIC window and if NPPV is indeed necessary after extubation. OBJECTIVES To assess whether AECOPD patients can breathe independently at the PIC window and thus whether NPPV is necessary after extubation. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study at a university hospital during a 9-month period. We used the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to assess whether each patient could breathe independently at the PIC window, then performed extubation. Patients who passed the SBT received venturi oxygen therapy only, whereas those that failed received NPPV. However, if the former showed respiratory distress, they too received NPPV. The primary outcome variables were SBT pass/fail, the demand for NPPV and rate of reintubation within 72 h following extubation. RESULTS In all, 23 patients were enrolled, 15 (65%) of which passed the SBT. Of these, 12 (80%) developed respiratory distress after extubation and required NPPV (one of whom required reintubation). Of the eight patients that failed, one received reintubation after NPPV. The reintubation rates within 72 h following extubation of SBT-pass (7%) and SBT-fail (13%) patients were comparable. CONCLUSION Our results provide experimental evidence that most AECOPD patients can breathe independently at the PIC window, but nonetheless develop respiratory distress and thus require NPPV following extubation.","output":"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is required following extubation at the pulmonary infection control window: a prospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world since it broke out massively in December 2019, which has caused a large loss to the whole world.

In this study, the effects of a mixture of different types of beneficial bacteria (De Simone Formulation) were investigated in a mouse model of stomach wall damages induced by single or multiple doses of acetylsalicylic acid. Control mice received water. The stomachs of all mice were processed for microscopic examination and labeling of dividing stem cells and stomach cell lineages secreting mucus, acid, pepsin, and hormones. The results reveal beneficial effects for the multiple bacterial strain of De Simone Formulation given before or after the induction of stomach erosions. The regeneration of the stomach wall was associated with an increase in stem cell proliferation and enhanced production of protective factors such as mucus, and restoration of the aggressive factors produced by acid and pepsin secreting cell lineages. Therefore, the protective and therapeutic effects of the multi-strain healthy bacteria against stomach erosions involve modulation of not only dividing stem cells but also the multiple secretory cell lineages of the stomach. ABSTRACT: Patients with gastric mucosal erosions are predisposed to chronic gastritis, ulcer or even cancer. The repair of mucosal erosions involves several events including proliferation of gastric epithelial stem cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the probiotic mixture of De Simone Formulation on gastric epithelial stem cell lineages in mouse models of gastric mucosal erosions. Gastric erosions were induced by a single oral gavage of 80% ethanol containing 15 mg/mL acetylsalicylic acid (5 mL/kg) following a daily dose of probiotic mixture (5 mg/day/mouse) for 10 days. In another protocol, erosions were induced by a daily gavage of acetylsalicylic acid (400 mg/kg/day/mouse) for 5 days before or after daily administration of probiotic mixture for 5 days. Control mice received water gavage for 10 days. All mice were injected with bromodeoxyuridine two hours before sacrifice to label S-phase cells. The stomachs of all mice were processed for histological examination, lectin binding, and immunohistochemical analysis. The results reveal that mice that received probiotics before or after the induction of erosion showed a decrease in erosion index with an increase in gastric epithelial stem/progenitor cell proliferation and enhanced production of mucus, trefoil factors, and ghrelin by mucous and enteroendocrine cell lineages. These mice also showed restoration of the amount of H(+),K(+)-ATPase and pepsinogen involved in the production of the harsh acidic environment by parietal and chief cell lineages. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the beneficial effects of probiotics against gastric mucosal erosion and highlights the involvement and modulation of proliferative stem cells and their multiple glandular epithelial cell lineages.","output":"Modulation of Stem Cell Progeny by Probiotics during Regeneration of Gastric Mucosal Erosions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting how actions result in conflicting outcomes for self and others is essential for social functioning.

The objectives of this study are (1) to assess how published LSRs report on the flow of studies through the different phases of the review for the different updates; (2) to propose an approach to reporting on that flow. Methods: For objective 1, we identified all LSRs published up to July 2020. We abstracted information regarding their general characteristics and how they reported on search results. For objective 2, we based our proposal for tailored PRISMA approaches on the findings from objective 1, as well as on our experience with conducting Cochrane LSRs. Results: We identified 108 living publications relating to 32 LSRs. Of the 108 publications, 7% were protocols, 24% were base versions (i.e., the first version), 62% were partial updates (i.e., does not include all typical sections of an SR), and 7% were full updates (i.e., includes all typical sections of an SR). We identified six ways to reporting the study flow: base separately, each update separately (38%); numbers not reported (32%); latest update separately, all previous versions combined (20%); base separately, all updates combined (7%); latest update version only (3%); all versions combined (0%). We propose recording in detail the results of the searches to keep track of all identified records. For structuring the flow diagram, we propose using one of four approaches. Conclusion: We identified six ways for reporting the study flowthrough the different phases of the review for the different update versions. We propose to document in detail the study flow for the different search updates and select one of our four tailored PRISMA diagram approaches to present that study flow.","output":"PRISMA flow diagrams for living systematic reviews: a methodological survey and a proposal."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: New coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become an international emergency. As many of the intensive care unit (ICU) patients with the disease also present multiple organ failure, blood purification techniques might be a good choice in their treatment. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of cytokine removal in COVID-19 patients managed in ICUs. Methods: For this case-control study we have investigated the role of the cytokine removal by means of two resin membranes (HA330 and Mediasorb) in COVID-19 patients managed in ICUs. Particularly, we investigated the overtime variation in clinical severity scores, laboratory variables, and effects on hospital and ICU stay and mortality. Results: Seventy-two patients have been evaluated, of which half constituted Cytokine Filtration (CF) Group, and other half the Case-Control (CC) Group. Mortality was 55.6% and 50% in CF and CC groups, respectively. In the CF Group, there was decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels measured at the end of cytokine adsorption; lymphocyte count and ratio were increased, whereas neutrophile ratio was decreased. There were no differences between the groups regarding other laboratory variables, SOFA scores and vasopressor uses. Conclusions: We have demonstrated decrease in CRP, fibrinogen and increase in lymphocyte count in the patients having cytokine adsorption, but there was no clinical reflection of these benefits, and no decrease in mortality as well. Even though there is physio-pathologic rationale to use cytokine adsorption techniques for immunomodulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, it is early to make strong suggestions about their benefits.","output":"Cytokine Adsorption in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients, a Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enveloped viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and SARS-CoV-2, target cells through membrane fusion process. The detailed understanding of the process is sought after for vaccine development but remains elusive due to current technique limitations for direct three-dimensional (3D) imaging of an individual virus during its viral entry. Recently, we developed a simple specimen preparation method for real-time imaging of metal dynamic liquid-vaper interface at nanometer resolution by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Here, we extended this method to study biology sample through snapshot 3D structure of a single HIV (pseudo-typed with the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV-G) at its intermediate stage of viral entry to HeLa cells in a liquid-phase environment. By individual-particle electron tomography (IPET), we found the viral surface release excess lipids with unbound viral spike proteins forming ~50-nm nanoparticles instead of merging cell membrane. Moreover, the spherical-shape shell formed by matrix proteins underneath the viral envelope does not disassemble into a cone shape right after fusion. The snapshot 3D imaging of a single virus provides us a direct structure-based understanding of the viral entry mechanism, which can be used to examine other viruses to support the development of vaccines combatting the current ongoing pandemic.","output":"Single-molecule 3D imaging of HIV cellular entry by liquid-phase electron tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A major challenge during the COVID-19 outbreak is the sudden increase in ICU bed occupancy rate. In this article we reviewed the strategies of escalation and de-escalation put in place at a large university hospital in Madrid during the COVID-19 outbreak, in order to meet the growing demand of ICU beds. Materials and methods The data displayed originated from the hospital information system and the hospital contingency plan. Results The COVID-19 outbreak produced a surge of ICU patients which saturated the available ICU capacity within a few days. A total of four new ICUs had to be opened in order to accommodate all necessary new ICU admissions. Management challenges included infrastructure, material allocation and ICU staffing. Through the strategies put in place the hospital was able to generate a surge capacity of ICU beds of 340%, meet all requirements and also maintain minimal surgical activity. Conclusions Hospital surge capacity is to date hardly quantifiable and often has to face physical limitations (material, personnel, spaces). However an extremely flexible and adaptable management strategy can help to overcome some of these limitations and stretch the system capacities during times of extreme need.","output":"Rapid response to COVID-19, escalation and de-escalation strategies to match surge capacity of intensive care beds to a large scale epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: For the clinical treatment of cancer patients, coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can cause serious immune-related problems. Cancer patients, who experience immunosuppression due to the pathogenesis and severity of disease, may become more aggressive due to multiple factors such as age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. In this pandemic era, COVID-19 causes lymphopenia, cancer cell awakening, inflammatory diseases, and a cytokine storm that worsens disease-related morbidity and prognosis. AREAS COVERED: We discuss all the risk factors of COVID-19 associated with cancer patients and propose new strategies to use antiviral and anticancer drugs for therapeutic purposes. We bring new drugs, cancers and COVID-19 treatment strategies together to address the immune system challenges faced by oncologists. EXPERT OPINION: The chronic inflammatory microenvironment caused by COVID-19 awakens dormant cancer cells through inflammation and autoimmune activation. Drug-related strategies to ensure that clinical treatment can reduce the susceptibility of cancer patients to COVID-19, and possible counter-measures to minimize the harm caused by the COVID-19 have been outlined. The response to the pandemic and recovery has been elaborated, which can provide information for long-term cancer treatment and speed up the optimization process.","output":"Novel therapeutic drug strategies to tackle immune-oncological challenges faced by cancer patients during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the best kept secrets in global public health is how China achieved the tuberculosis (TB) targets in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) The MDGs TB targets were to reduce the prevalence and mortality of TB by 50% between 1990 and 2015 By 2010, China had reduced its TB prevalence and mortality by 65% and 80%, (1?2) which meant China exceeded the MDG targets 5 years before the MDG deadline This impressive achievement helped China to move from a high to a medium TB-incidence country Today, China still has the worlds third highest number of new TB cases each year But when adjusted for population size, it has the lowest TB incidence per capita among the 30 high TB-burden countries (3) In 2015, the global community committed to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which included two new TB targets  reducing TB incidence and deaths by 80% and 90%, respectively, compared to their 2015 levels (3) World Health Organization (WHO) went further by setting the 2035 END TB targets of reducing TB incidence and deaths by 90% and 95%, respectively (3) WHO estimates that Chinas TB incidence in 2015 was around 65 cases per 100,000 population (4) A 90% reduction would bring TB incidence to less than 7 cases per 100,000 population, a level seen in most high-income countries Achieving this will mean that China has eliminated TB as a major public health problem Although the SDG and END TB targets seem difficult to achieve, we can learn from how China achieved the MDG TB targets, which was made possible by Chinas renewed commitment to control major infectious diseases following the 2003 SARS epidemic (5) Today, we are in similar situation China is once again impacted by the spread of another coronavirus The country has been strengthening its health system to be more responsive to both current and future pandemics Perhaps TB can once again benefit from the renewed focus on controlling infectious diseases This commentary will discuss how China can apply the lessons and approaches from its COVID-19 response to make progress toward eliminating TB as a major public health problem","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Elimination of Tuberculosis in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Japan has an ageing population and geographical impediments to healthcare access, so an experimental trial of telepharmacy has recently been implemented in remote islands or remote areas of Japan prior to the formal implementation.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four elderly patients, who were all of the patients receiving telepharmacy in Toyone village, Japan, at the time of the survey. The transcribed interview data were qualitatively analyzed by coding and categorization. The subjects thought telepharmacy would be advantageous to overcome poor access to a clinic and to improve convenience in processes ranging from medical examination to obtaining prescribed medicines. However, they pointed out the low digital literacy of the elderly. Also, they had low expectations for pharmacists, because they had previously had no relationship with pharmacists due to lack of pharmacies in the area. To promote telepharmacy, efforts to eliminate resistance to smartphones and to provide support for smartphone operations are needed among the elderly. Work is also needed to establish how pharmacists should best be involved in patient care and health support in remote areas.

The relation between pernio\\\\like acral eruptions and COVID\\\\19 has not been fully elucidated because most reported cases have occurred in patients with negative microbiological tests for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. METHODS: A retrospective study of 49 cases of chilblains seen during the first year of the pandemic in a children's hospital in Madrid, Spain. The incidence of these skin lesions was correlated with the number of COVID\\\\19 admissions and environmental temperatures. Patients were separated into two groups depending on the day of onset (strict lockdown period vs. outside the lockdown period). RESULTS: Most chilblains cases presented during the first and third waves of the pandemic, paralleling the number of COVID\\\\19 admissions. The first wave coincided with a strict lockdown, and the third wave coincided with the lowest ambient seasonal temperatures of the year. Systemic symptoms preceding chilblains were more frequent in the first wave (45.8% vs. 8.0%, p = .002), as was the co\\\\occurrence with erythema multiforme\\\\like lesions (16.7% vs. 0%, p = .033).

This research tailored the existing capabilities of a traditional micro-electric discharge machining (-EDM) setup by adding 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 g/l bioactive zinc powder particle concentrations (PPCs) to the dielectric. A copper and brass micro-tool electrode (C--TE and B--TE) was employed in association with each PPC. Experiments were executed using the one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) approach. Machining time and dimensional deviation were chosen as the response variables of Zn powder mixed-micro-EDM (Zn-PM--EDM). According to the analytical findings, the combination of C--TE and 6 g/l Zn PPC achieved 23.52%, 3.29%, and 17.96% lesser machining time, dimensional deviation, and recast layer thickness, respectively, compared to the B--TE. The detailed study of this surface endorsed a significant modification in terms of improved recast layer thickness (26.44 m), topography (Ra = 743.65 nm), and wettability (contact angle < 90 deg), suggesting its dental application.

Methods: : A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 2244 adults in urban China. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare the respondents willingness and uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Multivariate logistic regressions were fitted to investigate the factors associated with willingness and uptake of the two measures. Findings: In early 2021, 52.45% of the respondents had received or scheduled a COVID-19 test at least once, and a majority (95.63%) were willing to receive testing. 63.28% of the respondents had received/scheduled or were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Willingness and uptake of COVID-19 testing were not associated with socio-demographic characteristics, except for occupation.

Both require trade-offs between such policy goals as liberty, security, efficiency, and equity. In public health, however, decisions about who will approve, pay for, and deliver services are often accompanied by decisions on when and how to compel individual behaviour. Policy becomes complex because different stakeholders interpret evidence differently: stakeholders may assign different weights to policy goals and may even define the same goals differently. In the debate over mandatory annual influenza vaccination for health care workers, for example, proponents as well as opponents of mandatory vaccination may convey arguments in security terms. Those in favour of mandatory vaccination emphasize subclinical infections and duty of care (public security) while those opposed emphasize risk of adverse events (personal security). Proponents assert less worker absenteeism (efficiency) while opponents stress coercion and alternate personal infection control measures (liberty and individual rights/responsibilities). Consequently, stakeholders talk past each other.

As a case of study, we consider the epidemic of COVID-19 in Brazil performing data-driven simulations. Properties of the simulated epidemic curves have very broad distributions across different geographical locations and scales, from states, passing through intermediate and immediate regions down to municipality levels. Correlations between delay of the epidemic outbreak and distance from the respective capital cities were predicted to be strong in several states and weak in others, signaling influences of multiple epidemic foci propagating towards the inland cities. Responses of different regions to a same mitigation protocol can vary enormously implying that the policies of combating the epidemics must be engineered according to the region' specificity but integrated with the overall situation.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings. MAIN RESULTS: We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention. We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects. As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review.","output":"Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to measure the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) helicase in the presence of different types of nucleic acids (NAs) for the determination of the optimal condition of hydrolysis activity The steady-state NTP hydrolysis analysis demonstrated that the MERS-CoV helicase only (and considerably) hydrolyzed the ATP in the presence of poly(U) On the contrary, only UTP was considerably hydrolyzed in the presence of poly(C) When we used the DNAs as a substrate, the single-stranded M13 DNA considerably stimulated the ATP and UTP hydrolysis However, the ATP hydrolysis was not detected in the presence of ds DNA The pH-dependent ATP hydrolysis analysis demonstrated that the helicase optimally hydrolyzed ATP at a pH value of 7 0 The ATP hydrolysis was also performed in the presence of four different kinds of divalent cations, which demonstrated that only Mg2+ ions stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity","output":"Analysis of Nucleoside Triphosphate Hydrolysis by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Les infections associes aux soins (IAS) constituent un vritable problme de sant publique.

Summary The burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is global and major. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile are the most frequent associated pathogens. Infection control measures are crucial but not sufficient to stem the burden of HAIs. Due to antimicrobial resistance, lack of therapeutic options for treatment of totally-drug resistant organism is also observed. Therefore, alternative strategies to antimicrobial drugs are urgently needed to prevent and treat HAI. Among these strategies, vaccines and passive immunization are probably one of the most attractive. In this review, we will discuss licensed and non-licensed vaccines for HAIs at-risk patients and HCWs to prevent HAI. The benefit of Influenza and rotavirus vaccines in patients to prevent these viral IAS is reviewed. The development of an S. aureus vaccine, previously associated to failures, seem to be complicated. These failures allow however a better knowledge of S. aureus immunity. For C. difficile, the goal of obtaining a preventive vaccine seems to be near. Development of vaccines to prevent gram negative bacteria involved in IAS remain challenging and confined in early phases of development. Vaccination of at risk patients is however challenging due to the poor immune response to vaccines usually obtained. Therefore, immunization of healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial to prevent IAS as it is associated to herd immunity. We also review here the benefit of HCWs immunization against measles, pertussis, influenza, varicella and hepatitis B to prevent HAIs.","output":"Les vaccins dans la prvention des infections associes aux soins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 56 year old lady walked into our clinic with history of bilateral renal calculi and generalised weakness of 6 months duration.

OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical decisions and practices made for acute cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) patients with respiratory impairments and oropharyngeal dysphagia. SETTINGS: All hospital intensive care units in the UK that admit acute cervical spinal cord injury patients. METHODS: Online distribution of a 35-question multiple-choice survey on the clinical management of ventilation, swallowing, nutrition, oral hygiene and communication for CSCI patients, to multi-disciplinary staff based in specialised and non-specialised intensive care units across UK. RESULTS: Responses were received from 219 staff members based in 92 hospitals. Of the 77 units that admitted CSCI patients, 152 participants worked in non-specialised and 30 in specialised units. Non-specialised unit staff showed variations in clinical decisions for respiratory management compared to specialised units with limited use of vital capacity measures and graduated weaning programme, reliance on coughing to indicate aspiration, inconsistent manipulation of tracheostomy cuffs for speech and swallowing and limited use of instrumental assessments of swallowing. Those in specialised units employed a multi-discplinary approach to clinical management of nutritional needs.

However, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the movement and activities of groups of people have been restricted, especially in indoor spaces. This reduction in travel by engineers also implies a reduction in associated costs. Telepresence technology, which is studied in the field of virtual reality, can be used as a way to reduce travel. Telepresence allows users to engage with a site from a remote location as if they were present. Thus, engineers would be able to participate in a working group without the necessity of physically traveling to the site to cooperate with local manufacturing people. A variety of telepresence systems have been proposed;however, relatively few methods have been widely implemented compared with video chat applications that have recently become an established infrastructure in many companies. This is most likely because most proposed systems use robots, head-mounted displays, or dedicated multi-functional applications that require engineers to learn how to use them. One way to use a video chat application to understand a remote space is to have a remote participant move a camera used in a video chat application. In contrast, many VR social networking services use a viewing method with which users can change their viewing direction on the computer screen. In this study, we demonstrate that a system that allows users to rotate their viewing perspective on a laptop computer screen can provide an easier understanding of a virtual space than a system that requires a remote person to move a webcam.

Rapid, accurate diagnosis and genotyping of emerging pathogens during early-suspected disease cases is critical to facilitate timely response to deploy adequate control measures and prevent or reduce spread.

The main limitation of this approach is the lengthy turnaround time. Here, we report an innovative approach using a previously developed specific PCR assay for pathogen diagnosis combined with a new Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)-based amplicon sequencing method for pathogen genotyping. Using fish clinical samples, we applied this approach for the rapid confirmation of PCR amplicon sequences identity and genotyping of tilapia lake virus (TiLV), a disease-causing virus affecting tilapia aquaculture globally. The consensus sequences obtained after polishing exhibit strikingly high identity to references derived by Illumina and Sanger methods (99.83-100%).

There were 119,315 fewer hospitalizations than expected during March to May 2020 in Portugal, which represented a 57% reduction. Non-COVID-19 hospitalizations had a higher mean length of stay and proportion of inpatient deaths than forecasted values. Differences between observed and forecasted values varied greatly among regions and hospitals.

In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 100 patients admitted with suspected COVID-19. Predictive models of COVID-19 diagnosis were performed based on radiology, clinical and laboratory findings; bootstrapping was performed in order to account for overfitting. RESULTS: A total of 29% of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Variables associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in multivariate analysis were leukocyte count &#8804;7.7103mm-3, LDH >273U/L, and chest radiographic abnormality.

The introduction of the need for PPE to be worn throughout ECT and for general hospital operating procedures to be adhered to has also been a big change. The change in the required infection control procedures has had an impact on treatment capacity and has led many areas to reduce, relocate or centralise their ECT provisions which has had a knock on effect on training.This study assesses the perceived impact COVID-19 has had on the provision of training and learning in ECT for core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West as well as their perceived competence levels.MethodViews were sought through surveys and focus groups from September to December 2020, participants were core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West.

Almost 81% of core trainees surveyed and 92.86% of higher trainees had participated in no ECT sessions from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak to the time of data collection eight to ten months later.81% of core trainees and 85.71% of higher trainees had received no teaching in any form about ECT over the period studied.When considering the competencies required in ECT for a core trainee, one (4.76%) felt they were fully competent, 3 (14.29%) nearly competent, 7(33.33%) needs some improvement, 10 (47.62%) not yet competent. Only one higher trainee felt they met the RCPsych competencies, 5 (35.71%) were nearly competent, 6 (42.86%) need some improvement and 2 (14.29%) were not yet competent.ConclusionThis study indicates a clear lack of provision of training which is very concerning ,and possibly pre dates the COVID outbreak, particularly in the case of specialty trainees who may well be consultants in a number of months and will not have the time to make up for the lost training. In order for ECT provision to continue it is crucial that we are able to adequately train the future workforce.","output":"Research into psychiatry trainees views around the impact COVID-19 has had on the provision of electroconvulsive therapy training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is currently a global public health emergency and beyond vaccines as a prophylactic treatment, no specific and effective therapeutical treatments are available. COVID-19 induces a massive release of proinflammatory cytokines, which drives COVID-19 progression, severity, and mortality. In addition, bronchial epithelial cells are the first pulmonary cells activated by coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) leading to massive cytokine release, which can hyperactivate lung fibroblasts, resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, a phenomenon observed even in moderate COVID-19 survivors. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis that Virlaza, a herbal medicine, could inhibit the hyperactivation of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC-5) induced by SARS-Cov-2. BEAS-2B (5x104/mL/well) and MRC-5 (5x104/mL/well) cells were co-cultivated with 1ml of blood of a Sars-Cov-2 infected patient for 4 hours and Virlaza (1ug/mL) was added in the first minute of the co-culture. After 4 hours, the cells were recovered and used for analysis of cytotoxicity by MTT and for mRNA expression of P2X7 receptor E iNOS. The supernatant was used to measure ATP and cytokines. Sars-Cov-2 incubation resulted in increased release of ATP, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha by BEAS-2B and MRC-5 cells (p<0.001). Treatment with Virlaza resulted in reduction of ATP, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha release (p<0.001). In addition, Sars-Cov-2 incubation resulted in increased expression of P2X7 receptor and iNOS (p<0.001), which has been reversed by Virlaza (p<0.001).

In Bangladesh, infection occurs when people drink date-palm sap contaminated with bat excreta. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the influence of viral dynamics in bats on their temporal and spatial distribution is poorly understood. We analyzed data on host ecology, molecular epidemiology, serological dynamics, and viral genetics to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of NiV dynamics in its wildlife reservoir, Pteropus medius bats, in Bangladesh. We found that NiV transmission occurred throughout the country and throughout the year. Model results indicated that local transmission dynamics were modulated by density-dependent transmission, acquired immunity that is lost over time, and recrudescence. Increased transmission followed multiyear periods of declining seroprevalence due to bat-population turnover and individual loss of humoral immunity. Individual bats had smaller host ranges than other Pteropus species (spp.), although movement data and the discovery of a Malaysia-clade NiV strain in eastern Bangladesh suggest connectivity with bats east of Bangladesh. These data suggest that discrete multiannual local epizootics in bat populations contribute to the sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks in South Asia. At the same time, the broad spatial and temporal extent of NiV transmission, including the recent outbreak in Kerala, India, highlights the continued risk of spillover to humans wherever they may interact with pteropid bats and the importance of limiting opportunities for spillover throughout Pteropuss range.","output":"Nipah virus dynamics in bats and implications for spillover to humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The central role of the car in city mobility has led to a decreased capacity for people to choose another alternative form of mobility.

In many disease models, this rate is captured in a single compound parameter, the probability of transmission . However, closer examination reveals how  can be further decomposed into a number of biologically relevant variables, including contact rates among individuals and the probability that contact events actually result in disease transmission. We start by introducing some of the basic concepts underlying the different approaches to modeling disease transmission and by laying out why a more detailed understanding of the variables involved is usually desirable. We then describe how parameter estimates of these variables can be derived from empirical data, drawing primarily from the existing literature on human diseases. Finally, we discuss how these concepts and approaches may be applied to the study of pathogen transmission in wildlife diseases.

Trials included a total of 1,514 children and young people with ADHD who were allocated to take an omega-3/6 intervention, or a placebo. RESULTS Of the studies identified, 13 reported favourable benefits on ADHD symptoms including improvements in hyperactivity, impulsivity, attention, visual learning, word reading, and working/short-term memory. Four studies used supplements containing a 9 : 3 : 1 ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid : docosahexaenoic acid : gamma linolenic acid which appeared effective at improving erythrocyte levels. Supplementation with this ratio of fatty acids also showed promise as an adjunctive therapy to traditional medications, lowering the dose and improving the compliance with medications such as methylphenidate.

METHODS Patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and initially had more than 2 FI episodes per week, were offered SNS therapy. Patients with 50% or higher reduction in FI during a 2-week test period were implanted with a neurostimulator (InterStim; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn). Assessments were completed by patients at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after implant, and annually thereafter. The present report includes data from the 4-year postimplant follow-up. RESULTS A total of 133 patients underwent test stimulation with a 90% success rate, and as a result, 120 (110 females) with a mean age of 60.5 years and a mean duration of FI of 6.8 years received long-term implantation. Of them, 78 patients completed all or part of the 4-year follow-up assessment. Fecal incontinence episodes decreased from a mean of 9.4 per week at baseline to 1.9 per week at 48 months (P < 0.001).

However, there is a general lack of standardized procedures for airborne virus sampling and limited knowledge of how sampling and storage stress impact the recovery of captured airborne viruses. Since filtration is one of the commonly used methods to capture airborne viruses, this study analyzed the effect of sampling and storage stress on SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus (human coronavirus OC43, or HCoV-OC43) captured by filters. HCoV-OC43, a simulant of the SARS-CoV-2, was aerosolized and captured by PTFE-laminated filters. The impact of sampling stress was evaluated by comparing the RNA yields recovered when sampled at 3 L/min and 10 L/min and for 10 min and 60 min; in one set of experiments, additional stress was added by passing clean air through filters with the virus for 1, 5, and 15 hr. The impact of storage stress was designed to examine RNA recovery from filters at room temperature (25 C) and refrigerated conditions (4 C) for up to 1 week of storage. To our knowledge, this is the first report on using HCoV-OC43 aerosol in air sampling experiments, and the mode diameter of the virus aerosolized from the growth medium was 40-60 nm as determined by SMPS + CPC system (TSI Inc.) and MiniWRAS (Grimm Inc.) measurements. No significant difference was found in virus recovery between the two sampling flow rates and different sampling times (p > 0.05). However, storage at room temperature (25 C) yielded a??2x less RNA than immediate processing and storage at refrigerated conditions (4 C). Therefore, it is recommended to store filter samples with viruses at 4 C up to 1 week if the immediate analysis is not feasible. Although the laminated PTFE filter used in this work purposefully does not include a non-PTFE backing, the general recommendations for handling and storing filter samples with viral particles are likely to apply to other filter types.","output":"Impact of sampling and storage stress on the recovery of airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus surrogate captured by filtration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is characterized by pulmonary hyper-inflammation and potentially life-threatening cytokine storms. Controlling the local and systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19 may be as important as anti-viral therapies. Endogenous lipid autacoid mediators, referred to as eicosanoids, play a critical role in the induction of inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a cell death (debris)-induced eicosanoid storm, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which in turn initiates a robust inflammatory response. A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators (SPMs), such as resolvins. Resolvins and other SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris and counter pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a process called inflammation resolution. SPMs and their lipid precursors exhibit anti-viral activity at nanogram doses in the setting of influenza without being immunosuppressive. SPMs also promote anti-viral B cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro-resolution mediators, activating anti-inflammatory processes, and preventing the cytokine storm. Both resolvins and EETs also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal, which is emerging as a key pathology of COVID-19 infection. Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation. While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on anti-viral and anti-inflammatory strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue. Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression. Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.","output":"Inflammation resolution: a dual-pronged approach to averting cytokine storms in COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy represents a life-saving treatment in primary antibody deficiencies. The introduction of subcutaneous Ig (SCIg) administration brings a major improvement in quality of life for patients, compared to the traditional intravenous administration. In recent years, an additional role has been proposed for Ig therapy for various inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Consequently, the use of SCIg has expanded from immunodeficiencies to immune-mediated diseases, such as polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM). Given the rarity of these conditions, it is still difficult to evaluate the real impact of SCIg treatment on PM and DM, and additional data are constantly required on this topic, particularly for long-term treatments in real-life settings. AIM: This study aimed to increase the knowledge about the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of SCIg treatment for myositis. To this aim, a long-term evaluation of the effectiveness of 20% human SCIg treatment (20% SCIg, Hizentra(?), CSL Behring) was carried out in patients with PM/DM in care at our Center. In addition, an evaluation of the 20% SCIg therapy in CVID patients was provided. This analysis, beside adding knowledge about the use of SCIg therapy in this real-life setting, was intended as a term of comparison, regarding the safety profile. RESULTS: Results support the beneficial effect and tolerability of long-term 20% SCIg therapy in PM/DM patients, reporting a significant improvement in creatine kinase levels, muscle strength, skin conditions, dysphagia, disease activity (MITAX score) and disability (HAQ-DI score). None of the patients reported systemic reactions. The duration of the reported local reactions was a few hours in 80% of the patients, and all resolved spontaneously. CVID patients reported an improvement in all the considered effectiveness parameters at the end of 20% SCIg therapy. The frequency of the adverse events reported by PM/DM patients was not different from what reported in CVID patients, where the use of SCIg therapy is more consolidated CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that 20% SCIg treatment represents a viable and safe treatment for PM/DM patients and a valid therapeutic alternative to IVIg, with important advantages for patients quality of life.","output":"Replacement and Immunomodulatory Activities of 20% Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin Treatment: A Single-Center Retrospective Study in Autoimmune Myositis and CVID Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the costliest complex disease affecting the cattle industry worldwide, with significant economic losses.

Gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, diabetes mellitus, wound age, wound length, wound contamination, wound type, and sites were analyzed using univariable analysis and binary logistic regression. Results: There were 3,276 cases included. In the univariable analysis, there was no significant difference in the infection rate between genders or between the wound age groups. In binary logistic regression, age, wound length, wound type, and physician level were risk factors for infection: age of 18-44 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-2.9), 44-64 years (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.3-4.3), and 65 years (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-4.1); wound length of 4-8 cm (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2) and >8 cm (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1); intra-oral wounds (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4) and communicating wounds (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3-4.4); junior specialists (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2); and lip (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.0) and cheek (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.3-17.1) sites.

EXPERT OPINION: The growing understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes is enabling the careful selection of patients suitable for biologics. In this context, the availability of reliable and simple self-injection devices is important in implementing self-administration. The transition to self-injection is also possible thanks to the high safety profile of biologics. With attention, most patients may potentially be suitable for self-administration. The transition process from hospital to home administration can therefore be carried out correctly by clinicians with adequate expertise in the field of severe asthma and biologic therapies, with the support of other health professionals, pharmacists, and general practitioners.

The imbalances between T helper (Th)1/Th2 cells and Th17/regulatory T (Treg) cells participate in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Previously it was demonstrated that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 knockout (KO) prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity of young mice (6 months of age), however the effect of TLR4 KO on spontaneous obesity in aged mice (18 month of age) is still unknown. To further study this, TLR4 KO and WT mice were fed with a standard chow diet from weaning to the endpoint of the experiment. We found that TLR4-/- mice were thinner compared with WT mice at 6 months (M) old. However, TLR4-/- mice spontaneously developed obesity with increased weight and adiposity in both subcutaneous and visceral fat depots by 18 M old. Our results also indicated that TLR4 KO activated TRIF/IRF3 signalling, induced inflammation, and repolarised alternatively-activated (M2) macrophages to classically-activated (M1) macrophages. In addition, TLR4 KO resulted in an increased spleen index and induced imbalances of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cells which indicated the occurrence of chronic low-grade inflammation. In conclusion, chronic low-grade inflammation induced by TLR4 KO was involved in spontaneous obesity in aged mice. An emerging link was established among the TRIF/IRF3 pathway, chronic low-grade inflammation, and obesity. We hope that these novel findings will provide a potential preventive strategy for obesity and build a spontaneous obesity mouse model.","output":"Chronic low-grade inflammation is involved in TLR4 knockout-induced spontaneous obesity in aged mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of infection control has taken centre stage with the arrival of Covid-19, and radiology staff must take precautions to limit contamination.

Information spread is measured on volume and retweets and the Value of Misinformation (VoMi) is introduced as the impact on forecast accuracy where misinformation has the highest dissimilarity in information dynamics. We validate InTo for COVID-19 in New Delhi and three other SE Asian cities. We forecast weekly hospitalization and cases using ARIMA models and interpolate spatial hospitalization using geostatistical kriging on inferred risk perception curves between tweet positivity and epidemiological outcomes. Geospatial tweet positivity tracks accurately ~60% of hospitalizations and forecasts hospitalization risk hotspots along risk aversion gradients. VoMi is higher for risk-prone areas and time periods, where misinformation has the highest predictability, with high incidence and positivity manifesting popularity-seeking social dynamics. Hospitalization gradients, VoMi, effective healthcare pressure and spatial model-data gaps can be used to predict hospitalization fluxes, misinformation, capacity gaps and surveillance uncertainty.

Governments turned their hopes to technology and its potential to offer reliable solutions in controlling the virus. Contact-tracing apps were introduced to assist health officials in tracking down exposures after infected individuals were identified. Despite the benefits, the design of tracking apps was accompanied by many privacy concerns. The objective of this chapter is to survey what strategies of digital contact tracing have been used to control the spread of COVID-19, what are some of the privacy discussions that surround the choices for those strategies and whether those choices are embedded in the legal requirements of privacy protection. The chapter argues that privacy should be a central feature of the conversations surrounding the implementation of contact-tracing technologyevery decision-making should always take place within the legal boundaries of privacy protection. The Canadian case serves as a good example because the public policy makers did not respond to the health crisis by compromising privacy rights for the benefit of protecting public health, even if the situation could have favored such decision. The chapter offers an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing employed in Canada with the aim of analyzing how privacy concerns shaped the Canadian decision-making in adopting particular measures. The chapter concludes that it is in under situations of crisis when a countrys democracy is put to a testpolicy makers will fail the test if they aim to achieve legitimate goals through controversial means, especially if those means weaken fundamental human rights.

Recombinant genomes were then constructed that contained mixtures of the WT and mutant regulatory circuits, reflecting recombinant viruses that might occur in nature. Although viable viruses could readily be isolated from WT and recombinant genomes containing homogeneous transcription circuits, chimeras that contained mixed regulatory networks were invariantly lethal, because viable chimeric viruses were not isolated. Mechanistically, mixed regulatory circuits promoted inefficient subgenomic transcription from inappropriate start sites, resulting in truncated ORFs and effectively minimize viral structural protein expression.

The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the enhanced activation of PPAR transcription factors, including PPAR, and to a lesser degree PPAR and PPAR1. How these transcription factors are regulated in the heart is largely unknown. Recent studies have described post-translational ubiquitination of PPARs as ways in which PPAR activity is inhibited in cancer. However, specific mechanisms in the heart have not previously been described. Recent studies have implicated the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase muscle ring finger-2 (MuRF2) in inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor SRF. Initial studies of MuRF2?/? hearts revealed enhanced PPAR activity, leading to the hypothesis that MuRF2 regulates PPAR activity by post-translational ubiquitination. METHODS: MuRF2?/? mice were challenged with a 26-week 60% fat diet designed to simulate obesity-mediated insulin resistance and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mice were followed by conscious echocardiography, blood glucose, tissue triglyceride, glycogen levels, immunoblot analysis of intracellular signaling, heart and skeletal muscle morphometrics, and PPAR, PPAR, and PPAR1-regulated mRNA expression. RESULTS: MuRF2 protein levels increase ~20% during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy induced by high fat diet. Compared to littermate wildtype hearts, MuRF2?/? hearts exhibit an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by an early onset systolic dysfunction, larger left ventricular mass, and higher heart weight. MuRF2?/? hearts had significantly increased PPAR- and PPAR1-regulated gene expression by RT-qPCR, consistent with MuRF2s regulation of these transcription factors in vivo. Mechanistically, MuRF2 mono-ubiquitinated PPAR and PPAR1 in vitro, consistent with its non-degradatory role in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, increasing MuRF2:PPAR1 (>5:1) beyond physiological levels drove poly-ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PPAR1 in vitro, indicating large MuRF2 increases may lead to PPAR degradation if found in other disease states. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in MuRF2 have been described to contribute to the severity of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study suggests that the lack of MuRF2, as found in these patients, can result in an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy. These studies also identify MuRF2 as the first ubiquitin ligase to regulate cardiac PPAR and PPAR1 activities in vivo via post-translational modification without degradation.

There is no clear explanation why food allergy appears to have increased so rapidly in recent years, particularly in young children, hence ongoing research to identify effective primary prevention strategies. Food allergy prevention guidelines for health professionals have been developed based on existing clinical trial evidence for effective translation and implementation. As these guidelines underpin clinical practice, it is important to ensure robust processes of development. We conducted a systematic review to identify food allergy prevention guidelines for health professional use; to compare the recommendations made by the identified guideline documents; and to assess the quality of the identified guideline documents. We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Global Health and Guidelines International Network for the period 1990 to 13 August 2019, to identify articles referring to English-language food allergy prevention guidelines or the guidelines themselves. A grey literature search of Google Scholar and reference checking was also undertaken. The guidelines were compared for recommendation similarities and differences. An Appraisal Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) appraisal was undertaken to assess guideline quality. The electronic database search yielded 1121 publications and reference checking identified an additional 16 publications. After title, abstract and full text screening, data extraction was undertaken on 156 publications and with additional reference checking, 28 food allergy prevention guidelines and advice documents were identified. Comparison of the recommendations within the guidelines and advice documents indicated the greatest variation in recommendations related to exclusive breastfeeding and timing of solid food introduction. Eight of the 10 guidelines and none of the 18 advice documents met the quality threshold set by the reviewers. Overall, documents specifically termed \\"guidelines\\" scored better than advice documents when assessed using the AGREE II tool. Variation in recommendations may create confusion for health professionals and result in inconsistent advice being provided to parents, and less translation of the evidence into actual food allergy reduction in the population.

The AGREE II appraisal identified common areas of poorer quality development and/or documentation of processes to inform future guideline development.

Appropriate management of medicines for heart failure at the time of hospital discharge reduces readmissions, improves quality of life and increases survival. The Improving the Safety and Continuity Of Medicines management at Transitions (ISCOMAT) trial tests the effectiveness of the Medicines at Transition Intervention (MaTI), which aims to enhance self-care and increase community pharmacy involvement in the medicines management of heart failure patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: ISCOMAT is a parallel-group cluster randomised controlled trial, randomising 42 National Health Service trusts with cardiology wards in England on a 1:1 basis to implement the MaTI or treatment as usual. Around 2100 patients over the age of 18 admitted to hospital with heart failure with at least moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction within the last 5 years, and planned discharge to the geographical area of the cluster will be recruited. The MaTI consists of training for staff, a toolkit for participants, transfer of discharge information to community pharmacies and a medicines reconciliation/review. Treatment as usual is determined by local policy and practices. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure-related hospitalisation at 12 months postregistration obtained from national electronic health records. The key secondary outcome is continued prescription of guideline-indicated therapies at 12 months measured via patient-reported data and Hospital Episode Statistics. The trial contains a parallel mixed-methods process evaluation and an embedded health economics study.

The availability of information in pediatric intensive care (PICUs) remains limited. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 positive admissions (CPAs) in the United States and to determine factors that may impact those admissions. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 dashboard virtual pediatric system containing information regarding respiratory support and comorbidities for all CPAs between March and April 2020. The state level data contained 13 different factors from population density, comorbid conditions and social distancing score. The absolute CPAs count was converted to frequency using the state's population. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CPAs frequency and endpoints. Results A total of 205 CPAs were reported by 167 PICUs across 48 states. The estimated CPAs frequency was 2.8 per million children. A total of 3,235 tests were conducted with 6.3% positive tests. Children above 11 years of age comprised 69.7% of the total cohort and 35.1% had moderated or severe comorbidities. The median duration of a CPA was 4.9 days [1.25-12.00 days]. Out of the 1,132 total CPA days, 592 [52.2%] were for mechanical ventilation. The inpatient mortalities were 3 [1.4%]. Multivariate analyses demonstrated an association between CPA's with greater population density [beta-coefficient 0.01, p<0.01] and increased percent of children receiving the influenza vaccination [beta-coefficient 0.17, p=0.01]. Conclusions Inpatient mortality during PICU CPAs is relatively low at 1.4%. CPA frequency seems to be impacted by population density while characteristics of illness severity appear to be associated with ultraviolet index, temperature, and comorbidities such as Type 1 diabetes. These factors should be included in future studies using patient-level data.","output":"Pediatric intensive care unit admissions for COVID-19: insights using state level data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With over 575,000 deaths and about 13.3 million cases globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a terrible impact globally during the 6 months since cases were first detected in China.

We aimed to investigate age-related differences in symptom presentations of patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: SETTING: Calls to the medical helpline (1-8-1-3) and emergency number (1-1-2) in Copenhagen, Denmark. At both medical services all calls are recorded. PARTICIPANTS: We included calls for patients who called for help/guidance at the medical helpline or emergency number prior to receiving a test for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1st and 20th 2020 (8423 patients). Among these calls, we randomly sampled recorded calls from 350 patients who later tested positive and 250 patients tested negative and registered symptoms described in the call. OUTCOME: RESULTS: After exclusions, 544 calls (312 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 232 negative) were included in the analysis. Fever and cough remained the two most common of COVID-19 symptoms across all age groups and approximately 42% of SARS-CoV-2 positive and 20% of negative presented with both fever and cough. Symptoms including nasal congestion, irritation/pain in throat, muscle/joint pain, loss of taste and smell, and headache were common symptoms of COVID-19 for patients younger than 60 years; whereas loss of appetite and feeling unwell were more commonly seen among patients over 60 years. Headache and loss of taste and smell were rare symptoms of COVID-19 among patients over 60 years. CONCLUSION: Our study identified age-related differences in symptom presentations of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients calling for help or medical advice.

Despite the respiratory complication which is the most common symptomatology, multi-organ dysfunction and multiple cardiovascular complications were described such as acute myocarditis, heart failure and even arrhythmias. CASES PRESENTATION: Two patients aged 26 and 56 year-old, developed acute myocarditis related to Covid-19 infection but with different symptomatology. CASE 1: Presented to the emergency room with digestive symptomatology, Covid-19 infection was confirmed by a positive chest CT scan and positive COVID-19 serology testing. Clinical, biological, radiological findings allowed making the diagnosis of a Covid-19 infection with a bacterial superinfection complicated by a fulminant myocarditis. CASE 2: Presented to the emergency department with a chest pain, dyspnoea, paroxistic cough, myalgia and fever. A Covid-19 infection was confirmed. The electrocardiogram showed a diffuse ST elevation, echocardiography showed normal systolic function and the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I level was high. Invasive coronary angiography was performed, revealing angiographically normal coronary arteries. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Our 2 cases was treated differently, case 1 received antibiotherapy because of the bacterial superinfection and inotropic support for the septic and cardiogenic choc. Contrarily to case 2 who received inotropic support, immunoglobulin and corticosteroid. With a total recovery for both patients.

To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a data set of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean of 5.5 to 9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, consistent with a midrange coronavirus substitution rate of 3  10-4 substitutions/site/year. Almost one-half of sequence changes were Ca??U transitions, with an 8-fold base frequency normalized directional asymmetry between Ca??U and Ua??C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV), and decreasing ratios were observed in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E, and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. Ca??U transitions underpinned almost one-half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants and occurred preferentially in both 5' U/A and 3' U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favored motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in nonpandemic human coronaviruses (U a?? A > G a?? C) and low G+C contents may represent long-term effects of prolonged Ca??U hypermutation in their hosts. The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short- and long-term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favored mutational hot spots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represent a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks and are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations.IMPORTANCE The wealth of accurately curated sequence data for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), its long genome, and its low substitution rate provides a relatively blank canvas with which to investigate effects of mutational and editing processes imposed by the host cell. The finding that a large proportion of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 in the initial months of the pandemic comprised Ca??U mutations in a host APOBEC-like context provides evidence for a potent host-driven antiviral editing mechanism against coronaviruses more often associated with antiretroviral defense. In evolutionary terms, the contribution of biased, convergent, and context-dependent mutations to sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 is substantial, and these processes are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","output":"Rampant Ca??U Hypermutation in the Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses: Causes and Consequences for Their Short- and Long-Term Evolutionary Trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively update and survey the current provision of recovery, rehabilitation and follow-up services for adult critical care patients across the UK. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered, predominantly closed-question, electronic, online survey. SETTING: Institutions providing adult critical care services identified from national databases. PARTICIPANTS: Multiprofessional critical care clinicians delivering services at each site. RESULTS: Responses from 176 UK hospital sites were included (176/242, 72.7%). Inpatient recovery and follow-up services were present at 127/176 (72.2%) sites, adopting multiple formats of delivery and primarily delivered by nurses (n=115/127, 90.6%). Outpatient services ran at 130 sites (73.9%), predominantly as outpatient clinics. Most services (n=108/130, 83.1%) were co-delivered by two or more healthcare professionals, typically nurse/intensive care unit (ICU) physician (n=29/130, 22.3%) or nurse/ICU physician/physiotherapist (n=19/130, 14.6%) teams. Clinical psychology was most frequently lacking from inpatient or outpatient services. Lack of funding was consistently the primary barrier to service provision, with other barriers including logistical and service prioritisation factors indicating that infrastructure and profile for services remain inadequate. Posthospital discharge physical rehabilitation programmes were relatively few (n=31/176, 17.6%), but peer support services were available in nearly half of responding institutions (n=85/176, 48.3%). The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in either increasing, decreasing or reformatting service provision. Future plans for long-term service transformation focus on expansion of current, and establishment of new, outpatient services. CONCLUSION: Overall, these data demonstrate a proliferation of recovery, follow-up and rehabilitation services for critically ill adults in the past decade across the UK, although service gaps remain suggesting further work is required for guideline implementation. Findings can be used to enhance survivorship for critically ill adults, inform policymakers and commissioners, and provide comparative data and experiential insights for clinicians designing models of care in international healthcare jurisdictions.","output":"Recovery, rehabilitation and follow-up services following critical illness: an updated UK national cross-sectional survey and progress report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of narrow band CE-Chirp (NB CE-Chirp) on the amplitudes and latencies in ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs) at 500 and 1000 Hz in comparison with tone burst (TB). DESIGN Twenty-one healthy volunteers were included in the study and tested in air conduction with a \\"belly-tendon\\" montage. Recording conditions were randomized for each participant and each modality was tested twice to check the reproducibility of the procedure. RESULTS NB CE-Chirps at 500 Hz revealed larger n1-p1 amplitudes than 500 Hz TBs (p = .001), which were also larger than NB CE-Chirps and TBs at 1000 Hz (p = .022, p < .001, respectively). Besides, n1 and p1 latencies were shorter in NB CE-Chirp than in TB at 500 Hz (p < .001) and 1000 Hz (p < .001). The older the participants, the lower the amplitudes (p = .021, p = .031) and the longer the n1 (p = .030, p = .025) and p1 latencies (p < .001, p < .001) in 500 Hz NB CE-Chirps and 500 Hz TBs. Interaural asymmetry ratios were slightly higher in 500 Hz NB CE-Chirps as compared to 500 Hz TBs (p = .013). CONCLUSIONS NB CE-Chirps at 500 Hz improved the amplitudes of waveforms in oVEMPs. As for TBs with clicks before, enhancing oVEMPs amplitudes is an essential step to distinguish a healthy person from a patient with either utricular or its related pathways disorder and potentially minimize the risk of cochlear damages. Additional studies including a higher number of healthy participants and patients with vestibular disorders are required to confirm this hypothesis. The large interindividual variability of interaural asymmetry ratios in NB CE-Chirp and in TB at 500 Hz could be explained by the selected montage.","output":"Optimizing Ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials With Narrow Band CE-Chirps."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Varios artculos recientes sugieren que la obesidad es un factor de riesgo para una enfermedad ms grave por coronavirus.

However, there is a lack of consensus on how P4P affects health systems. There is a need to evaluate P4P effects on health systems using methods suitable for evaluating complex systems. We developed a causal loop diagram (CLD) to further understand the pathways to impact of P4P on delivery and uptake of MCH services in Tanzania. The CLD was developed and validated using qualitative data from a process evaluation of a P4P scheme in Tanzania, with additional stakeholder dialogue sought to strengthen confidence in the diagram. The CLD maps the interacting mechanisms involved in provider achievement of targets, reporting of health information, and population care seeking, and identifies those mechanisms affected by P4P. For example, the availability of drugs and medical commodities impacts not only provider achievement of P4P targets but also demand of services and is impacted by P4P through the availability of additional facility resources and the incentivisation of district managers to reduce drug stock outs. The CLD also identifies mechanisms key to facility achievement of targets but are not within the scope of the programme; the activities of health facility governing committees and community health workers, for example, are key to demand stimulation and effective resource use at the facility level but both groups were omitted from the incentive system. P4P design considerations generated from this work include appropriately incentivising the availability of drugs and staffing in facilities and those responsible for demand creation in communities. Further research using CLDs to study heath systems in LMIC is urgently needed to further our understanding of how systems respond to interventions and how to strengthen systems to deliver better coverage and quality of care.","output":"Understanding the maternal and child health system response to payment for performance in Tanzania using a causal loop diagram approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The use of computed tomography (CT) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in an area of northern Italy with a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have identified more patients with this disease than RT-PCR in the very early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 148 chest CT scans of oncological patients who were referred to the Radiological Unit of Policlinico S. Marco from 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bergamo area. In parallel, we analyzed RT-PCR tests of these 148 patients. Results Among 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 17 patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (53.1%), while 15 developed severe disease (46.8%). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.9%, the mortality rate was 18.8%. We did not find any correlation between disease severity and age, sex, smoking, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Remarkably, patients who were on treatment for cancer developed a milder disease than patients who were not on treatment. Conclusions The acceptance of CT-defined diagnoses in COVID-19 high-incidence areas like Bergamo region highlighted a larger oncological population affected by COVID-19 than RT-PCR, in particular, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, because only symptomatic patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that patients actively treated for their cancer had a milder disease, in agreement with previous studies that suggested a protective role of immunosuppression.

While highly conserved, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV PLpro have contrasting Ub/Ubl substrate preferences. Using a combination of structural analyses and functional assays, we identify a molecular sensor within the S1 Ub-binding site of PLpro that serves as a key determinant of substrate specificity. Variations within the S1 sensor specifically alter cleavage of Ub substrates but not of the Ubl interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15). Significantly, a variant of concern associated with immune evasion carries a mutation in the S1 sensor that enhances PLpro activity on Ub substrates.

Plasmonic nanomaterials offer a great opportunity to tune the functionality of enzymes, through their remarkable optical properties. Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) can be used to modify chemical transformations at the nanomaterial's surface, upon light irradiation. Incident light can promote energetic processes, which may be related to an increase of local temperature (photothermal effects), but also to effects triggered by generated hot-spots or hot-electrons (photoelectronic effects). As a consequence, light irradiation of the protein-nanomaterial interface affects enzyme functionality. To harness these effects to finely and remotely regulate enzyme activity, the physicochemical features of the nanomaterial, properties of the incident light and parameters governing molecular interactions must be optimized. In this perspective article, we discuss relevant examples that illustrate the use of plasmonic nanoparticles to control enzyme function through LSPR excitation. Finally, we also highlight the importance of expanding the use of plasmonic nanomaterials to the immobilization of multi-enzyme systems for light-driven regulation of cell-free biosynthetic pathways.

Earlier COVID-19 studies have reported that the pandemic caused widespread impacts on mental health and sleep in the general population. However, it remains largely unknown how the prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbance developed and interacted in adolescents at different times in the epidemic. METHODS: 831 teenagers (aged 14C19) underwent a longitudinal follow-up study to evaluate the prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbance among adolescents before, during, and after the COVID-19 breakout in China and to explore the interaction between mental health and sleep across the three measurements. The chronotype, anxiety and depression level, sleep quality, and insomnia were investigated during each measurement. RESULTS: The adolescents had delayed sleep onset and sleep offset time, longer sleep duration during the quarantine than before and after the epidemic, whereas their chronotype tended to morning type during the epidemic. Yet, the highest prevalence of anxiety, depression, poor sleeper, and insomnia symptoms were observed before but not during the COVID-19 breakout. The females and adolescents who were eveningness type showed significantly higher anxiety and depression levels, poorer sleep quality, and severe insomnia status than the males and the intermediate and morning types. Sleep disturbance was positively associated with mental problems among three measurements. Pre-measured depression level significantly predicted sleep disturbance level at follow-ups.

We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (1/12/19-30/09/20). We also searched clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished studies testing therapies with potential implication for COVID-19-mediated cardiovascular complication. Eligible studies had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and a clinical and/or histological diagnosis of myocarditis by ESC or WHO/ISFC criteria. Reports of 38 cases were included (26 male patients, 24 aged < 50 years). The first histologically proven case was a virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis; however, biopsy evidence of myocarditis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 cardiotropism has been recently demonstrated. Histological data was found in 12 cases (8 EMB and 4 autopsies) and CMR was the main imaging modality to confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis (25 patients). There was a substantial variability in biventricular systolic function during the acute episode and in therapeutic regimen used. Five patients died in hospital. Cause-effect relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and myocarditis is difficult to demonstrate. However, current evidence demonstrates myocardial inflammation with or without direct cardiomyocyte damage, suggesting different pathophysiology mechanisms responsible of COVID-mediated myocarditis.

Design: Retrospective case-control study. Setting: Robertsau Geriatric Hospital of the University Hospitals of Strasbourg, France. Patients: 179 elderly patients who had been in contact with the SARS-CoV-2, of whom 89 had tested RT-PCR-positive (COVID-pos) for the virus and 90 had tested RT-PCR-negative (COVID-neg). Measurements: Treatments within 15 days prior to RT-PCR (including antihypertensive drugs, antipsychotics, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), paracetamol, anticoagulant, oral antidiabetics (OADs), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants), comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcome were all collected using the electronic patient record. Results: COVID-pos patients more frequently had a history of diabetes (P=.016) and alcoholism (P=.023), a lower leukocyte count (P=.014) and a higher mortality rateC29.2% versus 14.4% C(P=.014) when compared to COVID-neg patients. Patients on PPIs were 2.3 times less likely (odds ratio [OR] = 0.4381, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.2331, 0.8175], P=.0053) to develop COVID-19 infection, compared to those not on PPIs.

By mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India have crossed 95,000. To facilitate an intuition for the spatio-temporal development of the pandemic and to help resource deployment planning, we analyze and describe how the disease burden almost-predictably shifted from large metropolitan districts to sub-urban districts. Methods. We gathered the publicly available granular data from 186 different districts (equivalent of counties) on their COVID-19 infections and deaths during the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. These districts presented an active case burden of 559,566 and a cumulative 2,715,656 infections as of August 31. The epidemiological data of these districts was fit to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model and the underlying epidemic parameters for each of these districts during the course of 4 months was estimated. We validated these parameters against known epidemiological characteristic distributions and analyzed them to understand their changes in space-time during the pandemic. Findings. The center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with most international access shifted continuously and smoothly shifted towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in most epidemic parameters consistently across the districts with four categories of accessibility from an international travel perspective - large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77{+/-}0.58 on May 15 to 1.07{+/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58{+/-}0.39 on May 15 to 0.94{+/-}0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581{+/-}0.009 on May 15 to 0.091{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26.10^{-12}); and from 0.059{+/-}0.011 on May 15 to 0.100{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12.10{-16}). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025{+/-}0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018{+/-}0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789. Interpretation. As the daily infections continue to rise at a national level, it is important to notice a \`local-flattening' in larger metro districts, and a shift of the pandemic-burden towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. The pandemic burden shifting towards remotely accessible regions, with possibly lesser health care facilities, is a call for attention to the re-organization of resources.","output":"A steady trickle-down from metro districts and improving epidemic-parameters characterize the increasing COVID-19 cases in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to reduce disease spread.

Early humoral response has been extensively studied, however data on what recovered individuals are still scarce and the most recent studies are based on few time points over time, which limits the comprehension of the longitudinal pattern of the potential changes. In this study we have evaluated the neutralizing activity and IgG antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 in mild/ asymptomatic and hospitalized COVID-19 individuals, over a 6-month period. Methods: We have evaluated the kinetics of the humoral immune response in 210 individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 covering the first and second waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Catalonia (Spain). IgG antibody titer was evaluated with an in-house sandwich ELISA against the S2 subunit, the binding domain receptor (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP) and the neutralizing activity was evaluated by a neutralization assay with HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects non-linear and linear models. Results: Most study participants developed a neutralizing humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, however the maximum neutralization titer was 10-fold lower in mild/asymptomatic individuals compared to those with a more severe illness. We observed a slow and progressive decay of neutralizing activity in individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease throughout the 6-month period. In hospitalized individuals, half maximal neutralization activity was achieved on day 10 and showed an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed and remained nearly flat after day 80. Despite this, activity at six months remained higher in hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic participants. On the other hand, we observed that IgG antibody titers against S2, RBD and NP had a more marked fall without showing differences in the decay pattern between individuals with different degree of severity of the disease. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the neutralizing activity remains relatively stable for more than 6 months despite the decline in IgG antibodies, suggesting that the quality of immune response evolves and allows maintaining the neutralizing activity despite the decay in antibody titers. Our results provide a more detailed picture of the behavior of the natural humoral immune response over time that complements the current evidence on mid-term immunity.","output":"Stable neutralizing-antibody levels 6 months after mild and severe COVID-19 episode"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid detection and isolation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is the only means of reducing hospital transmission.

The global and by age-groups weighted seroprevalences have been estimated and the risk factors of the infection by SARS-COV-2 have been assessed by using logistic regression. Results In Cotonou, a slight increase in overall age-standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from 29.77% (95% CI: 23.12-37.41%) at the first survey to 34.86% (95% CI: 31.57-38.30%) at the second survey was observed.

This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being, training, and career choices of Canadian medical clerks within the first three months of the pandemic. It also aims to assess their use of university support systems and their appreciation of potential solutions to common academic stressors. METHODS: An electronic survey composed of four sections: demographics, stressors experienced during the pandemic, World Health Organization (WHO) well-being index, and stress management and resources was distributed to Canadian clerks. RESULTS: Clerks from 10 of the 17 Canadian medical faculties participated in this study (n = 627). Forty-five percent of clerks reported higher levels of stress than usual; 22% reconsidered their residency choice; and 19% reconsidered medicine as a career. The factors that were most stressful among clerks were: the means of return to rotations; decreased opportunities to be productive in view of residency match; and taking the national licensing exam after the beginning of residency. The mean WHO well-being index was 14.8/25  4.5, indicating a poor level of well-being among a considerable proportion of students. Clerks who reconsidered their residency choice or medicine as a career had lower mean WHO well-being indices. Most clerks agreed with the following suggested solutions: training sessions on the clinical management of COVID-19 cases; being allowed to submit fewer reference letters when applying to residency; and having protected time to study for their licensing exam during residency. Overall, clerks were less concerned with being infected during their rotations than with the impact of the pandemic on their future career and residency match.

Surgical checklist exposure was associated with lower crude hospital mortality (OR 0.84, CI 0.75-0.94; P=0.002). This effect remained after adjustment for baseline risk factors in a multivariate model (adjusted OR 0.81, CI 0.70-0.94; P<0.005) and strengthened after adjusting for variations within countries and hospitals in a three-level generalized mixed model (adjusted OR 0.71, CI 0.58-0.85; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The use of surgical checklists varies across European nations. Reported use of a checklist was associated with lower mortality. This observation may represent a protective effect of the surgical checklist itself, or alternatively, may be an indirect indicator of the quality of perioperative care.

Mouse aSyn contains a threonine residue at position 53 that mimics the human familial PD substitution A53T, yet in contrast to A53T patients, mice show no evidence of aSyn neuropathology even after aging. Here, we studied the neurotoxicity of human A53T, mouse aSyn, and various human-mouse chimeras in cellular and in vivo models, as well as their biochemical properties relevant to aSyn pathobiology. METHODS: Primary midbrain cultures transduced with aSyn-encoding adenoviruses were analyzed immunocytochemically to determine relative dopaminergic neuron viability. Brain sections prepared from rats injected intranigrally with aSyn-encoding adeno-associated viruses were analyzed immunohistochemically to determine nigral dopaminergic neuron viability and striatal dopaminergic terminal density. Recombinant aSyn variants were characterized in terms of fibrillization rates by measuring thioflavin T fluorescence, fibril morphologies via electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and protein-lipid interactions by monitoring membrane-induced aSyn aggregation and aSyn-mediated vesicle disruption. Statistical tests consisted of ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons post hoc test and the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn's multiple comparisons test or a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mouse aSyn was less neurotoxic than human aSyn A53T in cell culture and in rat midbrain, and data obtained for the chimeric variants indicated that the human-to-mouse substitutions D121G and N122S were at least partially responsible for this decrease in neurotoxicity. Human aSyn A53T and a chimeric variant with the human residues D and N at positions 121 and 122 (respectively) showed a greater propensity to undergo membrane-induced aggregation and to elicit vesicle disruption. Differences in neurotoxicity among the human, mouse, and chimeric aSyn variants correlated weakly with differences in fibrillization rate or fibril morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Mouse aSyn is less neurotoxic than the human A53T variant as a result of inhibitory effects of two C-terminal amino acid substitutions on membrane-induced aSyn aggregation and aSyn-mediated vesicle permeabilization. Our findings highlight the importance of membrane-induced self-assembly in aSyn neurotoxicity and suggest that inhibiting this process by targeting the C-terminal domain could slow neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathy disorders.","output":"Two C-terminal sequence variations determine differential neurotoxicity between human and mouse -synuclein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting millions of patients worldwide.

In this process, a patient who tests positive for an infectious disease and public health officials work to identify the patient's close contacts, notify them of their risk of possible exposure to the disease, and provide resources to facilitate the decreased spreading of disease. Contact notification can be done physically in person, via phone call, or digitally through the use of media such as SMS and email. When alerts are made through the latter, it is called digital contact notification. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform a preliminary evaluation on the use of TellYourContacts.org, a COVID-19 digital contact notification tool that can be used confidentially and anonymously, to gather information about the quantity of website users and message senders, the types of messages sent, and the geographic distribution of senders. METHODS: Patients who chose to get tested for COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the disease were alerted of their positive results through Curative, Inc., a COVID-19 testing laboratory, and Healthvana, a results disclosure app. Included in the notification was a link to TellYourContacts.org and a message encouraging the COVID-19 positive patient to utilize the website to alert their close contact of exposure risk. Over the course of three months, from May 18th, 2020 to August 17th, 2020, we utilized Google Analytics and Microsoft Excel to record data on the quantity of website users and message senders, types of messages sent, and geographic distribution of the senders. RESULTS: Over the course of three months, 9,130 users accessed the website. Of the users, 1,474 unique senders sent a total of 1,957 messages. Of those messages, users sent 1,820 (93%) SMS messages and 137 (7%) emails. Users sent messages from 40 states, with the majority of United States senders from California (49%). CONCLUSIONS: We set out to determine if individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will utilize the TellYourContacts.org website to notify their close contacts of COVID-19 exposure risk. Our findings reveal that, during the observation period, each unique sender sent an average of 1.33 messages.

Drawing knowledge maps of health literacy research through data mining and visualized measurement technology helps systematically present the research status and development trends in global academic circles. METHODS: This paper uses CiteSpace to carry out a metric analysis of 9,492 health literacy papers included in Web of Science through mapping knowledge domains. First, based on the production theory of scientific knowledge and the data mining of citations, the main bodies (country, institution and author) that produce health literacy knowledge as well as their mutual cooperation (collaboration network) are both clarified. Additionally, based on the quantitative framework of cocitation analysis, this paper introduces the interdisciplinary features, development trends and hot topics of the field. Finally, by using burst detection technology in the literature, it further reveals the research frontiers of health literacy. RESULTS: The results of the BC measures of the global health literacy research collaboration network show that the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom are the major forces in the current international collaboration network on health literacy. There are still relatively very few transnational collaborations between Eastern and Western research institutions. Collaborations in public environmental occupational health, health care science services, nursing and health policy services have been active in the past five years. Research topics in health literacy research evolve over time, mental health has been the most active research field in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic approach is needed to address the challenges of health literacy, and the network framework of cooperation on health literacy at regional, national and global levels should be strengthened to further promote the application of health literacy research. In the future, we anticipate that this research field will expand in two directions, namely, mental health literacy and eHealth literacy, both of which are closely linked to social development and issues.

Tinnitus influenced by alterations in somatosensory afference from the neck or jaw is referred to as somatic tinnitus (ST). ST is known to respond positively to physiotherapy treatment; however, it is challenging to motivate patients to systematically perform home exercises correctly, and the necessary tinnitus counselling is often lacking. The aim of this study is twofold, namely to investigate both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a blended physiotherapy program for ST, including a smartphone application designed to increase exercise therapy compliance and provide tinnitus counselling. METHODS: This study is designed as a single-blind two-arm 1:1 randomised controlled trial (RCT). Adult patients diagnosed with ST, without psychiatric comorbidities and with experience in using a smartphone, will be recruited at the Ear Nose Throat (ENT) department of the Antwerp University Hospital (UZA). Patients will be randomised into two groups. The experimental group will receive the blended physiotherapy program comprising six in-clinic physiotherapy sessions over a period of 12 weeks (1x/2 weeks) and an exercise and counselling program provided by the smartphone application. The control group will receive the standard care program comprising twelve weekly in-clinic physiotherapy sessions. Each physiotherapy session has a duration of 30 min. The primary outcome measure is the change in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) score. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a societal perspective considering both direct and indirect costs. There will be follow-up assessments at one and 3 months after the final treatment session. DISCUSSION: Our study is the first to combine both tinnitus counselling and neck/jaw treatment provided by a digital application in a blended physiotherapy program. This, in order to empower ST patients to improve and better manage their own health and, possibly, reduce economic costs by alleviating the tinnitus burden that ST patients experience.

This study describes the clinical features and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in hospitalized patients in Egypt. METHODS: SARI surveillance was implemented at Cairo University Hospital (CUH) during the period 2010C2014. All hospitalized patients meeting the WHO case definition for SARI were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs were collected and samples were tested using RT-PCR for influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1,2,3,4), adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and atypical bacteria. Data were analyzed to calculate positivity rates for viral pathogens and determine which pathogens related to severe outcomes or resulted in death. RESULTS: Overall, 1,075/3,207 (33.5%) cases had a viral etiology, with a mean age of 5.74 (13.87) years. The highest rates were reported for RSV (485 cases, 45.2%), PIV (125, 11.6%), and adenovirus (105, 9.8%). Children had a higher viral rate (981, 91.2%) compared to 94 (8.8%) cases in adults. Patients with identified viruses had significantly lower rates for ICU admission, hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, and overall mortality than those without identified viruses. No infections were independently associated with severe outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens were encountered in one-third of hospitalized adult and pediatric Egyptian patients with SARI, while atypical bacteria had a minor role. Highest rates of viral infections were reported for RSV, PIV, and adenovirus.

It is critically important to differentiate between bacterial infection and colonization to avoid prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. Quantitative culture of lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens, however, requires invasive procedures. Nowadays, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been studied in vitro and in vivo to identify pathogen-derived biomarkers. Therefore, an exploratory pilot study was conceived for a proof of concept that the appearance and level of A. baumannii-derived metabolites might be correlated with the presence of the pathogen and its ecological niche (i.e. the infection and colonization states) in ICU ventilated patients. Twenty patients with A. baumannii VAP (infection group), 20 ventilated patients with LRT A. baumannii colonization (colonization group) and 20 ventilated patients with neurological disorders, but without pneumonia or A. baumannii colonization (control group) were enrolled in the in vivo pilot study. A clinical isolate of A. baumannii strains was used for the in vitro culture experiment. The adsorptive preconcentration (solid-phase microextraction fiber and Tenax(?) TA) and analysis technique of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were applied in the studies. Breath profiles could be visually differentiated between A. baumannii cultivation in vitro and culture medium, and among in vivo groups. In the in vitro experiment, nine compounds of interest (2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, 1-undecene, isopentyl 3-methylbutanoate, decanal, 1,3-naphthalenediol, longifolene, tetradecane, iminodibenzyl and 3-methyl-indene) in the headspace were found to be possible A. baumannii derivations. While there were eight target VOCs (1-undecene, nonanal, decanal, 2,6,10-trimethyl-dodecane, 5-methyl-5-propyl-nonane, longifolene, tetradecane and 2-butyl-1-octanol) exhibiting characteristics of A. baumannii VAP derivations. The selected VOC profile in vivo could be adopted to efficiently differentiate the presence of LRT A. baumannii from its absence, and LRT A. baumannii infection from its colonization (AUC = 0.89 and 0.88, respectively). It is not feasible to simply transfer the metabolic biomarkers from the in vitro condition to in vivo.

CBD has been suggested to ameliorate monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH, including reduction in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), a vasorelaxant effect on pulmonary arteries and a decrease in the white blood cell count. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of chronic administration of CBD (10 mg/kg daily for 21 days) on the parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs of rats with MCT-induced PH. In MCT-induced PH, we found a decrease in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and glutathione level (GSH), an increase in inflammatory parameters, e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), and the overexpression of cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 (CB(1)-Rs, CB(2)-Rs). Administration of CBD increased TAC and GSH concentrations, glutathione reductase (GSR) activity, and decreased CB(1)-Rs expression and levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-, IL -1, NF-B, MCP-1 and CD68. In conclusion, CBD has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in MCT-induced PH.

Many studies have attempted to improve patientCphysician communication. Incorporating patient priorities into agenda setting and medical decision-making are fundamental to patient-centered communication. Efficient and scalable approaches are needed to empower patients to speak up and prepare physicians to respond. Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) in engaging patients and health care teams has the potential to enhance the integration of patient priorities in clinical encounters. A systematic approach to eliciting and documenting patient priorities before encounters could facilitate effective communication in such encounters. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report the design and implementation of a set of EHR tools built into clinical workflows for facilitating patientCphysician joint agenda setting and the documentation of patient concerns in the EHRs for ambulatory encounters. METHODS: We engaged health information technology leaders and users in three health care systems for developing and implementing a set of EHR tools. The goal of these tools is to standardize the elicitation of patient priorities by using a previsit patient important issue questionnaire distributed through the patient portal to the EHR. We built additional EHR documentation tools to facilitate patientCstaff communication when the staff records the vital signs and the reason for the visit in the EHR while in the examination room, with a simple transmission method for physicians to incorporate patient concerns in EHR notes. RESULTS: The study is ongoing. The anticipated completion date for survey data collection is November 2021. A total of 34,037 primary care patients from three health systems (n=26,441; n=5136; and n=2460 separately recruited from each system) used the previsit patient important issue questionnaire in 2020. The adoption of the digital previsit questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic was much higher in one health care system because it expanded the use of the questionnaire from physicians participating in trials to all primary care providers midway through the year. It also required the use of this previsit questionnaire for eCheck-ins, which are required for telehealth encounters. Physicians and staff suggested anecdotally that this questionnaire helped patientCclinician communication, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: EHR tools have the potential to facilitate the integration of patient priorities into agenda setting and documentation in real-world primary care practices. Early results suggest the feasibility and acceptability of such digital tools in three health systems. EHR tools can support patient engagement and clinicians work during in-person and telehealth visits. They could potentially exert a sustained influence on patient and clinician communication behaviors in contrast to prior ad hoc educational efforts targeting patients or clinicians.

Isoquercetin is a monoglycosylated derivative of quercetin. When ingested, isoquercetin accumulates more than quercetin in the intestinal mucosa where it is converted to quercetin;the latter is absorbed into enterocytes, transported to the liver, released in circulation, and distributed to tissues, mostly as metabolic conjugates. Physiologically, isoquercetin and quercetin exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, and anticoagulant activities. Generally isoquercetin is less active than quercetin in vitro and ex vivo, whereas it is equally or more active in vivo, suggesting that it is primarily a more absorbable precursor to quercetin, providing more favorable pharmacokinetics to the latter. Isoquercetin, like quercetin, has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activities, significantly reducing cell infection by influenza, Zika, Ebola, dengue viruses among others. This ability, together with their other physiological properties and their safety profile, has led to the proposition that administration of these flavonols could prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), or arrest the progression to severity and lethality of resulting coronavirus disease of 2019 (Covid-19). In silico screening of small molecules for binding affinity to proteins involved SARS-CoV-2 life cycle has repeatedly situated quercetin and isoquercetin near to top of the list of likely effectors.

We estimated associations between household composition and COVID-19 mortality in older adults ([]65 years) using a newly linked census-based dataset, and investigated whether living in a multi-generational household explained some of the elevated COVID-19 mortality amongst ethnic minority groups. Methods: Using retrospective data from the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2017-2019) and death registration data (up to 27th July 2020), we followed adults aged 65 years or over living in private households in England from 2 March 2020 until 27 July 2020 (n=10,078,568). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 death for people living in a multi-generational household compared with people living with another older adult, adjusting for geographical factors, socio-economic characteristics and pre-pandemic health. We conducted a causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of ethnic inequalities explained by living in a multi-generational household. Results: Living in a multi-generational household was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. After adjusting for confounding factors, the HRs for living in a multi-generational household with dependent children were 1.13 [95% confidence interval 1.01-1.27] and 1.17 [1.01-1.35] for older males and females. The HRs for living in a multi-generational household without dependent children were 1.03 [0.97 - 1.09] for older males and 1.22 [1.12 - 1.32] for older females. Living in a multi-generational household explained between 10% and 15% of the elevated risk of COVID-19 death among older females from South Asian background, but very little for South Asian males or people in other ethnic minority groups. Conclusion: Older adults living with younger people are at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, and this is a notable contributing factor to the excess risk experienced by older South Asian females compared to White females.

An open-label clinical study to determine the tolerance and efficacy of oral BSS therapy (Pepto-Bismol chewable tablets) was performed in 10 patients with acute, active COVID-19. Concurrent COVID-19 standard of care treatment was continued in these patients. Methods: Entry into the study required a positive salivary COVID-19 test, and the ability to chew Pepto-Bismol tablets. Demographics, vitals, comorbidities, COVID-19 related symptoms and concomitant medications were recorded. Sixteen (16) Pepto Bismol tablets were given per day for three days. The presence/absence of salivary SARS CoV-2 virus by RT-LAMP assay was measured daily. Results: After three days two groups emerged, 5 remaining COVID-19 positive and 5 COVID-19 negative (-) patients. Both groups were not demographically different. Medical vitals were similar, but the COVID-19+ patients trended to have more starting comorbidities and concomitant medications. COVID-19 related morbidities were similar between the groups. All patients studied showed an overall decrease in COVID-19 symptoms. The difference between the two groups of patients that became COVID-19- and those that remained virus + was the preexisting use of SSRI/SNRI/SARI or second-generation histamine receptor 1 (H1R) medications. None of the COVID-19 - group were on these medications and appeared to respond to administration of bismuth subsalicylate by clearing the virus from the saliva within days. None of the 10 BSS treated patients required escalation of care to an ICU. Conclusion: Bismuth subsalicylate is an over-the-counter intestinal medication. Bismuth has been shown to decrease SARS-CoV-2 viral replication through its effects on the viral helicase. Preexisting medications can impact its efficacy.

The current body of evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 requires the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the membrane-bound serine protease TMPRSS2 to enter cells. Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 patients rarely exhibit viral RNA in tear film and conjunctival smears and that, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are only expressed in very small amounts in the conjunctiva, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely. Nevertheless, we consider the current evidence to be still too limited to provide a conclusive statement and recommend appropriate protective measures for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients.","output":"Welche Bedeutung hat die Bindehaut als m?glicher bertragungsweg fr eine SARS-CoV-2-Infektion?/ [What is the importance of the conjunctiva as a potential transmission pathway for SARS-CoV-2 infections?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE During the early 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, several US states had implemented stay-in-place orders (SIPOs) with varying degrees of stringency which resulted in inter-state differences in mobility (i.e., longer presence at home). We test whether the inter-state differences in mobility influenced changes in reported psychological distress. Our study is not on the surge in COVID-19 in the later part of 2020. OBJECTIVE To identify whether the change in state-level mobility is associated with the change in individuals' reported psychological distress during the early COVID-19 pandemic and whether the intensity of the association varies by older individuals, females, and nonwhites. METHODS We use differences in state-level mobility and change in reported psychological distress between the two dates of interviews of 5,132 individuals who participated in March and April 2020 waves of Understanding America Study (UAS). RESULTS We find support for modest effects, i.e., a one standard deviation decline in mobility was associated with a 3.02% higher psychological distress [95% CI: 0.4%-5.64%], and the effects are robust to controlling for reported changes in exercise intensity, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, recreational drug use, and meditation intensity. We also find support for a stronger association for females, but not for older individuals or non-whites. Further, we do not find support for the mediation effects from change in chance of running out of money or change in chance of getting COVID-19. CONCLUSION Our findings show that reduced mobility from lockdowns during the early COVID-19 wave in the US is associated with a modest increase in reported psychological distress, especially for females. However, these conclusions should not be construed as a small increase in psychological distress in general, as a variety of non-mobility related factors associated with COVID-19 could have exacerbated psychological distress during the early COVID-19 wave in the US.","output":"Change in psychological distress in response to changes in reduced mobility during the early 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence of modest effects from the U.S."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a zoonotic illness caused by a new strain of coronavirus and has recently been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with an estimated fatality rate of 1% to 2%.

In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%). Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min.

METHODS From January 2014 to May 2016, 49 patients underwent robotic-assisted right colectomy by a board-certified colorectal surgeon (S.R). Extracorporeal anastomosis (ECA) was used in the first 20 procedures, whereas ICA was used in all subsequent procedures. Outcomes recorded in a database for retrospective review included operating time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), conversion rate, complications, readmissions, and mortality rate. RESULTS Comparison of average OT, EBL, and LOS between extracorporeal and intracorporeal groups demonstrated no significant differences. For all patients, average OT was 141.6  25.8 (range 86-192) min, average EBL was 59.5  83.3 (range 0-500) mL, and average LOS was 3.4  1.19 (range 1.5-8) days. Four patients required conversion, all of which occurred in the extracorporeal group. There were no conversions after the 18th procedure. The 60-day mortality rate was 0%. There were no anastomotic leaks, ostomies created, or readmissions. As the surgeon gained experience, a statistically significant increase in lymph node sampling was observed in oncologic cases (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS The robotic platform may help more surgeons safely and efficiently transition to a purely minimally invasive procedure, enabling more patients to reap the benefits of less invasive surgery. Transitioning from ECA to ICA during robotic right colectomy resulted in no significant change in OT or LOS. A lower rate of conversion to open surgery was noted with increased experience.","output":"A single surgeon's experience transitioning to robotic-assisted right colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) re-infection where the time interval between two COVID-positive episodes is the longest in the literature.

This study aimed to investigate whether the shape memory bolus can be applied to radiotherapy as a bolus that conformally adheres to the body surface, can be created in a short time, and can be reused. METHODS: The shape memory bolus was developed by cross\\\\linking tetrabranch PCL with reactive acrylate end groups. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to evaluate shape memory characterization before deformation and after restoration. In addition, the degree of adhesion to the body surface and crystallization time were calculated. Moreover, dosimetric characterization was evaluated using the water equivalent phantom and an Alderson RANDO phantom. RESULTS: The DSC value between before deformation and after restoration was close to 1. The degree of adhesion of the shape memory bolus (1.9%) was improved compared with the conventional bolus (45.6%) and was equivalent to three\\\\dimensional (3D) printer boluses (1.3%C3.5%). The crystallization time was approximately 1.5 min, which was clinically acceptable. The dose calculation accuracy, dose distribution, and dose index were the equivalent compared with 3D boluses. CONCLUSION: The shape memory bolus has excellent adhesion to the body surface, can be created in a short time, and can be reused.

It takes two forms: one is local, namely diffusion in space, and other is related to travel. With the advancement of transportation system, it is possible for diseases to move from one place to an entirely separate place very quickly. In a developing country like India, the mass movement of large numbers of individuals creates the possibility of spread of common infectious diseases. This has led to the study of infectious disease model to describe the infection during transport. An SIRS-type epidemic model is formulated to illustrate the dynamics of such infectious disease propagation between two cities due to population dispersal. The most important threshold parameter, namely the basic reproduction number, is derived, and the possibility of existence of backward bifurcation is examined, as the existence of backward bifurcation is very unsettling for disease control and it is vital to know from modeling analysis when it can occur. It is shown that dispersal of populations would make the disease control difficult in comparison with nondispersal case. Optimal vaccination and treatment controls are determined. Further to find the best cost-effective strategy, cost-effectiveness analysis is also performed.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","output":"Impact of Home Quarantine on Physical Activity Among Older Adults Living at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Interview Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery paradigm of drugs is rapidly growing due to advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).

Using a mouse model of hepatitis C, we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) that encodes an HCV protein. We generated immunocompetent mice that each expressed multiple HCV proteins via a Cre/loxP switching system and established several distinct attenuated rVV strains. The HCV core protein was expressed consistently in the liver after polyinosinic acidCpolycytidylic acid injection, and these mice showed chronic hepatitis C-related pathological findings (hepatocyte abnormalities, accumulation of glycogen, steatosis), liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunization with one rVV strain (rVV-N25), which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins, suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels and alleviated the symptoms of pathological chronic hepatitis C within 7 days after injection. Furthermore, HCV protein levels in liver tissue also decreased in a CD4 and CD8 T-cell-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, we showed that rVV-N25 immunization induced a robust CD8 T-cell immune response that was specific to the HCV nonstructural protein 2. We also demonstrated that the onset of chronic hepatitis in CN2-29((+/?))/MxCre((+/?)) mice was mainly attributable to inflammatory cytokines, (tumor necrosis factor) TNF- and (interleukin) IL-6. Thus, our generated mice model should be useful for further investigation of the immunological processes associated with persistent expression of HCV proteins because these mice had not developed immune tolerance to the HCV antigen.

Despite emerging reports and literature covering a broad spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations, facets of COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated. To the authors concern, sinus bradycardia as a manifestation of COVID-19-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) has never been reported before. CASE PRESENTATION: In this paper, we report a case of a 59-year-old male patient with confirmed COVID-19 initially presented with presyncope. Further investigations reveal sinus bradycardia related to COVID-19-induced SIADH. This case highlights the possibility of immuno-neuroendocrino-cardiovascular crosstalk resulting in an atypical manifestation of COVID-19: near syncope due to sinus bradycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Another possible cause of sinus bradycardia in COVID-19 is electrolyte imbalance due to COVID-19-related SIADH.","output":"Symptomatic sinus bradycardia due to electrolyte imbalances in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) related covid-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral diseases exhibit spatial and temporal variation, and there are many factors that can affect their occurrence. The identification of these factors is critical in the efforts to predict and lessen viral disease burden. Because viral infection is able to spread to humans from the environment, animals, and other humans, the One-Health framework can be used to investigate the critical pathways through which viruses are transported and transmitted. A holistic approach, incorporating publicly available clinical data for human, livestock, and wildlife disease occurrence, together with environmental data reported in federal and state databases such as parameters related to land use, environmental quality, and weather, can enhance the understanding of variations in disease patterns, leading to the design and implementation of surveillance systems. An example analysis approach is presented for Michigan, United States, which is a state with large urban centers as well as a sizeable rural and agricultural population. Analysis of publicly available data from 2017 indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) and influenza-associated illnesses in Michigan may have been related with agricultural land use to a higher extent than with developed land use during that year. Meanwhile, hepatitis A virus appears to be most closely related with developed land use in dense population areas. GI illnesses may be related to precipitation, and this relationship is strongest in the springtime, although GI illnesses are most common in the winter months. Integration of human-related clinical data, animal disease data, and environmental data can ultimately be used for prioritization of the most critical locations and times for viral outbreaks in both urban and rural environments.","output":"Understanding temporal and spatial variations of viral disease in the US: The need for a one-health-based data collection and analysis approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive literature describes the importance of food environments (FEs) as a driver of food choices and nutrition outcomes; yet existing FE frameworks do not adequately capture the diversity of FEs relevant to the Pacific Region.

We then apply this typology to food acquisition data from Solomon Islands 2012/13 Household Income and Expenditure Survey and analyse the relationship between FEs and diet quality. The cultivated FE accounts for 60% of the quantity of food acquired nationally, followed by wild (15%), kin and community (9%), and formal and informal retail FEs (8% each), with wide variation between urban and rural households, provinces and wealth groups. Reliance on different FEs is a significant predictor of diet quality and affirms the importance of subsistence fisheries and agriculture, and community and kinship networks.

Rapid antigen tests have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in symptomatic persons (2), but data are lacking on test performance in asymptomatic persons to inform expanded screening testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons (3). To evaluate the performance of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, it was used along with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to analyze 3,419 paired specimens collected from persons aged 10 years at two community testing sites in Pima County, Arizona, during November 3-17, 2020. Viral culture was performed on 274 of 303 residual real-time RT-PCR specimens with positive results by either test (29 were not available for culture). Compared with real-time RT-PCR testing, the BinaxNOW antigen test had a sensitivity of 64.2% for specimens from symptomatic persons and 35.8% for specimens from asymptomatic persons, with near 100% specificity in specimens from both groups. Virus was cultured from 96 of 274 (35.0%) specimens, including 85 (57.8%) of 147 with concordant antigen and real-time RT-PCR positive results, 11 (8.9%) of 124 with false-negative antigen test results, and none of three with false-positive antigen test results. Among specimens positive for viral culture, sensitivity was 92.6% for symptomatic and 78.6% for asymptomatic individuals. When the pretest probability for receiving positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 is elevated (e.g., in symptomatic persons or in persons with a known COVID-19 exposure), a negative antigen test result should be confirmed by NAAT (1). Despite a lower sensitivity to detect infection, rapid antigen tests can be an important tool for screening because of their quick turnaround time, lower costs and resource needs, high specificity, and high positive predictive value (PPV) in settings of high pretest probability. The faster turnaround time of the antigen test can help limit transmission by more rapidly identifying infectious persons for isolation, particularly when used as a component of serial testing strategies.","output":"Evaluation of Abbott BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen Test for SARS-CoV-2 Infection at Two Community-Based Testing Sites  Pima County, Arizona, November 3C17, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased public awareness of the welfare and well-being of laboratory animals in biomedical research and related ethical considerations inspired us to review recent developments and recommendations for the care and housing of laboratory cats.

METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted among 18 to 49-year-old Chinese parents who had at least one child in June 2021. We calculated the prevalence of self-reported childrearing barriers and used univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression to analyze associated factors. RESULTS: 94.7% of the respondents self-reported barriers to rearing children aged 0C3 years, and the biggest barrier included high time cost (39.3%), high parenting cost (36.5%) and high education cost (13.5%). Women (aOR 1.49, 95%CI 1.13,1.96) and people with college degree or above (aOR 3.46, 95%CI 2.08, 5.75) were associated with higher prevalence of childrearing barriers, and people who intended to have a second child (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.40, 0.83) and people who intended to have a third child (aOR 0.51,95%CI 0.37, 0.71) were less likely to report childrearing barriers. The biggest barrier was more likely to be high time cost for parents one of whom is only child (aOR1.21, 95%CI 1.03, 1.42) and physical factors for parents both of whom are only child (aOR 1.56,95%CI 1.08, 2.26). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of barriers to rearing children aged 0C3 years was high among Chinese people of childbearing age who had children. Full consideration should be given to the barriers of people with different sociodemographic characteristics and people with fertility intention, thus making targeted childrearing policies and supporting measures to reduce the burden on people of childbearing age, encourage suitable couples to have a second or third child and then cope with Chinas aging population.

It is known that HCWs who serve as front-liners during the COVID-19 pandemic experience stress and have the fear of contracting the infection. Little is known of how being a positive contact affects HCWs. OBJECTIVE: We examined the experience of HCWs who were quarantined following a close unprotected contact with a COVID-19 positive colleague and explore the psychological impact especially as the timing of the quarantine coincided with the Eid (annual Muslim festival) celebration in Malaysia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional on-line questionnaire study, involving HCWs exposed to a COVID-19 positive colleague in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, a teaching hospital. Data on demographics, levels of depression, anxiety and stress using a validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire, aspects of quarantine, wearing of masks, hand hygiene practice and swab experience were collected. RESULTS: Twenty-two HCWs participated. Eighteen (81.8%) were between 30-39 years and 17 (77.3%) were women. Majority 19 (86.3%) were Malays. There were twelve (54.5%) medical officers, 5 (22.7%) specialists and 5(22.7%) allied health staff. Eighteen out of 22 (81.8%) felt they were able to do home quarantine adequately. All tested negative with a mean (Standard Deviation) hour of contact of 2.562.38 hours. Eighteen reported their biggest concern was infecting their families. CONCLUSION: HCWs undergoing contact swabbing and quarantine are vulnerable to depression, anxiety and stress. The ability of the HCW to adequately home quarantine should not be taken for granted. Psychological support should be offered to HCWs who are positive contacts.","output":"A descriptive study of the psychological experience of health care workers in close contact with a person with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely use medical image modality in clinical medicine, because it produces excellent visualizations of fine structural details of the human body. In clinical procedures, it is desirable to acquire CT scans by minimizing the X-ray flux to prevent patients from being exposed to high radiation. However, these Low-Dose CT (LDCT) scanning protocols compromise the signal-to-noise ratio of the CT images because of noise and artifacts over the image space. Thus, various restoration methods have been published over the past 3 decades to produce high-quality CT images from these LDCT images. More recently, as opposed to conventional LDCT restoration methods, Deep Learning (DL)-based LDCT restoration approaches have been rather common due to their characteristics of being data-driven, high-performance, and fast execution. Thus, this study aims to elaborate on the role of DL techniques in LDCT restoration and critically review the applications of DL-based approaches for LDCT restoration. To achieve this aim, different aspects of DL-based LDCT restoration applications were analyzed. These include DL architectures, performance gains, functional requirements, and the diversity of objective functions. The outcome of the study highlights the existing limitations and future directions for DL-based LDCT restoration.

In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA.

Whether maternal infection causes changes in the transfer of immunity to infants remains unclear. Maternal infections have previously been associated with compromised placental antibody transfer, but the mechanism underlying this compromised transfer is not established. Here, we used systems serology to characterize the Fc profile of influenza-, pertussis-, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transferred across the placenta. Influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies were actively transferred. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer was significantly reduced compared to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and cord titers and functional activity were lower than in maternal plasma. This effect was only observed in third-trimester infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to altered SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profiles and was partially rescued by infection-induced increases in IgG and increased FCGR3A placental expression.

This study investigated potential racial disparities in visits during the pandemic for patients with documented active treatment for hematologic malignancies. Methods: We used the nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record (EHR)-derived de-identified database to select patients with confirmed diagnosis of AML, DLBCL, FL, MCL, CLL or MM, at least 18 years old at initial diagnosis, and documented race in the EHR as Black/African American or White were included. Patients were categorized into treatment types within lines of therapy: Orals (orals + outpatient infusions with orals) vs. Inpatient treatments (chemotherapy, hematopoietic transplants & CAR-T cell therapy). Monthly visit rates were calculated as the number of visits (telemedicine or in-person [in-clinic treatment administration, vitals, and/or labs]) per active patient per 30-day standardized month, except for months in which the patient was considered not active (e.g. no documented therapy, surveillance). We used time-series forecasting methods on pre-pandemic monthly visit rate data (March 2016 - February 2020) to estimate projected counterfactual monthly visit rates (expected rates if the pandemic did not occur) between March 2020 - February 2021 for all diseases combined, for each disease, each treatment type, and each race. Differences between projected and actual monthly visit rates during the pandemic period were considered significant and related due to the pandemic if the actual visit rate was outside of the 95% prediction interval (PI) surrounding the projected estimate. We used cross-correlation analysis to test for significant differences in visit rates between Black and White patients. Results: The analysis included 17,621 patients (2,225 Black, 15,396 White): 3,041 AML, 2,715 DLBCL, 1,558 FL, 1,511 MCL, 3,813 CLL and 5,244 MM (1,166 Black, 4078 White). Across all diseases and treatment categories, Black patients had no significant reductions in in-person visit rates throughout the pandemic period compared to the projected rates. There was, however, an 18% statistically significant reduction (95% PI 9.9% - 25%) in in-person visit rates for White patients on orals during early pandemic months (March - May 2020) from a projected visit rate of 2.0 (95% PI 1.8 - 2.2) visits per patient per month to an actual visit rate of 1.61. There was no significant reduction in in-person visit rates for White patients on inpatient treatments. Telemedicine uptake was significantly higher for White patients compared with Black patients for all diseases combined across all treatment categories (Figure A & B) (t = 9.5, p < 0.01), AML inpatient treatments (t = 2.4, p = 0.04), MM orals (Figure C) (t = 6.0, p < 0.01) and MM inpatient treatments (Figure D) (t = 2.3, p = 0.04). Conclusions: A tradeoff in reductions in in-person visits and uptake of telemedicine use was observed overall. White patients had significantly higher telemedicine uptake compared with Black patients for both oral and inpatient treatments. In-person visit rates for Black patients were unchanged regardless of treatment category. These in-person visit rates reflect documented telemedicine use disparities, which requires further study into possible compound causes, including economic and societal factors. Figure.

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMS) delayed operations to protect themselves, patients, and staff. This manuscript presents (1) institution's experience in management of pediatric craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma during COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) suggests recommendations to decrease transmission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of children 18 years or younger who had an operation at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) in Atlanta, GA from March to August 2020. Patients were: (1) 18 years old or younger, (2) had one or more maxillofacial fractures, and (3) had an operation by OMS, Otolaryngology, or Plastic Surgery. Medical records were reviewed regarding: (1) fracture location (2) COVID status, (3) timing, (4) personal protection equipment (PPE), and (5) infection status. Descriptive statistics were computed. RESULTS: 58 children met inclusion criteria. Most commonly injured maxillofacial location was nose. Operations occurred 50.9 hours after admission. Specific prevention perioperative guidelines were used with all patients with no transmission from a patient to a healthcare worker. CONCLUSIONS: With our recommendations, there was no transmission to health care workers. We hope that these guidelines will assist OMS during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC FACIAL FRACTURES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with excessive inflammatory response, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without timely treatment. A fewer effective drugs are available currently to treat the ALI/ARDS. Herein, a therapeutic nanoplatform with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsiveness was developed for the regulation of inflammation. Dexamethasone acetate (Dex) was encapsulated into poly(thioketal) polymers to form polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) (PTKNPs@Dex). The NPs were composed of poly(1,4-phenyleneacetonedimethylene thioketal) (PPADT) and polythioketal urethane (PTKU), in which the thioketal bonds could be cleaved by the high level of ROS at the ALI site. The PTKNPs@Dex could accumulate in the pulmonary inflammatory sites and release the encapsulated payloads rapidly, leading to the decreased ROS level, less generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced lung injury and mortality of mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs was associated with the modulation of many immune and inflammation-linked pathways. These findings provide a newly developed nanoplatform for the efficient treatment of ALI/ARDS. Graphical A therapeutic nanoplatform composed of low Mw of poly(1,4-phenyleneacetonedimethylene thioketal) and high Mw of polythioketal urethane was developed with the feature of ROS scavenging and anti-inflammation.

Except for TTYH2, these molecules primarily interacted with spike via regions outside of the receptor-binding domain. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of pulmonary cells from COVID-19 patients indicated predominant expression of these molecules on myeloid cells. Although these receptors do not support active replication of SARS-CoV-2, their engagement with virus induced robust proinflammatory responses in myeloid cells that correlated with COVID-19 severity. We also generated a bispecific anti-spike nanobody that not only blocked ACE2-mediated infection but also the myeloid receptors-mediated proinflammatory responses. Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2-myeloid receptor interactions promote immune hyper-activation, which represents potential targets for COVID-19 therapy.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 exacerbates proinflammatory responses in myeloid cells through C-type lectin receptors and Tweety family member 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fentanyl is now the primary driver of the current opioid crisis. Fentanyl and its analogues are subject to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, the Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (Federal Analogue Act), state laws, international treaties, and the laws of foreign countries. The appearance of novel psychoactive substances led to further legislative developments in scheduling. New fentanyl analogues proliferated in a manner previously unseen since about 2016. Overdose deaths of these fentanyl analogues prompted the Drug Enforcement Administration to reactively emergency schedule each new fentanyl analogue as it appeared. The international community also acted. Finally, on February 6, 2018, a proactive temporary (emergency) class\\\\wide scheduling of fentanyl\\\\related substances was implemented based upon the fentanyl core structure to save lives. This action spurred a similar action in China. Fentanyl analogues fell dramatically in the marketplace, despite further increases in fentanyl itself. Congress temporarily extended this scheduling, but it will soon expire.

METHODS The medical records of patients who received LS TAPP inguinal hernia repair between 2009 and 2012 at our institution were reviewed. Patients were included if the received LS TAPP with either no mesh fixation, mesh fixation with NBCA only, fixation with ST only, or fixation with NBCA + ST. Outcome measures were operation time, postoperative length of stay, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score 24 h after surgery, postoperative complications, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS A total of 1,027 TAPP cases were included. In 552 cases, meshes were fixed with NBCA only, in 89 cases only ST were used, in 47 cases ST and NBCA were used, and in 339 cases meshes were not fixed. The groups were comparable with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics. No surgical complications occurred in any group. VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the nonfixation and NBCA only groups (1.4  0.6 and 1.3  0.6, respectively) than in the ST and NBCA + ST groups (2.2  0.9 and 2.2  0.7, respectively; P = 0.001). The mean follow-up duration was ~19 months. At the final follow-up, no wound infections or hernia recurrences had occurred in any of the groups. No occurrence of chronic pain was noted in the nonfixation and NBCA only groups, whereas two cases (2.2%) were noted in the ST group and one case (2.1%) in the NBCA + ST group (P = 0.005).

Data were obtained from the electronic health records, a multi-specialty healthcare system serving a racially/ethnically diverse patient population in northern California. The study cohort included patients who had at least one oncology visit from January 2019 to August 2020. We examined the trends in the volume of oncology office visits and adoption of video visits during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic period. Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression were performed to examine variability in use of video visits by specific patient characteristics (sex, age, race/ethnicity and language barrier). Of 63,903 cancer patients (median age: 66;68% female), Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and others composed of 64.8%, 3.5%, 9.2%, 11.7% and 10.8% of our study cohort. Over the 20 month study period, the drop in in-person visits began in March and peaked in April 2020. Compared to the year 2019, the office visits decreased by -16.6%, -55.9%, and -50.9% in March, April, and May of 2020. Although there was a trend towards increased office visits in June (-21.9% compared to 2019), this again decreased to -35% in July 2020. The proportion of visits conducted by video began at 16.6% in the first week after California's shelter-in-place order in March, peaked at a high rate of 43.4% in April, and remained at a rate of 33.8% in August. We focused on variability by specific patient subgroups when telemedicine was offered and used prevalently during early pandemic in April. Based on age, the younger cohorts, 18-50 and 51-64 year olds, were more likely to utilize video visit at 50.6%, and 50.6% compared to only 38.0% and 36.7% of the older groups (65-75 and 76+ years old, p<0.001). In fact, the largest discrepancy, 21% difference between the younger vs older groups, was observed towards the end of April. With respect to race, Asians had the highest use of video visits (51.4%) compared to Hispanic (34.5%) and Black patients (40.3%) in April (p<0.001). Although the gap narrowed over the next 4 months with only a 4% difference by August, these cancelled visits were not recovered in the minority groups. Finally, 44.6% of those who did not require an interpreter utilized video visits as compared to only 19.8% who did require an interpreter (p<0.001). Age and race/ethnicity remain strong predictors of video visit use after adjusting the main and interaction effects of patient characteristics, with Asians 51-64 year old having the highest rate (58%) and Hispanics 76+ year old the lowest rate (30%). Overall office visits have decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older patients, Black patients, Hispanic patients, and patients who required interpreting services were less likely to be treated through video visits. Future studies are needed to better understand the barriers to telemedicine care.

Therefore, the main aim of this paper was to determine the effects of priming an analytical or intuitive thinking style on the credulity of participants. In two experiments (N = 965), analytic thinking was induced and the source of fake profile (astrological reading vs. psychological testing) was manipulated and participants prior paranormal beliefs, anomalous explanation, cognitive reflection, and depression were measured. Although analytic thinking was proved to be hard to induce experimentally, the results showed that analytic thinking predicts credulity and belief in the paranormal was linked with experiencing more anomalous experiences and more paranormal explanations. The more people were able to think analytically, the less credulous they were as reflected in the lower acceptance of fake profile as accurate.","output":"The Effect of Analytic Cognitive Style on Credulity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for lung perfusion imaging is attracting considerable interest in intensive care, as it might open up entirely new ways to adjust ventilation therapy. A promising technique is bolus injection of a conductive indicator to the central venous catheter, which yields the indicator-based signal (IBS). Lung perfusion images are then typically obtained from the IBS using the maximum slope technique. However, the low spatial resolution of EIT results in a partial volume effect (PVE), which requires further processing to avoid regional bias. APPROACH In this work, we repose the extraction of lung perfusion images from the IBS as a source separation problem to account for the PVE. We then propose a model-based algorithm, called gamma decomposition (GD), to derive an efficient solution. The GD algorithm uses a signal model to transform the IBS into a parameter space where the source signals of heart and lung are separable by clustering in space and time. Subsequently, it reconstructs lung model signals from which lung perfusion images are unambiguously extracted. MAIN RESULTS We evaluate the GD algorithm on EIT data of a prospective animal trial with eight pigs. The results show that it enables lung perfusion imaging using EIT at different stages of regional impairment. Furthermore, parameters of the source signals seem to represent physiological properties of the cardio-pulmonary system. SIGNIFICANCE This work represents an important advance in IBS processing that will likely reduce bias of EIT perfusion images and thus eventually enable imaging of regional ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio.","output":"A model-based source separation algorithm for lung perfusion imaging using electrical impedance tomography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Amidst the uncertainty of the current days, as we slowly recover from COVID-19?s first wave and apprehending its second, medical trainees from all different backgrounds should reflect back on how this pandemic has affected our medical training Many of which were halted as elective procedures and clinics were postponed indefinitely as a measure to contain the virus and focus all medical resources on battling the pandemic 1 However, albeit the negative consequences on our medical education, the COVID-19 emergency department will undeniably make us all better physicians","output":"How the COVID-19 Emergency Department Will Make Us Better Future Physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the impact that a series of Archives Unleashed datathon events have had on community engagement both within the web archiving field, and more specifically, on the professional practices of attendees.

For LAGB, the median age was 48 years (range, 18-78), the body mass index was 44 (range, 33-87), 465 participants (76%) were women, and 63 participants (10%) were nonwhite. Follow-up weights were obtained in 1300 of 1569 (83%) eligible for a year-7 visit. Seven years following RYGB, mean weight loss was 38.2 kg (95% CI, 36.9-39.5), or 28.4% (95% CI, 27.6-29.2) of baseline weight; between years 3 and 7 mean weight regain was 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4-4.4) of baseline weight. Seven years after LAGB, mean weight loss was 18.8 kg (95% CI, 16.3-21.3) or 14.9% (95% CI, 13.1-16.7), with 1.4% (95% CI, 0.4-2.4) regain. Six distinct weight change trajectory patterns for RYGB and 7 for LAGB were identified. Most participants followed trajectories in which weight regain from 3 to 7 years was small relative to year-3 weight loss, but patterns were variable. Compared with baseline, dyslipidemia prevalence was lower 7 years following both procedures; diabetes and hypertension prevalence were lower following RYGB only. Among those with diabetes at baseline (488 of 1723 with RYGB [28%]; 175 of 604 with LAGB [29%]), the proportion in remission at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 71.2% (95% CI, 67.0-75.4), 69.4% (95% CI, 65.0-73.8), 64.6% (95% CI, 60.0-69.2), and 60.2% (95% CI, 54.7-65.6), respectively, for RYGB and 30.7% (95% CI, 22.8-38.7), 29.3% (95% CI, 21.6-37.1), 29.2% (95% CI, 21.0-37.4), and 20.3% (95% CI, 9.7-30.9) for LAGB. The incidence of diabetes at all follow-up assessments was less than 1.5% for RYGB. Bariatric reoperations occurred in 14 RYGB and 160 LAGB participants. Conclusions and Relevance Following bariatric surgery, different weight loss patterns were observed, but most participants maintained much of their weight loss with variable fluctuations over the long term. There was some decline in diabetes remission over time, but the incidence of new cases is low following RYGB.

RECENT FINDINGS Newly recognized racial disparities exist with respect to triaging trauma patients and in acute pain management. Social Determinants of Health offers a model to understand disparity in trauma care. SUMMARY Race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare drive outcome disparity among trauma patients. These disparities include reduced healthcare services, inadequate pain management, reduced postdischarge care, and increased mortality. Increasing workforce diversity may mitigate implicit bias and improve cultural competency.

In the case of COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country such as Bangladesh, however, the fact is that some physicians decline either to report for duty or to treat patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms. At issue ethically is whether such medical practitioners are to be automatically disciplined for dereliction of duty and gross negligence; or, on the contrary, such physicians may legitimately claim a professional right of autonomous judgment, on the basis of which professional right they may justifiably decline to treat patients. METHODS: This ethical issue is examined with a view to providing some guidance and recommendations, insofar as the conditions of medical practice in an under-resourced country such as Bangladesh are vastly different from medical practice in an industrialized nation such as the USA. The concept of moral dilemma as discussed by philosopher Michael Shaw Perry and philosopher Immanuel Kant's views on moral appeal to \\"emergency\\" are considered pertinent to sorting through the moral conundrum of medical care during pandemic. RESULTS: Our analysis allows for conditional physician discretion in the decision to treat COVID-19 patients, i.e., in the absence of personal protective equipment (PPE) combined with claim of duty to family. Physicians are nonetheless expected to provide a minimum of initial clinical assessment and stabilization of a patient before initiating transfer of a patient to a \\"designated\\" COVID-19 hospital. The latter is to be done in coordination with the national center control room that can assure admission of a patient to a referral hospital prior to ambulance transport. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a moral dilemma (i.e., conflict of obligations) in the pandemic situation of clinical care requires institutional authorities to exercise tolerance of individual physician moral decision about the duty to care. Hospital or government authority should respond to such decisions without introducing immediate sanction, such as suspension from all clinical duties or termination of licensure, and instead arrange for alternative clinical duties consistent with routine medical care.","output":"A Duty to treat?

The proximity of patients inside nursing homes allows investigate the dynamics of viral transmission, which may help understand SARS-Cov2 biology and spread. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes obtained from 46 patients infected in an outbreak inside a nursing home in Calabria region (South Italy) were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing. We also investigated the evolution of viral genomes in 8 patients for which multiple swabs were available. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype reconstruction were carried out with IQ-TREE software and RegressHaplo tool, respectively. RESULTS: All viral strains isolated from patients infected in the nursing home were classified as B.1 lineage, clade G. Overall, 14 major single nucleotide variations (SNVs) (frequency > 80%) and 12 minor SNVs (frequency comprised between 20% and 80%) were identified with reference to the Wuhan-H-1 sequence (NC_045512.2). All patients presented the same 6 major SNVs: D614G in the S gene; P4715L, ntC3037T (F924F) and S5398P in Orf1ab gene; ntC26681T (F53F) in the M gene; and ntC241T in the non-coding UTR region. However, haplotype reconstruction identified a founder haplotype (Hap A) in 36 patients carrying only the 6 common SNVs indicated above, and 10 other haplotypes (Hap BK) derived from Hap A in the remaining 10 patients. Notably, no significant association between a specific viral haplotype and clinical parameters was found. CONCLUSION: The predominant viral strain responsible for the infection in a nursing home in Calabria was the B.1 lineage (clade G).

This meta-analysis reports on the efficacy of psychological interventions on these symptom domains in addition to post-traumatic stress. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of electronic databases was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions for young people following interpersonal trauma exposure. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were analysed using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Of the 4832 records screened, 78 studies were reviewed, and 10 RCTs, involving 679 participants (mean age 15.6 years), were analysed. There was a large pooled effect size for post-traumatic stress (7 studies, g = 1.43, 95% CI [0.37, 2.15], p = .002) and substance use (2 studies, g = 0.70, 95% CI [-0.11, 1.22], p < .001) and small effect sizes for anxiety (4 studies, g = 0.30, 95% CI [0.10, 0.49], p = .003), and trend-level effect for depression (10 studies, g = 0.27, 95% CI [0.00, 0.54], p = .052). Heterogeneity was significant for post-traumatic stress and moderate for depression. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality RCTs of psychological interventions for anxiety, depression, substance use, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in young people exposed to interpersonal trauma are scarce. While available studies show either statistically significant or trend-level efficacy for psychological interventions in reducing these symptoms, wide confidence intervals, heterogeneity and small sample size mean that results need to be interpreted with caution.","output":"Relative efficacy of psychological interventions following interpersonal trauma on anxiety, depression, substance use, and PTSD symptoms in young people: A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the current pandemic disease without any vaccine or efficient treatment to rescue the patients. Underlying diseases predispose the patients to a more severe disease and to a higher mortality rate. However, little evidence exists about COVID-19 outcomes in the pediatric population with congenital heart disease (CHD). Here, we report nine children with COVID-19 and concomitant CHD. METHODS: Our study included nine children with COVID-19 and concomitant CHD who were admitted to Children Medical Center Hospital during March and April 2020. The patients were classified based on the final outcome (death), and their clinical sign and symptoms, type of CHD, and drugs administered were compared. RESULTS: Among the nine patients, two died and we compared different characteristics, laboratory results and clinical findings of these cases based on the mortality. The deceased patients had severe types of CHD, worse arterial blood gases, severe clinical symptoms, higher mean level of partial thromboplastin time and C-reactive protein, and required more medications. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the general consideration of mild COVID-19 in children does not include patients with CHD and that it is necessary to pay greater attention to children with CHD to determine guidelines for treatment of COVID-19 in these children. Owing to the scarcity of CHD and COVID-19, we reported only nine cases.

Intraoperative bleeding as the main complication is also the primary cause of conversion from laparoscopic to open splenectomy. Intraoperative blood salvage can reduce transfusion requirements, decrease the conversion rate to open, and promote fast-tracking in laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). From November 2007 through December 2016 we collected medical data of 115 LS patients. There were three groups: 54 patients receiving routine care (we marks them as Group RT), 33 patients with fast-track care (Group FT), and 28 receiving fast-track care receiving intraoperative splenic blood salvage and autotransfusion (Group FT + ISBS). These medical data are comprised of included three phases (pre-, intra-, and postoperative). There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between RT, FT, and FT + ISBS groups. The hemoglobin level in Group FT + ISBS was significantly higher than in Group RT and Group FT. Comparing the duration of hospital stay of 3 groups, Group RT stayed for a significantly longer time than Group FT and Group FT + ISBS, Group FT + ISBSmuch shorter than Group FT. Comparing the hospitalization expense, GroupFT + ISBS significantly expended less than Group RT and Group FT.

METHODS: Among 361 Japanese patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Kanagawa Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center between February 2020 and December 2020, 356 patients with data on serum KL-6 levels were enrolled and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between KL-6 levels and the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen on admission. The KL-6 levels on admission and the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in patients with severe disease (n = 60) than in those with nonsevere disease (n = 296). Furthermore, the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in nonsurvivors (n = 6) than in survivors (n = 350). In nonsurvivors, the KL-6 levels increased as the disease progressed. The optimal cutoff value of the maximal KL-6 level for discriminating between survivors and nonsurvivors was 684 U/mL, with a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 90.5%, and an area under the curve of 0.89.

Harm reduction centres are often linked to social services, mental health services, and infectious disease testing, in addition to tools and services that help to reduce the harms associated with injecting drugs. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on these services in four autonomous communities in Spain. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that employed a seven-section structured survey administered electronically to 20 centres in July 2020. Data from the most heavily affected months (March-June) in 2020 were compared to data from the same period in 2019. Averages were calculated with their ranges, rates, and absolute numbers. RESULTS: All 11 responding centres reported having had to adapt or modify their services during the Spanish state of alarm (14 March-21 June 2020). One centre reported complete closure for 2 months and four reported increases in their operating hours. The average number of service users across all centres decreased by 22% in comparison to the same period in the previous year and the average needle distribution decreased by 40% in comparison to 2019. Most centres reported a decrease in infectious disease testing rates (hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis) for March, April, and May in 2020 compared to the previous year. Reported deaths as a result of overdose did not increase during the state of alarm, but 2/11 (18%) centres reported an increase in overdose deaths immediately after finalisation of the state of alarm. CONCLUSION: Overall, Spanish harm reduction centres were able to continue operating and offering services by adjusting operating hours. The number of overall service users and needles distributed fell during the Spanish state of alarm lockdown period, suggesting that fewer clients accessed harm reduction services during this time, putting them at greater risk of reusing or sharing injecting equipment, overdosing, acquiring infectious diseases with decreased access to testing or discontinuing ongoing treatment such as methadone maintenance therapy, hepatitis C treatment, or antiretroviral therapy.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on harm reduction services in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Brazil, mathematical models for derivingestimates and projections of COVID-19 cases have been developed without data on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We estimated the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Methods: Data were collected on 2,857 blood donors from April 14 to 27, 2020. We report the crude prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the weighted prevalence by the total state population, and adjusted prevalence estimates for test sensitivity and specificity. To establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, we used logistic regression models. The analysis included period and site of blood collection, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence. Results: The proportion of SARS-Cov-2 positive tests without any adjustment was 4.0% (95% CI 3.3-4.7%), and the weighted prevalence was 3.8% (95% CI 3.1-4.5%). Further adjustment by test sensitivity and specificity produced lower estimates, 3.6% (95% CI 2.7-4.4%) and 3.3% (95% CI 2.6-4.1%), respectively. The variable most significantly associated with the crude prevalence was the period of blood collection: the later the period, the higher the prevalence. Regarding socio-demographic characteristics, the younger the blood donors, the higher the prevalence, and the lower the educational level, the higher the odds of a positive SARS-Cov-2 antibody. Similar results were found for the weighted prevalence. Discussion: Although our findings resulted from a convenience sample, they match some basic premises: the increasing trend over time, since the epidemic curve in the state is still on the rise;the higher prevalence among the youngest who are more likely to circulate;and the higher prevalence among the less educated as they have more difficulties in following the social distancing recommendations.

The results show that heterogeneous beliefs and short sale restrictions have negative impacts on conditional skewness during periods of market decline but have negative, positive or no impacts during periods of market growth. This evidence reconciles conflicting evidence in recent empirical studies on the relationship among heterogeneous beliefs, short sale restrictions and conditional skewness.","output":"Modelling conditional skewness: Heterogeneous beliefs, short sale restrictions and market declines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose/Objective(s) Patients undergoing radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic have experienced unique changes to care, including increased use of telehealth for radiotherapy on-treatment visits (OTVs). The objective of this study was to determine telehealth utilization and provider perceptions towards effectively assessing, managing and treating patients via telehealth OTVs during the pandemic. Materials/Methods As part of this IRB-approved single institution study, a survey was developed to capture the percentage of OTVs that were conducted via telehealth and provider perceptions on management effectiveness. Participants included attending and resident physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs). Likert scale questions assessed the provider perceptions in the following areas: ability to fully evaluate patient, manage symptoms, minimize acute care, and prevent COVID19 exposure. The survey was sent at 3 timepoints: April 15th, May 22nd, and December 18, 2020 (1, 2, and 7 months since declaration of COVID-19 as a national emergency). Respondents were not linked across the 3 surveys. Response frequencies and percentages are presented for each survey and global trends in responses are described. Results Surveys were sent to 34 radiation oncology providers. 22 (65%), 20 (59%), and 21 (62%) participants responded to the April, May, and December survey, respectively. 13, 12, 13 attending physicians; 8, 6, and 3 resident physicians; and 2, 2, and 5 APPs responded to the 3 surveys, respectively. In the April survey 59% of respondents indicated that 75-100% of patients were evaluated weekly by telehealth. This percentage dropped to 8% in May and 0% in December. Most respondents reported agreement with the ability to fully evaluate patients (70% vs 55%; 55%), manage symptoms (80% vs 59%; 60%) and minimize acute care (70% vs 64%; 60%) with in-person OTVs (% December vs April; May). Agreement of an appropriate balance of patient care and COVID-19 risk prevention dropped from 86% in April to 75% in May and 68% in December. Respondents reported a preference for patient-specific management strategies (telehealth vs in-person visits) at all time points (95% in April and May; 90% in December). Conclusion Based on our results, telehealth was widely used during the beginning of the pandemic, but shifted to essentially zero by December 2020. The increase of in person visits by December appears to correlate with agreement to fully evaluate a patient, manage symptoms, and minimize acute care. However, as in person OTVs increased, there was more concern for COVID-19 prevention by providers. By implementing systems into our electronic medical record that can accurately predict patients that may imminently require acute intervention, we may strike a balance of providing the best care for our cancer patients and minimize exposure risk.","output":"Survey of Healthcare Providers Utilization and Perception of Telehealth On-Treatment Visits During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel mesoporous Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 heterostructures were prepared for the first time by utilizing the sol-gel route in the presence of a nonionic surfactant. TEM and XRD measurements showed that Li2MnO3 (5-10a?nm) with monoclinic structures was uniformly distributed onto porous g-C3N4 for the construction of Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 heterojunctions. The obtained photocatalysts were assessed for mineralization and removal of trichloroethylene (TCE) in aqueous media under visible light exposure. Complete degradation of TCE over a 3a?%Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 heterostructure within 120a?min was achieved. The degradation rate over Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 heterostructures was significantly enhanced, and the 3% Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 heterostructure exhibited a large degradation rate of 7.04 molL-1 min-1, which was enhanced by 5 and 3.8 fold compared to those of pristine g-C3N4 (1.39 molL-1 min-1) and Li2MnO3 (1.85 molL-1 min-1), respectively. The photocatalytic efficiency of the Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction was outstandingly promoted because integrating Li2MnO3 with g-C3N4 could create close interfaces with well-matched band potentials for easy mobility and low recombination of photoinduced carriers. The coexistence of Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 interfaces led to a synergic effect, which is considered the key factor in photoinduced electron-hole separation. The synthesis procedure that was employed here is a promising process for the preparation of effective g-C3N4-based photocatalyst systems for photocatalysis applications.","output":"S-scheme mesoporous Li2MnO3/g-C3N4 heterojunctions as efficient photocatalysts for the mineralization of trichloroethylene in aqueous media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The performance of the Roche Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, and Trillium IgG/IgM rapid assays was evaluated in Jamaica, the largest country of the English-speaking Caribbean.

The IoT promises many benefits to streamlining and enhancing health care delivery to proactively predict health issues and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients both in and out of the hospital. Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations.

The previously introduced model of closed self-organized criticality (SOC), is adapted in the case of a virus-induced epidemic. In this version this physical model can distinguish the virus spread according to the virus aggressiveness. The study presented, highlights the critical value of virus density over a population. For low values of the initial virus density (lower than the critical value) it is proved that the virus-diffusion behavior is safe and quantitatively similar to usual real epidemical data. However, it is revealed that very close to the critical point, the critical slowing-down (CSD) phenomenon, introduced by the theory of critical phenomena, emerges, leading to a tremendous increase of both the percentage of active carriers and the duration of the epidemic. A behavior of the epidemic obeying to a second order phase transition, also occurs. For virus density values higher than the critical value, the epidemic duration becomes extremely prolonged. Additionally, the effect of the closed system population size revealed interesting properties. All these results, together with an investigation of the effectiveness of applying physical contact restriction measures, document scientifically their worthiness, while they also demonstrate the limits for which herd immunity holds safely. Finally, the model has been compared against real epidemic data in the case of Greece, which imposed restrictive measures consistently and in time.","output":"On the effectiveness of imposing restrictive measures in a graded Self-Organized Criticality epidemic spread model The case of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019, more than 8 million cases have occurred worldwide as of June 16, 2020. However, it is important to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza. Here, we comparatively described the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 and paediatric patients with influenza. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of 585 paediatric patients with COVID-19 or influenza in Wuhan Children's Hospital, China. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes were comparatively analysed. RESULTS: The median ages were 6.96 years (IQR, 2-10.81) for children with confirmed COVID-19, 2.67 years (IQR, 1.03-15.25) for those with influenza A and 3.67 years (IQR, 1.62-5.54) for those with influenza B. Fever was a symptom in 84 (34.7%) COVID-19 cases, 132 (70.21%) influenza A cases and 111 (74.50%) influenza B cases. The median length of stay (LOS) was 11 (8-15) days for paediatric COVID-19 patients, 4 (3-6) days for influenza A patients and 5 (3-6) days for influenza B patients. Twenty-six (13.98%) influenza A patients and 18 (12.59%) influenza B patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts, while 13 (5.33%) COVID-19 patients presented with decreased white blood cell counts. Eight (3.28%) COVID-19 patients, 23 (12.71%) influenza A patients and 21 (14.79%) influenza B patients experienced lymphocytopenia. Acute cardiac injury occurred in 18 (7.29%) COVID-19 patients, while 37 (19.68%) influenza A and 27 (18.12%) influenza B patients had acute cardiac injury.

One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. Psychosocial stress can reduce sleep length and increase sleep disturbance, which can in turn reduce individuals ability to cope and respond to stressors, and worsen health outcomes. Therefore this study explored whether either worries about adversities during the pandemic or the experience of adversities were associated with impaired sleep. We used data from 45,109 adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-11/05/2020 in the UK during the pandemic. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models that automatically account for all time-invariant confounders. Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.17 (95% CI = 1.11, 1.24) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.23) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by social or psychiatric factors. Results suggest that poor sleep may be a mechanism by which adversities are affecting mental health and highlight the importance of interventions that seek to reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies during the pandemic.","output":"Are adversities and worries during the COVID-19 pandemic related to sleep quality?

Despite its increasing popularity, few social media initiatives consider the theoretical perspectives of how social media works as a knowledge translation strategy to affect research use. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework to understand how social media works as a knowledge translation strategy for health care providers, policy makers, and patients to inform their health care decision-making. METHODS: We developed this framework using an integrative approach that first involved reviewing 5 long-standing social media initiatives. We then drafted the initial framework using a deductive approach by referring to 5 theories on social media studies and knowledge translation. A total of 58 empirical studies on factors that influenced the use of social media and its messages and strategies for promoting the use of research evidence via social media were further integrated to substantiate and fine-tune our initial framework. Through an iterative process, we developed the Social Media for ImpLementing Evidence (SMILE) framework. RESULTS: The SMILE framework has six key constructs: developers, messages and delivery strategies, recipients, context, triggers, and outcomes. For social media to effectively enable recipients to use research evidence in their decision-making, the framework proposes that social media content developers respond to target recipients needs and context and develop relevant messages and appropriate delivery strategies. The recipients use of social media messages is influenced by the virtualCtechnical, individual, organizational, and system contexts and can be activated by three types of triggers: sparks, facilitators, and signals. CONCLUSIONS: The SMILE framework maps the factors that are hypothesized to influence the use of social media messages by recipients and offers a heuristic device for social media content developers to create interventions for promoting the use of evidence in health care decision-making. Empirical studies are now needed to test the propositions of this framework.","output":"Social Media for ImpLementing Evidence (SMILE): Conceptual Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported among patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Meanwhile there were controversies among different studies about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients. Hence, we aimed to study CVD burden among COVID-19 patients, using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in journal websites and Google Scholar. Meta-analyses were carried out for Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for different CVDs. We have also performed a descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and 198 papers for descriptive outcomes, including 159,698 COVID-19 patients. Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 13.29, 95% CI 7.35-24.03), hypertension (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 2.11-3.19), heart Failure (OR: 6.72, 95% CI 3.34-13.52), arrhythmia (OR: 2.75, 95% CI 1.43-5.25), coronary artery disease (OR: 3.78, 95% CI 2.42-5.90), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.89-3.62) were significantly associated with mortality. Arrhythmia (OR: 7.03, 95% CI 2.79-17.69), acute cardiac injury (OR: 15.58, 95% CI 5.15-47.12), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.09-6.26), cardiovascular disease (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.59-6.09), and hypertension (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.41-2.68) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients.

Here we report on the use of purified ?-glucan (lentinan) extracts from Lentinus edodes (Shiitake) mushroom that can reduce infection by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a rodent pneumonia model, likely through immunomodulation. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to intra-tracheal administration of K. pneumoniae to induce pulmonary sepsis and randomized to three groups; vehicle control (Vehicle, n = 12), commercial lentinan (CL, n = 8) or in-house extracted lentinan (IHL, n = 8) were administered intravenously 1 h postinfection. Physiological parameters and blood gas analysis were measured, bacterial counts from bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) were determined, along with differential staining of white cells and measurement of protein concentration in BAL 48 h after pneumonia induction. Use of IHL extract significantly decreased BAL CFU counts. Both CL and IHL extractions reduced protein concentration in BAL. Use of IHL resulted in an improvement in physiological parameters compared to controls and CL.

Our main goal was to locate geographical areas with increased number of people feeling the symptoms and to determine any temporal changes in the statistics of the survey entries. It was found that the application was rapidly disseminated to the entire Greek territory via social media, having, thus, a great public reception. The higher percentages of participants experiencing symptoms coincided geographically with the highly populated urban areas, having also increased numbers of confirmed cases, while temporal variations were detected that accorded with the restrictions of activities.

The reconstruction was done with loco-regional flaps like temporalis muscle flap n = 12 (38.7%), Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap n = 8 (25.8%), supraclavicular artery flap n = 10 (32.2%) and combination of fore-head, temporalis major and cheek rotation flaps n = 1 (3%). Defects involved different regions like maxilla n = 11 (35.4%), buccal mucosa n = 6 (19.3%), tongue with floor of mouth n = 6 (19.3%), mandible n = 4 (12.9%), parotid gland, mastoid n = 3 (9.6%) and combination of defects n = 1 (3%). Metal reconstruction plate was used in 3 (9.6%) patients with mandibular defects. All flaps survived, with the maximum follow-up of 8 months and minimum follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Pedicled flaps are proving as the workhorse for head and neck reconstruction in unique global health crisis. Vigilant use of proper PPE and adherence to the ethical principles proves to be the only shield that will benefit patients, HCW and health system.","output":"Taking a step down on the reconstruction ladder for head and neck reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmaceuticals pose a major threat to the marine environment, and several studies have recently described their negative effects on marine organisms. Pharmaceutical compounds are constantly being released into aquatic ecosystems, and chronic exposure, even at low concentrations, may have a major impact on marine organisms. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the biological changes induced by one of the most widely used pharmaceuticalsparacetamolin the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, after a long-term exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations. We present our data alongside and in comparison with results from a previous short-term exposure, to demonstrate the significance of exposure period on the effects of paracetamol in adult blue mussels. After 24 days of laboratory exposure, seven potential target genes were selected to examine toxicological effects in mussels gonads and possible disruptive effects on reproductive processes. The results show the modulation of some important reproduction-related genes: estrogen receptor-2 (ER2), vitelline envelope zona pellucida domain-9 (V9), and vitellogenin (VTG). Variations in mRNA expression of four other genes involved in apoptosis (HSP70, CASP8, BCL2, and FAS) are also highlighted. Histopathological alterations caused by paracetamol, together with neutral red retention time response in mussels hemocytes, are presented herein. Overall, this study highlights the exacerbated effects of low concentration of paracetamol after chronic exposure, similar to the damage induced by higher concentrations in a short exposure scenario, thus emphasizing the importance of length of exposure period when studying the effects of this substance. Additionally, this study also discusses the potential of paracetamol to inflict several major changes in the reproductive system of mussels and thus possibly affect the survival of populations.

However, such type of side effect has not been observed in the follow-up during the treatment of the third-generation EGFR-TKI Almonertinib (also called HS-10296). Here, we first report an Almonertinib-induced ILD in an elderly female patient. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old female diagnosed with  lung adenocarcinoma with intracranial metastasis harboring a mutation of EGFR 19DEL was administrated with Almonertinib 110 mg orally as the first-line treatment. However, she presented with chest tightness, and shortness of breath, accompanying with paroxysmal dry cough 3 months after the initiation of Almonertinib. DIAGNOSES: Extensive relevant examinations did not provide conclusive results and the chest computed tomography showed a diffuse ILD in bilateral pulmonary. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with Almonertinib-induced ILD in the absence of no other potential causes. She discontinued Almonertinib and was treated with oxygen uptaken and methylprednisolone. OUTCOMES: The whole symptoms were eliminated and the chest computed tomography showed ILD got remission after the prescription of methylprednisolone.

We hypothesised that criteria for inflammation and cell death would predict this type of CS. METHODS We analysed 513 hospitalised patients who were positive for COVID-19 reverse transcriptase PCR and for ground-glass opacity by chest high-resolution CT. To achieve an early diagnosis, we analysed the laboratory results of the first 7 days of hospitalisation. We implemented logistic regression and principal component analysis to determine the predictive criteria. We used a 'genetic algorithm' to derive the cut-offs for each laboratory result. We validated the criteria with a second cohort of 258 patients. RESULTS We found that the criteria for macrophage activation syndrome, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and the HScore did not identify the COVID-19 cytokine storm (COVID-CS). We developed new predictive criteria, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, comprising three clusters of laboratory results that involve (1) inflammation, (2) cell death and tissue damage, and (3) prerenal electrolyte imbalance. The criteria identified patients with longer hospitalisation and increased mortality. These results highlight the relevance of hyperinflammation and tissue damage in the COVID-CS. CONCLUSIONS We propose new early predictive criteria to identify the CS occurring in patients with COVID-19.

The controversial nature of existing medical treatment options means that novel, alternative approaches are needed. In basic and clinical studies, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has proven successful in regenerating peripheral nerves. Laser acupuncture therapy (LAT) is a rapidly growing treatment modality; however, its effectiveness for treating chronic Bell's palsy is unknown. The feasibility of this innovative approach is the focus of this pilot study. Methods: A two-armed, parallel, randomized, investigator-subject-assessor-blinded, sham-controlled pilot study was conducted, and 17 eligible subjects were randomly allocated to either LAT (n=8) or sham LAT (n=9). The LAT group received three treatments each week for six weeks (18 sessions), while the sham LAT group received the same procedure but with a sham laser device. The change from baseline to week 6 in the social subscale of the Facial Disability Index (FDI) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were changes in the House-Brackmann facial paralysis scale (HB), the Sunnybrook facial grading system (SB) and a stiffness scale at weeks 3 and 6. Results: A significant difference was shown in the HB score (P=0.0438) between baseline and week 3 and borderline significance was observed in both SB and stiffness scores from baseline to week 6 (P=0.0598 and P=0.0980 respectively). There was no significant difference in the FDI score between baseline and week 6. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this clinical trial is the first such investigation on this topic.

In addition, infection diagnosis is the main building block of most automated diagnostic/prognostic frameworks. Recently, due to the devastating effects of the radiation on the body caused by the CT scan, there has been a surge in acquiring low and ultra-low-dose CT scans instead of the standard scans. Such CT scans, however, suffer from a high noise level which makes them difficult and time-consuming to interpret even by expert radiologists. In addition, some abnormalities are only visible using specific window settings on the radiologists' monitor. Currently, manual adjustment of the windowing settings is the common approach to analyze such low-quality images. In this paper, we propose an automated framework based on the Capsule Networks, referred to as the 'WSO-CAPS', to detect slices demonstrating infection using low and ultra-low-dose chest CT scans. The WSOCAPS framework is equipped with a Window Setting Optimization (WSO) mechanism to automatically identify the best window setting parameters to resemble the radiologists' efforts. The experimental results on our in-house dataset show that the WSO-CAPS enhances the capability of the Capsule Network and its counterparts to identify slices demonstrating infection. The WSO-CAPS achieves the accuracy of 92.0%, sensitivity of 90.3%, and specificity of 93.3%. We believe that the proposed WSO-CAPS has a high potential to be further utilized in future frameworks that are working with CT scans, particularly the ones which utilize an infection diagnosis step in their pipeline. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Wso-caps: Diagnosis of lung infection from low and ultra-lowdose CT scans using capsule networks and windowsetting optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The second half of 2021 has seen the aviation industry continue to grapple with the impact of the on-going Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as travel restrictions and similar adjustments have been required in a number of jurisdictions.

A variety of computational heuristics have been developed to pre-emptively identify susceptible host species based on variation in the ACE2 receptor used for viral entry. However, the predictive performance of these heuristics remains unknown. Using a newly-compiled database of 96 species we show that, while variation in ACE2 can be used by machine learning models to accurately predict animal susceptibility to sarbecoviruses (accuracy = 80.2%, binomial confidence interval [CI]: 70.8 C 87.6%), the sites informing predictions have no known involvement in virus binding and instead recapitulate host phylogeny. Models trained on host phylogeny alone performed equally well (accuracy = 84.4%, CI: 75.5 C 91.0%) and at a level equivalent to retrospective assessments of accuracy for previously published models. These results suggest that the predictive power of ACE2-based models derives from strong correlations with host phylogeny rather than processes which can be mechanistically linked to infection biology. Further, biased availability of ACE2 sequences misleads projections of the number and geographic distribution of at-risk species. Models based on host phylogeny reduce this bias, but identify a very large number of susceptible species, implying that model predictions must be combined with local knowledge of exposure risk to practically guide surveillance. Identifying barriers to viral infection or onward transmission beyond receptor binding and incorporating data which are independent of host phylogeny will be necessary to manage the ongoing risk of establishment of novel animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Variation in the ACE2 receptor has limited utility for SARS-CoV-2 host prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of COVID-19 patients in the ICUs requires several and prolonged life-support systems (mechanical ventilation, continuous infusions of medications and nutrition, renal replacement therapy).

To combat this pandemic, effective screening techniques for infected patients are indispensable. There is no doubt that the use of chest X-ray images for radiological assessment is one of the essential screening techniques. Some of the early studies revealed that the patient's chest X-ray images showed abnormalities, which is natural for patients infected with COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a parallel-dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) based COVID-19 detection system from chest x-ray images, named as Parallel-Dilated COVIDNet (PDCOVIDNet). First, the publicly available chest X-ray collection fully preloaded and enhanced, and then classified by the proposed method. Differing convolution dilation rate in a parallel form demonstrates the proof-of-principle for using PDCOVIDNet to extract radiological features for COVID-19 detection.

Here, we show that open reading frame 8 (ORF8) acts as messenger for inter-cellular communication between alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanistically, ORF8 is a secretory protein that can be secreted by infected epithelial cells via both conventional and unconventional secretory pathways. The unconventionally secreted ORF8 recognizes the IL17RA receptor of macrophages and induces cytokine release. However, conventionally secreted ORF8 cannot bind to IL17RA due to N-linked glycosylation. Furthermore, we found that Yip1 interacting factor homolog B (YIF1B) is a channel protein that translocates unglycosylated ORF8 into vesicles for unconventional secretion.

As the accumulation of discarded face masks represents a booming threat to the environment, here we propose a solution to reuse and upcycle surgical masks according to one of the cornerstones of the circular economy. Specifically, the non-woven cellulosic layer of the masks is used as an environmentally sustainable and highly porous solid support for the controlled deposition of catalytically active metal-oxide nanoparticles. The native cellulosic fibers from the surgical masks are decorated by titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), iron oxide (Fe(x)O(y)), and cobalt oxide (CoO(x)) nanoparticles following a simple and scalable approach. The abundant surface COH groups of cellulose enable the controlled deposition of metal-oxide nanoparticles that are photocatalytically active or shown enzyme-mimetic activities. Importantly, the hydrophilic highly porous character of the cellulosic non-woven offers higher accessibility of the pollutant to the catalytically active surfaces and high retention in its interior. As a result, good catalytic activities with long-term stability and reusability are achieved. Additionally, developed free-standing hybrids avoid undesired media contamination effects originating from the release of nanoscale particles. The upcycling of discarded cellulosic materials, such as the ones of masks, into high-added-value catalytic materials, results an efficient approach to lessen the wastes hazards of plastics while enhancing their functionality. Interestingly, this procedure can be extended to the upcycling of other systems (cellulosic or not), opening the path to greener manufacturing approaches of catalytic materials. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: A novel approach to upcycle discarded cellulosic surgical masks is proposed, providing a solution to reduce the undesired accumulation of discarded face masks originating from the COVID-19 pandemic. The non-woven cellulosic layer formed by fibers is used as solid support for the controlled deposition of catalytically active titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), iron oxide (Fe(x)O(y)), and cobalt oxide (CoO(x)) nanoparticles. Cellulosic porous materials are proven useful for the photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes, while their peroxidase-like activity opens the door to advanced applications such as electrochemical sensors.

The biggest problem is that most COVID-19 patients might face sequelae (e.g., fatigue, sleep disturbance, pulmonary fibrosis) during the recovery phase. We aimed to test six Chinese patent medicines to treat three major abnormal symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the recovery phase, including cardiopulmonary function, sleep disturbance, and digestive function. We launched the three syndromes and six Chinese patent medicines randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial on April 10, 2020. The results showed that Jinshuibao tablets and Shengmaiyin oral liquid significantly improved the cardiopulmonary function of recovering COVID-19 patients. Shumian capsules, but not Xiaoyao capsules, significantly improved patients sleep disorders. This might be because the indication of Xiaoyao capsules is liver qi stagnation rather than psychological or emotional problems. Xiangsha Liujun pills and Ludangshen oral liquid significantly improved digestive function. Our research provides a guideline for treating COVID-19 sequelae in patients during the recovery period based on high-quality evidence.","output":"The three syndromes and six Chinese patent medicine study during the recovery phase of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exponential growth of biomedical knowledge in computable formats challenges organizations to consider mobilizing artifacts in findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, and trustable (FAIR+T) ways(1).

While lockdowns may be crucial for disease prevention and control, they also disrupt food systems and economic activity and may have devastating impacts on vulnerable households. This study uses longitudinal data to examine trends in household food insecurity in Nigeria just after lockdowns were imposed and at multiple points later in 2020, and assesses the impacts of lockdowns in spring 2020 on household food insecurity. METHODS: This study utilizes data from the Nigerian General Household Survey 2018/19 and the first seven rounds of the LSMS-ISA National Longitudinal Panel Survey on COVID-19 collected between April-November 2020. We assess trends in household food insecurity, as measured by the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and use a difference-in-difference design to estimate the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on household food insecurity. RESULTS: Household food insecurity in Nigeria increased significantly between Jan/Feb 2019 and the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in April/May 2020. As the pandemic continued, food insecurity decreased between April/May and November of 2020 for all items in the FIES yet remained significantly higher than before the pandemic began. Difference-in-difference models, however, suggest that the lockdowns that were imposed in some Nigerian states did not significantly increase household food insecurity. CONCLUSIONS: When lockdowns were imposed in response to COVID-19 outbreaks in early 2020, many researchers and policymakers worried that households in low- and middle-income countries, many of which rely on informal work and/or daily wages for their livelihoods, would be vulnerable to food insecurity and hunger. Still, lockdowns are a key public health strategy for slowing the spread of infectious disease. As we continue to address COVID-19 and prepare for new emerging infectious diseases, we must weigh the risks and benefits strategies such as lockdowns. These results will help policymakers understand how measures to prevent and control COVID-19 influence livelihoods during a prolonged public health crisis.

However, many countries have reported critical supply shortages due to the spike in demand during the outbreak in 2020. One potential solution to ease pressure on conventional supply chains is the local fabrication of PPE, particularly face shields, due to their simplistic design. The purpose of this paper is to provide a research protocol and cost implications for the rapid development and manufacturing of face shields by individuals or companies with minimal equipment and materials. This article describes a best practice case study in which the establishment of a local manufacturing hub resulted in the swift production of 12,000 face shields over a seven-week period to meet PPE shortages in the North-West region of Ireland. Protocols and processes for the design, materials sourcing, prototyping, manufacturing, and distribution of face shields are described. Three types of face shields were designed and manufactured, including Flat, Laser-cut, and 3D-printed models. Of the models tested, the Flat model proved the most cost-effective (0.51/unit), while the Laser-cut model was the most productive (245 units/day). The insights obtained from this study demonstrate the capacity for local voluntary workforces to be quickly mobilised in response to a healthcare emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19: Rapid prototyping and production of face shields via flat, laser-cut, and 3D-printed models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is considered as serious global threat of this time and greatest challenge for recent days Several approaches have been carried out in this direction to fight against COVID-19 Among these, nanotechnology is one of the promising approach to face these challenges in the current situation Recently, graphene-based nanomaterials have been explored for COVID-19 due to its unique physicochemical properties This mini review provides a recent progress in graphene-based nanomaterials and its applications for diagnosis, detection, decontamination, and protection against COVID-19 Further, main challenges and perspective for fundamental design and development of technologies based on graphene-based materials are discussed and suitable directions to improve these technologies are suggested This article will provide timely knowledge and future direction about this wonder materials in various biological applications","output":"Graphene-based Materials for Fighting Coronavirus Disease 2019: Challenges and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the survival of adult and pediatric patients receiving mechanical ventilation and determine the associated risk factors METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in the intensive care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) and King Abdullah Childrens Specialist Hospital (KACSH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The analysis includes data from medical records of all patients admitted to ICUs who received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. For each patient, potential risk factors were collected. The main outcome of this study was the mortality during the stay in ICU after receiving mechanical ventilation RESULTS: A total of 262 adults and 175 pediatric patients were admitted to ICUs and received mechanical ventilation during the study period. For adult patients, the overall mortality was 37%, with a median survival time of 11 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-20 days). The main risk factors independently associated with the increased mortality rate were being aged 51-60 (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-1.0) and factors related to ICU admission.

CR lacks non-invasive markers and reliable diagnostic methods. We evaluated endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as a novel approach for monitoring of the intestinal allograft with respect to CR. DESIGN: In intestinal graft recipients, EUS and enteroscopy with ileal mucosal biopsy were performed via the ileostomy. At EUS, the wall thickness of the intestinal graft was measured in standard mode, whereas the resistive index (RI) of the supplying artery was assessed in pulsed Doppler mode. At enteroscopy, the intestinal mucosa was assessed. Findings were compared with histopathology and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: EUS was successfully performed in all 11 patients (adequate clinical course (AC) n=9; CR n=2) after a median interval of 1537 days (range: 170C5204), post-transplantation. The total diameter of the wall (layer ICV) was comparable in all patients. Meanwhile, the diameter of the outermost part (layer IVCV; that is, muscularis propriaCserosa) was among the two CR patients (range: 1.3C1.4 mm) in the upper end of measurements as compared with the nine AC patients (range: 0.5C1.4 mm).

Clinically most important are septic and hemorrhagic shock, which comprise more than 75% of all clinical cases of shock. Both forms lead to severe dysfunction of the microcirculation and the mitochondria that can cause or further aggravate tissue damage and inflammation. However, the detailed mechanisms of acute and long-term effects of impaired oxygen utilization are still elusive. Importantly, a defective oxygen exploitation can impact multiple organs simultaneously and organ damage can be aggravated due to intense organ cross-talk or the presence of a systemic inflammatory response. Complexity is further increased through a large heterogeneity in the human population, differences in genetics, age and gender, comorbidities or disease history. To gain a deeper understanding of the principles, mechanisms, interconnections and consequences of impaired oxygen delivery and utilization, interdisciplinary preclinical as well as clinical research is required. In this review, we provide a tool-box that covers widely used animal disease models for septic and hemorrhagic shock and methods to determine the structure and function of the microcirculation as well as mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we suggest magnetic resonance imaging as a multimodal imaging platform to noninvasively assess the consequences of impaired oxygen delivery on organ function, cell metabolism, alterations in tissue textures or inflammation. Combining structural and functional analyses of oxygen delivery and utilization in animal models with additional data obtained by multiparametric MRI-based techniques can help to unravel mechanisms underlying immediate effects as well as long-term consequences of impaired oxygen delivery on multiple organs and may narrow the gap between experimental preclinical research and the human patient.","output":"A Toolbox to Investigate the Impact of Impaired Oxygen Delivery in Experimental Disease Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound impact on healthcare systems around the world.

Multivariate COX regression was used to investigate the association between BAR and in-hospital mortality and propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were also used to ensure the robustness of our findings. eICU-CRD database (validation cohort) was also applied to validate our findings. RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for BAR was 6.8mg/g.

However, unexpectedly, 44% of healthy unexposed healthy controls, all IgG-RBD seronegative, had a strong virus-specific T-cell response with the COVID-19 IGRA, probably because of prior exposure to common cold-causing coronaviruses or other viral or microbial antigens. Conclusion and Discussion The high percentage of unexposed healthy subjects with a pre-existing immunity suggests that a part of the Ecuadorian population is likely to have SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells. Given that the IGRA technique is simple, and can be easily scaled up for investigations where high numbers of patients are needed, this COVID-19 IGRA may serve to determine if the T-cell only response represents protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based study.","output":"Pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed healthy controls in Ecuador, as detected with a COVID-19 Interferon-Gamma Release Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A key measure to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been social distancing. Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians experience using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative content analysis. SETTING: PICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. SUBJECTS: PICU Physicians. INTERVENTIONS: Due to the pandemic, the hospitals PICU used Zoom(?) as a remote conferencing application instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review board approval, data were collected over two weeks (1 Jul 2020 to 14 Jul 2020). MEASUREMENTS: An online survey was conducted using open-ended questions to capture demographic data and the perceived efficacy of remote handovers. Thematic framework analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. MAIN RESULTS: All 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. While 20 (54.1%) physicians reported attending 1C5 Zoom handovers by the time of the study, some (n. 6, 16.2%) had more than ten virtual handovers. They had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were comfortable conducting a remote handover. Most found that SituationCBackgroundCAssessmentCRecommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings. CONCLUSION: Video-conferencing applications for online handovers could supplement traditional face-to-face intensive care unit patient handover during outbreaks of infectious diseases. The use of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be encouraged to optimize the users experience.","output":"Virtual Handover of Patients in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit During the Covid-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women during the confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 15 April and 14 May 2020, a multicentre cross-sectional survey was performed to study depression, anxiety and resilience in a sample of Spanish pregnant women during the lockdown set up by the Government in response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We designed an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire (https://bit.ly/34RRpq1) that included the Spanish validated versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-items Scale (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS: A total of 514 pregnant women completed the survey. 72.8% had been confined < 40 days and 27.2% between 41 and 60 days. 182 (35.4%) participants scored over 10, with 21.3% scoring over 13 (75th Percentile) in depressive symptoms rates. We found high trait and anxiety scores, with 223 (43.4%) and 227 (44.2%) pregnant women scoring over the trait and state mean scores. Neither depression, anxiety or resilience levels showed any significant correlation with the length of confinement. We found low CD-RISC-10 scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the quarantine, although we did not find an increased prevalence of psychological distress according to length of home confinement.

Patients were randomized into two groups where Group 1 (Ivermectin group) included patients who received ivermectin 12 mg once daily for 3 days with standard care and Group 2 (control group) included patients who received standard protocol of treatment alone for 14 days. The main outcomes were mortality, the length of hospital stay, and the need for mechanical ventilation. All patients were followed up for 1 month. Overall, 82 individuals were randomized to receive ivermectin plus standard of care and 82 to receive standard of care alone. Patients in the ivermectin group had a shorter length of hospital stay (8.82  4.94 days) than the control group (10.97  5.28 days), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.085). Three patients (3.7%) in each group required mechanical ventilation (p = 1.00). The death rate was three patients in the ivermectin group (3.7%) versus four patients (4.9%) in the control group without any significant difference between the two groups (p = 1.00).

The structure and function of nodes can vary significantly, with vital nodes playing a crucial role in information spread and other spreading phenomena. Identifying and taking action on vital nodes enables change to the network's structure and function more efficiently. Previous work either redefines metrics used to measure the nodes' importance or focuses on developing algorithms to efficiently find vital nodes. These approaches typically rely on global knowledge of the network and assume that the structure of the network does not change over time, both of which are difficult to achieve in the real world. In this paper, we propose a localized strategy that can find vital nodes without global knowledge of the network. Our joint nomination (JN) strategy selects a random set of nodes along with a set of nodes connected to those nodes, and together they nominate the vital node set. Experiments are conducted on 12 network datasets that include synthetic and real-world networks, and undirected and directed networks. Results show that average degree of the identified node set is about 3-8 times higher than that of the full node set, and higher-degree nodes take larger proportions in the degree distribution of the identified vital node set. Removal of vital nodes increases the average shortest path length by 20-70% over the original network, or about 8-15% longer than the other decentralized strategies. Immunization based on JN is more efficient than other strategies, consuming around 12-40% less immunization resources to raise the epidemic threshold to [Formula: see text]. Susceptible-infected-recovered simulations on networks with 30% vital nodes removed using JN delays the arrival time of infection peak significantly and reduce the total infection scale to 15%. The proposed strategy can effectively identify vital nodes using only local information and is feasible to implement in the real world to cope with time-critical scenarios such as the sudden outbreak of COVID-19.","output":"Hunting for vital nodes in complex networks using local information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antecedentes y objetivos: El propsito de este estudio en 265 pacientes con sndrome respiratorio agudo severo por coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) es establecer una relacin entre la cuantificacin inicial de los hallazgos en la radiografa de trax en pacientes con COVID-19 y un eventual empeoramiento clnico, as como comparar tres sistemas de cuantificacin que se proponen.

Background and aims: We aimed to analyze the relationship between the initial chest X-ray findings in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and eventual clinical worsening and to compare three systems of quantifying these findings. Material and methods: This retrospective study reviewed the clinical and radiological evolution of 265 adult patients with COVID-19 attended at our center between March 2020 and April 2020. We recorded data related to patients comorbidities, hospital stay, and clinical worsening (admission to the ICU, intubation, and death). We used three scoring systems taking into consideration 6 or 8 lung fields (designated 6A, 6B, and 8) to quantify lung involvement in each patients initial pathological chest X-ray and to classify its severity as mild, moderate, or severe, and we compared these three systems. We also recorded the presence of alveolar opacities and linear opacities (fundamentally linear atelectasis) in the first chest X-ray with pathologic findings. Results: In the 2 analysis, moderate or severe involvement in the three classification systems correlated with hospital admission (p=0.009 in 6A, p=0.001 in 6B, and p=0.001 in 8) and with death (p=0.02 in 6A, p=0.01 in 6B, and p=0.006 in 8). In the regression analysis, the most significant associations were 6B with alveolar involvement (OR 2.3; 95%CI 1.1.C4.7; p=0.025;) and 8 with alveolar involvement (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.01.C4.25; p=0.046). No differences were observed in the ability of the three systems to predict clinical worsening by classifications of involvement in chest X-rays as moderate or severe. Conclusion: Moderate/severe extension in the three chest X-ray scoring systems evaluating the extent of involvement over 6 or 8 lung fields and the finding of alveolar opacities in the first pathologic X-ray correlated with mortality and the rate of hospitalization in the patients studied.

Methods: In this prospective study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D high-resolution T1WI sequences were acquired in 60 recovered COVID-19 patients (56.67% male; age: 44.10  16.00) and 39 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 controls (56.41% male; age: 45.88  13.90). Registered fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI, and an index score system was introduced. Regional volumes derived from Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) and DTI metrics were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two sample t-test and Spearman correlation were conducted to assess the relationships among imaging indices, index scores and clinical information. Findings: In this follow-up stage, neurological symptoms were presented in 55% COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had statistically significantly higher bilateral gray matter volumes (GMV) in olfactory cortices, hippocampi, insulas, left Rolandic operculum, left Heschl's gyrus and right cingulate gyrus and a general decline of MD, AD, RD accompanied with an increase of FA in white matter, especially AD in the right CR, EC and SFF, and MD in SFF compared with non-COVID-19 volunteers (corrected p value <0.05). Global GMV, GMVs in left Rolandic operculum, right cingulate, bilateral hippocampi, left Heschl's gyrus, and Global MD of WM were found to correlate with memory loss (p value <0.05).

To assess the inactivation potential of the proposed UVC germicidal device as a function of time by using 3 M 8211-N95 particulate respirators inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. A germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose was developed and test coupons (2.5 cm(2)) of the 3 M-N95 respirator were inoculated with 10(6) plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 and were UV irradiated. Different exposure times were tested (0C164 s) by fixing the distance between the lamp and the test coupon to 15.2 cm while providing an exposure of at least 5.43 mWcm(?2). Primary measure of outcome was titration of infectious virus recovered from virus-inoculated respirator test coupons after UVC exposure. Other measures included the method validation of the irradiation protocol, using lentiviruses (biosafety level-2 agent) and establishment of the germicidal UVC exposure protocol.

Comorbid diseases are determinants of the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality. The aim of this study was to explore the potential association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the severity of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study included 609 consecutive adult patients (male: 54.52%, mean age: 59.23  15.55 years) hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a tertiary level hospital. Data were collected from the electronic health records of the hospital. The patients were separated into two groups: Group I included COVID-19-positive patients with CKD stage 1-2, and Group II included COVID-19-positive with CKD stage 3-5. The relationships were examined between CKD stage, laboratory parameters and mortality. RESULTS: Significant differences were determined between the groups in respect of the inflammation parameters and the parameters used in prognosis. In Group II, statistically significantly higher rates were determined of comorbid diseases [hypertension (p < 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), acute kidney injury (AKI), which was found to be associated with mortality (p < 0.001), and mortality (p < 0.001)].

RESULTS The score of SAS, SOS and GSES are range from 20 - 80, 22 - 110 and 10 - 40 respectively, the SAS (31.797.32) and SOS (40.1912.92) and GSES scores (24.836.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (r=0.679, P<0.001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r=-0.326, p<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress, and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (p=0.006, <0.001, <0.001, 0.039, respectively).

Unfortunately, there is not any potential drugs available to combat the action of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Based on the reports HIV-protease inhibitors can be applied against the SARS by targeting the SARS-CoV-1 Mpro, we have chosen few clinically trialed experimental and allophenylnorstatine (APNS) containing HIV-protease inhibitors (JE-2147, JE-533, KNI-227, KNI-272 & KNI-1931), to examine their binding affinities with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and to assess their potential to check for a possible drug candidate against the protease. Here, we have chosen a methodology to understand the binding mechanism of these five inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by merging molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and MM-PBSA based free energy calculations. Our estimations disclose that JE-2147 is highly effective (GBind = -28.31 kcal/mol) due to an increased favorable van der Waals (Evdw) interactions and decreased solvation (Gsolv) energies between the inhibitor and viral protease. JE-2147 shows a higher level of interactions as compared to JE-533 (-6.85 kcal/mol), KNI-227 (-18.36 kcal/mol), KNI-272 (-15.69 kcal/mol) and KNI-1931 (-21.59 kcal/mol) against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Binding contributions of important residues (His41, Met49, Cys145, His164, Met165, Glu166, Pro168, Gln189, etc.) from the active site or near the active site regions with 1.0 kcal/mol suggest a potent binding of the inhibitors.

AIM To investigate the effects of hypocapnia and hypocapnia combined with hypotension (HCT) on cerebral perfusion and tissue oxygenation in anesthetized piglets. METHOD Thirty anesthetized piglets were randomly allocated to groups: moderate hypocapnia (mHC), severe hypocapnia (sHC) and HCT. Cerebral monitoring comprised a tissue oxygen partial pressure and a laser Doppler probe inserted into the brain tissue as well as a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor placed on the skin, measuring regional oxygen saturation. Hypocapnia was induced by hyperventilation (target PaCO2 mHC: 3.7 - 4; sHC: 3.1 - 3.3 kPa) and hypotension by blood withdrawal and nitroprusside infusion (mean blood pressure: 35 - 38 mmHg). Data were analyzed at baseline, during (Tr20, Tr40, Tr60) and after (Post20, Post40, Post60) treatment. RESULTS Compared to baseline, tissue oxygen partial pressure decreased significantly and equally during all treatments [mean(SD) at baseline: mHC 35.7(32.45); sHC: 28.1(20.24); HCT 25.4(10.3) and at Tr60: mHC: 29.9(27.36); sHC: 22.2(18.37); HCT: 18.4(9.5) mmHg]. Decreased laser Doppler flow was detected with all treatments at Tr20 [mHC: 0.9(0.18); sHC: 0.88(0.15); HCT: 0.97(0.13) proportion from baseline]. Independently of group, regional oxygen saturation varied only after reverting and not during treatment.

The increasingly evident role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission means testing is central to control, but test sensitivity estimates are as low as 65%. Methods: We extend an existing UK-focused branching process model for contact tracing, adding diagnostic testing and refining parameter estimates to demonstrate the impact of poor test sensitivity and suggest mitigation methods. We also investigate the role of super-spreading events, providing estimates of the relationship between infections, cases detected and hospitalisations, and consider how tracing coverage and speed affects outbreak risk. Findings: Incorporating poor sensitivity testing into tracing protocols could reduce efficacy, due to false negative results impacting isolation duration. However, a 7-day isolation period for all negative-testing individuals could mitigate this effect. Similarly, reducing delays to testing following exposure has a negligible impact on the risk of future outbreaks, but could undermine control if negative-testing individuals immediately cease isolating. Even 100% tracing of contacts will miss cases, which could prompt large localised outbreaks if physical distancing measures are relaxed prematurely. Interpretation: It is imperative that test results are interpreted with caution due to high false-negative rates and that contact tracing is used in combination with physical distancing measures. If the risks associated with imperfect test sensitivity are mitigated, we find that contact tracing can facilitate control when the reproduction number with physical distancing, Rs, is less than 15.","output":"An imperfect tool: COVID-19 'test & trace' success relies on minimising the impact of false negatives and continuation of physical distancing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We estimated unit costs for COVID-19 case management for patients with asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 disease in Kenya. METHODS: We estimated per-day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients. We used a bottom-up approach to estimate full economic costs and adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from data provided by three public COVID-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya and augmented this with guidelines. We obtained input prices from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and from market prices for Kenya. RESULTS: Per-day, per-patient unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease under home-based care are 1993.01 Kenyan shilling (KES) (US$18.89) and 1995.17 KES (US$18.991), respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation centre or hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease are 6717.74 KES (US$63.68) and 6719.90 KES (US$63.70), respectively.

However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible.

Epitope mapping revealed that the binding site is a key determinant of neutralization potency, rather than affinity alone.

For this purpose, basic psychological interventions and psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among members of a society seems necessary.","output":"Stress and anxiety resulting from COVID-19 in the Iranian population C a questionnaire-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) causing tick-borne hemorrhagic fever which was earlier endemic to western Ghats, southern India, it is now encroaching into new geographic regions, but there is no approved medicine or effective vaccine against this deadly disease. In this study, we did in-silico design of multi-epitope subunit vaccine for KFDV. B-cell and T-cell epitopes were predicted from conserved regions of KFDV envelope protein and two vaccine candidates (VC1 and VC2) were constructed, those were found to be non-allergic and possess good antigenic properties, also gives cross-protection against Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus. The 3D structures of vaccine candidates were built and validated. Docking analysis of vaccine candidates with toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) by Cluspro and PatchDock revealed strong affinity between VC1 and TLR2. Ligplot tool was identified the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between vaccine candidates and TLR-2, iMOD server confirmed the stability of the docking complexes. JCAT sever ensured cloning efficiency of both vaccine constructs and in-silico cloning into pET30a (+) vector by SnapGene showed successful translation of epitope region. IMMSIM server was identified increased immunological responses. Finally, multi-epitope vaccine candidates were designed and validated their efficiency, it may pave the way for up-coming vaccine and diagnostic kit development.","output":"In-silico design of envelope based multi-epitope vaccine candidate against Kyasanur forest disease virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A focused He+ beam with a beam diameter less than 1 nm is heating up the targeted surface for a He+ dose larger than 1  1020 ions cm-2. The temperature can reach 1000 C locally, resulting in surface decomposition or chemical reactions. This temperature was measured by fabricating gold nanodisks down to 20 nm in diameter and 10 nm in thickness on mica and sapphire surfaces. The melting and vaporization of these nanodisks were used to determine this temperature according to the known gold nanocluster melting temperature variations as a function of their volume. This local heat production is very negative for precise He+ nanolithography resist processes but advantageous without a resist when used to directly nano-sculpture a nanomaterial when a very thermally conductive support like sapphire is selected.","output":"Local heat generated by a focused He+ ion beam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Secondary inhalation of medical aerosols is a significant occupational hazard in both clinical and homecare settings. Exposure to fugitive emissions generated during aerosol therapy increases the risk of the unnecessary inhalation of medication, as well as toxic side effects. Methods: This study examines fugitively-emitted aerosol emissions when nebulising albuterol sulphate, as a tracer aerosol, using two commercially available nebulisers in combination with an open or valved facemask or using a mouthpiece with and without a filter on the exhalation port. Each combination was connected to a breathing simulator during simulated adult breathing. The inhaled dose and residual mass were quantified using UV spectrophotometry. Time-varying fugitively-emitted aerosol concentrations and size distributions during nebulisation were recorded using aerodynamic particle sizers at two distances relative to the simulated patient. Different aerosol concentrations and size distributions were observed depending on the interface. Results: Within each nebuliser, the facemask combination had the highest time-averaged fugitively-emitted aerosol concentration, and values up to 0.072  0.001 mg m(?3) were recorded. The placement of a filter on the exhalation port of the mouthpiece yielded the lowest recorded concentrations. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the fugitively-emitted aerosol was recorded as 0.890  0.044 m, lower the initially generated medical aerosol in the range of 2C5 m. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential secondary inhalation of exhaled aerosols from commercially available nebuliser facemask/mouthpiece combinations. The results will aid in developing approaches to inform policy and best practices for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions.","output":"Investigation of the Quantity of Exhaled Aerosols Released into the Environment during Nebulisation"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/20.md","filePath":"consultation/20.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/20.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
