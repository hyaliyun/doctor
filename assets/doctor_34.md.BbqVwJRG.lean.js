We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.","output":"Guillain Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to hospitals has been dramatically restricted during the COVID 19 pandemic. As a result, the patients were unable to communicate with their families other than through virtual communication channels. A still significant number of patients, which do not have access to modern videoconference tools, were completely isolated. As a result, the University Hospitals of Geneva decided to implement a Visio conference system inside their patient app ecosystem to allow every patient to remain connected. This article presents the iterative development of the solution in order to respond to the specific timely constraint of the situations as well as its evaluation by the patients and caregivers. Two iterations of the tool have been developed. The first relied on an existing commercial platform whereas the second is a fully integrated solution in our patient app ecosystem. The very positive evaluation at the first stage by more than 300 patients, relatives and caregivers convinced us to invest additional effort to provide a fully integrated solution. The second version, evaluated by 16 patients, confirmed that the Visio reaches its objective of reducing isolation during hospitalization.

Several validated questionnaires were administered to measure quality of life, psychological symptoms and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) at the time of diagnosis and after 1 and 2 years. Ninety-three patients reached the 1-year follow-up (81.7% were females with a median age at diagnosis of 35 years), and 55 patients reached the 2-year follow-up. We observed a significant improvement in quality of life, anxiety and depression scores at 1 year after diagnosis, particularly in patients who complied with a GFD. The improvements among classical CeD patients were similar to those observed in nonclassical patients except for anxiety, which improved only in patients with a classical presentation at diagnosis. Age, sex and other disease factors did not affect the change in quality of life (QoL) or other mood disorders. Most of the improvements measured 1 year after diagnosis and 2 years after diagnosis were not significant.

Background/Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects on everyday life leading to stress and anxiety, which may be heightened in those undergoing cardiac surgery. Health impacts following a traumatic event may be apparent at one month but can also present after many months. PURPOSE: The aim of the CardiacCovid study was to explore the effect of the pandemic on recovery from cardiac surgery. We report the preliminary results from a single centre study in the UK during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients >18 years old undergoing any form of cardiac surgery between 23rd March 2020 (UK lockdown) to 4th July 2020 (lifting of most restrictions) were recruited to this prospective observational study. Those too unwell or unable to give consent/complete study questionnaires were excluded. Participants completed a Quality of Life (QoL) (EQ-5D), impact of event (IES-R), depression (CES-D) and health service use questionnaire at baseline, 1 week after hospital discharge, and 6 weeks after surgery. Questionnaires were completed electronically on the Amplitude platform or via post. Ethics approval (20/YH/0132) was obtained and the study was registered (Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT04366167). RESULTS: A total of 395 patients had surgery of which 298 (91.7%) were screened and 203 (68.1%) were enrolled to the study. Participants were mostly male (74.6%), with a mean age of 63 years, undergoing urgent/emergency (57.9%) CABG +/-valve (70.1%). Mean inpatient stay was 8.6 days and in-hospital mortality was 0.5%. No patients had Covid-19. The initial findings suggest a deterioration of QoL at 1 week post discharge with near restoration to baseline level at 6 weeks post-surgery. Mean scores for CES-D and IES-R remained within subclinical levels at all available time points. However, at 6 weeks, a proportion of patients reached levels for depression on the CES-D and had high IES-R scores indicating possible post-traumatic stress. CONCLUSION: We believe that this is the largest/only study exploring the impact of the pandemic on cardiac surgery recovery, including QoL, spanning the immediate recovery phase but will continue until 1 year. The findings so far show that recovery from cardiac surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic is similar to that reported prior to the pandemic (Cromhout et al 2018) and reinforces the need for psychosocial assessments to identify patients who may require additional support during the immediate recovery phase.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on recovery after heart surgery: preliminary findings from the CardiacCovid Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La dcouverte dun cluster autour dun cas dinfection  coronavirus Covid-19 dans une commune fran?aise a dclench la cration dune cellule de crise Une quipe dintervention a d? tre constitue 24h aprs cette dcouverte pour dpister les contacts dun enfant infect appartenant  ce cluster Celle ci tait compose dune quipe mdicale et paramdicale dinfectiologie, dun mdecin et dambulanciers du SAMU Lobjet de ce travail est de dcrire le r?le des paramdicaux lors de la prparation et de la ralisation du dpistage autour des cas Matriels et mthodes Il est dcrit laction du cadre infirmier et de lquipe infirmire lors de la cration dune quipe de dpistage en urgence autour dun cluster de coronavirus et la gestion de laccueil des cas possibles en hospitalisation Rsultats Lintervention ncessitait la mobilisation, en moins de 24h, dune quipe afin de dpister 100 enfants des coles frquentes par lenfant infect Une premire quipe comprenant mdecins, infirmiers, cadres infirmiers et ambulanciers tait charge du dpistage dans la commune du cas La ractivit de lquipe paramdicale a t permise par limplication ds la dcouverte du cluster du cadre soignant du service Celui-ci a t impliqu dans la cellule de crise, puis sest dplac sur la commune concerne pour lorganisation et la ralisation des premiers prlvements du cluster Fort de cette exprience, le cadre a pu, 24h aprs, coordonner la prparation du matriel, le circuit des cas contacts et le protocole des rgles dhygine et de prlvements Sur la base du volontariat, 5 infirmires de lquipe dinfectiologie, un cadre et 2 infirmiers du SAMU ont particip  laction de terrain en plus du cadre dinfectiologie Ceci a permis la cration de 6 postes de prlvements en coopration avec les mdecins infectiologues Dans lhypothse dhospitalisation des cas possibles, il a t ncessaire dorganiser en parallle un cohorting ddi au coronavirus dans le service de maladies Infectieuses du centre hospitalier de rfrence Celui-ci a t coordonn par le cadre soignant avec les mdecins infectiologues rests en lien avec la cellule de crise Le transfert de la moiti des patients alors hospitaliss dans le service a t ralis Un protocole de libration de la totalit des lits du service a t rdig par anticipation Conclusion Cette exprience montre la capacit de mobilisation trs rapide dune quipe paramdicale pour mettre en place une intervention de dpistage dlocalise face  un risque pidmique La bonne gestion de la crise a t permise par lanticipation, la ractivit, lexprience et la comptence en hygine des acteurs paramdicaux","output":"R?le de linfirmire et du cadre infirmier lors de la mise en place urgente dune quipe de dpistage autour dun cluster de coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, a fatal disease emerged from Wuhan, a large city in the Chinese province of Hubei in December 2019.

Initial confirmation of the pandemic shows patient exposure to the Huanan seafood market. Bats might be a significant host for the spread of coronaviruses via an unknown intermediate host. The human-to-human transfer has become a significant concern due to one of the significant reasons that is asymptomatic carriers or silent spreaders. No data is obtained regarding prophylactic treatment for COVID-19, although many clinical trials are underway. CONCLUSION: The most effective weapon is prevention and precaution to avoid the spread of the pandemic. In this current review, we outline pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, ongoing clinical trials, prevention, and precautions. We have also highlighted the impact of pandemic worldwide and challenges that can help to overcome the fatal disease in the future.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic crisisa complete outline of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: P.1 lineage (Gamma) was first described in the State of Amazonas, northern Brazil, in the end of 2020, and has emerged as a very important variant of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. P.1 has been linked to increased infectivity, higher mortality and immune evasion, leading to reinfections and potentially reduced efficacy of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Methods: The samples of 276 patients from the State of Amazonas were sent to a central referral laboratory for sequencing by gold standard techniques, through Illumina MiSeq platform. Both global and regional phylogenetic analyses of the successfully sequenced genomes were conducted through maximum likelihood method. Multiple alignments were obtained including previously obtained unique human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The evolutionary histories of spike and non-structural proteins from ORF1a of northern genomes were described and their molecular evolution was analyzed for detection of positive (FUBAR, FEL, and MEME) and negative (FEL and SLAC) selective pressures. To further evaluate the possible pathways of evolution leading to the emergence of P.1, we performed specific analysis for copy-choice recombination events. A global phylogenomic analysis with subsampled P.1 and B.1.1.28 genomes was applied to evaluate the relationship among samples. Results: Forty-four samples from the State of Amazonas were successfully sequenced and confirmed as P.1 (Gamma) lineage. In addition to previously described P.1 characteristic mutations, we find evidence of continuous diversification of SARS-CoV-2, as rare and previously unseen P.1 mutations were detected in spike and non-structural protein from ORF1a. No evidence of recombination was found. Several sites were demonstrated to be under positive and negative selection, with various mutations identified mostly in P.1 lineage. According to the Pango assignment, phylogenomic analyses indicate all samples as belonging to the P.1 lineage. Conclusion: P.1 has shown continuous evolution after its emergence. The lack of clear evidence for recombination and the positive selection demonstrated for several sites suggest that this lineage emergence resulted mainly from strong evolutionary forces and progressive accumulation of a favorable signature set of mutations.","output":"Comparative genomics and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 P.1 (Gamma) Variant of Concern (VOC) from Amazonas, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During epidemics and pandemics healthcare personnel (HCP) are on the front line of disease containment and mitigation. Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), serve an important role in minimizing HCP risks and are in high demand during public health emergencies. Because PPE demand can exceed supply, various public health strategies have been developed to reduce the rate of PPE consumption as supply dwindles. Extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs are strategies advocated by many governmental agencies used to increase the number of times a device can be used. Increased use of respirators designed for reuse-such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air-purifying respirators- is another option designed to reduce the continuous need for new devices as the daily need for respirator use increases. Together, these strategies are designed to reduce the number of PPE units that must be discarded daily and, therefore, extend the longevity of available supply. The purpose of this paper is to theoretically estimate the impact of extended use and limited reuse strategies for N95 FFRs and the increased use of reusable respirator options on PPE consumed. The results suggest that a considerable reduction in PPE consumption would result from extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs and the increased use of respirators designed for reuse; however, the practical benefits must be balanced with the risks and economic costs. In addition, extended use and reuse strategies must be accompanied by proper procedures to reduce risk. The study is designed to support epidemic and pandemic PPE supply and demand planning efforts.","output":"Planning for Epidemics and Pandemics: Assessing the Potential Impact of Extended Use and Reuse Strategies on Respirator Usage Rates to Support Supply-and-Demand Planning Efforts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies using data accrued from global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts have demonstrated that breakthrough infections are correlated with levels of neutralizing antibodies. The decrease in neutralizing antibody titers of vaccinated individuals over time, combined with the emergence of more infectious variants of concern has resulted in waning vaccine efficacy against infection and a rise in breakthrough infections. Here we use a combination of neutralizing antibody measurements determined by a high throughput surrogate viral neutralization test (sVNT) together with published data from vaccine clinical trials and comparative plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) between SARS-CoV-2 variants to develop a model for vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic infection. Vaccine efficacy estimates using this model show good concordance with real world data from the US and Israel. Our work demonstrates that appropriately calibrated neutralizing antibody measurements determined by high throughput sVNT can be used to provide a semi-quantitative estimate of protection against infection. Given the highly variable antibody levels among the vaccinated population, this model may be of use in identification of individuals with an elevated risk of breakthrough infections.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy from Neutralizing Antibody Levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To contribute to the understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, this study evaluated the correlations of the frequencies of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations due to COVID-19, and deaths due to COVID-19 with social isolation indices and outpatient prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. METHODS: This was an analytical, observational, retrospective study based on secondary data that were obtained from public Brazilian databases and covered the period from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 10-44). Data on weekly COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths due COVID-19, sales of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and social isolation indices were obtained. Associations between the variables were tested using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: In all regions of Santa Catarina, there were almost simultaneous peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in weeks 28-31, followed by a sudden decrease. Social isolation indices were not associated with the outcomes; sales of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were significant predictors of all outcomes (p < 0.001). COVID-19 prevalence was significantly different across the state regions when COVID-19 cases started to decline (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Collective immunity and social isolation may not have been the only causes for the reduction of the COVID-19 pandemic observed in Santa Catarina. The results of this study were compatible with the hypothesis that early treatment of COVID-19 cases with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine may contribute to reducing the transmissibility of COVID-19 in the population. This hypothesis needs to be further tested in future studies.","output":"Correlation of the rise and fall in COVID-19 cases with the social isolation index and early outpatient treatment with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil: A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the field of science and technology, the graph theory has offered several approaches to articulate any situation or concept.

Guidelines recommend preoperative intravenous antimicrobial prophylaxis with aerobic and anaerobic coverage to reduce SSI risk. Cephalosporin based prophylaxis (CBP) regimens are recommended as first-line prophylaxis, and non-cephalosporin based are recommended as alternative prophylaxis (AP). We evaluate the efficacy of CBP versus AP in preventing surgical site infections in colorectal surgery patients. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of studies published between 2005 and 2020 in MEDLINE and Web of Science. Studies were excluded if intravenous antimicrobial prophylaxis was not administered, or if oral and intravenous prophylaxis were routinely co-administered. Heterogeneity was reported using the Q-statistic and I2-statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger test for small study effects. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p < 0.05. Results 11 studies met inclusion criteria. AP was not associated with increased SSI risk at 30 days compared to CBP (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91, 1.13; OR < 1 favors AP). There was no effect size variability in subgroup analysis comparing higher-to lower-quality studies (I2 = 99%, P = 0.17).

METHODS: All patients scheduled for elective urological procedures for malignant or benign diseases at two high-volume Centres were administered a questionnaire, through structured telephone interviews, between 24(th) and 27(th) April 2020. The questionnaire included three questions: 1) In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, would you defer the planned surgical intervention? 2) If yes, when would you be willing to undergo surgery? 3) What do you consider potentially more harmful for your health: the risk of contracting COVID-19 during hospitalization or the potential consequences of delaying surgical treatment? RESULTS: Overall, 332 patients were included (51.5% and 48.5% in the oncology and benign groups, respectively). Of these, 47.9% patients would have deferred the planned intervention (33.3% vs 63.4%; p<0.001), while the proportion of patients who would have preferred to delay surgery for more than six months was comparable between the groups (87% vs 80%). These answers were influenced by patient age and ASA score (in the Oncology group) and by the underlying urological condition (in the benign group). Finally, 182 (54.8%) patients considered the risk of COVID-19 potentially more harmful than the risk of delaying surgery (37% vs 73%; p<0.001). This answer was driven by patient age and the underlying disease in both groups.

Hygienic precautions have been recommended, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. However, some people in society have not considered and ignored these health issues. This study aims to identify the sociological perceptions of people who ignore the COVID-19 warning. A qualitative study was carried out from May to July 2020. The interviewees were purposefully selected from people in Isfahan who avoided paying attention to the COVID-19 warnings. The saturation point was reached in 20 semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the transcribed documents using MAXQDA software (version 12). RESULTS: The results show 2 themes and 4 sub-themes related to the sociological perception of people who ignore the COVID-19 warning. The themes and sub-themes include: feelings of social anomie (disruption and social unrest, social distrust), unmet social relationship needs (intention to maintain social participation, Feeling of reduced social support).

In this study, we used serum collected from patients undergoing one-lung ventilation (OLV) to establish an in vitro acute lung injury (ALI) model to explore the potential protective mechanism of curcumin on ALI. Our study provides a new reference for the prevention and treatment of ALI induced by OLV. METHODS: A549 cells were treated with 20% serum from patients undergoing OLV to establish an in vitro ALI model. Curcumin, at a dose of 40 g/ml, was administered two hours prior to this model. The levels of inflammation and oxidative stress markers were observed by Western blot, qRTCPCR, ELISA and reactive oxygen species assay. Additionally, the expression of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) and proteins involved in the NF-B signaling pathway was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty percent of serum collected from patients undergoing OLV downregulated the expression of Prdx6, leading to the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway, which was associated with the subsequent overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Pretreatment with curcumin restored Prdx6 downregulation and inhibited NF-B pathway activation by suppressing the nuclear translocation of P65, eventually reducing inflammation and oxidative stress damage in A549 cells.

In this study, a six-item self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate self-reported awake and sleep bruxism. Results: In the present study, bruxism was not statistically significantly correlated with self-reported perceived stress based on PSS-10 (rank correlation coefficient was rho (145) = 0.080, p < 0.341). There was no statistically significant difference within the study group between genders in the frequency of low, moderate, and high PSS-10 results (U = 2329.5, p = 0.339). The analysis also showed no statistically significant difference between males and females regarding bruxism score (U = 2381.5, p = 0.434). Conclusions: Results do not confirm the findings of a positive association between bruxism and perceived stress. Within the limitations of this study, the data suggest that the relationship between perceived stress and the expression of bruxism is more complex. Given the results of the current research, this issue requires further investigation.","output":"Assessing the Influence of Increased Stress on Bruxism during the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are the major causes for the modulation of ongoing COVID-19 infection. Currently, the D614G substitution in the spike protein has become dominant worldwide. It is associated with higher infectivity than the ancestral (D614)variant. We demonstrate using Gaussian network model-based normal mode analysis that the D614G substitution occurs at the hinge region that facilitates domain-domain motions between receptor binding domain and S2 region of the spike protein. Computer-aided mutagenesis and inter-residue energy calculations reveal that contacts involving D614 are energetically frustrated. However, contacts involving G614 are energetically favourable, implying the substitution strengthens residue contacts that are formed within as well as between protomers. We also find that the free energy difference (G) between two variants is -2.6 kcal/mol for closed and -2.0 kcal/mol for 1-RBD up conformation. Thus, the thermodynamic stability has increased upon D614G substitution. Whereas the reverse mutation in spike protein structures having G614 substitution has resulted in the free energy differences of 6.6 kcal/mol and 6.3 kcal/mol for closed and 1-RBD up conformations, respectively, indicating that the overall thermodynamic stability has decreased. These results suggest that the D614G substitution modulates the flexibility of spike protein and confers enhanced thermodynamic stability irrespective of conformational states. This data concurs with the known information demonstrating increased availability of the functional form of spikeprotein trimer upon D614G substitution.","output":"D614G substitution at the hinge region enhances the stability of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which is a significant threat to global public health. The rapid spread of COVID-19 necessitates the development of cost-effective technology platforms for the production of vaccines, drugs, and protein reagents for appropriate disease diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explored the possibility of producing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and an anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibody (mAb) CR3022 in Nicotiana benthamiana. Both RBD and mAb CR3022 were transiently produced with the highest expression level of 8 g/g and 130 g/g leaf fresh weight respectively at 3 days post-infiltration. The plant-produced RBD exhibited specific binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, the plant-produced mAb CR3022 binds to SARS-CoV-2, but fails to neutralize the virus in vitro. This is the first report showing the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and mAb CR3022 in plants. Overall these findings provide a proof-of-concept for using plants as an expression system for the production of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies or similar other diagnostic reagents against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly, especially during epidemic or pandemic situation.","output":"Rapid production of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike specific monoclonal antibody CR3022 in Nicotiana benthamiana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this review is to synthesize existing literature to analyze the influence of the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), including the COVID-19 pandemic, and toxic stress on child development and lifelong health outcomes of Latinx children in the USA, utilizing the ACE framework.

Objective Our objective was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on drug purchases overall, by class, and for specific countries. Methods Cross-sectional time-series analysis of country-level drug purchase data from August 2014-August 2020 from IQVIA MIDAS. Standardized units per 100 population and percent increase in units purchased was assessed from 68 countries/jurisdictions in March 2020 (when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic). Analyses were compared by United Nations development status and drug class. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models tested the significance of changes in purchasing trends. Results Before COVID-19, standardized medication units per 100 population ranged from 3990-4760 monthly. In March 2020, there was a global 15% increase in units of drugs purchased to 5309.3 units per 100 population compared to the previous year; the increase was greater in developed countries (18.5%; p<0.001) than developing countries (12.8%; p<0.0001). After the increase in March 2020, there was a correction in the global purchase rate decreasing by 4.7% (April-August 2020 rate: 21,334.6/100 population; p<0.001). Globally, we observed high purchasing rates and large changes for respiratory medicines such as inhalers and systemic adrenergics (March 2020 rate: 892.7/100 population; change from 2019: 28.5%; p<0.001). Purchases for topical dermatologic products also increased substantially (42.2%), although at lower absolute rates (610.0/100 population in March 2020; p<0.0001). Interestingly, purchases for systemic anti-infectives (including antivirals) increased in developing countries (11.3%; p<0.001), but decreased in developed countries (1.0%; p=0.06). Conclusion We observed evidence of global drug stockpiling in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among developed countries.

However, there is not a systematic evaluation of all aspects of this association. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between all underlying comorbidities in COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: Electronic literature search was performed via scientific search engines. After the removal of duplicates and selection of articles of interest, 28 studies were included. A fixed-effects model was used; however, if heterogeneity was high (I(2) > 50%) a random-effects model was applied to combine the data. RESULTS: A total of 6,270 individuals were assessed (1,615 severe and 4,655 non-severe patients). The median age was 63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49C74) and 47 (95% CI: 19C63) years in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Moreover, about 41% of patients had comorbidities. Severity was higher in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease: OR 4.85 (95% CI: 3.11C7.57). The odds of being in a severe group increase by 4.81 (95% CI: 3.43C6.74) for a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Data on number of vaccinated patients and of patients with a breakthrough infection were retrospectively collected in 27 Italian MS centers. We estimated the rate of breakthrough infections and of infection requiring hospitalization per DMT. Findings. 19641 vaccinated pwMS were included in the database. After a median follow-up of 8 months, we observed 137 breakthrough infections.

Colorados law went into effect on January 1, 2020, after significant controversy and concern over potential misuse of the law to confiscate weapons; many (n = 37 of 64) counties declared themselves 2nd Amendment (2A) sanctuaries and said they would not enforce the law. Here, reviewed the patterns of use of the law during its first year. METHODS: We obtained all court records for ERPO petitions filed between January 1 and December 31, 2020. Data elements were abstracted by trained staff using a standardized guide. We calculated the proportion of petitions that were approved or denied/dismissed, identified cases of obvious misuse, and examined patterns by 2A county status. FINDING AND RESULTS: In 2020, 109 ERPO petitions were filed in Colorado; of these, 61 were granted for a temporary ERPO and 49 for a full (year-long) ERPO. Most petitions filed by law enforcement officers were granted (85%), compared to only 15% of petitions filed by family or household members. Of the 37 2A sanctuary counties, 24% had at least one petition filed, versus 48% of non-2A sanctuary counties. Across the 2A counties, there were 1.52 ERPOs filed per 100,000 population, compared to 2.05 ERPOs filed per 100,000 in non-2A counties. There were 4 cases of obvious law misuse; none of those petitions resulted in an ERPO or firearm confiscation. CONCLUSION: State-level studies suggest ERPOs may prevent firearm injuries. Robust implementation, however, is critical for maximal effect. Understanding ERPO experiences and challenges can inform policy creation and enaction in other states, including identifying how best to address concerns and facilitate evaluation.","output":"Colorados first year of extreme risk protection orders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus is emerging as an epidemic worldwide, and the incidence and prevalence of diabetes have drastically changed in China over the past 30 years, but data on its mortality rate are scarce. This study aimed to analyze the time trends of mortality rates among patients with diabetes in the rural and urban population in China between 1987 and 2019. METHODS: The research data come from Chinas annual report on national health statistics and the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbook. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated by using the direct method based on the World Standard Population from the WHO. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to estimate the annual percent change and average annual percentage changes of mortality rates of diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: An overall trend for increment in diabetes mortality was observed. The crude mortality rates and age-standardized mortality rates of diabetes for urban and rural residents in China showed a significant increasing trend between 1987 and 2019. Mortality due to diabetes in urban areas has been higher than in rural areas for 30 years. However, due to the rapid increase of rural diabetes mortality in the past decade, the gap between the two gradually narrowed. The age-standardized mortality rates of diabetes increased by about 38.5% in urban areas and 254.9% in rural areas over the whole study period. In addition, the age-standardized mortality rate of females with diabetes was higher than that of males, but this pattern began to change in urban areas in 2012. Finally, the age-standardized mortality rates in the elderly population in China are higher with a faster growth rate, especially in rural areas. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of diabetes is on the rise in China. The rapid growth of the mortality rate of diabetes in rural areas leads to the reduction of the urbanCrural gap. Male mortality rates in urban areas have surpassed those of women. At the same time, the mortality rate of diabetes showed obvious elder-group orientation. As Chinas population ages, the burden of death and disability caused by diabetes and its complications will continue to increase. These results indicate that diabetes has become a significant public health problem in China. Such an effect increases the demand for strategies aimed at the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus. In addition to the prevention and intervention of diabetes in high-risk groups, it is also necessary to establish diabetes screening networks to identify patients with mild symptoms. Early detection and timely intervention can effectively reduce the incidence and mortality of diabetes.","output":"Trends in Diabetes Mortality in Urban and Rural China, 1987C2019: A Joinpoint Regression Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization Call to Eliminate Cervical Cancer resonates in cities like Manaus, Brazil, where the burden is among the worlds highest. Manaus has offered free cytology-based screening since 1990 and HPV immunization since 2013, but the public system is constrained by many challenges and performance is not well-defined. We obtained cervical cancer prevention activities within Manaus public health records for 2019 to evaluate immunization and screening coverage, screening by region and neighborhood, and the annual Pink October screening campaign. We estimated that among girls and boys age 14C18, 85.9% and 64.9% had 1+ doses of HPV vaccine, higher than rates for age 9C13 (73.4% and 43.3%, respectively). Of the 90,209 cytology tests performed, 24.9% were outside the target age and the remaining 72,230 corresponded to 40.1% of the target population (one-third of women age 25C64). The East zone had highest screening coverage (49.1%), highest high-grade cytology rate (2.5%) and lowest estimated cancers (38.1/100,000) compared with the South zone (32.9%, 1.8% and 48.5/100,000, respectively). Largest neighborhoods had fewer per capita screening locations, resulting in lower coverage. During October, some clinics successfully achieved higher screening volumes and high-grade cytology rates (up to 15.4%). Although we found evidence of some follow-up within 10 months post-screening for 51/70 women (72.9%) with high-grade or worse cytology, only 18 had complete work-up confirmed. Manaus has successfully initiated HPV vaccination, forecasting substantial cervical cancer reductions by 2050. With concerted efforts during campaigns, some clinics improved screening coverage and reached high-risk women. Screening campaigns in community locations in high-risk neighborhoods using self-collected HPV testing can achieve widespread coverage. Simplifying triage and treatment with fewer visits closer to communities would greatly improve follow-up and program effectiveness.

Thus, there is increasing interest in metabolic and lipoprotein signatures of the disease, and early analyses have demonstrated a metabolic pattern typical for atherosclerotic and hepatic damage in COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unclear whether this is specific for COVID-19 and whether the observed signature is caused by the disease or rather represents an underlying risk factor. To answer this question, we have analyzed 482 serum samples using nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics, including longitudinally collected samples from 12 COVID-19 and 20 cardiogenic shock intensive care patients, samples from 18 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody-positive individuals, and single time point samples from 58 healthy controls. COVID-19 patients showed a distinct metabolic serum profile, including changes typical for severe dyslipidemia and a deeply altered metabolic status compared with healthy controls. Specifically, very-low-density lipoprotein and intermediate-density lipoprotein particles and associated apolipoprotein B and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly increased, whereas cholesterol and apolipoprotein A2 were decreased. Moreover, a similarly perturbed profile was apparent when compared with other patients with cardiogenic shock who are in the intensive care unit when looking at a 1-week time course, highlighting close links between COVID-19 and lipid metabolism. The metabolic profile of COVID-19 patients distinguishes those from healthy controls and also from patients with cardiogenic shock. In contrast, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals without acute COVID-19 did not show a significantly perturbed metabolic profile compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls, but SARS-CoV-2 antibody-titers correlated significantly with metabolic parameters, including levels of glycine, ApoA2, and small-sized low- and high-density lipoprotein subfractions. Our data suggest that COVID-19 is associated with dyslipidemia, which is not observed in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals who have not developed severe courses of the disease. This suggests that lipoprotein profiles may represent a confounding risk factor for COVID-19 with potential for patient stratification.","output":"Metabolic and Lipidomic Markers Differentiate COVID-19 From Non-Hospitalized and Other Intensive Care Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, mortality, stage, and recovery of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients and further analyze the effect of patient demographics and comorbidities on AKI incidence. STUDY DESIGN: Our study looked at 1545 charts of patients over 18 years old who presented to BronxCare Hospital in NY with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Using the KDIGO criteria, any patient presenting with a creatinine of 1.5 times the baseline or that had an increase in creatinine of 0.3mg/dL in 48 hours was diagnosed with AKI. Pregnant patients, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and patients with a history of renal transplant were excluded. RESULTS: The incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 39% (608), and the mortality rate was 58.2% (354). Of the 254 survivors, 74.8% recovered. Moreover, 42.6% (259) of patients with AKI were admitted to the ICU. Twenty-six of our patients received hemodialysis during admission. There was a statistically significant association between AKI and age, race, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hepatitis C (HCV), congestive heart failure (CHF), CKD, patient outcome, and days spent in the hospital.

This study investigates the effects that soil type, temperature, moisture content, time, and loading have on DAS performance. Impact testing was performed along a buried fiber optic array for over one year to induce a DAS response, which was evaluated using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The results indicate that portions of the array in gravel consistently out-perform portions of the array in other soil types. Neither soil moisture nor temperature appear to have a significant effect on SNR. An increase in ground surface load was observed to increase SNR. A significant change in performance occurred while testing paused from March 2020 to August 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The observed changes highlight how DAS could be used for infrastructure monitoring, where such changes could possibly prompt a localized site inspection. Performance of a decade-old portion of the DAS array remained consistent and strong, suggesting that DAS has long-term viability.","output":"Geotechnical Effects on Fiber Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To adapt an existing virtual family-based mental health intervention learning platform (I-InTERACT-North), using participatory action research design, to meet the needs of parents and children with congenital, neonatal, and neurodevelopmental conditions that impact development.

As such, detailed characterization of antibody-antigen binding provides important information to guide development. Due to the time and expense required, high-resolution structural characterization techniques are typically used sparingly and late in a development process. Here, we show that antibody-antigen binding can be characterized early in a process for whole panels of antibodies by combining experimental and computational analyses of competition between monoclonal antibodies for binding to an antigen. Experimental \\"epitope binning\\" of monoclonal antibodies uses high-throughput surface plasmon resonance to reveal which antibodies compete, while a new complementary computational analysis that we call \\"dock binning\\" evaluates antibody-antigen docking models to identify why and where they might compete, in terms of possible binding sites on the antigen. Experimental and computational characterization of the identified antigenic hotspots then enables the refinement of the competitors and their associated epitope binding regions on the antigen. While not performed at atomic resolution, this approach allows for the group-level identification of functionally related monoclonal antibodies (i.e., communities) and identification of their general binding regions on the antigen. By leveraging extensive epitope characterization data that can be readily generated both experimentally and computationally, researchers can gain broad insights into the basis for antibody-antigen recognition in wide-ranging vaccine and immunotherapy discovery and development programs.","output":"Characterizing Epitope Binding Regions of Entire Antibody Panels by Combining Experimental and Computational Analysis of Antibody: Antigen Binding Competition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hepatitis E (HEV) is an emerging cause of viral hepatitis worldwide.

In Israel, chronic HEV infection has not yet been reported, although HEV seroprevalence in humans is ~10%. Camels and swine are >65% seropositive. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of HEV from local camels and swine. Methods: Sera from camels (n = 142), feces from swine (n = 18) and blood from patients suspected of hepatitis E (n = 101) were collected during 2017C2020 and used to detect and characterize HEV sequences. Results: HEV-3 isolated from local swine and the camel-derived HEV-7 sequence were highly similar to HEV-3f and HEV-7 sequences (88.2% and 86.4%, respectively) related to viral hepatitis. The deduced amino acid sequences of both isolates were also highly conserved (>98%). Two patients were HEV-RNA positive; acute HEV-1 infection could be confirmed in one of them.

METHODS: Participants were 273 [M (SD) age = 22 (2.1) years, 55% female, 32% from minoritized groups] EA completed an online survey of adherence to 11 preventative health behaviors recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during summer 2020. Participants rated adherence via a visual analog scale. Participants also reported demographic information and completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA). RESULTS: Median levels of adherence to preventative recommendations ranged from 66% to 100%. Highest adherence levels (Mdn > 90%) were reported for quarantining if exposed to COVID-19; covering mouth when sneezing; avoiding the elderly/those at high risk; and avoiding large gatherings. Median adherence was <80% for mask wearing; maintaining a 6-foot distance; avoiding in-person visits with romantic partners or friends; and disinfecting surfaces. Female gender was the only variable significantly associated with overall adherence, and it explained 4% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Following guidelines related to social distancing practices may be particularly challenging for EA, possibly because of unique developmental needs of this group, and males may be at greater risk for non-adherence to CDC recommendations.

Travel restrictions due to the current COVID-19 pandemic have limited the in-person availability of technical support staff. To overcome these limitations, we explored the feasibility of a trans-atlantic remote technical support for EAM, with an internet-based communication platform, for complex electrophysiological ablation procedures.

Thus, this study aims to assess hygiene practices in society by using a community-based survey. A cross-sectional study using survey monkey was conducted from December 2019 to February 2020. The Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants and exploratory factor analysis was applied to scrutinize the construct validity of the measurement. We used the Tobit regression model to assess the association. Hygiene in a high-risk environment and hygiene in the social and educational environment were two main factors after applying the EFA method. Participants grade community sanitation quite low (around 6 out of 10). Furthermore, the mean score of hygiene practice at a local level in a high-risk environment was slightly low at 6.0. The score of sanitation in the Central region (5.3) was quite low compared to the North (5.8) and the South (6.2). The most high-risk environment was construction, industrial zone and food safety. Moreover, younger respondents were more likely to report poorer hygiene practices in high-risk environments (Coefficient = -1.67; 95% CI = -3.03; -0.32) and social and educational environment (Coefficient = -1.29; 95% CI = -2.54; -0.04).

Here we report some impacts that have been studied using local surveys and qualitative observations in Ecuador at the popular beaches and ports of Salinas, Manta, and Galapagos. Satellite data support this information. Online surveys were carried out at critical moments of the pandemic: May (15th) and just after when measures were relaxed a little, but within lockdown in July (21st) 2020. Respondents were asked to compare conditions before and during the pandemic lockdown. Most (97-99 %) suggested that beaches had significantly improved from visual observations during confinement. On a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), the beaches of Salinas and Manta respectively were rated 2.2 and 2.8 (less than acceptable) before quarantine, and 4.5 and 4.3 after;results from the second survey (after 18 weeks of restrictions) were much the same. Replies from Galapagos showed a similar trend but with less marked differences. In addition to the beaches having less plastic and garbage, more fish, and large marine organisms, including humpback whales, bottlenose dolphins, and manta-ray were observed near to shore. At Galapagos beaches, turtles, sea lions, and sharks were observed many more times than pre COVID.

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare outcomes of Cortiment vs Prednisolone treatment for UC. METHODS: Hospital based prescriptions from of 3 UK IBD units were extracted from computerized pharmacy records for the time periods between 1/3/2019 C 30/6/2019 and 1/3/2020 C 30/6/2020. All adult outpatients treated with oral steroids for a flare of UC were included. Baseline data included age, sex, phenotype, IBD medications, symptoms and changes to medication at time of steroid prescription. Follow up data included need for hospital admission for acute severe ulcerative colitis, symptoms at 4 weeks and end of treatment, need for rescue Prednisolone (Cortiment group only). Primary outcome was symptomatic improvement at 4 weeks. RESULTS: The 2019 (94 patients) and 2020 (127 patients) cohorts did not differ significantly with regards to age, sex, phenotype and baseline characteristics. The proportion of Cortiment prescriptions rose significantly from 24.5% in 2019 to 70.1% in 2020 (p<0.001). At week 4 of treatment there were statistically significant differences in mean bowel frequency (3.49 in 2019 vs 5.85 in 2020, p=0.001), rectal bleeding <50% (89.7% of patients in 2019 vs 73.1% in 2020, p=0.039) and physician global assessment (39.2% of patients in remission in 2019 compared to 19.8% in 2020, p=0.045).There was no significant difference in hospital admissions, rectal bleeding and physician global assessment at end of treatment. Patients prescribed Cortiment in 2019 had similar baseline characteristics to those prescribed Cortiment in 2020. Mean bowel frequency at four weeks was significantly higher in 2020 (6.18) compared to 2019 (3.69, p=0.034), but rectal bleeding (p=0.388) and physician global assessment at week four did not differ between 2019 and 2020 (p=0.422).

Moreover, accompanying and underlying lung abnormalities may interfere with the CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The diseases that COVID-19 pneumonia may mimic can be broadly classified as infectious or non-infectious diseases (pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, neoplasms, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary infarction, interstitial lung diseases, and aspiration pneumonia). We summarize the imaging findings of COVID-19 and the aforementioned lung pathologies that COVID-19 pneumonia may mimic. We also discuss the features that may aid in the differential diagnosis, as the disease continues to spread and will be one of our main differential diagnoses some time more.","output":"COVID-19 pneumonia: the great radiological mimicker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 creates an opportunity for science classrooms to relate content about viruses to students personal experiences with the pandemic. Previous researchers have shown that students are interested in crisis situations like disease outbreaks; however, they primarily acquire information about these events through internet sources which are often biased. We argue that it is important to understand student interest, concerns, and information-seeking behaviors related to COVID-19 to support science classroom learning and engagement about the virus and other potential outbreaks. We surveyed 224 high school students and analyzed their responses to six open-ended questions. We found that students expressed the most interest in topics related to the origin of COVID-19 and vaccines. Their greatest concerns included contracting the virus or someone they know contracting the virus and vaccine distribution. Of our sample, only 6.7% reported using their teachers as their source of COVID-19 information. Science classrooms have the potential to pique students situational interest by discussing COVID-19 topics that are important to students, which can increase their academic performance, content knowledge, attention, and engagement in learning about viruses. Moreover, classroom instruction about COVID-19 by teachers has shown to alleviate students stress and anxiety. We provide key areas of student interest about COVID-19 to help educators address students questions and improve curricular resources on viral pandemics.","output":"Student interest, concerns, and information-seeking behaviors related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked disorder related to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. In Poland, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD is offered by the National Health Fund only at selected hospital infusion centers. Patients with FB are considered at a high risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Some patients omitted infusions due to fear of infection or outbreaks in hospitals. Lack of alternative infusion sites hampered the situation. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on FD patients, especially their fears and expectations, the Polish FD Collaborative Group collaborated on a survey project. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September and November 2020, we distributed a customized survey exploring expectations and fears among FD subjects. RESULTS: Fifty-five individuals (35 receiving ongoing ERT) from different FD centers completed the study. The median age was 40 years [IQR 25; 50], and gender distribution was almost equal (27 F; 28 M). One-fourth of FD patients reported severe disability limiting transportation for infusions that, in the opinion of the other 25% of responders, consumed >4 h. Forty-four (80%) of all would prefer home infusions performed by a nurse (n = 37, 67.3%) or by a trained non-medical person (n = 7, 12.7%), while 8 (14.5%) patients would choose a local hospital. As expected, transportation time (in one direction) was longer in those preferring home infusions (89.4 63 vs 36.2 67 min; p = 0.02). Also, those with more severe FD manifestation would prefer home infusions to treatment in FD centers (p = 0.03). The vast majority of respondents (n = 46; 83%) would not change their preferences after pandemic termination. CONCLUSIONS: To maintain ERT, FD patients prefer home infusions or those given in the nearest hospital, especially during a pandemic.","output":"Is home-based therapy in Fabry disease the answer to compelling patients' needs during the COVID-19 pandemic?

This study presents changes in CO, NO(2), O(3), SO(2), PM(10), and PM(2.5) based on their anomalies during the COVID-19 partial (Phase 2) and total (Phase 3) lockdowns in Mexico City (MCMA). To minimise the impact of the air pollutant long-term trends, pollutant anomalies were calculated using as baseline truncated Fourier series, fitted with data from 2016 to 2019, and then compared with those from the lockdown. Additionally, days with stagnant conditions and heavy rain were excluded to reduce the impact of extreme weather changes. Satellite observations for NO(2) and CO were used to contrast the ground-based derived results. During the lockdown Phase 2, only NO(2) exhibited significant decreases (p < 0.05) of between 10 and 23% due to reductions in motor vehicle emissions. By contrast, O(3) increased (p < 0.05) between 16 and 40% at the same sites where NO(2) decreased. During Phase 3, significant decreases (p < 0.05) were observed for NO(2) (43%), PM(10) (20%), and PM(2.5) (32%) in response to the total lockdown. Although O(3) concentrations were lower in Phase 3 than during Phase 2, those did not decrease (p < 0.05) from the baseline at any site despite the total lockdown. SO(2) decreased only during Phase 3 in a near-road environment. Satellite observations confirmed that NO(2) decreased and CO stabilised during the total lockdown. Air pollutant changes during the lockdown could be overestimated between 2 and 10-fold without accounting for the influences of meteorology and long-term trends in pollutant concentrations. Air quality improved significantly during the lockdown driven by reduced NO(2) and PM(2.5) emissions despite increases in O(3), resulting in health benefits for the MCMA population. A health assessment conducted suggested that around 588 deaths related to air pollution exposure were averted during the lockdown. Our results show that to reduce O(3) within the MCMA, policies must focus on reducing VOCs emissions from non-mobile sources. The measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns provide valuable information to reduce air pollution through a range of abatement strategies for emissions other than from motor vehicles.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Quality and Resulting Public Health Benefits in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interleukin-(IL-)17 family of cytokines is composed of six members named IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, and IL-17F. IL-17A is the prototype of this family, and it was the first to be discovered and targeted in the clinic. IL-17A is essential for modulating the interplay between commensal microbes and epithelial cells at our borders (i.e., skin and mucosae), and yet, for protecting us from microbial invaders, thus preserving mucosal and skin integrity. Interactions between the microbiota and cells producing IL-17A have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of immune mediated inflammatory diseases and cancer. While interactions between microbiota and IL-17B-to-F have only partially been investigated, they are by no means less relevant. The cellular source of IL-17B-to-F, their main targets, and their function in homeostasis and disease distinguish IL-17B-to-F from IL-17A. Here, we intentionally overlook IL-17A, and we focus instead on the role of the other cytokines of the IL-17 family in the interplay between microbiota and epithelial cells that may contribute to cancer pathogenesis and immune surveillance.

By pulse-chase analysis of radiolabeled protein condensation in beta-cells, the formation of insoluble aggregates of regulated secretory protein lags behind the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Condensation occurs within immature granules (IGs), accounting for passive protein sorting as demonstrated by constitutive-like secretion of newly synthesized C- peptide in stoichiometric excess of insulin (Kuliawat, R., and P. Arvan. J. Cell Biol. 1992. 118:521-529). Experimental manipulation of condensation conditions in vivo reveals a direct relationship between sorting of regulated secretory protein and polymer assembly within IGs. By contrast, entry from the trans-Golgi network into IGs does not appear especially selective for regulated secretory proteins. Specifically, in normal islets, lysosomal enzyme precursors enter the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway with comparable efficiency to that of proinsulin. However, within 2 h after synthesis (the same period during which proinsulin processing occurs), newly synthesized hydrolases are fairly efficiently relocated out of the stimulus- dependent pathway. In tunicamycin-treated islets, while entry of new lysosomal enzymes into the regulated secretory pathway continues unperturbed, exit of nonglycosylated hydrolases from this pathway does not occur. Consequently, the ultimate targeting of nonglycosylated hydrolases in beta-cells is to storage granules rather than lysosomes. These results implicate a post-Golgi mechanism for the active removal of lysosomal hydrolases away from condensed granule contents during the storage process for regulated secretory proteins.","output":"Distinct molecular mechanisms for protein sorting within immature secretory granules of pancreatic beta-cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an open debate on the impact of biologic drugs used in the treatment of psoriasis. In order to define whether patients under treatment with biologics suffer from increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, compared to psoriatic patients treated only with topical drugs, we designed an observational, monocentric prevalence study recording the personal and clinical data of psoriatic patients, with focus on the presentation of signs and symptoms related to COVID-19 in the period of time going from 1.1.2020 to 31.5.2020. A total of 180 patients were enrolled in two groups: 100 patients in the topical therapy group, and 80 patients in the biologic therapy group. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 infection and symptoms at a bivariable analysis with adjustment for confounders. In conclusion, psoriatic patients under treatment with biologics don't seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 compared to other psoriatic patients and we suggest not interrupting treatment with biologic drugs, even in areas suffering from active outbreaks of the disease.

PURPOSE Veterans prescribed oral antineoplastic therapies (OATs) by community providers outside the Veterans Health Administration (VA) may lack access to comprehensive medication management. To address this, our multidisciplinary team developed and implemented a pharmacist-led telehealth medication management program for veterans prescribed OATs by community providers. SUMMARY The program exclusively uses telehealth to connect veterans with a dedicated board-certified clinical oncology pharmacist who provides comprehensive medication management. The program is based on established pharmacy models found in the research literature. We developed a standard operating procedure, communication templates, patient education materials, and a suite of health information technology tools to help streamline pharmacy processes. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to design implementation strategies to promote the adoption of the program. In the first year, 64 veterans from 3 VA medical centers were enrolled in the program. The oncology clinical pharmacist performed 342 encounters and 101 interventions. The program saved an estimated $200,724 in medication-related costs. The veterans we surveyed reported high levels of satisfaction with the pharmacy services provided by the program. CONCLUSION The delivery of comprehensive medication management through telehealth is feasible from a healthcare system perspective and beneficial for patients. The board-certified oncology clinical pharmacist provided remote pharmacy services to Veterans across three sites in a large and rural service area for the VA. The program realized several benefits, including positive clinical outcomes, high levels of patient satisfaction, and cost savings on medication-related costs.","output":"Development and implementation of a pharmacist-led telehealth medication management program for veterans receiving oral antineoplastic therapies through the MISSION Act."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"a?COVID-19 related lockdown policies and stay at home strategy may lead to the overuse or excessive usage of smartphones.a?Excessive use of smartphones can potentially lead to gaming disorders and internet use disorders and eventually be considered to cause psychosocial crisis.a?Without proper initiative, problematic smartphone usage can turn into an emerging public health challenge to annihilate lives by perpetuating the socio-psychological problems.a?It will be a crucial step to monitor smartphone overuse and take necessary action to minimise the problem through protective policies and family support during and after this COVID 19 pandemic.","output":"Smartphone overuse: A hidden crisis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the large number of individuals infected and recovered from Covid-19, there is intense discussion about the quality and duration of the immunity elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the possibility of disease recurrence Here we report a case with strong clinical, epidemiological and laboratorial evidence of, not only reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, but also clinical recurrence of Covid-19","output":"Are SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and Covid-19 recurrence possible? a case report from Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic -, a global health crisis has come as a great challenge to even the most advanced healthcare systems around the world Pakistan has a poorly developed healthcare infrastructure to effectively cope with the pandemic In view of this, it was appropriate to anticipate that Pakistans state of preparedness might prove to be inadequate if and when the disease became rampant It was also important to note that countries which prepared preemptively for the crisis and responded timely were able to cope with it better than others This realization prompted a need for formulation of a strategy to manage the fallout expected from a high number of COVID-19 cases Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH & RC) is a research-based tertiary care center in a low resource-income country Having previous experience in devising strategic healthcare guidelines, we at SKMCH & RC created a comprehensive plan for the department of anesthesia and pain medicine, with the specific aim of improving our ability to deal with the ongoing crisis We believed that our plan might be applied across the region, where limited availability of resources is a common theme The plan of action was divided into three phases: planning, preparation and implementation A team of anesthetists was formed and tasked with performing a thorough review of international guidelines and literature on the subject The next step was to compile the findings and create tailored solutions for successful application in a resource-poor environment The report further explains the procurement and mobilization of necessary resources at the hospital level as warranted by the plan Lastly, the report shares knowledge on how the plan was practically implemented across operating rooms and intensive care units at SKMCH & RC It is hoped that this review will enable low-budget healthcare facilities to implement and benefit from our plan","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: Preparation of the department of anesthesiology and pain medicine in a tertiary care hospital of a low income country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is keeping the world on tenterhooks, the last few months have also led to a new wave of cybercrime.

This study aims to systematically review the hematologic autoimmune complications in these patients. METHOD: Data from three online databases including Medline (via PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science were searched on 19 December 2020, and after excluding duplicate, irrelevant and inappropriate records, eligible documents were identified. Afterwards, information such as patients' history, presentations, paraclinical data, treatment course and outcome were extracted from the records. RESULTS: A total of 58 documents were considered to be eligible for data extraction which described 94 patients with COVID-19 who developed hematologic autoimmune disorder in their course of infection. Of these patients with COVID-19, the most common hematologic autoimmune disorder was immune thrombocytopenic purpura (55 cases) followed by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (22 cases). Other hematologic autoimmune disorders include antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Evans syndrome and autoimmune neutropenia. CONCLUSION: The current study would help us to always consider an autoimmune etiology for cases with abnormal hematologic finding which further lead to an appropriate treatment of the patients, especially when the symptoms present in about 1-2 weeks after the first manifestation of the infection symptoms. Maybe, at least in this pandemic, it should be recommended to evaluate patients with unexpected and unexplained decrease in their hemoglobulin or platelet count for COVID-19.

Therefore, it is important to explore whether there is an explicit relationship between population migration and the number of confirmed cases for the control of the COVID-19 epidemic. This paper mainly explores the impact of population migration on early COVID-19 transmission, and establishes a predictive nonlinear mathematical model to predict the number of early cases. METHODS: Data of confirmed cases were sourced from the official website of the Municipal Health Committee, and the proportions of migration from Wuhan to other cities were sourced from the Baidu data platform. The data of confirmed cases and the migration proportions of 14 cities in Hubei Province were collected, the COVID-19 cases study period was determined as 10 days based on the third quartile of the interval of the incubation period, and a non-linear mathematical model was constructed to clarify the relationship between the migration proportion and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Finally, eight typical regions were selected to verify the accuracy of the model. RESULTS: The daily population migration rates and the growth curves of the number of confirmed cases in the 14 cities were basically consistent, and Pearsons correlation coefficient was 0.91. The specific mathematical expression of 14 regions is [Image: see text] . In each of the fourteen cities, The nonlinear exponential model structure is as follows:[Image: see text] . It was found that the R(2) values of the fitted mathematical model were greater than 0.8 in all studied regions, excluding Suizhou (p < 0.05). The established mathematical model was used to fit eight regions in China, and the correlations between the predicted and actual numbers of confirmed cases were greater than 0.9, excluding that of Hebei Province (0.82).

The curriculum integrates live coding lessons with individual-level and group-based practice exercises, and also serves as a succinct resource that learners can reference both during and after the workshop. Moreover, it lowers the entry barrier for new instructors as they do not have to develop their own teaching materials or sift through extensive content. We developed this curriculum during a two-day sprint, successfully used it to host a two-day virtual workshop with almost 40 participants, and updated the material based on instructor and learner feedback. We hope that our new curriculum will prove useful to future instructors interested in teaching workshops with similar learning objectives.","output":"Developing and deploying an integrated workshop curriculum teaching computational skills for reproducible research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the world has been devastated by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Emergency Departments have been experiencing situations of urgency where clinical experts, without long experience and mature means in the fight against COVID-19, have to rapidly decide the most proper patient treatment. In this context, we introduce an artificially intelligent tool for effective and efficient Computed Tomography (CT)-based risk assessment to improve treatment and patient care. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach built on top of volume-of-interest aware deep neural networks for automatic COVID-19 patient risk assessment (discharged, hospitalized, intensive care unit) based on lung infection quantization through segmentation and, subsequently, CT classification. We tackle the high and varying dimensionality of the CT input by detecting and analyzing only a sub-volume of the CT, the Volume-of-Interest (VoI). Differently from recent strategies that consider infected CT slices without requiring any spatial coherency between them, or use the whole lung volume by applying abrupt and lossy volume down-sampling, we assess only the \\"most infected volume\\" composed of slices at its original spatial resolution. To achieve the above, we create, present and publish a new labeled and annotated CT dataset with 626 CT samples from COVID-19 patients. The comparison against such strategies proves the effectiveness of our VoI-based approach. We achieve remarkable performance on patient risk assessment evaluated on balanced data by reaching 88.88%, 89.77%, 94.73% and 88.88% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score, respectively.","output":"Volume-of-Interest Aware Deep Neural Networks for Rapid Chest CT-Based COVID-19 Patient Risk Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 global pandemic posed a particularly acute problem for sport. Although there was massive sectoral disruption in areas like higher education, music, and tourism, sport is unusually dependent on commercial media-financed, impossible-to-repeat live events performed before large co-present crowds that form a key part of the spectacle for the many times larger, distant audiences using an expanding range of screens. Covid-19 exposed the inner workings of sport as a machine that could be disabled by its own global interdependency. The compulsive generation of inequalities of class, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, ability, space, and so on resulting from the advanced commoditisation and consequent hierarchisation of contemporary global sport, created the structural imbalance and vulnerability that Covid-19 has mercilessly punished. This article applies a sociological analysis to sport before, during and after the pandemic, arguing that an emphasis on the relationships between human rights and cultural citizenship is required to improve the social institution of sport. It argues that if sociology does not play a key role in reforming sport after Covid-19, then it will have lost the moral compass that first guided the discipline in early modernity when the institution of sport emerged.","output":"Subjecting pandemic sport to a sociological procedure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease, was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

Using a mouse model, we found that intramuscular COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during early pregnancy at gestational age E7.5 did not lead to differences in fetal size by crown-rump length or weight at term, nor did we observe any gross birth defects. In contrast, injection of the TLR3 agonist and double-stranded RNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, or poly(I:C), impacted growth in utero leading to reduced fetal size. No overt maternal illness following either vaccination or poly(I:C) exposure was observed. We also found that term fetuses from these murine pregnancies vaccinated prior to the formation of the definitive placenta exhibit high circulating levels of anti-spike and anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consistent with maternal antibody status, indicating transplacental transfer in the later stages of pregnancy after early immunization.

This study characterizes antisera elicited by these two vaccines in comparison to convalescent sera. METHODS: Sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated healthcare workers, and sera from participants of a phase I trial vaccinated with 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 g CVnCoV and convalescent sera from hospitalized patients were analyzed by ELISA, neutralization tests, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and peptide arrays. RESULTS: BNT162b2-elicited sera and convalescent sera have a higher titer of spike-RBD-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies as compared to the CVnCoV-elicited sera. For all analyzed sera a reduction in binding and neutralizing antibodies was found for the lineage B.1.351 variant of concern. SPR analyses revealed that the CVnCoV-elicited sera have a lower fraction of slow-dissociating antibodies. Accordingly, the CVnCoV sera almost fail to compete with the spike-ACE2 interaction. The significance of common VOC mutations K417N, E484K, or N501Y focused on linear epitopes was analyzed using a peptide array approach. The peptide arrays showed a strong difference between convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. Specifically, the linear epitope at position N501 was affected by the mutation and elucidates the escape of viral variants to antibodies against this linear epitope. CONCLUSION: These data reveal differences in titer, neutralizing capacity, and affinity of the antibodies between BNT162b2- and CVnCoV-elicited sera, which could contribute to the apparent differences in vaccine efficacy.","output":"Analysis of BNT162b2- and CVnCoV-elicited sera and of convalescent sera toward SARS-CoV-2 viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Increasing access to high-quality emergency and prehospital care is an important priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

We describe the development and implementation of an innovative asynchronous learning tool for EMTs in the form of a Web-based trivia game. Methods Over 500 case-based multiple-choice questions (covering 10 essential prehospital content areas) were created by experts in prehospital education, piloted with EMT educators from LMICs, and delivered to EMTs through a Web-based quiz game platform over a 12-week period. We enrolled 252 participants from nine countries. Results Thirty-two participants (12.7%) completed the entire 12-week game. Participants who completed the game were administered a survey with a 100% response rate. Ninety-three percent of participants used their mobile phone to access the game. Overall, participants reported that the interface was easy to use (93.8% agreed or strongly agreed), the game improved their knowledge (100% agreed or strongly agreed), and they felt better prepared for their jobs (100% agreed or strongly agreed). The primary motivators for participation were improving patient care (37.5%) and being recognized on the game's leaderboard (31.3%).

We hypothesized that goal-directed therapy during interfacility transport would decrease hospital length of stay, prevent multiple organ dysfunction, and reduce subsequent ICU interventions. DESIGN Before-and-after intervention trial. SETTING During interfacility transport of critically ill patients by a specialized pediatric transport team, back to a tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS Before-and-after intervention trial. DESIGN Interfacility pediatric transport patients, age 1 month to 17 years, with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. INTERVENTIONS Prospective data were collected on all pediatric interfacility transport patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome transported by the Angel One Transport team at Arkansas Children's Hospital. A 10-month data collection period was followed by institution of a goal-directed resuscitation protocol. Data were subsequently collected for 10 additional months followed by comparison of pre- and postintervention groups. All transport personnel underwent training with didactics and high-fidelity simulation until mastery with goal-directed resuscitation was achieved. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All transport patients were screened for systemic inflammatory response syndrome using established variables and 235 (123 preintervention and 112 postintervention) were enrolled. Univariate analysis revealed shorter hospital stay (11  15 d vs 7  10 d; p = 0.02) and fewer required therapeutic ICU interventions in the postintervention group (Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System-28 Scores, 19.4  6.8 vs 17.3  6.6; p = 0.04). ICU stay and prevalence of organ dysfunction were not statistically different. Multivariable analysis showed a 1.6-day (95% CI, 1.3-2.03; p = 0.02) decrease in hospital stay in the postintervention group. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that goal-directed therapy administered by a specialized pediatric transport team has the potential to impact the outcomes of critically ill children. Findings from this study should be confirmed across multiple institutions, but have the potential to impact the clinical outcomes of critically ill children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.","output":"Goal-Directed Resuscitative Interventions During Pediatric Interfacility Transport."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mirando con retrospectiva, el a?o 2020 no ha sido para nada como lo hubiramos imaginado La pandemia de la COVID-19 lo ha marcado todo Hemos vivido experiencias inimaginables Los escenarios de confinamiento y de distancia social han requerido una incorporacin de las tecnologas como medio imprescindible para continuar con las actividades profesionales, educativas y sociales A nivel social, el avance en las competencias digitales de la poblacin se ha visto incrementado de forma exponencial Sin embargo, esta necesidad de uso de la tecnologa no significa que, de forma general, las instituciones y personas estuvieran preparadas para afrontar los procesos digitales, lo que pone de manifiesto dficits en sus estrategias de transformacin digital Esto ha sido muy patente en las universidades, que, si bien gracias a las tecnologas han podido cumplir con sus misiones, especialmente en lo que se refiere a la docencia, la madurez de sus procesos de transformacin digital se ha visto comprometida En lo que se refiere a la revista Education in the Knowledge Society (EKS), como para el resto de publicaciones cientficas, en 2020 los procesos de revisin se han visto un poco ms dilatados, pero se han cumplido y el volumen 21 ha contado con 30 contribuciones de calidad contrastada Adems, 2020 le ha otorgado a EKS su primer ndice CiteScore (Scopus) de 0 25, con un percentil del 27% que la coloca en un tercer cuartil Con este artculo editorial se inaugura el volumen 22 de esta revista correspondiente a 2021 Este editorial est disponible tanto en espa?ol como en ingls","output":"Transformacin digital en las universidades: Implicaciones de la pandemia de la COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are 3-5 million cases of severe influenza-like illness globally each year, and up to 650,000 related deaths.

Immunisation is gold-standard for the prevention of influenza outbreaks. The HSE Influenza Immunisation Strategy allocates vaccines to be administered in primary care to patients at-risk and their contacts. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this has become a logistical challenge. We aimed to design and test a drive-through influenza vaccine clinic at a large GP practice in Cork. METHOD: We designed and implemented an online booking system for at-risk patients and their contacts. 1-minute drive-through time slots were available to book for up to 6 people per vehicle. The primary measurement was the number of patients vaccinated with a secondary measurement of time spent vaccinating these patients. RESULTS: The pilot clinic occurred on 10/10/2020 with over 600 patients-at-risk & their contacts receiving the influenza vaccination over a time period of 10 hours. The capacity of this clinic was limited by the supply of vaccines. We estimate that 1,800 people could be vaccinated over the same time period with adequate vaccine supply. CONCLUSIONS: A drive-through influenza vaccination clinic can be efficiently run using an online booking system and serves as a safe, efficient, and convenient way for patients-at-risk & their contacts to receive vaccinations.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between contact precautions and transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) across US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used mathematical models applied to data from a population-based sample of adults hospitalized in 108 VA acute care hospitals for at least 24 hours from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from May 2, 2019, to December 11, 2020. EXPOSURES: A positive MRSA test result, presumed to indicate contact precautions use according to the VA MRSA Prevention Initiative. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the association between contact precautions and MRSA transmission, defined as the relative transmissibility attributed to contact precautions. A contact precaution effect estimate (<1 indicates a reduction in transmission associated with contact precautions) was estimated for each hospital and then pooled over time and across hospitals using meta-regression. RESULTS: In this cohort study of 108 VA hospitals, more than 2 million unique individuals had over 5.6 million admissions, of which 14.1% were presumed to have contact precautions with more than 8.4 million MRSA surveillance tests. Pooled estimates found associations between contact precautions and transmission to be stable from 2008 to 2017, with estimated transmission reductions ranging from 43% (95% credible interval [CrI], 38%-48%) to 51% (95% CrI, 46%-55%). Over the entire 10-year study period, contact precautions reduced transmission 47% (95% CrI, 45%-49%), and the intrafacility autocorrelation coefficient estimate was 0.99, suggesting consistent estimates over time within facilities. Larger facilities and those with higher admission screening compliance observed additional reductions in transmission associated with contact precautions (relative rate, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96 and 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96, respectively) compared with smaller facilities and those with lower admission screening compliance. Facilities in the southern US had a smaller transmission reduction attributable to contact precautions (relative rate, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28) compared with facilities in other regions in the US. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of adults in VA hospitals, transmissibility of MRSA was found to be reduced by approximately 50% among patients with contact precautions.

Risks of a H5N1 pandemic appear to be receding with declining human cases, and the H7N9 influenza virus is now the leading candidate as the next pandemic influenza virus.

Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are neural networks that are able to represent the essential information of a high dimensional data set in a low dimensional latent space, which have a probabilistic interpretation. In particular, the so-called encoder network, the first part of the VAE, which maps its input onto a position in latent space, additionally provides uncertainty information in terms of variance around this position. In this work, an extension to the autoencoder architecture is introduced, the FisherNet. In this architecture, the latent space uncertainty is not generated using an additional information channel in the encoder but derived from the decoder by means of the Fisher information metric. This architecture has advantages from a theoretical point of view as it provides a direct uncertainty quantification derived from the model and also accounts for uncertainty cross-correlations. We can show experimentally that the FisherNet produces more accurate data reconstructions than a comparable VAE and its learning performance also apparently scales better with the number of latent space dimensions.","output":"Probabilistic Autoencoder Using Fisher Information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Food, Environment, and Health (FEH) program of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) aims to improve the health of low- and middle-income country populations by generating evidence, innovations, and policies that reduce the health and economic burdens of preventable chronic and infectious diseases. A predominant focus of the FEH program is research related to consumer food environments that promote or enable healthy and sustainable shifts in consumption. An evaluation of the FEH program, led by the University of Toronto, provided an opportunity to analyse the approach and role of a development funder in building the field of food systems research. DISCUSSION: In this commentary, we provide an external evaluators perspective on the IDRCs contributory role in building the field of food systems research, based on a secondary analysis of findings from a recent FEH program evaluation. We used the field-building framework outlined in Di Ruggiero et al. (Health Res Policy System, 2017) to highlight the strengths and challenges of the FEHs approach to field-building and determined that the program aligns with six of the seven features of the framework. The FEH program has enhanced support and awareness for food systems research, provided organized funding and capacity-building opportunities, multilevel activity to support research and its use, and strong scientific leadership, and set significant standards and exemplars. However, we also found that not all sociopolitical environments have fully recognized or valued food systems research and its use for policy change. CONCLUSION: The FEH programs field-building approach can be situated within the field-building framework, and it has been successful in laying the groundwork for building the field of food systems, particularly consumer food environments research. However, supportive external environments and further investments may be needed to achieve a critical mass of capacity, continue building communities of practice, and influence policy. The FEH program approach may serve as an exemplar and comparator for other research funding agencies looking to develop strategic research programming in the field of food systems research.","output":"Building the field of food systems research: commentary on a research funders role"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our study examines the literature that has been published in important journals on supply chain disruptions, a topic that has emerged the last 20 years, with an emphasis in the latest developments in the field.

We aimed to identify differences in patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of COVID-19 positive cases to develop and validate a diagnostic-model predicting who will develop severe-form and who will need critical-care in the future. Methods: In this observational retrospective study, COVID-19 positive cases (total 417) diagnosed in Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE were recruited, and their prognosis in terms of admission to the hospital and the need for intensive care was reviewed until their tests turned negative. Patients were classified according to their clinical state into mild, moderate, severe, and critical. We retrieved all the baseline clinical data, laboratory, and radiological results and used them to identify parameters that can predict admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Patients with ICU admission showed a distinct clinical, demographic as well as laboratory features when compared to patients who did not need ICU admission. This includes the elder age group, male gender, and presence of comorbidities like diabetes and history of hypertension. ROC and Precision-Recall curves showed that among all variables, D dimers (>1.5 mg/dl), Urea (>6.5 mmol/L), and Troponin (>13.5 ng/ml) could positively predict the admission to ICU in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, decreased Lymphocyte count and albumin can predict admission to ICU in patients with COVID-19 with acceptable sensitivity (59.32, 95% CI [49.89C68.27]) and specificity (79.31, 95% CI [72.53C85.07]). Conclusion: Using these three predictors with their cut of values can identify patients who are at risk of developing critical COVID-19 and might need aggressive intervention earlier in the course of the disease.","output":"D-dimer, Troponin, and Urea Level at Presentation With COVID-19 can Predict ICU Admission: A Single Centered Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases may be particularly critical for the conservation of endangered species. A striking example is the recurrent outbreaks that have been occurring in seabirds on Amsterdam Island for the past 30 years, threatening populations of three Endangered seabird species and of the endemic, Critically Endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis. The bacteria Pasteurella multocida (avian cholera causative agent), and to a lesser extent Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (erysipelas causative agent), were both suspected to be responsible for these epidemics. Despite this critical situation, demographic trends were not available for these threatened populations, and the occurrence and characterization of potential causative agents of epizootics remain poorly known. The aims of the current study were to (i) provide an update of population trends for four threatened seabird species monitored on Amsterdam Island, (ii) assess the occurrence of P. multocida, and E. rhusiopathiae in live birds from five species, (iii) search for other infectious agents in these samples and, (iv) isolate and genotype the causative agent(s) of epizooties from dead birds. Our study shows that the demographic situation has worsened substantially in three seabird species during the past decade, with extremely low reproductive success and declining populations for Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses Thalassarche carteri, sooty albatrosses Phoebetria fusca, and northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi. Pasteurella multocida or E. rhusiopathiae were detected by PCR in live birds of all five investigated species, while results were negative for eight additional infectious agents. A single strain of P. multocida was repeatedly cultured from dead birds, while no E. rhusiopathiae could be isolated. These results highlight the significance of P. multocida in this particular eco-epidemiological system as the main agent responsible for epizootics.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess dentists willingness to treat patients infected with HCV and the socio-demographic variables that influence their decision. METHODS: An online questionnaire was disseminated to dentists practicing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and enquired about their willingness to perform two dental treatments: restorative and surgical, to patients infected with HCV, while hypothetically being equipped with optimal personal protective equipment. Binary logistic regression test was used to assess socio-demographic factors that predict dentists unwillingness decision. RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-five dentists participated in this survey. Among those, 25.6 and 19.3% were unwilling to perform dental extractions and aerosol-generating restorative dental treatments for patients infected with HCV, respectively. Dentists clinical experience was a significant predictor of their unwillingness decision, with those of shorter clinical experience expressing greater reluctance than their counterparts (OR:1.61; 95% CI: 1.02C2.54; p = 0.042).

BALB/c mice free of (BALB/c-) or naturally infected with (BALB/c+) coronavirus, or hyperimmunized with inactivated MHV3 (BALB/ci), were always fully susceptible. All susceptible mice developed an acute hepatitis with a high virus titre in the tissues. Resistance mice developed a mild disease in which the low virus titres detected in the tissues were cleared. After infection, interferon (IFN)-gamma synthesis in A/J- mice was lower than that in A/J+ and A/J mice; IFN-gamma synthesis was very high in BALB/c+ and BALB/ci mice, but low in BALB/c- mice. Studies of the anti-MHV3 effect induced in macrophages in vitro showed that only IFN-gamma-activated A/J mouse macrophages were able to restrict partially the growth of MHV3, regardless of whether the animals had been immunized. The effect occurred only when the cells were activated with IFN-gamma before virus infection. The results indicate that the resistance of A/J mice to our strain of MHV3 is not natural but is acquired after immunization, and that the mechanism involved is dependent on T cell activity, IFN-gamma production and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN-gamma.","output":"Acquired immunity of A/J mice to mouse hepatitis virus 3 infection: dependence on interferon-gamma synthesis and macrophage sensitivity to interferon-gamma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Successful viral infection, as well as any resultant antiviral response, relies on numerous sequential interactions between host and viral factors. These interactions can take the form of affinity-based interactions between viral and host macromolecules or active, enzyme-based interactions, consisting both of direct enzyme activity performed by viral enzymes and indirect modulation of the activity of the host cells enzymes via viral interference. This activity has the potential to transform the local microenvironment to the benefit or detriment of both the virus and the host, favouring either the continuation of the viral life cycle or the hosts antiviral response. Comprehensive characterisation of enzymatic activity during viral infection is therefore necessary for the understanding of virally induced diseases. Activity-based protein profiling techniques have been established as effective and practicable tools with which to interrogate the regulation of enzymes catalytic activity and the roles played by these enzymes in various cell processes.

The relative importance of vaccination strategies and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of simulated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage scenarios with and without NPIs with infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An established agent-based decision analytical model was used to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression from March 24, 2020, to September 23, 2021. The model simulated COVID-19 spread in North Carolina, a US state of 10.5 million people. A network of 1 017 720 agents was constructed from US Census data to represent the statewide population. EXPOSURES: Scenarios of vaccine efficacy (50% and 90%), vaccine coverage (25%, 50%, and 75% at the end of a 6-month distribution period), and NPIs (reduced mobility, school closings, and use of face masks) maintained and removed during vaccine distribution. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risks of infection from the start of vaccine distribution and risk differences comparing scenarios. Outcome means and SDs were calculated across replications. RESULTS: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy, 25% coverage), a mean (SD) of 2 231 134 (117 867) new infections occurred after vaccination began with NPIs removed, and a mean (SD) of 799 949 (60 279) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained during 11 months. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy, 75% coverage), a mean (SD) of 527 409 (40 637) new infections occurred with NPIs removed and a mean (SD) of 450 575 (32 716) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained. With NPIs removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared with the worst-case scenario (mean [SD] absolute risk reduction, 13% [1%] and 8% [1%], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Simulation outcomes suggest that removing NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. These findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many prepandemic activities can be resumed.","output":"Association of Simulated COVID-19 Vaccination and Nonpharmaceutical Interventions With Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consumption has lately been under the microscope facing pressure from all stakeholders as principles of sustainability have gained more popularity.

The following contribution will showcase one of these properties, the photothermal effect produced by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and show how AgNPs can serve as potential viricidal materials for PPE (i.e., personal protective equipment) disinfection. In the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic, PPE disinfection is critical for addressing the shortfalls in the supply chains that ensure rapid and reliable sources of PPE for both medical professionals and the public. Two AgNP composites were prepared using both photochemical and pulsed laser ablation in liquid techniques. Then, to improve the durability of the NPs' coating, they were mixed in a commercially available tent protectant solution or with a chitosan suspension. Transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopic analyses of the AgNP/protectant composites present mostly monodisperse, spherical particles of 5-10 nm in diameter, dependent on the route of nanoparticle synthesis. Blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were utilized to activate the surface plasmon resonance effects of the AgNP-coated materials at 400 nm. The resultant photothermal activation produced elevated surface temperatures on the fabrics, up to 150 C, approaching the ignition temperature of the fabric samples, and well above the threshold required to deactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Photothermal heating was found to be largely dependent on both proximity of the coated sample surface to the LED source and illumination intensity. Furthermore, the rate of temperature increase was determined to be considerably faster than traditional or photothermal heating studies conducted on aqueous nanoparticle colloids, illustrating the efficiency of this methodology. Finally, durability studies of the AgNP/protectant coatings were examined and were found to maintain photothermal activity over long durations of exposure and after a 3-month storage timeframe. A marginal decrease in heating can be noticed following laundering with traditional detergent cleaners, mainly during the first washing cycle. The coating resistance to washing could be improved by the cross linkage of a biodegradable polymer, chitosan. ? 2021 American Chemical Society.","output":"Investigating the Photothermal Disinfecting Properties of Light-Activated Silver Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, sustainable forms of collective resilience help societies coping cohesively with unprecedented challenges.

This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020.

We used latent growth mixture modeling to identify anxiety trajectories over time. Group comparison and multivariate regression models were used to examine demographic and risk and resilience factors associated with class membership. Results. A four-class model provided the best fit. The resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) was the most common (n = 961, 75.08%), followed by chronic anxiety (n = 149, 11.64%), recovery (n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety (n = 74, 5.78%).

The first measure assigns COVID-19 deaths to its most significant lagged number of cases based on a fixed-effects panel data model. The second fatality measure relates pandemic deaths and cases based on their respective change points. The results find notable variations of the pandemic lethality between the Middle East countries, likely due to the difference in the quality of health care. Although crude case-fatality rate does not identify the pandemic lethality variations during the ongoing of the disease, this paper develops two novel measures for COVID-19 case fatality which can identify the dynamics and the variations of the pandemic deadliness.","output":"COVID-19 case-fatality variations with application to the Middle East countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first report of porcine kobuvirus (PKV) in 2008, it has been confirmed that PKV is widely present in several countries and plays an important role in diarrhoea outbreak in pigs. Studies have shown that the biggest difference among PKVs is the presence or absence of a specific 30-amino acid (aa) sequence in the 2B region of the polyprotein gene. Based on this unique feature, most PKV sequences could be divided into two groups (Group 1 without deletion and Group 2 with deletion), but a few sequences did not follow this rule due to possible recombination. In this study, two PKV genome sequences, designated JXAT2015 (8,123 nucleotide) and JXJC2015 (8,120 nucleotide), were identified on two different commercial swine farms with the severe diarrhoea outbreak accompanying with highly PKV infection (90%, 18/20) and moderate infection (40%, 8/20) of porcine bocavirus 1 (PBoV1) in Jiangxi province of China. Sequence analysis based on the polyprotein gene showed that they shared low nucleotide similarity (86.3%-88.1%) with other known PKVs. Although both possessed the 30-aa deletion in the 2B region, phylogenetic analysis showed that JXJC2015 was distinct from Group 1 and even Group 2, and formed a new Group (designated Group 3). The findings of this study further revealed genetic diversity and the possible pathogenic role of PKV in conjunction with other pathogens in piglets.","output":"A novel porcine kobuvirus emerged in piglets with severe diarrhoea in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic diseases, is a common occurrence with ageing and a recognised public health concern, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multimorbidity population is more susceptible to the virus, its complications, and death. The study aimed to explore the multimorbidity characteristics and their associations at a population level for the first time in Malta. Such data enables adequate priority and policy planning due to COVID-19's predilection for this population. STUDY AND METHODS: Baseline data was collected from 3,947 adults recruited between 2014-2016 through a cross-sectional study. A single-stage sampling strategy was implemented and stratified by age (18 -70 years), sex and locality. Participants were invited to attend a health examination survey consisting of a questionnaire, anthropometric and biological measurements. Descriptive (chi-square) and analytic (regression modelling) statistics were used to determine the characteristics and associations of the multimorbidity population. The chronic diseases considered for multimorbidity were type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, myocardial infraction, coronary heart disease and dyslipidaemia. RESULTS: Multimorbidity was present in 33% (95% confidence interval 31.54-34.47) of the study population, with a male predominance. Hypertension and myocardial infarction were the commonest multimorbidity combination from a young age group (20-30 years). Low socio-economic status and residing on the island of Gozo were positively associated with multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity in Malta was evident from a young age, with the highest occurrence among the low socio-economic status and residents of Gozo, bringing forward the need for preventive action. An adaptive healthcare system and policies are recommended to prevent, support, and manage multimorbidity non-communicable diseases while bracing for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"At-risk population for COVID-19: multimorbidity characteristics of a European small Island state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To assess the relationship between fat-free mass (FFM) and glucose metabolism in children 0-18 years of age. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature on Medline/PubMed, SinoMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to 12 October 2021; this encompassed observational studies in which the relationship between FFM and glucose metabolism was assessed.

Results: We included eight studies comprising 13,282 individuals, five of which involved the assessment of the relationship between FFM and blood glucose, and four on the relationship between FFM and insulin resistance (IR). Our results showed that FFM was significantly associated with fasting plasma insulin levels (r = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.30-0.39, P < 0.001). Due to high heterogeneity or insufficient quantity of data, the studies of the relationship between FFM and fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, or HbA1c were not congruent, and were therefore not suitable for meta-analysis. Conclusion: Our results indicated that FFM was significantly associated with fasting plasma insulin levels. As far as we have determined, this is the first-ever systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between FFM and glucose metabolism in children and adolescents; and our results thus provide novel information to fill a gap in the literature in this area.

Identification of those at highest risk could facilitate pre-emptive intervention such as reduction of immunosuppression. Reduced circulating monocytic HLA-DR density is a marker of immune depression in the general population and associates with poorer outcome in critical illness. It has recently been used as a safety marker in adoptive cell therapy trials in renal transplantation. Despite its potential as a marker of dampened immune responses, factors that impact upon monocytic HLA-DR density and the long-term clinical sequelae of this have not been assessed in transplant recipients. Methods: A cohort study of stable long-term renal transplant recipients was undertaken. Serial circulating monocytic HLA-DR density and other leucocyte populations were quantified by flow cytometry. Gene expression of monocytes was performed using the Nanostring nCounter platform, and 13-plex cytokine bead array used to quantify serum concentrations. The primary outcome was malignancy development during one-year follow-up. Risk of malignancy was calculated by univariate and multivariate proportionate hazards modelling with and without adjustment for competing risks. Results: Monocytic HLA-DR density was stable in long-term renal transplant recipients (n=135) and similar to non-immunosuppressed controls (n=29), though was suppressed in recipients receiving prednisolone. Decreased mHLA-DRd was associated with accumulation of CD14+CD11b+CD33+HLA-DRlo monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor-like cells. Pathway analysis revealed downregulation of pathways relating to cytokine and chemokine signalling in monocytes with low HLA-DR density; however serum concentrations of major cytokines did not differ between these groups. There was an independent increase in malignancy risk during follow-up with decreased HLA-DR density. Conclusions: Dampened chemokine and cytokine signalling drives a stable reduction in monocytic HLA-DR density in long-term transplant recipients and associates with subsequent malignancy risk. This may function as a novel marker of excess immunosuppression. Further study is needed to understand the mechanism behind this association.","output":"Dampened inflammatory signalling and myeloid-derived suppressor-like cell accumulation reduces circulating monocytic HLA-DR density and associates with malignancy risk in long-term renal transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"'Lockdown' periods in response to COVID-19 have provided a unique opportunity to study the impacts of economic activity on environmental pollution (e g , NO2, aerosols, noise, light) The effects on NO2 and aerosols have been very noticeable and readily demonstrated, but that on light pollution has proven challenging to determine The main reason for this difficulty is that the primary source of nighttime satellite imagery of the earth is the SNPP-VIIRS/DNB instrument, which acquires data late at night after most human nocturnal activity has already occurred and much associated lighting has been turned off Here, to analyze the effect of lockdown on urban light emissions, we use ground and satellite data for Granada, Spain, during the COVID-19 induced confinement of the city&rsquo;s population from 14 March until 31 May 2020 We find a clear decrease in light pollution due both to a decrease in light emissions from the city and to a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol content in the atmosphere which resulted in less light being scattered A clear correlation between the abundance of PM10 particles and sky brightness is observed, such that the more polluted the atmosphere the brighter the urban night sky An empirical expression is determined that relates PM10 particle abundance and sky brightness at three different wavelength bands","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Urban Light Emissions: Ground and Satellite Comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public safety personnel (PSP) experience unique occupational stressors and suffer from high rates of mental health problems.

Our research unit, PSPNET, provides internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy to PSP in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. When the pandemic spread to Saskatchewan, PSPNET began inquiring about the impact of the pandemic on prospective clients during the eligibility screening process. We used content analysis to analyze data from telephone screening interviews (n = 56) and descriptive statistics to analyze data from a questionnaire concerning the impacts of COVID-19 (n = 41). The results showed that most PSP reported facing several novel emotional challenges (e.g., social isolation, boredom, anger, and fear) and logistical challenges (e.g., related to childcare, finances, work, and access to mental healthcare). Most participants indicated they felt at least somewhat afraid of contracting COVID-19 but felt more afraid of their families contracting the virus than themselves. However, few participants reported severe challenges of any kind, and many (40%) indicated that they had not been significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic. Overall, the results suggest that PSP are not expressing significant concern at this time in meeting the novel challenges posed by COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an increase in the volume of seriously ill patients in EDs and a consequent rapid increase in PC integration in many EDs. OBJECTIVES: To describe the new PC-ED delivery innovations that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this qualitative study of PC programs in EDs, semistructured interviews were conducted with ED and PC clinicians between June 30, 2020 and August 18, 2020. Participants were asked about PC-ED integration before, during, and after COVID. We conducted a two-phased rapid analysis using a rapid analysis template and consolidated matrix to identify innovations. RESULTS: Using purposive and snowball sampling, we interviewed 31 participants, representing 52 hospitals. Several new innovations in care delivery were identified. These included elements of fully embedded PC, the use of PC extenders, technology both within the electronic medical record and outside it, and innovations in training emergency clinicians in primary PC skills to support care delivery. Most PC efforts focused on increasing goals-of-care conversations. Institutions that implemented these programs reported that they increased PC utilization in the ED, were well received by clinicians, and changed patient's care trajectories. CONCLUSION: Several new innovations in PC-ED care delivery emerged during COVID. Many innovations leveraged different types of clinicians to deliver care, an increased physical presence of PC in the ED, and used technology to enhance care delivery. These innovations may serve as a framework for institutions as they plan for evolving needs in the ED during and after COVID.

In fact, several retrospective studies, in addition to our own, as well as a systematic review, indicate that KIT mutations have a negative prognostic impact in AML with t(8;21) or, to a lesser extent, with inv(16)/t(16;16). In addition, gene expression studies found KIT to be highly expressed in CBFL regardless of its mutational status. Furthermore, recent studies have identified novel recurrent somatic mutations co-occurring with KITmut. In-vitro studies revealed that Midostaurin (Mido) is effective in inhibiting both wild type (WT) and a range of KIT mutants. In addition, it is proven to be effective in KIT-positive malignancies such as Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis (ASM), Mast Cell Leukemia (MCL), and SM with Associated Hematological Neoplasm (SM-AHN). With this background, we designed a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mido in association with Intensive Chemotherapy (IC), in CBFL regardless of KIT mutational status. Methods: The inclusion criteria were the following: age 18 to 60 years, diagnosis of de-novo CBFL, adequate organ function, signed informed consent. The exclusion criteria were: central nervous system involvement, uncontrolled infections, other active malignancies, a Qtc value greater than 470 ms (according to Bazett formula) at the electrocardiogram, significant uncontrolled or active cardiovascular diseases. Patients received standard induction therapy with an anthracycline containing regimen (7+3-like) + Mido, three cycles of post-remission consolidation chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine + Mido, and 12 months of Mido as Maintenance. The Mido dosage was: 50 mg orally twice a day, on days 8-21, in association with IC, and 50 mg orally twice a day as single agent maintenance. In order to attain a reduction in 2 years Relapse Incidence (RI), from the historical value of 48% to 28% (Primary Objective of the Study), we plan to enrol 39 patients (power 82%, alpha error 4,6%). At diagnosis all patients were studied by a comprehensive NGS panel targeting 40 DNA genes and 29 RNA fusion driver genes. MRD status was assessed by qPCR and high-resolution multicolor flow cytometry at established check-points during consolidation and maintenance therapy. Results: 17 patients were enrolled between December 2018 to April 2020 (table1). Overall, the CR rate was 94.2%. At a median follow-up of 9 months (range 3-19 months), we recorded a RI of 12.5%, an OS of 93.7%, and a DFS of 81.2%. 16 patients continue on study and 14 patients are in 1st CR, MRD-negative by flow cytometry and qPCR.

We only recorded one death from SARS-Cov2 infection (Interstitial Pneumonia) in a patient in MRD-negative complete remission. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: In patients with CBFL, the regimen consisting of intensive chemotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy in association with Mido, followed by Mido maintenance, had an acceptable safety profile and excellent response rates with a significant proportion of patients in MRD-negative complete remission.

As of December 16, 2021, almost 4,822,472 people had died and over 236,132,082 were infected with this lethal viral infection. It is believed that the human immune system is thought to play a critical role in the initial phase of infection when the viruses invade the host cells. Although some effective vaccines have already been on the market, researchers and many bio-pharmaceuticals are still working hard to develop a fully functional vaccine or more effective therapeutic agent against the COVID-19. Other efforts, in addition to functional vaccines, can help strengthen the immune system to defeat the corona virus infection. Herein, we have reviewed some of those proven measures, following which a more efficient immune system can be better prepared to fight viral infection. Among these, dietary supplements like- fresh vegetables and fruits offer a plentiful of vitamins and antioxidants, enabling to build of a healthy immune system. While the pharmacologically active components of medicinal plants directly aid in fighting against viral infection, supplementary supplements combined with a healthy diet will assist to regulate the immune system and will prevent viral infection. In addition, some personal habits, like- regular physical exercise, intermittent fasting, and adequate sleep, had also been proven to aid the immune system in becoming an efficient one. Maintaining each of these will strengthen the immune system, allowing innate immunity to become a more defensive and active antagonistic mechanism against corona-virus infection.

We infer the leaning of users about controversial topics - ranging from vaccines to abortion - and reconstruct their interaction networks by analyzing different features, such as shared links domain, followed pages, follower relationship and commented posts. Our method quantifies the existence of echo-chambers along two main dimensions: homophily in the interaction networks and bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded peers. We find peculiar differences across social media. Indeed, while Facebook and Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit and Gab do not. Finally, we test the role of the social media platform on news consumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook. Again, we find support for the hypothesis that platforms implementing news feed algorithms like Facebook may elicit the emergence of echo-chambers.","output":"Echo Chambers on Social Media: A comparative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia remains a matter of concern. Chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia have been reported widely, while there is relatively rare research on chest X-ray (CXR). OBJECTIVE The study was aimed to compare the CXR and chest CT findings of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and to explore their respective clinical values. METHODS 28 inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent both CXR and CT were included. The pulmonary manifestations of the lesions were recorded. Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and fibrosis were quantified in CXR and chest CT separately. Consistency was analyzed using Fleiss' kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient. The stages of the disease in CXR and chest CT were evaluated. RESULTS Approximately 67.9% (19/28) of subjects had abnormal findings on CXR. The common manifestations in CXR were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (100%, 19/19) and consolidation (68.4%, 13/19). 92.9% (26/28) of patients had abnormal manifestations on CT. The common manifestations in CT were GGO (88.5%, 23/26), consolidation (69.2%, 18/26), reticular opacity (69.2%, 18/26) and nodule (46.2%, 12/26). Among the abnormalities between CXR and CT, only consolidation was consistent (=0.510). GGO (ICC=0.501) and consolidation (ICC=0.431) scores were consistent in CXR and chest CT. The results of staging were the same in 14 cases, most of them were in stage I and stage II. While in other cases with inconsistent results, CT was more advanced in the disease stage than CXR, mainly stage III and stage IV. CONCLUSION CXR is helpful to observe the change of the pulmonary lesions in patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. CT can be used for early diagnosis and staging of lesions.","output":"Clinical Value of COVID-19 Chest Radiography and High-Resolution CT Examination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the major causes of neonatal calf diarrhea.

Our study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of community-based Lebanese pharmacists, in addition to their willingness to expand their practice scope to include vaccine administration. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the phase preceding the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine in Lebanon between 1 and 31st December 2020. Using a stratified random sampling method, data were collected from Lebanese community pharmacists (CPs) through an online survey that included information on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical experience, willingness to administer vaccines, knowledge about vaccination, attitudes towards immunization, reasons supporting utilizing pharmacists as immunizers and the requested elements to incorporate immunization in pharmacists practice scope. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with knowledge. RESULTS: A total of 412 community pharmacists participated in this survey. Of the total, 66.5% of the surveyed CPs are willing to administer vaccines. The majority of them (89.8%) had an overall good level. Out of all, 92.7% showed a positive overall attitude score toward immunization, 95.4% agreed that community pharmacists can play an important role in advertising and promoting vaccination. The main needed elements for implementing immunization services in pharmacies listed by participants were: support of health authorities (99.3%), statutory allowance (82.8%), patient demand (95.4%), pharmacists interest (96.1%) and continuous education and training workshops on immunization. Older CPs (50 years and above) [aOR = 0.703, CI 95% (0.598C0.812)] and those working in Bekaa and North have lower knowledge score than their counterparts. High educational level [aOR = 1.891, CI 95% (1.598C2.019)], previous experience in immunization [aOR = 3.123, CI 95% (2.652C4.161)] and working in urban areas [aOR = 3.640, CI 95% (2.544C4.717)] were positively associated with a good knowledge level. CONCLUSION: Most of Lebanese community pharmacists are willing to offer immunizations. The expansion of the pharmacists practice scope to include provision of immunizations required a national plan that encompasses strengthening knowledge, training, certification for eligibility to administer vaccines, enhancing pharmacovigilance and statutory reform.","output":"Pharmacists as immunizers in Lebanon: a national survey of community pharmacists willingness and readiness to administer adult immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials are an essential part of the effort to find safe and effective prevention and treatment for COVID-19. Given the rapid growth of COVID-19 clinical trials, there is an urgent need for a better clinical trial information retrieval that supports searching by specifying criteria including both eligibility criteria and structured trial information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built a linked graph for registered COVID-19 clinical trials: the COVID-19 Trial Graph, to facilitate retrieval of clinical trials. Natural language processing (NLP) tools were leveraged to extract and normalize the clinical trial information from both their eligibility criteria free texts and structured information from ClinicalTrials.gov. We linked the extracted data using the COVID-19 Trial Graph and imported it to a graph database, which supports both query and visualization. We evaluated trial graph using case queries and graph embedding. RESULTS: The graph currently (as of 10-05-2020) contains 3,392 registered COVID-19 clinical trials, with 17,480 nodes and 65,236 relationships. Manual evaluation of case queries found high-precision and recall scores on retrieving relevant clinical trials searching from both eligibility criteria and trial-structured information. We observed clustering in clinical trials via graph embedding, which also showed superiority over the baseline (0.8704 vs. 0.8199) in evaluating whether a trial can complete its recruitment successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Trial Graph is a novel representation of clinical trials that allows diverse search queries and provides a graph-based visualization of COVID-19 clinical trials. High-dimensional vectors mapped by graph embedding for clinical trials would be potentially beneficial for many downstream applications, such as trial end recruitment status prediction, and trial similarity comparison.

The objective of this study was to determine its placental transfer. METHODS: Maternal-to-fetal transfer was investigated using the open-circuit ex vivo dually perfused human cotyledon model. Doravirine was added to a maternal perfusate (theoretical doravirine concentration of 250 ng/mL) containing 2 g/L human albumin and 20 g/L antipyrine, a marker to validate the cotyledon's viability, and cotyledons were dually perfused for up to 90 min. RESULTS: In five experiments, the median (IQR) doravirine concentrations in the maternal and fetal compartments were, respectively, 303 (178-420) and 40 (30-54) ng/mL, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 16% (12%-18%) and the clearance index (in comparison with antipyrine transfer) was 48% (35%-64%). The median accumulation index in cotyledon tissue was 39% (range 10%-66%). CONCLUSIONS: Doravirine both crosses and accumulates in the placenta.

CoronaVac is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been rolled out in several low and middle-income countries including Brazil, where it was the mainstay of the first wave of immunization of health care workers and the elderly population. We aimed to assess the T cell and antibody responses of vaccinees as compared to convalescent subjects. Methods. We detected IgG against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, neutralizing antibodies against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, and used SARS-CoV-2 peptides to detect IFN-g and IL-2 specific T cell responses in a cohort of CoronaVac vaccinees ( N=101) and convalescent ( N=72) individuals. Findings. Among vaccinees, 95% displayed T cell or antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 as compared to 99% convalescent individuals. However, we observed that among vaccinees, males and individuals 55 years or older developed significantly lower anti-RBD, anti-NP and neutralizing antibody responses as well as antigen-induced IL-2 production by T cells. Interpretation. Even though some studies indicated Coronavac helped reduce mortality among elderly people, considering the current dominance of the gamma variant of concern (VOC) and potential increase of the delta VOC, in Brazil, our data support that Coronavac vaccinees above 55 years old are likely to benefit from a third dose to boost immune response and protection.

RESULTS: Among 271 639 patients with COVID-19, 18 460 had at least one cancer diagnosis: 8034 with a history of cancer and 10 426 with newly diagnosed cancer within one year of COVID-19 infection. Patients with a cancer diagnosis were older and more likely to be male, white, Medicare beneficiaries, and have higher prevalences of chronic conditions. Cancer patients had higher risks for 30-day mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01C1.14, P = 0.028) and hospitalization (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01C1.07, P = 0.006) but without significant differences in ICU admission and ventilator use compared to non-cancer patients. Recent cancer diagnoses were associated with higher risks for worse COVID-19 outcomes (RR for mortality 1.17, 95% CI 1.08C1.25, P<0.001 and RR for hospitalization 1.10, 95% CI 1.06C1.14, P<0.001), particularly among recent metastatic (stage IV), hematological, liver and lung cancers compared with the non-cancer group.

The purpose of our study was to determine useful criteria for the differentiation of patients with acute clinical syndromes and suspicion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Materials and Methods: This was an observational retrospective study, conducted in an internal medicine clinic from April to May 2020. We collected clinical, biological, and computed tomography (CT) data on patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases and clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with an already-positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 on presentation at the emergency department were excluded from our study. Results: Of 253 suspected cases, 20 were laboratory-confirmed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, whereas COVID-19 diagnosis was ruled out in the remaining 233. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) correlated significantly with COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected patients, while laboratory markers were not significantly different between the two groups. Of the suspected patients, significantly higher percentages of dry cough, fever, myalgias, sore throat, loss of smell and appetite, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) on CT were found in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that, until receiving the result of an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (usually 12-24 h), association with VTE as a comorbidity, fever, dry cough, and myalgia as clinical features, and GGO on CT are the main markers for the identification of COVID-19 patients among those suspected with acute clinical syndromes. Our results also provide evidence for doctors not to rely solely on biological markers in the case of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases. These data are useful for faster decision-making with regard to suspected COVID-19 patients before receiving RT-PCR test results, thus avoiding keeping patients in crowded emergency departments.","output":"Acute Clinical Syndromes and Suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: The Experience of a Single Romanian Center in the Early Pandemic Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communities are vital sources of support during crisis, providing collective contexts for shared identity and solidarity that predict supportive, prosocial responses.

Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and pre-existing diseases/conditions. 613 participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19.

ACE2 is the main cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which can attach to the C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein. The GRP78 receptor plays an anchoring role, which attaches to the RBD and increases the chance of other RBDs binding to ACE2. Although high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are produced during viral infections, it is not clear how they affect the RBD structure and its binding to ACE2 and GRP78. In this research, we apply molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of oxidation of the highly reactive cysteine (Cys) amino acids of the RBD on its binding to ACE2 and GRP78. The interaction energy of both ACE2 and GRP78 with the whole RBD, as well as with the RBD main regions, is compared in both the native and oxidized RBDs. Our results show that the interaction energy between the oxidized RBD and ACE2 is strengthened by 155 kJ/mol, increasing the binding of the RBD to ACE2 after oxidation. In addition, the interaction energy between the RBD and GRP78 is slightly increased by 8 kJ/mol after oxidation, but this difference is not significant. Overall, these findings highlight the role of RONS in the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein to host cell receptors and suggest an alternative mechanism by which RONS could modulate the entrance of viral particles into the cells.","output":"Effect of Cysteine Oxidation in SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain on Its Interaction with Two Cell Receptors: Insights from Atomistic Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has changed rapidly the business operation and travel behavior of global communities and calls for research on resilience.

Some allergic diseases, including asthma, have been defined as risk factors for a poor outcome in COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the role of another allergic disease-allergic rhinitis-in the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted at Sakarya Educational and Research Hospital, Toyota Hospital and Yenikent State Hospital between March 18, 2020 and August 30, 2020. The study included a case group of 125 randomly selected patients who had been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in advance of having COVID-19 and a control group of 125 patients without allergic rhinitis who were diagnosed with COVID-19. We evaluated all participants' statuses regarding smoking, symptoms, and hospitalization, as well as the length of their hospitalization and the number of their comorbidities. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding percentage of asymptomatic patients (p = 0.27), presence of smoking (p = 0.068), hospitalization status (p = 0.79), and hospitalization length (p = 0.55). From each group, two patients needed care in an intensive care unit (ICU). One patient from the case group and two from the control group died due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found that allergic rhinitis did not affect the severity of COVID-19. However, we recommend that the literature be augmented with further studies on the COVID-19 prognosis of patients who have allergic rhinitis.","output":"How does allergic rhinitis impact the severity of COVID-19?: a case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The importance of autonomic neurology has grown exponentially since the development of neuroscience, genetics, and immunology.

However, some patients may suffer from other pulmonary abnormalities that can be worsened by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and they may consequently require lung surgery. COVID-19 affects the indications, surgical procedure, and postsurgical care of these patients. Background: We present a case of a 14-year-old girl with COVID-19 pulmonary disease and persistent air leak due to right apical bullae that required resection. Clinical, surgical, and safety implications are discussed. The role of thoracic minimally invasive surgery under COVID-19 conditions is also analyzed. Materials and Methods: The thoracoscopic procedure was scheduled earlier than normally expected. The surgery was performed in a COVID-19 reserved theatre with neutral pressure and only the necessary personnel was allowed inside. The use of the required personal protective equipment was supervised by an expert nurse before and after the intervention. Results: The surgeons used a three-port technique to resect the bullae with an endostapler and no mechanical pleural abrasion was added to the procedure. Electrocautery and CO2 insufflation were avoided, and a chest drain with a closed-circuit aspiration system was installed before removing the ports. The child was discharged home 3 days later after the removal of the chest drain. Conclusions: COVID-19 has an impact on the standard indications, surgical strategies and postoperative care of some conditions requiring intervention. Extra safety measures are needed in the operating room to limit the chance of transmission. Minimally invasive surgery for thoracic surgery remains safe if the current safety guidelines are followed closely.","output":"Thoracoscopic Bullectomy for Persistent Air Leak in a 14-Year-Old Child with COVID-19 Bilateral Pulmonary Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research results in the last two decades show the important role of pekarangan as a micro-scale landscape unit in providing space for growing various types of plants, i.e., multi-layers from the grasses to the trees, livestock, and fish.

Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents a computation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network.

The predominant diagnostic test is viral RNA detection by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens, however the results of this test are not promptly obtainable in all patient care locations. Routine laboratory testing, in contrast, is readily available with a turn-around time (TAT) usually within 1-2 hours. Here we present a machine learning model incorporating patient demographic features (age, sex, race) with 27 routine laboratory tests to predict an individual's SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Laboratory test results obtained within two days before the release of SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR result were used to train a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) model from 3,346 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tested patients (1,394 positive and 1,952 negative) evaluated at a large metropolitan hospital. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.853 (95% CI: 0.829-0.878). Application of this model to an independent patient dataset from a separate hospital resulted in a comparable AUC (0.838), validating the generalization of its use. Moreover, our model predicted initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in 66% individuals whose RT-PCR result changed from negative to positive within two days. Overall, this model employing routine laboratory test results offers opportunities for early and rapid identification of high-risk SARS-COV-2 infected patients before their RT-PCR results are available.

SettingGlobal Participants167 countries for which obesity and death data were available, grouped by population size, with multiples of 10 countries in each of 8 groups plus a group including all 57 countries with obesity rates <15%. Outcome and measuresUsing Excel, COVID-19 deaths/million were regressed on the obesity rate for each country, based on obesity being a key factor in COVID hospitalizations and deaths. Using the least squares formula for the best fit for each model, R2, components of the formula, and the percentage of world population represented, were recorded for each group. ResultsObesity rates ranged from 2.1% to 37.9% and death rates ranged from 0.4/million to 1,892/million for groups representing up to 91% of global population. Results for the 8 population groups had R2 from 0.30 to 0.90 with slopes of the fitted line ranging from 27.9-51.0.

Current evidence suggests that severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with a dysregulated immune response. However, little is known about how the innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral, surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), and CXCL8, and identified NF-&#954;B and ATF-4 as key drivers of this proinflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III interferon (IFN) response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, pretreatment and posttreatment with type I and III IFNs significantly reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures that correlated with upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Combined, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger an IFN response but is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs. Our studies demonstrate the utility of pHAE cultures to model SARS-CoV-2 infection and that both type I and III IFNs can serve as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Our research identifies an excellent system to model SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human airways that can be used to test various treatments. Analysis of infection in this model system found that human airway epithelial cell cultures induce a strong proinflammatory cytokine response yet block the production of type I and III IFNs to SARS-CoV-2. However, treatment of airway cultures with the immune molecules type I or type III interferon (IFN) was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, our model system identified type I or type III IFN as potential antiviral treatments for COVID-19 patients.","output":"Type I and Type III Interferons Restrict SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Human Airway Epithelial Cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To quantify the impact of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, and on cardiac structure and function.

Processing the answers of a participant comprises the calculation of 10 scores corresponding to 8 scales measuring several aspects of perceived health and 2 summary components (physical and mental). Surprisingly, no study has compared score values issued from a telephone interview versus those from an internet-based questionnaire self-completion. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the SF-36 score values issued from a telephone interview versus those from an internet-based questionnaire self-completion. METHODS: Patients with an internet connection and returning home after hospital discharge were enrolled in the SENTIPAT multicenter randomized trial on the day of discharge. They were randomized to either self-completing a set of questionnaires using a dedicated website (internet group) or providing answers to the same questionnaires administered during a telephone interview (telephone group). This ancillary study of the trial compared SF-36 data related to the posthospitalization period in these 2 groups. To anticipate the potential unbalanced characteristics of the responders in the 2 groups, the impact of the mode of administration of the questionnaire on score differences was investigated using a matched sample of individuals originating from the internet and telephone groups (1:1 ratio), in which the matching procedure was based on a propensity score approach. SF-36 scores observed in the internet and telephone groups were compared using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and the score differences between the 2 groups were also examined according to Cohen effect size. RESULTS: Overall, 29.2% (245/840) and 75% (630/840) of SF-36 questionnaires were completed in the internet and telephone groups, respectively (P<.001). Globally, the score differences between groups before matching were similar to those observed in the matched sample. Mean scores observed in the telephone group were all above the corresponding values observed in the internet group. After matching, score differences in 6 out of the 8 SF-36 scales were statistically significant, with a mean difference greater than 5 for 4 scales and an associated mild effect size ranging from 0.22 to 0.29, and with a mean difference near this threshold for 2 other scales (4.57 and 4.56) and a low corresponding effect size (0.18 and 0.16, respectively).

Thus, the performance of generic classification models that classify stress status is crude. Building a person-specific model leads to a reliable classification, but it requires the collection of new data to train a new model for every individual and needs periodic upgrades because stress is dynamic. In this paper, a new binary classification (called stressed and non-stressed) approach is proposed for a subjects stress state in which the inter-beat intervals extracted from a photoplethysomogram (PPG) were transferred to spatial images and then to frequency domain images according to the number of consecutive. Then, the convolution neural network (CNN) was used to train and validate the classification accuracy of the persons stress state. Three types of classification models were built: person-specific models, generic classification models, and calibrated-generic classification models. The average classification accuracies achieved by person-specific models using spatial images and frequency domain images were 99.9%, 100%, and 99.8%, and 99.68%, 98.97%, and 96.4% for the training, validation, and test, respectively. By combining 20% of the samples collected from test subjects into the training data, the calibrated generic models accuracy was improved and outperformed the generic performance across both the spatial and frequency domain images. The average classification accuracy of 99.6%, 99.9%, and 88.1%, and 99.2%, 97.4%, and 87.6% were obtained for the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively, using the calibrated generic classification-based method for the series of inter-beat interval (IBI) spatial and frequency domain images. The main contribution of this study is the use of the frequency domain images that are generated from the spatial domain images of the IBI extracted from the PPG signal to classify the stress state of the individual by building person-specific models and calibrated generic models.","output":"Stress Classification Using Photoplethysmogram-Based Spatial and Frequency Domain Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Introduction: Vitamin D supplements are recommended for elderly care home residents with little sunlight exposure. However, their use in care homes is limited and vitamin D deficiency in residents is widespread. This study aimed to understand perceived responsibility for the vitamin D status of residents and the determinants of current practice around supplementation. Methods: Thirteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants in two areas of Southern England including care home managers, general practitioners (GPs) and public health professionals. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results: Inductive thematic analysis identified four themes: medical framing; professional and sector boundaries; awareness of national guidance; and ethical and practical issues. Vitamin D supplements were not routinely given to residents, and most participants, including the GPs, believed the vitamin D status of residents was the responsibility of the GP. Care home managers felt unable to make decisions about vitamin D and vulnerable to suggestions of wrongdoing in administering over-the-counter vitamin tablets. This results in vitamin D requiring prescription by medical professionals and few care home residents receiving vitamin D supplements. Conclusion: The medical framing of vitamin D supplements in care homes is a practical barrier to residents receiving them and is out of step with public health recommendations. Vitamin D levels in care home residents could be improved through universal supplementation. This requires a paradigm shift so that vitamin D is understood as a protective nutrient as well as a medicine, and a public health as well as a medical responsibility. The failure to ensure vitamin D adequacy of residents may emerge as a factor in the spread and severity of COVID-19 in care homes and gives increased urgency to addressing this issue.","output":"Responsibility for vitamin D supplementation of elderly care home residents in England: falling through the gap between medicine and food"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The daily oscillations of bi ological and behavioural processes are controlled by the circadian clock circuitry that drives the physiology of the organism and, in particular, the functioning of the immune system in response to infectious agents.

Although this has been the subject of vigorous debate in laparoscopic hernia repair, the several methods of fixation in open, anterior inguinal hernia repair have seldom been reviewed. The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether there is any difference in patient-based (recurrence, post-operative pain, SSI, quality of life) or surgical outcomes (operative time, length of operative stay) with different fixation methods in open anterior inguinal hernioplasty. METHODS A literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases. Randomised clinical trials assessing more than one method of mesh fixation (or fixation versus no fixation) of mesh in adults (>18 years) in open, anterior inguinal hernia repair, with a minimum of 6-month follow-up and including at least one of the primary outcome measures (recurrence, chronic pain, surgical site infection) were included in the review. Secondary outcomes analysed included post-operative pain (within the first week), quality of life, operative time and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Twelve randomised clinical trials, which included 1,992 primary inguinal hernia repairs, were eligible for inclusion. Four studies compared n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (NB2C) glues to sutures, two compared self-fixing meshes to sutures, four compared fibrin sealant to sutures, one compared tacks to sutures, and one compared absorbable sutures to non-absorbable sutures. The majority of the trials were rated as low or very low-quality studies. There was no significant difference in recurrence or surgical site infection rates between fixation methods. There was significant heterogeneity in the measurement of chronic pain. Three trials reported significantly lower rates of chronic pain with fibrin sealant or glue fixation compared to sutures. A further three studies reported lower pain rates within the first week with non-suture fixation techniques compared to suture fixation. A significant reduction in operative time, ranging form 6 to 17.9 min with non-suture fixation, was reported in five of the studies. Although infrequently measured, there were no significant differences in length of hospital stay or quality of life between fixation methods. CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to promote fibrin sealant, self-fixing meshes or NB2C glues ahead of suture fixation. However, these products have been shown to be at least substantially equivalent, and moderate-quality RCTs have suggested that both fibrin sealant and NB2C glues may have a beneficial effect on reducing immediate post-operative pain and chronic pain in at-risk populations, such as younger active patients. It will ultimately be up to surgeons and health-care policy makers to decide whether based on the limited evidence these products represent a worthwhile cost for their patients.","output":"A systematic review of randomised control trials assessing mesh fixation in open inguinal hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 is currently a pandemic that is spread out the whole world. Several methods have been presented to detect COVID-19 disease. Computer vision methods have been widely utilized to detect COVID-19 by using chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. This work introduces a model for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using CT images. A novel handcrafted feature generation technique and a hybrid feature selector are used together to achieve better performance. The primary goal of the proposed framework is to achieve a higher classification accuracy than convolutional neural networks (CNN) using handcrafted features of the CT images. In the proposed framework, there are four fundamental phases, which are preprocessing, fused dynamic sized exemplars based pyramid feature generation, ReliefF, and iterative neighborhood component analysis based feature selection and deep neural network classifier. In the preprocessing phase, CT images are converted into 2D matrices and resized to 256  256 sized images. The proposed feature generation network uses dynamic-sized exemplars and pyramid structures together. Two basic feature generation functions are used to extract statistical and textural features. The selected most informative features are forwarded to artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN) for classification. ANN and DNN models achieved 94.10% and 95.84% classification accuracies respectively. The proposed fused feature generator and iterative hybrid feature selector achieved the best success rate, according to the results obtained by using CT images.","output":"An automated COVID-19 detection based on fused dynamic exemplar pyramid feature extraction and hybrid feature selection using deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The increasing availability of health information online combined with reduced access to health care providers due to the coronavirus pandemic means that more people are using the internet for health information. However, with no standardised regulation of the internet, the population is vulnerable to misinformation regarding important health information. This review aimed to evaluate the quality and readability of the online information available on emergency contraception (EC) options. STUDY DESIGN: In this descriptive study, a Google search was performed using the term 'emergency contraception options' on 13 April 2020 yielding 232 results. Seventy-one results were excluded (34 inaccessible, 37 contained no medical information). The remaining 161 results were categorised by typology and assessed for credibility (JAMA criteria and HONcode), reliability (DISCERN tool) and readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook). RESULTS: Of all webpages evaluated, the most common typology was governmental. Credibility of web pages was poor (average JAMA score of 1.47 out of 4). Only 10.6% of webpages were HONcode certified. The most common DISCERN category was Fair (29.81%), closely followed by Poor (27.95%) reliability. On average, readability levels were above the recommended grade level for health information. The intrauterine device was discussed least frequently (86.96%) of all the EC options.

We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India. METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3-5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys. FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29a082 individuals from 15a613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 66% (95% CI 58-74). Among 15a084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 71% (62-82). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations. Seroprevalence was highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas. We estimated a cumulative 743 million infections in the country by Aug 18, 2020, with 26-32 infections for every reported COVID-19 case. INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older in India had SARS-CoV-2 infection by Aug 18, 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased approximately tenfold between May and August, 2020. Lower infection-to-case ratio in August than in May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted based on the SUS Dataset (DATASUS). Descriptive analysis of the number of dental procedures and socio-demographic regions was presented and the number of dental procedures during the first semester of 2020 was compared to 2019, using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test ( = 0.05). The number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths were also retrieved from DATASUS. RESULTS: Dental procedures decreased from 47 million in the first semester of 2019 to 15 million in 2020, representing an overall decrease of about 66%.

Thus, we examined the association between caregiving and PE, and its mediators, in a large sample of adults from 48 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS Cross-sectional, community-based data from the World Health Organization (WHO) World Health Survey were analyzed. Informal caregivers referred to those who provided help to a relative or friend (adult or child) in the past year, because this person has a long-term physical or mental illness or disability, or is getting old and weak. PE were assessed using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview psychosis screen. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted. RESULTS Data on 224,842 individuals were analyzed. The mean (SD) age was 38.3 (16.0) years (range 18-120 years) and 50.7% were females. After adjustment for age, sex, and country, in the overall sample, caregiving was associated with 1.67 (95%CI = 1.56-1.79) times higher odds for PE. Sleep/energy explained the largest proportion of the association between caregiving and PE (13.9%), followed by pain/discomfort (11.5%), perceived stress (7.6%), depression (6.2%), and cognition (3.5%). CONCLUSION Caregivers in LMICs are at higher risk of PE.

Wild aquatic birds are believed to be the primary reservoir of all influenza viruses; however, the spillover of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and the recent swine-origin pandemic H1N1 viruses have sparked increased interest in identifying and understanding which and how many species can be infected. Moreover, novel influenza virus sequences were recently isolated from New World bats. Crocodilians have a slow rate of molecular evolution and are the sister group to birds; thus they are a logical reptilian group to explore susceptibility to influenza virus infection and they provide a link between birds and mammals. A primary American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) cell line, and embryos, were infected with four, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains to assess susceptibility to infection. Embryonated alligator eggs supported virus replication, as evidenced by the influenza virus M gene and infectious virus detected in allantoic fluid and by virus antigen staining in embryo tissues. Primary alligator cells were also inoculated with the LPAI viruses and showed susceptibility based upon antigen staining; however, the requirement for trypsin to support replication in cell culture limited replication. To assess influenza virus replication in culture, primary alligator cells were inoculated with H1N1 human influenza or H5N1 HPAI viruses that replicate independent of trypsin. Both viruses replicated efficiently in culture, even at the 30 C temperature preferred by the alligator cells. This research demonstrates the ability of wild-type influenza viruses to infect and replicate within two crocodilian substrates and suggests the need for further research to assess crocodilians as a species potentially susceptible to influenza virus infection.","output":"In ovo and in vitro susceptibility of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) to avian influenza virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Multiple societies including the Fleischner Society do not recommend that CT is routinely used in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, this advice is based on the limited evidence. In this study, we aim to confirm whether it is necessary to do CT scans in SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections by summarizing the longitudinal chest CT and clinical features of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: A total of 33 individuals (14 men and 19 women) with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data of CT positive and negative groups were compared. Longitudinal chest CT scans were reviewed for CT features and analyzed for temporal change. Results: Thirty-two (97%) individuals had positive results for first RT-PCR testing. For clinical data, only monocyte count showed a significant difference between CT positive and negative groups. For first chest CT, only eighteen (54.5%) individuals had abnormal manifestations, common CT features were GGO (88.9%) and consolidation (33.3%), the median number of segments involved was 3.0 (1.0-7.5). No case in CT negative group was abnormal on the follow-up CT. Three patterns of evolution throughout series of CT were observed in CT positive group, including gradual improvement (12, 66.7%), mismatch to improvement (3, 16.7%) and mild progression to improvement (3, 16.7%).

However, the use of meshes has not completely extended in all the cases of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias (LPHH) due to the complications related to them. The aim of this study is to present our long-term results and complications related to Crurasoft? mesh (Bard) for the treatment of LPHH. METHODS From January 2004 to December 2014, 536 consecutive patients underwent open or laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease or LPHH at Ramn y Cajal University Hospital. Primary simple suture of the crura and additional reinforcement with a Crurasoft? mesh (Bard) was performed in 93 patients (17.35 %). Radiologic hiatal hernia recurrence and mesh-related complications were investigated. RESULTS Of the 93 patients undergoing mesh repair, there were 28 male and 65 female with a mean age of 67.27 years (range 22-87 years). Laparoscopic surgery was attended in 88.2 % of the cases, and open surgery in the rest 11.8 %. Mean operative time was 167.05 min (range 90-370 min). Median postoperative stay was 4.79 days (range 1-41 days). Conversion rate was 8.53 % (7 patients). Intraoperative complications were described in 10.75 % (10 patients), but all of them, except in one case, could be managed laparoscopically. Overall postoperative complications rate was 28 %. Early postoperative complications occurred in 11 patients (12 %), respectively, for grades 2 (6 cases), 3b (1 case) and 5 (4 cases) according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Late postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients (16 %), respectively, for grades 1 (7 cases), 2 (2 cases), 3b (5 cases) and 5 (1 case) according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Thirty day-mortality rate was 4.3 %. Mortality rate specific associated with the mesh was 1 %. Reoperation rate was 5.4 %. After a median follow-up of 76.33 months (range 3-130 months), 8 patients (9 %) developed a recurrent hiatal hernia. Mesh was removed in three cases (3.22 %). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the recurrence rate in patients with a Crurasoft? (Bard) is acceptable. However, the rate of postoperative complications and mortality is excessive. The use of meshes in the hiatus keeps on being controversial due to the severe complications related to them. It would be advisable to compare our results in the non-mesh group in terms of recurrences and complications, to determine if meshes in the hiatus should be given in these patients due to its high rate of complications.","output":"Long-term results and complications related to Crurasoft? mesh repair for paraesophageal hiatal hernias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Globally rural medicine is currently suffering from staff shortages. Social and professional isolation are identified as significant pressures on health professionals working in rural areas. Social media (SOME) has created new methods of social engagement where conventional forms have failed. The Rural Family Medicine Caf (RFMC) is a SOME project created to engage and support those interested in rural family medicine thus decreasing occupational isolation. Methods: A quantitative analysis of SOME activity associated with the RFMC was done by measuring the frequency of #ruralcafe, #ruralwomenGP, #ruralGP, #ruralstories, and #ruralmedicine from October 2015 to October 2016 along with the number of Facebook page likes and YouTube views. A time series and regression analysis were done to assess the correlation between the frequencies of hashtag use and the number of new likes or views. A qualitative analysis of the content of tweets using the associated hashtags and comments on the RFMC YouTube videos was then done to assess participants' response to the RFMC. To add context to the data collected, regularly attending participants were invited for a semi-structured interview. Results: There was a positive trend in the number of Facebook page likes (+273%) and Twitter hashtag use (+2,458%) but a negative trend (?92%) in the number of RFMC YouTube views. There was no statistically significant relationship between the number of views on the RFMC YouTube and RFMC associated SOME activity (p = 0.141). A significant relationship was shown between the number of Facebook page likes and the number of views on the RFMC YouTube (p = 0.037). Participants felt positively about the RFMC with recurring themes of; promotion, advocacy, public health, engagement, inspire, sharing, spreading information, feeling connected and general positive comments such as enjoying tweets, great discussion. Participants shared anecdotes, useful links, and book recommendations. Conclusion: The RFMC has seen an increase in the amount of associated SOME activity despite having less viewers. This is most likely due to the few participants of the RFMC continuing the caf discussions on SOME, particularly Twitter, and engaging outside of the RFMC. The RFMC has developed into a virtual community which is reducing occupational isolation for its participants.","output":"The Rural Family Medicine Caf Project: A Social Media Strategy to Reduce Occupational Isolation and Improve Support for Rural Healthcare Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ER Forum, Demo and Posters 2020 was part of the 39th International Con- ference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2020), whose overarching theme was Digi- tal Transformation-Exciting Times for Conceptual Modeling ER 2020 encompasses a broad array of subthemes such as foundations, data and object manage- ment, engineering, business information systems, advanced and cross disciplinary applications and experiences with conceptual modeling ER Forum, Demo and Posters 2020 offer a platform for presenting and discussing novel research ideas addressing any of the ER conference topics as well as new emerging topics related to conceptual modeling, where innovation prevailed over maturity The main goal was to facilitate the interaction, discussion and exchange of ideas among presenters and participants ER Forum, Demo and Posters 2020 accepted four types of submissions: full research papers (14 pages), short research papers (8 pages), tool demonstrations and posters We received 28 submissions, whereas 9 full papers, 4 short papers and 5 demos were accepted During the peer-review process, each submission received three reviews by an international program committee ER 2020 was planned to be held in Vienna, Austria, on November 36, 2020 However, due to the COVID pandemic, the whole conference and satellite events were switched to a virtual format at the same dates Presentation of the publications has started with a Madness-Show including all contributions since the _rst ER Forum in 2017 Due to the virtual format, the Madness-Show was performed as a compilation of 1-minute videos This was followed by live presentations of demonstrations and research papers We would like to thank the international program committee members for their reviews and discussions about the submissions We especially thank the authors who took the time to carefully write up the results of their research and submit papers for consideration Finally, we would like to thank the other members of the Organizing Committee of the ER 2020 for their support and cooperation Copyright ? 2020 for this paper by its authors","output":"Preface of ER forum, demo and posters 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new colorimetric and fluorescent 'on-off' chemosensor, 1O, based on a photochromic diarylethene with a quinoline unit was designed and synthesized.

An approach to stratify patients by likelihood of disease based on rapidly available emergency department (ED) clinical data would offer significant operational and clinical value. The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a predictive model to aid in the discrimination of patients undergoing investigation for COVID\\\\19. METHODS: All patients greater than 18 years presenting to a single academic ED who were tested for COVID\\\\19 during this index ED evaluation were included. Outcome was defined as the result of COVID\\\\19 PCR testing during the index visit or any positive result within the following 7 days. Variables included chest radiograph interpretation, disease specific screening questions, and laboratory data. Three models were developed with a split\\\\sample approach to predict outcome of the PCR test utilizing logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted decision\\\\tree methods. Model discrimination was evaluated comparing AUC and point statistics at a predefined threshold. RESULTS: 1026 patients were included in the study collected between March and April 2020. Overall, there was disease prevalence of 9.6% in the population under study during this time frame. The logistic regression model was found to have an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84 \\\\ 0.94) when including four features: exposure history, temperature, WBC, and chest radiograph result. Random forest method resulted in AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 \\\\ 0.92) and gradient boosting had an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79\\\\0.91).

Biologic meshes have been advocated in parastomal hernia repair due to purported resistance to infection in contaminated fields. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of additionally cross-linked acellular porcine dermal collagen mesh (Permacol) for onlay parastomal hernia repair. METHODS A retrospective review of case notes, and abdominal CT scans when available, was performed for consecutive patients who had a parastomal hernia repaired between January 2007 and May 2010. All hernias were repaired with onlay placement of the biologic mesh. Hernias were classified according to the Moreno-Matias classification where CT scans were available. RESULTS Over a 34-month period, 30 consecutive patients, median age 74 years, 17 female, underwent parastomal hernia repair using onlay biologic mesh. There were 23 paracolostomy and seven paraileostomy hernias. The hernia was primary in 26 patients. Pre-operative CT scans were available in 18 patients (Moreno-Matias Type 1 = 1, Type 2 = 4, Type 3 = 13). There was one perioperative death, and 29 patients were available for follow-up, and median duration of follow-up (either CT or clinical) was 36 months (range 3-79). Twenty-six patients developed recurrence of the parastomal hernia (89.6%), and median time to recurrence was 10 months (range 3-72),with Moreno-Matias Type 1 = 0, Type 2 = 4, Type 3 = 14, unknown = 8. Fifteen out of 26 patients have had repairs of the recurrence using a variety of techniques. Of these, 10 patients have had further recurrence.

Objective: Identify subgroups of youth with ASD/NDD based on the pandemic impact on symptoms and service changes, as well as predictors of outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a naturalistic observational study conducted across 14 North American and European clinical and/or research sites. Parent responses on the Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey Initiative (CRISIS) adapted for Autism and Related Neurodevelopmental Conditions (AFAR) were cross-sectionally collected from April to October 2020. The sample included 1275, 5-21 year-old youth with ASD and/or NDD who were clinically well-characterized prior to the pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: To identify impact subgroups, hierarchical clustering analyzed eleven AFAR factors measuring pre- to pandemic changes in clinically relevant symptoms and service access. Random forest classification assessed the relative contribution in predicting subgroup membership of 20 features including socio-demographics, pre-pandemic service, and clinical severity along with indices of COVID-19 related experiences and environments empirically-derived from AFAR parent responses and global open sources. Results: Clustering analyses revealed four ASD/NDD impact subgroups. One subgroup - broad symptom worsening only (20% of the aggregate sample) - included youth with worsening symptoms that were above and beyond that of their ASD/NDD peers and with similar service disruptions as those in the aggregate average. The three other subgroups showed symptom changes similar to the aggregate average but differed in service access: primarily modified services (23%), primarily lost services (6%), and average services/symptom changes (53%). Pre-pandemic factors (e.g., number of services), pandemic environments and experiences (e.g., COVID-19 cases, related restrictions, COVID-19 Worries), and age emerged in unique combinations as distinct protective or risk factors for each subgroup. Together they highlighted the role of universal risk factors, such as risk perception, and the protective role of services before and during the pandemic, in middle childhood. Conclusions and Relevance: Concomitant assessment of changes in both symptoms and services access is critical to understand heterogeneous impact of the pandemic on ASD/NDD youth.

Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic further increase rates of child poverty due to widespread job and income loss and economic insecurity among families. Poverty leads to unequal distribution of power and resources, which impacts the economic, material, environmental and psychosocial conditions in which children live. There is evidence that poverty is associated with adverse child health and developmental outcomes in the short term, as well as increased risk of chronic diseases and mental illnesses over the life course. Over the past decade, advances in genomic and epigenomic research have helped elucidate molecular mechanisms that could in part be responsible for these long-term effects. Here, we review evidence suggestive of biological embedding of early life poverty in three, interacting physiological systems that are potential contributors to the increased risk of disease: the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, the brain, and the immune system. We also review interventions that have been developed to both eliminate childhood poverty and alleviate its impact on pediatric development and health. Pertinently, studies estimate that the costs of child poverty, calculated by increased healthcare expenditures and loss of productivity, are immense.

Among them, 9,810 patients with &#8805;2 CBC records from Hubei were assigned to the training cohort. CBC parameters were analyzed as potential predictors for all-cause mortality and were selected by the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Findings: Five risk factors were derived to construct a composite score (PAWNN score) using the Cox regression model, including platelet counts, age, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. The PAWNN score showed good accuracy for predicting mortality in 10-fold cross-validation (AUROCs 0.92-0.93) and subsets with different quartile intervals of follow-up and preexisting diseases. The performance of the score was further validated in 2,949 patients with only 1 CBC record from the Hubei cohort (AUROC 0.97) and 227 patients from the Italian cohort (AUROC 0.80). The latent Markov model (LMM) demonstrated that the PAWNN score has good prediction power for transition probabilities between different latent conditions.

Median methylprednisolone cumulative doses were significantly lower (360 mg [IQR 360C842] vs. 870 mg [IQR 364C1451]; p = 0.007), and administered for a shorter time (median of 4.00 days [3.00C17.5] vs. 18.5 days [3.00C53.2]; p = 0.011) in the experimental group than in the control group. Although not statistically significant, those receiving the experimental therapy showed a numerically lower all-cause mortality than those receiving SoC, especially at day 10 [2 (7.41%) vs. 5 (17.9%); OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.05C2.1); p = 0.282]. The total number of non-serious adverse events was 42 in each the two groups. Those receiving experimental treatment had a numerically higher rate of non-serious infectious adverse events [16 (38%) vs. 10 (24%)] and serious infectious adverse events [7 (35%) vs. 3 (23%)] than those receiving SoC. Conclusions: The combined use of methylprednisolone pulses plus tacrolimus, in addition to the SoC, did not significantly improve the time to clinical stability or other secondary outcomes compared with the SoC alone in severe COVID-19. Although not statistically significant, patients receiving the experimental therapy had numerically lower all-cause mortality than those receiving SoC, supporting recent non-randomized studies with calcineurin inhibitors. It is noteworthy that the present trial had a limited sample size and several other limitations. Therefore, further RCTs should be done to assess the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus to tackle the inflammatory stages of COVID-19.

Methods The clinical course of the disease and the autopsy findings of seven deceased patients with verified COVID-19 were analyzed. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan was routinely performed while CT pulmonary angiography and a duplex ultrasound scan (DUS) of the lower limbs were used in cases of suspected VTE. The VTE prophylaxis was administered to all patients with intermediate or therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin. The histological examination of the lung tissue and other organs was performed with particular attention paid to the pulmonary vasculature. Results Venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis in one patient and pulmonary artery thrombosis in two patients, was confirmed by imaging tests despite anticoagulation. Systemic thrombolysis was performed in two patients with putative and confirmed pulmonary embolism. An autopsy revealed the signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome in all seven patients. Abnormalities of lung vessels were found in all cases and were represented by dystrophy and necrosis in the endothelium and muscle fibers, and by infiltration by plasmatic cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Multiple clots of variable maturity were observed. All those changes developed despite anticoagulation and were preserved after systemic thrombolysis. Conclusion Inflammatory and prothrombotic changes in the arterial wall in parallel with the lack of lung perfusion may cause diffuse arterial thrombosis in the lungs.

Whilst farm businesses face increasing challenges in terms of economic stability and traditional production methods, this paper considers the role of renewable energy production as a form of diversification. The study adopts mixed methods as a means of undertaking an in-depth investigation into the role of renewable energy generation in supporting agribusinesses in Wales. Initially a questionnaire obtained 118 responses from farmers in Wales. Subsequently, 15 follow-up semi-structured interviews with farmers were conducted to further investigate the issues from the initial questionnaire. The theoretical contribution of this paper is a segmentation of farmer businesses which allows for distinctions to be made of different attitudes to off-farm income and the adoption of renewable energy sources. Five farm types were identified, varying in relation to farm characteristics, attitudes to diversification, access to renewable energy and resource allocation. These farm types highlight the need for specific policies towards facilitating the increase in renewable energy along with sustaining farming incomes.

Now, a turning point has been reached regarding the interactions between health and the built environment and the contributions made by urban planning and other built environment disciplines. In the context of the post-pandemic city, there is a need to develop a health-led temporary urbanism agenda than can be implemented in various settings both in the Global South and North. RECENT FINDINGS: Health-led temporary urbanism requires a reinterrogation of current models of urban development including designing multifunctional spaces in urban environments that provide sites for temporary urbanism-related activities. A healthy city is an adaptable city and one that provides opportunities for citizen-led interventions intended to enhance well-being by blending the temporary with the permanent and the planned with the improvised.

The detection of these viruses with novel technologies is vital in timely prevention and treatment strategies for epidemics and pandemics. Respiratory viruses can be detected from saliva, swab samples, nasal fluid, and blood, and collected samples can be analyzed by various techniques. Conventional methods for virus detection are based on techniques relying on cell culture, antigen-antibody interactions, and nucleic acids. However, these methods require trained personnel as well as expensive equipment. Microfluidic technologies, on the other hand, are one of the most accurate and specific methods to directly detect respiratory tract viruses. During viral infections, the production of detectable amounts of relevant antibodies takes a few days to weeks, hampering the aim of prevention. Alternatively, nucleic acidCbased methods can directly detect the virus-specific RNA or DNA region, even before the immune response. There are numerous methods to detect respiratory viruses, but direct detection techniques have higher specificity and sensitivity than other techniques. This review aims to summarize the methods and technologies developed for microfluidic-based direct detection of viruses that cause respiratory infection using different detection techniques. Microfluidics enables the use of minimal sample volumes and thereby leading to a time, cost, and labor effective operation. Microfluidic-based detection technologies provide affordable, portable, rapid, and sensitive analysis of intact virus or virus genetic material, which is very important in pandemic and epidemic events to control outbreaks with an effective diagnosis.","output":"Microfluidic-based virus detection methods for respiratory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute and highly contagious disease in small ruminants that causes significant economic losses in developing countries. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that both autophagy and apoptosis are important cellular mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis, and they participate in the host response to pathogens. However, the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in host cells during PPRV infection has not been clarified. In this study, autophagy was induced upon virus infection in caprine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), as determined by the appearance of double- and single-membrane autophagy-like vesicles, LC3-I/LC3-II conversion, and p62 degradation. We also found that PPRV infection triggered a complete autophagic response, most likely mediated by the non-structural protein C and nucleoprotein N. Moreover, our results suggest that autophagy not only promotes the replication of PPRV in EECs but also provides a potential mechanism for inhibiting PPRV-induced apoptosis. Inhibiting autophagosome formation by wortmannin and knocking down the essential autophagic proteins Beclin-1 and ATG7 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in EECs in PPRV infection. However, inhibiting autophagosome and lysosome fusion by NH(4)Cl and chloroquine did not increase the number of apoptotic cells. Collectively, these data are the first to indicate that PPRV-induced autophagy inhibits caspase-dependent apoptosis and thus contributes to the enhancement of viral replication and maturity in host cells.","output":"Autophagy enhances the replication of Peste des petits ruminants virus and inhibits caspase-dependent apoptosis in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have proposed MultiLexANFIS which is an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that incorporates inputs from multiple lexicons to perform sentiment analysis of social media posts.

Here, a MADS-box transcription factor (MdMADS6) was identified using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay as a candidate protein that interacts with MdHDA19 during apple fruit ripening. Furthermore, Y2H, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and pull-down assays were used to confirm the interaction between MdHDA19 and MdMADS6. Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation and yeast one-hybrid assays showed that MdMADS6 promoted carotenoid accumulation in apple fruit by acting on the downstream target genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis. In summary, we conclude that, in the early stages of fruit development, the expression of MdMADS6 was maintained at lower levels, where it interacted with MdHDA19 to form a protein complex that inhibited the expression of the downstream genes. At the late stages of fruit development, active expression of MdMADS6 dissociated the protein complex of MdMADS6 and MdHDA19 and consequently promoted the expression of carotenoid biosynthesis genes as well as carotenoid accumulation.","output":"MdMADS6 Recruits Histone Deacetylase MdHDA19 to Repress the Expression of the Carotenoid Synthesis-Related Gene MdCCD1 during Fruit Ripening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the care of hip fracture patients remains a clinical priority. Our study aims to investigate the 30-day mortality rate of hip fracture patients during the first 30 days of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A single-center, observational, prospective study of patients presenting with hip fractures. Data collection started from day 0 of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and continued for 30 days. We collected data on time to surgery, Clinical Frailty Scale score, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, COVID-19 infection status, 30-day mortality, and cause of death. For comparison, we collected retrospective data during the same 30-day period in 2018, 2019, and the previous 6 months (Control groups A, B, and C, respectively). RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included in the study. There was no difference in age or gender between the Study and Control groups. The 30-day mortality rate of the Study group was 16.3%, which was higher than Control groups A (P = 0.022), B (P = 0.003) and C (P = 0.001).

The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of retro-pubic tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) 20 years after implantation for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in two urogynaecologic units in two countries. All the patients involved were consecutive women with urodynamically proven pure SUI treated by TVT. The patients underwent preoperative clinical and urodynamic evaluations. Subjective outcomes, objective outcomes and adverse events were recorded during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients underwent a TVT surgical procedure. Twenty years after surgery, 32 out of 36 patients (88.8%) declared themselves cured (p = 0.98). Similarly, 33 out of these 36 patients (91.7%) were objectively cured (p = 0.98). No significant deterioration of subjective and objective cure rates was observed over time (p for trend 0.50 and 0.48). Fifteen of the 36 patients (41.6%) at the 20-year follow-up reported the onset of de novo overactive bladder (OAB) (p = 0.004). No significant vaginal bladder or urethral erosion or de novo dyspareunia was recorded and no patient required tape release or resection during this period. The cause of death of seven out of ten women who died in the last year of the follow-up period was coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19).

Purple soil is characterized by low N, P, and organic C contents that influence crop productivity. However, the optimal organic materials that can be used to improve purple soil quality and crop yields remain to be clarified. Here, we conducted a 13-year field experiment (from 2007 to 2019) in Sichuan Province, China, intending to assess the long-term influence of various combinations of organic materials and chemical fertilizers on soil enzymatic activities, microbial communities, and crop yields. Treatments included chemical fertilizer alone (NPK), NPK plus returned straw (NPKS), NPK plus pig manure (NPKM), NPK plus fungal residue (NPKF), and NPK plus green manure (Vicia villosa Rothvar.) (NPKG). Results showed that NPKM and NPKF treatments significantly increased the average yields of maize (7.9 and 6.4%, respectively) and wheat (15.7 and 12.9%, respectively) relative to NPK treatment. The highest sustainable yield index value of maize and wheat was observed in NPKF treatment. The long-term application of fungal residue (NPKF) significantly increased soil organic C and available P contents, relative to NPKNPKS and NPKG treatments, and soil organic C content increased from 6.95 to 9.12  1.06 g kg?1 and available P content from 6.87 to 12.26  2.23 mg kg?1. Relative to NPK treatment, NPKF treatment significantly enhanced soil microbial biomasses (C, N, and P) and soil C-, N- and P-cycling enzyme activities but significantly decreased soil pH. The soil enzyme index following NPKF treatment was significantly higher relative to other treatments and was 208.6% higher than NPK treatment. Additionally, relative to NPK treatment, NPKF treatment altered soil microbial community structure, and significantly increased the rate of G+/G? and cy19/18:17c. Soil microbial biomasses N, Nitrate N, and available P were the main factors regulating the change of microbial community in purple soil. We, therefore, conclude that NPKF treatment is an effective fertilization strategy for improving purple soil quality and crop yields. ?

In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the ability of long PP sessions to improve oxygenation in awake ICU patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to COVID-19. METHODS: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Galicia (code No. 2020-188), and all patients provided informed consent. In this case series, awake patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at University Hospital of Santiago from March 21 to April 5, 2020 were prospectively analyzed. Patients were instructed to remain in PP as long as possible, until the patient felt too tired to maintain that position. Light sedation was administered with dexmedetomidine. The following information were collected: number and duration of PP sessions, StO2 and blood gases before, during and following a PP session, need of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission and ICU outcome. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) were fit to estimate changes from baseline with a random effect for patient. RESULTS: Seven patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID 19 were included. All patients received at least one PP session. A total of 16 PP sessions were performed in the 7 patients during the period study. The median duration of PP sessions was 10 hours. Dexmedetomidine was used in all PP sessions. Oxygenation increased in all sixteen sessions performed in the seven patients. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) significantly increased during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 110 [19; 202]) and after PP, albeit not significantly (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 38 [-9.2; 85]) compared with previous supine position. Similarly, tissue oxygenation underwent a small improvement during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 2.6% [0.69; 4.6]) without significant changes after PP. Two patients required intubation. All patients were discharged from the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PP improved oxygenation in ICU patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS. PP was relatively well tolerated in our patients and may be a simple strategy to improve oxygenation trying to reduce patients in mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU, especially in COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Effectiveness of prone positioning in non-intubated ICU patients with moderate to severe ARDS by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen unprecedented use of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing for epidemiological tracking and identification of emerging variants.

Prior studies reported a decrease in the number of stroke and TIAs admissions. Most reports have been from single hospitals, there is no data available on the impact on a statewide level. Methods: A retrospective analysis of stroke quality improvement data reported to the State of Maryland. These data are from Primary, Thrombectomy-Capable, and Comprehensive Stroke Centers. The number of admissions for stroke overall and by stroke subtype are reported and compared for March-June 2020 vs. March-June 2019. Last known well (LKW) to hospital arrival, intravenous tPA (IV tPA) and thrombectomy rates were analyzed. Results: The overall number of stroke admissions from March-June 2020 compared to March-June 2019 was 1,001 vs. 1,203 in March, 809 vs. 1,112 in April, 950 vs. 1206 in May, and 937 vs. 1,261 in June. There was an average 21% decrease for the 4-month period in 2020 compared to 2019. For ischemic stroke, there was a decrease in hospital admission for each month in 2020 vs. 2019: 740 vs. 922 in March, 606 vs. 866 in April, 721 vs. 906 in May, and 698 vs. 880 in June. TIAs admission rates were similarly decreased in 2020 vs. 2019: 116 vs. 136, 74 vs. 97, 111 vs. 137, and 107 vs. 111. The number of ICH admissions in 2020 vs. 2019 was 100 vs. 107 in March, 90 vs. 112 in April, 96 vs. 116 in May, and 103 vs. 121 in June. Median LKW well to hospital arrival was 292 vs. 254 min in March, 383 vs. 293 min in April, 291.5 vs. 247 min in May, and 320 vs. 292 min in June. There was about 1% decrease in thrombectomy rates in the 4-month period in 2020 compared to 2019. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Maryland there was a consistentdecrease in the volume of stroke admissions. Median LKW to hospital arrival was also increased,supporting evidence for of a delay in stroke care. While reasons for these changes need to befurther explored, our findings suggest that public health campaigns for the pandemic should takeinto account and not adversely affect the acute care of unrelated medical emergencies.","output":"The collateral damage of COVID-19 pandemic on stroke care: Data from a state stroke registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Potential retinal adverse events after COVID-19 vaccinations reported previously include paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM), acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), and central serous chorioretinopathy. We report four cases of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), one case of PAMM, and one case of AMN that occurred after administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of six patients who presented to Yame General Hospital or Oita University Hospital from July through October 2021. RESULTS: Four patients (2 males) presented with visual field defects associated with BRAO, one male patient with PAMM, and one female patient with AMN after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mean age was 59.3 years; the mean best-corrected visual acuity was 20/21. The mean time from the last vaccination to the onset of visual field defect was 22.8 days. Five patients had received two doses of the vaccine and one patient one dose. Patients medical history included diabetes mellitus in case 2, hypertension in cases 2, 3 and 6, and Alport syndrome and end-stage renal disease in case 6 for which the patient was undergoing regular hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Although rare, retinal adverse events may occur after COVID-19 vaccinations. Further studies with a larger sample size should determine whether these retinal abnormalities are causally associated with COVID-19 vaccinations or just coincidental. Potential risks of BRAO/PAMM/AMN after COVID-19 vaccinations must be carefully weighed against the substantial benefit of COVID-19 vaccinations.","output":"Branch Retinal Artery Occlusions, Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy and Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy After COVID-19 Vaccinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive work is being done to form targeted drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection;however, it is imperative to have a safe and effective vaccine against the same to win the war against this pandemic.

Methods: Seven online, text-based focus groups were conducted with a total of 42 participants. Eligible participants included adults living in Canada that prepared meals at home at least once per week. Focus groups took place from May-June 2020 and followed a semi-structured question guide. Participants were asked about their practices relating to food preparation habits at home; food purchasing, handling, and storage; hand hygiene and sanitation; and information sources about food safety concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. A thematic analysis was conducted using the Theoretical Domains Framework as a coding guide. Results: The most notable changes in behaviour since the onset of the pandemic were seen in participants' hand washing, sanitation, and grocery shopping practices. Participants tended to perceive grocery store employees, shoppers, and food service staff as having inadequate sanitation precautions and, therefore, as a source of COVID-19 transmission risk. They heavily relied on public health, medical, and government officials as sources of information. Feelings of stress and anxiety appeared to be linked to certain sanitation behaviours. Many participants displayed a general apathy toward routine food safety practices such as safe food storage at home. Conclusion: This work supports the need for clear and concise messaging for hand hygiene and food safety behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future times of crisis. It also highlights a need for ongoing food safety messaging.","output":"\\"I walk around like my hands are covered in mud\\": food safety and hand hygiene behaviours of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Signs and symptoms associated with testicular and paratesticular structures should not be underestimated because they may hide diseases requiring immediate evaluation and treatment, such as germline tumors or sarcomas, with the latter histotypes being more common among elderly patients Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy has led to a diagnostic delay of several malignancies and the impact of this delay has likely been underestimated Paratesticular leiomyosarcoma represents a very rare subtype of sarcoma Here we describe a 57-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and a voluminous mass in the right paratesticular region At the appearance of the scrotal mass 9 months prior, he had refused to undergo a urological evaluation due to fear of contracting COVID-19 We present this case for its histological rarity and to document a case of diagnostic and therapeutic delay during the pandemic in Lombardy","output":"Delayed Diagnosis of a Testicular Mass During COVID-19 Pandemic in Lombardy: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Search engines and the SPSS Python R extension were used to analyse COVID-19 healthcare big data information stored on the internet to identify significant limitations of statistical techniques.

In particular, workability is an emerging phenomenon that predominantly affects healthcare workers. This study aims to assess physical health status and workability among ageing healthcare workers. A cross-sectional study using the Work Ability Index (WAI) was performed. Data were collected in a university hospital in northern Italy. Data were collected voluntary through a questionnaire. Healthcare workers participating in the survey were contacted personally by two resident physicians. Thus, the total number of study participants was 220 among nursing aides, nurses, and physicians. Data were analyzed by performing ANOVA and regression to assess the differences between the healthcare workers and age groups. A generalized linear model was tested to evaluate the effect of age and task on workability. The majority of healthcare workers had good WAI values. Physicians' workability was higher than nursing aides. Nursing aides suffered more from cardiovascular disorders, while physicians and nurses had more musculoskeletal disorders. However, the distribution was statistically different (2 = 24.03, p = 0.00), as most of the physicians' workability values were good and good, while those of nursing aides and nurses were good and medium. In line with previous studies, the decrease in WAI with ageing is strictly dependent on the type of task assigned. Due to heavy physical tasks, nurses and nurses' aides showed a greater WAI than physicians. This study highlights the critical issues faced by ageing healthcare professionals. In the near future, it is necessary to find solutions to cope with these changes and devise possible interventions aimed at ameliorating workability.","output":"Physical Health and Work Ability among Healthcare Workers.

METHODS A literature search in three databases was performed according to the PRISMA statement. Studies comparing PR versus ER for ATAAD were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 27 studies incorporating 7113 patients (PR: 5080; ER: 2033) were included. Patients undergoing PR presented decreased in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.67 [95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 0.53-0.85]; p < 0.01) and post-operative bleeding (OR 0.75 [95% CI 0.60-0.95]; p = 0.02) compared to ER. Meta-regression analysis revealed that in-hospital mortality was not influenced by differences regarding the extent of dissection (p = 0.43). Cardiopulmonary bypass time (SMD:-0.93 [95% CI - 1.22, - 0.66]; p < 0.01) and length of hospital stay (SMD:-0.19 [95% CI - 0.34, - 0.05]; p = 0.01) were also lower in the PR group, while there was no difference in terms of renal failure and permanent neurological deficit. The ER approach demonstrated a lower post-discharge mortality compared to PR (OR 1.46 [95% CI 1.09, 1.97]; p = 0.01), while the post-discharge reoperation rate was comparable between the two groups. 1 and 3-year overall survival (OS) were comparable between PR and ER (OR 1.05, [95% CI 0.77-1.44]; p = 0.76) and (OR 1.27 [95% CI 0.86-1.86]; p = 0.23), respectively. The 5-year OS (OR 1.67 [95% CI 1.16-2.41]; p = 0.01) was in favor of the PR arm. CONCLUSIONS In patients with ATAAD, PR was associated with lower odds of in-hospital mortality but higher odds of late mortality.

Methods. Thirty-two children and adolescents with transplanted kidneys and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were randomized 1:1 to receive the pandemic vaccine upon enrolment and the seasonal vaccine 1 month later (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls), or to receive the two vaccines simultaneously upon enrolment (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls). Results. When the pandemic vaccine was administered sequentially to the seasonal vaccine, it was significantly less immunogenic in the patients than in the controls (P < 0.05); when it was administered together with the seasonal vaccine, the immune response of both patients (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.05) was significantly greater than when it was administered sequentially. Seroconversion rates and the geometric mean titres of all of the seasonal antigens were significantly lower in the patients, regardless of the type of vaccine administration (P < 0.05). Simultaneous administration was associated with a better immune response against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens in both patients and controls, and did not increase the mild local and systemic reactions. No impact on renal function was observed. Conclusions. Paediatric kidney transplant recipients have a lower immune response to the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted and seasonal virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccines than healthy controls.

Working remotely from the VA facility, students spent 2 hours per week using information from VA clinical dashboards and electronic health records (EHRs) to perform population health activities. Beginning August 2020, women's health initiatives were incorporated. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate student learning and productivity in an established remote population health IPPE that included women's health initiatives during a coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related university closure. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: During 2 IPPE semesters, activities of second-year student pharmacists were tracked. The course is typically conducted remotely at the university; however, owing to COVID-19 restrictions, students completed the course from their homes. Students were granted remote access privileges to VA's EHR and precepted by VA clinical pharmacists using Microsoft Teams. Students performed prescription drug monitoring program activities; reviewed outside medical records for breast and cervical cancer screening results, laboratory test results for diabetes, and medication safety monitoring; and documented progress notes. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Population health IPPEs can be tailored each semester to include a variety of initiatives. Activities are conducted remotely, eliminating the need for space and computers at the VA facility. The remote design enabled students to continue the IPPE during COVID-19 restrictions. EVALUATION: Students completed a survey about their confidence performing population health activities at baseline and at the completion of the IPPE. Student workload data were collected over 2 semesters. RESULTS: A total of 70 students reviewed 8865 health records and documented 5322 progress notes. Statistically significant improvements in student's reported abilities were reported from baseline to course completion such as explaining breast and cervical cancer screening recommendations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a six-month home-based resistance-training program on muscle health and physical performance in healthy older subjects during the unique condition of home confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. This was a randomized-controlled study that enrolled older participants that were allocated to either an experimental group performing the six-months exercise prescription (EXE) or a control group (CON). At the beginning (PRE), and after 6 months (POST), participants were assessed for muscle strength, balance, gait assessment and body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Normality distribution of data was checked with the DAgostino and Pearson test and changes between PRE and POST were assessed by paired Students t-test while percentage and absolute changes between groups at POST were tested by unpaired t-test. Results. Nine participants were included for the final analysis: EXE, n = 5 (age: 66  4; BMI: 27.5  3.7) and CON, n = 4 (age: 71  9; BMI: 24.2  4.1). Significant PRE-to-POST changes were observed in the EXE group only in the chair-stand test (+19.8%, p = 0.048 and ES:1.0, moderate) and in total fat mass (+5.0%, p = 0.035 and ES:1.4, large) with no between-group differences. Moreover, EXE had significantly higher absolute thigh CSA values than CON at POST (14.138  2977 vs. 9039  1015, p = 0.0178, ES = 1.7). No other within- and between-group differences were detected. Conclusions. The home-based resistance-training program during the lockdown period, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, determined only within-group improvement in lower limb muscle strength but not in muscle mass and composition in older subjects. Home confinement may partially explain the increase in total body fat due to a reduced daily PA regime and altered diet pattern.","output":"Home-Based Resistance Training for Older Subjects during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy: Preliminary Results of a Six-Months RCT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing studies show that inflammatory processes may be involved in depressive disorders. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) modulates tissue microglial M1 phenotypic changes to the M2 phenotype, which is implicated in protection against inflammatory diseases. We have reported that the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) display anti-inflammatory activity. In this study we explored whether the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of ADSCs was related to Nrf2. ADSCs were isolated from mouse fat pads and intravenously administered to chronic mild stress (CMS)-exposed C57BL/6 mice at the dose of 1  10(6) once a week for 3 weeks. We showed that ADSC administration significantly remedied CMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in sucrose preference test, tail suspension test, and forced swim test accompanied by suppressing microglial activation and the expression of inflammatory factors including MCP-1, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6. Furthermore, ADSC administration promoted both the expression of BDNF and TrkB, and promoted Nrf2/HO-1 signaling but suppressed TLR4/NF-B signaling in brain tissue. In order to elucidate the role of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in ADSC-caused neuroprotection, Nrf2-modified ADSCs were cocultured with BV2 microglial cells, then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Downregulation of Nrf2 in ADSCs decreased the protective effects of ADSCs against LPS-induced microglial activation and M1 polarization. Nrf2 overexpression in ADSCs markedly suppressed LPS-induced TLR4 and NF-B expression in microglial cells. These results suggest a possible antidepressive mechanism correlated with microglial polarization for anti-inflammatory agents, which may provide a new microglia-targeted strategy for depression therapy.","output":"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells protect against CMS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice via regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 and TLR4/NF-B signaling pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread world-wide since December 2019, affecting millions of people and killing thousands.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted because both medications cause corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation. Whether QTc duration significantly varies during the day, potentially requiring multiple ECGs, remains to be established. METHODS: We performed 12?lead ECGs and 12?lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged <80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days.

ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02). Four patients had a QTc  480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p = .03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p < .01) compared with those with QTc < 480 ms.

The aim of this study was to compile this information for 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on an online survey sent to the heads of dermatology departments at public hospitals in Spain. RESULTS: Of the 162 department heads contacted, 59 answered the survey (participation rate, 36.4%). General findings included a shortage of staff, especially dermatologists, in hospitals of low and medium complexity. The main reason given for the shortage of dermatologists was a lack of interested applicants. Large hospital complexes had more infrastructure and equipment. Over 50% of the departments surveyed used a combination of in-person and virtual visits. Psoriasis units were the most common specialized care units. Approximately 75% of the hospitals had operating rooms with an anesthetist. More complex procedures such as sentinel lymph node biopsy and Mohs micrographic surgery were performed more often in large hospital complexes. Hospitalization and the presence of dermatology residents working call shifts were also more common in these hospitals. Teaching and research activity differed according to hospital complexity.

PURPOSE: To examine the impact of CR closure during the first COVID-19-related national lockdown in Austria in spring 2020 on patients' maintenance of physical activity, physical fitness levels, and cardiovascular risk profile; and to describe the patient experience of lack of group-based CR training due to COVID-19. METHODS: This mixed-methods study recruited patients from an outpatient CR centre in Austria during summer 2020. Eligibility criteria were regular attendance at weekly group-based exercise training at the centre until the COVID-19-related lockdown in March 2020; pre-lockdown completion of a maximal cycle ergometer test; no contraindications for maximal exercise testing; and no new complaints limiting exercise performance. Participants underwent post-lockdown quantitative assessment of physical fitness (maximal cycle ergometer testing, submaximal cycle ergometer training session at individual pre-lockdown settings) and cardiovascular risk status. These were compared with pre-lockdown data from medical records. Participants gave qualitative interviews about their experience of maintaining exercise during lockdown. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and interpreted using framework analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight (57%) of 49 eligible patients were recruited, 1 withdrew, and 27 completed all study procedures. Two participants were excluded from analysis of physical fitness data, due to subsequent diagnosis of new complaints limiting exercise performance. Mean (SD) age was 69 (7.4) years. Six (22%) were female. Median (IQR) time since first CVD event was 8 (5.5, 9) years. In maximal ergometer testing, 14 (56%) had deteriorated, 10 (40%) were unchanged, and 1 (4%) had improved post-lockdown. At group level, power was significantly reduced (maximal ergometer testing, submaximal ergometer training), whereas CVD risk factors remained unchanged from pre- to post-lockdown (table 1). Qualitative analysis corroborated the negative impact of the closure of CR classes (table 2). CONCLUSIONS: This patient cohort was heterogeneous with respect to physical activity levels and exercise capacity, yet overall motivated and experienced in exercise training, having regularly attended training sessions at the centre before the lockdown. Despite individually seeking out alternative exercise options during lockdown, group average exercise capacity deteriorated even in this motivated and exercise-conscious group. This highlights the importance of providing group-based opportunities for supervised high intensity training for patients who engage well in such a setting, and the detrimental impact of disruption to this type of CR service.

However, -Klotho also exists in a circulating form, with pleiotropic, but incompletely understood functions and regulation. Therefore, we undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis followed by Mendelian randomization (MR) of circulating -Klotho levels. Plasma -Klotho levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (mothers) cohorts, followed by a GWAS meta-analysis in 4376 individuals across the two cohorts. Six signals at five loci were associated with circulating -Klotho levels at genome-wide significance (P < 5  10(?8)), namely ABO, KL, FGFR1, and two post-translational modification genes, B4GALNT3 and CHST9. Together, these loci explained >9% of the variation in circulating -Klotho levels. MR analyses revealed no causal relationships between -Klotho and renal function, FGF23-dependent factors such as vitamin D and phosphate levels, or bone mineral density. The screening for genetic correlations with other phenotypes followed by targeted MR suggested causal effects of liability of Crohns disease risk [Inverse variance weighted (IVW) beta = 0.059 (95% confidence interval 0.026, 0.093)] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [?0.198 (?0.332, ?0.063)] on -Klotho. Our GWAS findings suggest that two enzymes involved in post-translational modification, B4GALNT3 and CHST9, contribute to genetic influences on -Klotho levels, presumably by affecting protein turnover and stability. Subsequent evidence from MR analyses on -Klotho levels suggest regulation by mechanisms besides phosphate-homeostasis and raise the possibility of cross-talk with FGF19- and FGF21-dependent pathways, respectively. Significance statement: -Klotho as a transmembrane protein is well investigated along the endocrine FGF23--Klotho pathway. However, the role of the circulating form of -Klotho, which is generated by cleavage of transmembrane -Klotho, remains incompletely understood. Genetic analyses might help to elucidate novel regulatory and functional mechanisms. The identification of genetic factors related to circulating -Klotho further enables MR to examine causal relationships with other factors. The findings from the first GWAS meta-analysis of circulating -Klotho levels identified six genome-wide significant signals across five genes. Given the function of two of the genes identified, B4GALNT3 and CHST9, it is tempting to speculate that post-translational modification significantly contributes to genetic influences on -Klotho levels, presumably by affecting protein turnover and stability.","output":"GWAS meta-analysis followed by Mendelian randomization revealed potential control mechanisms for circulating -Klotho levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research focuses on the results of the survey conducted in Moscow State University of Food Production (MSUFP) to define the problems connected with professional L2 Discourse formation for the second-year technical students in the context of e-learning environment.

It also responds to the article in Sustainable Earth by Peter Hancock In Praise of Civicide by creating a more hopeful vision of the future. Peter suggests the only hope is in psychological mind-sets that can change behaviour as nothing else will stop the path to destruction from present growth in population, the economy and technology. Rather than seeing inevitable civicidal elements, as devised in the IPAT model used by Peter and many others to explain global environmental destruction, the paper reassesses the fundamentals of this model developed by Paul and Anne Ehrlich in the 1960's. As the global economy has collapsed and environmental impacts improved everywhere, the Hancock argument based on IPAT would seem to have support. The paper shows how it is possible to grow again in the three IPAT factors if the world moves beyond sustainable development which just minimises impact to regenerative development which reclaims environmental impacts. If all three elements combine to create uncontrolled growth as was happening in the 60s to 80s then civicide is inevitable, but not if they change to regenerative development. The three stages of exploitive, sustainable and regenerative development turn IPAT from being negative to positive about civilization. These choices are very stark in the 2020s. The technological possibilities of a regenerative future are outlined and the fundamentals needed for a sustainable earth are sketched, providing some evidence of hope for using the present pandemic and economic collapse as the basis for regenerating civilization not praising civicide.","output":"Hope in a time of civicide: regenerative development and IPAT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined.

Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters.

Elevated expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on cardiac cells of patients with heart diseases may be related to cardiovascular burden. We have thus analysed cardiovascular and inflammatory microRNAs (miRs), sensitive markers of cardiovascular damage, in critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID-19 or influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (Influenza-ARDS) admitted to the intensive care unit and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating miRs (miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-208a, and miR-499) were analysed in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 15). A validation study was performed in an independent cohort of mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 20), Influenza-ARDS patients (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 32). In both cohorts, RNA was isolated from serum and cardiovascular disease/inflammatory-relevant miR concentrations were measured by miR-specific TaqMan PCR analyses. In both the discovery and the validation cohort, serum concentration of miR-21, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M co-expression with either N or E is sufficient for producing virus-like particles (VLPs), although at a lower level compared to M, N and E co-expression. Whether E can release from cells or E/N interaction exists so as to contribute to enhanced VLP production is unknown. It also remains to be determined whether E palmitoylation or disulfide bond formation plays a role in SARS-CoV virus assembly. RESULTS: SARS-CoV N is released from cells through an association with E protein-containing vesicles. Further analysis suggests that domains involved in E/N interaction are largely located in both carboxyl-terminal regions. Changing all three E cysteine residues to alanines did not exert negative effects on E release, E association with N, or E enhancement of VLP production, suggesting that E palmitoylation modification or disulfide bond formation is not required for SARS-CoV virus assembly. We found that removal of the last E carboxyl-terminal residue markedly affected E release, N association, and VLP incorporation, but did not significantly compromise the contribution of E to efficient VLP production.

Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1,181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within and between host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.","output":"Patterns of within-host genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None.

Due to the intensification of online purchases for home delivery, there has been an increase in the use of food packaging (mostly non-biodegradable or non-renewable). Moreover, the fear of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 through contact with materials and surfaces has led to an intensified disposal of food packaging, promoting a setback in waste management. Scope and approach: The purpose of this short commentary is to address the impacts of increased use and disposal of food packaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technological solutions have been presented as tools to minimize the environmental impacts of the increased volume of disposed food packaging (namely, the development of biodegradable food packaging) as well as to minimize the occurrence of cross-contamination (namely, the incorporation of active antiviral components). Key findings and conclusions: The consumer behavior in the COVID-19 pandemic requires actions concerning adoption of bioplastics for single-use food packaging. Polylactide (PLA) stands out for high production viability, performance comparable to those of petroleum-based thermoplastics, and carbon neutral life cycle. Moreover, active components including organic compounds (resveratrol, luteolin, myricetin etc.) and metals (e.g., copper, zinc, silver) can mitigate cross-contamination. Therefore, there are opportunities to reduce food packaging-related environmental footprints while also decreasing the occurrence of surface-mediated cross-contamination.","output":"Food packaging wastes amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Trends and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artesunate is a safe noncytotoxic drug with low side effects which is used in the treatment of chloroquine-resistant malaria.

Many industries and organizations start to come up with alternative ways to accomplish tasks after the sudden lockdown either by splitting teams into smaller groups or by working from home (if this is applicable) according to the organization's policy. Like many other aspects of everyday life, COVID-19 had a serious impact on students, instructors, and all educational organizations worldwide. The pandemic caused schools, colleges and universities across the globe to shut down their campuses so that students could follow social distancing measures (Muhammad Adnan1and Kainat Anwar1, Online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Students perspectives, Journal of Pedagogical Research - June 2020).

While frequently encountered in the environment and clinical laboratories it is almost always considered nonpathogenic. Despite being a non-virulent organism, there are many cases of clinically significant disease. Occasionally, it has been known to cause severe infections, especially in patients with an underlying predisposition or immunosuppression such as AIDS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old male with no known PMH presents to the hospital with complaint of worsening dyspnea, fever, and nonproductive cough. He was in his usual state of health until 3 weeks prior when he began to experience body aches, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. Continued symptoms prompted visit to the hospital at which time he discharged from the emergency department. The patient continued to have progressive worsening of dyspnea with fever prompting return to the hospital and subsequent admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He lives at home with his wife and 4 children who do not have similar symptoms. He has lived in the US for 17 years and denies recent travel, sick contacts, history of autoimmune diseases, smoking history, vaping history, drug use, skin rash, joint pain. On admission vital signs and physical exam showed tachycardia and tachypnea with fever and inspiratory rales. Laboratory data including comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count with differential was unrevealing. Chest imaging showed diffuse bilateral dense ground glass opacities. Inflammatory markers including D-dimer, Ferritin, LDH, CRP were elevated. Influenza, COVID-19, mycoplasma, legionella antigen resulted negative. Testing for HIV returned positive with a CD4 count of 8. Given the clinical picture the patient was started on steroids, Bactrim, and Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed showing negative cytology, negative GMS-silver stain. However, AFB testing showed positive M. gordonae with fungal culture showing Candida albicans. Prednisone was discontinued and the patient was continued on HAART therapy along with Bactrim and sent for further treatment with Infectious Disease specialists. DISCUSSION: While there are reports of M. gordonae infections involving many organ systems, pulmonary infection is the most common site of symptomatic disease. Common symptoms include cough, weight loss, dyspnea, hemoptysis and fever. In addition to clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities, positive cultures from sputum, bronchial wash, transbronchial or lung biopsy are necessary for diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: M.gordonae is capable of causing significant infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Although the likelihood of this being a contamination is significant, its isolation should prompt further evaluation especially in those patients who are immunocompromised.

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a longitudinal study using municipality-level mortality data. METHODS We investigated the patterns and spatial correlation of EM of men aged 75 years during the first two pandemic waves (March-April 2020 vs November 2020) of COVID-19, using the mortality data released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. EM was estimated at the municipality level to accurately detect the critical areas within the region. RESULTS The areas that were mostly hit during the first wave of COVID-19 were generally spared by the second wave: EM of men aged 75 years in the municipality of Bergamo plummeted from +472% in March and April to -13% in November, and in Cremona the variation was from +344% to -19%. Conversely, in November 2020 EM was higher in some areas that had been protected in the first wave of the pandemic. Spatial correlation widely corroborates these findings, as large sections of the hot spots of EM detected in the first wave of the pandemic changed into cold spots in the second wave, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal the specular distribution of EM between the first and second wave of the pandemic, which may entail the consequences of social distancing measures and individual behaviors, local management strategies, 'harvesting' of the frailer population and, possibly, acquired immune protection.

The dynamic and unpredictable nature of many clinical situations has placed emergency service personnel in direct danger of contracting the disease. This work uses a validated survey developed for the study to assess the predictors of stress that paramedics, nurses and doctors experience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 955 medical staff, and the level of significance adopted for statistical analysis was p = 0.05. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the qualitative variables divided into groups. The selection of tests was carried out based on the distribution of variables, verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In order to determine the predictors that caused the feelings of stress, it was necessary to use the linear regression model. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, stress among emergency medical personnel has increased considerably due to new factors that did not previously exist. The predictors of stress in the professional environment include the fear of contracting COVID-19, a decrease in the level of safety while conducting emergency medical procedures, and the marginalization of treatment for patients not suffering from COVID-19. Additional socio-demographic factors that increase stress among emergency medical personnel are being female and working in the nursing profession. Appropriate training, the supply of personal protective equipment and opinions on the preparedness of the system to deal with the outbreak of the pandemic did not affect the level of stress among health service personnel.

We intend to explore the place of lung ultrasound (LU) imagery to assess lung status in those latter patients, with afterthoughts on the interest of it for quick triage of patients. Methods: eChoVid is a multicentric observational study based on routinely collected data, conducted in 3 emergency units of Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris. 107 SDC patients included between 19.03.2020 and 01.04.2020 had both a LU examination (LU) and a chest CT-scanner (CCS). LU consisted in scoring lesions of 8 chest zones, each scored from 0 to 3, defining a severity Global Score (GS) ranging from 0 to 24. CCS severity score was graded from 0 to 3, according to interstitial pneumonia signs extension. 14 patients had a LU by both an expert and a newly trained physician (NTP). Findings: GS shows good performances to predict CCS severity assessment of Covid19 disease categorized as Normal vs Pathologic, AUC-ROC=0.93, maximal Youden index for GS=1, with 95% sensitivity, 83% specificity. Similar performances were found for CCS categorization Normal or Minimal vs Moderate or Severe, N=90, AUC-ROC= 0.89, maximal Youden index for GS=7, with 86% sensitivity, 78% specificity. Multi-logistic regression model provided a weighted score, relating ultrasound scoring of each chest zone and CT-scanner severity score, with no significant improvement of GS. Good agreement was found between GS assessed by NTP and experts, measured by Bland & Altman method. Interpretation : GS score brings a simple tool to assess lung damages severity in SDC patients. Compared performance results between NTP and expert physician are very preliminary but opens a path towards adoption beyond the scope of ultrasound experts. LU is a good candidate for triage of SDC patients, especially useful when CT-scanners suffer from availability issues related either to overwhelmed requests or poor health infrastructure.","output":"Lung injury in patients with or suspected COVID-19 : a comparison between lung ultrasound and chest CT-scanner severity assessments, an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc with the health and economy of much of human civilization.

The primary outcome was the success rate of HFNC to prevent the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We also evaluated the risk factors associated with HFNC success or failure. Results This study included 378 patients who were admitted to the Temporary COVID-19 Hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and hypoxemic respiratory failure. HFNC therapy effectively prevented IMV in 71.4% of patients ( n = 270;95% confidence interval [CI] 66.6C75.8%). Factors that were significantly different between patients who were only treated with HFNC therapy and those who progressed to IMV included age, the presence of hypertension, and the Charlson comorbidity index.

Therefore, a strategy based on network pharmacology and molecular docking was designed to explore the systemic mechanism of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia. After a series of bioinformatics assays, seven kernel targets were obtained, including TNF, IL6, IFNG, IL1B, IL10, IL4, and TLR9. And seven key compounds were identified as the synergy components of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia, the four key compounds belonging to AR were (3R)-3-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-7-chromanol, formononetin, quercetin, and kaempferol, the three key compounds belonging to AMR were atractylone, 14-acetyl-12-senecioyl-2E, 8E, 10E-atractylentriol, and &#945;-Amyrin. The crucial pathways were mainly related to three modules, including immune diseases, infectious disease, and organismal systems.

The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of such intervention on the traumatological emergency service, with particular emphasis on variations in trauma incidence and patients characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational analysis was performed. Medical records were collected from 3 different trauma centers within a wide metropolitan area, and compared between 2 time periods: the full Italian lockdown period and the same period from the past year. The study population included all patients who were admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). For those who accessed for orthopedic reasons, the analyzed variables included the date of ED admission, age, gender, after visit discharge or hospitalization, place where the injury occurred, traumatic mechanism, diagnosis, relationship with sport activity, and time from injury/symptoms debut to ED access. RESULTS: A total of 17591 ED accesses and 3163 ED trauma visits were identified. During the lockdown, ED trauma visits decreased by -59.8%, but required patients hospitalization significantly more frequently. The rate of ED trauma admissions in the elderlies significantly increased, together with the proportion of fragility fractures such as hip fractures. Road accident traumas (-79.6%) and sport-related injuries (-96.2%) significantly dropped. Admissions for less-severe reasons such as atraumatic musculoskeletal pain significantly decreased (-81.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown reduced the pressure on the Health System in at least 2 ways: directly, by curbing viral transmission and indirectly, by more than halving the ED trauma visits. Nonetheless, we observed an increased proportion of traumas in older patients, requiring hospitalizations, while the rate of less-severe cases decreased.

For the secondary objective, an in-depth analysis was performed of the economic costs associated with each program using a cost-minimization analysis. RESULTS: The failure mode and effects analysis resulted in scores of 184, 170 and 126 points for the health center collection, home delivery and community pharmacy collection programs, respectively.

Besides interstitial pneumonia, a number of other clinical manifestations were noticed in COVID-19 patients. In particular, liver and spleen dysfunctions have been described both as complications of COVID-19 and as potential predisposing factors for severe COVID-19. Liver damage is rather common in COVID-19 patients, and it is most likely multifactorial, caused by the direct insult of SARS-CoV-2 to the liver by the cytokine storm triggered by the virus, by the use of hepatotoxic drugs, and as a consequence of hypoxia. Although generally mild, liver impairment has been found to be associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit admission. A higher mortality rate was reported among chronic liver disease patients. Instead, spleen impairment in patients with COVID-19 has been poorly described. The main anatomical changes are the architectural derangement of the B cell compartment, white pulp atrophy, and reduction or absence of lymphoid follicles, while, from a functional point of view, the IgM memory B cell pool is markedly depleted. The outcome of COVID-19 in asplenic or hyposplenic patients is yet to be defined.

AZD1222 induced transient leukopenia and major changes among innate and adaptive subpopulations. Both vaccines induced spike protein specific effector T cells which were dominated by Th1 responses following AZD1222 vaccination. A significant reduction of anti-inflammatory T cells upon re-stimulation was also restricted to AZD1222 vaccinees. While IgM and IgG were the dominant isotypes elicited by AZD1222, BNT162b2 led to a significant production of IgG and IgA.

Objectives To evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women compared to: (1) non-pregnant controls and (2) natural COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. Study Design 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131) and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, second vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post second vaccine, and at delivery by Luminex. Umbilical cord sera (N=10) titers were assessed at delivery. Titers were compared to those of pregnant women 4-12 weeks from natural infection (N=37) by ELISA. A pseudovirus neutralization assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers for the subset of women who delivered during the study period. Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed via questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups. Results Vaccine-induced antibody titers were equivalent in pregnant and lactating compared to non-pregnant women (median [IQR] 5.59 [4.68-5.89] pregnant, 5.74 [5.06-6.22] lactating, 5.62 [4.77-5.98] non-pregnant, p = 0.24). All titers were significantly higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (p < 0.0001). Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in umbilical cord compared to maternal sera, although this finding did not achieve statistical significance (median [IQR] 104.7 [61.2-188.2] maternal sera, 52.3 [11.7-69.6] cord sera, p=0.05). The second vaccine dose (boost dose) increased SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, but not IgA, in maternal blood and breastmilk. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. Conclusions COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection.

Methods: We assembled a cohort 12 to 39 years old patients, insured by Kaiser Permanente Northwest, who received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna) between December 2020 and October 2021. We followed them for up to 30 days after their second dose of an mRNA vaccine to identify encounters for myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis. We compared two identification methods: A method that searched all encounter diagnoses using a brief text description (e.g., ICD-10-CM code I40.9 is defined as acute myocarditis, unspecified). We searched the text description of all inpatient or outpatient encounter diagnoses (in any position) for myocarditis or pericarditis. The other method was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), which searched for emergency department visits or hospitalizations with a select set of discharge ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. For both methods, two physicians independently reviewed the identified patient records and classified them as confirmed, probable or not cases using the CDCs case definition. Results: The encounter methodology identified 14 distinct patients who met the confirmed or probable CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis with an onset within 21 days of receipt of COVID-19 vaccination. Three of these 14 patients had an ICD-10 code of I51.4 Myocarditis, Unspecified which was overlooked by the VSD algorithm. The VSD methodology identified 11 patients who met the CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis. Seven (64%) of the eleven patients had initial care for myopericarditis outside of a KPNW facility and their diagnosis could not be ascertained by the VSD methodology until claims were submitted (median delay of 33 days; range of 12-195 days). Among those who received a second dose of vaccine (n=146,785), we estimated a risk as 95.4 cases of myopericarditis per million second doses administered (95% CI, 52.1 to 160.0). Conclusion: We identified additional valid cases of myopericarditis following an mRNA vaccination that would be missed by the VSDs search algorithm, which depends on select hospital discharge diagnosis codes. The true incidence of myopericarditis is markedly higher than the incidence reported to US advisory committees. The VSD should validate its search algorithm to improve its sensitivity for myopericarditis.","output":"Risk of Myopericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in a Large Integrated Health System: A Comparison of Completeness and Timeliness of Two Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Much of what is known about COVID-19 risk factors comes from patients with serious symptoms who test positive. While risk factors for hospitalization or death include chronic conditions and smoking; less is known about how health status or nicotine consumption is associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who do not present clinically. METHODS: Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n = 8214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in either April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and nicotine and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco or nicotine with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. RESULTS: Compared to people with self-identified excellent or very good health status, those reporting good or fair health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a statewide, community-based population drawn for SARS-CoV-2 testing, we find that overall health status was associated with infection rates. Unlike in studies of COVID-19 patients, smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

Objective: We aim to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the association between thrombin generation parameters and the inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, as well as their prognostic value in COVID-19 patients Methods: . A total of 127 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 24 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative pneumonia and 12 healthy subjects were included. Clinical characteristics, thrombin generation triggered by tissue factor with and without soluble thrombomodulin, and also by silica, as well as other biochemical parameters were assessed. Results: . Despite the frequent use of heparin, COVID-19 patients had similar thrombin generation than healthy controls. In COVID-19 patients, the thrombin generation lag-time positively correlated with markers of cell lysis (LDH), inflammation (CRP, IL-6) and coagulation (D-dimer), while the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) inversely correlated with D-dimer and LDH, and positively correlated with fibrinogen levels. Patients with more prolonged lag-time and decreased ETP presented with increased ISTH-DIC scores, and had more severe disease (vascular events and death). The ROC curve and Kaplan Meier estimate indicated that the D-dimer/ETP ratio was associated with in-hospital mortality (HR 2.5;p=0.006), and with the occurrence of major adverse events (composite end-point of vascular events and death) (HR 2.38;p=0.004).

It was reported that, among majority of the infections due to the delta variant, only 9.8% percent cases required hospitalization, whereas only 0.4% fatality was observed. Sudden dropdown in COVID-19 infections cases were observed within a short timeframe, suggesting better host adaptation with evolved delta variant. Downregulation of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 by ORF8 induced MHC-I degradation has been reported earlier. The Delta variant carried mutations (deletion) at Asp119 and Phe120 amino acids which are critical for ORF8 dimerization. The deletions of amino acids Asp119 and Phe120 in ORF8 of delta variant resulted in structural instability of ORF8 dimer caused by disruption of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges as revealed by structural analysis and MD simulation studies. Further, flexible docking of wild type and mutant ORF8 dimer revealed reduced interaction of mutant ORF8 dimer with MHC-I as compared to wild-type ORF8 dimer with MHC-1, thus implicating its possible role in MHC-I expression and host immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We thus propose that mutant ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 delta variant may not be hindering the MHC-I expression thereby resulting in a better immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, which partly explains the possible reason for sudden drop of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 predominated by delta variant in India.

And yet, the Covid-19 crisis has revealed the importance of developing digital-based complementary support to existing resources.ObjectivesFactors associated with higher utilization rates among the target audience need to be investigated.MethodsIn 2018, 41 French cities enrolled in an intervention program aimed at promoting StopBlues?, a digital health tool that helps prevent mental distress and suicide among the general population. After two years of experimentation, a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was performed using quantitative and qualitative data collection methods from institutional sources, questionnaires and web analytics tools.ResultsFinding trends show that higher utilization rates were associated with the involvement of general practitioners (GPs) in the promotion of StopBlues and the use of digital marketing channels. Context-specific characteristics also played an important role in the adoption of the tool.ConclusionsThe local context has a strong influence on how digital tools are locally promoted and accepted. Further research is needed to understand how local actors and specifically GPs can be involved in suicide prevention. More broadly, the challenge today is to ensure acceptance of digital health technology among targeted populations by adapting the digital offer to their needs and promoting the available tools.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","output":"Lessons learned from an e-mental health intervention: The promotion of stopblues in 41 french cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flexibility regarding where and when work is completed is becoming increasingly available to employees, especially following the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent shift in the nature of work. There is a plethora of research linking various flexible work arrangements (FWA) to a variety of positive outcomes across domains including reduced workCfamily conflict, better psychological health, and increased role satisfaction. While several studies have suggested that FWA are related to positive health, others have found no relationship between flexible work arrangements and health outcomes. To clarify these inconsistent findings, the current meta-analytic review (k = 33, n = 90,602) examines the relationship between flexible work arrangements available to employees and health behaviours and outcomes, specifically physical health, absenteeism, somatic symptoms, and physical activity. Results demonstrate that FWA are associated with better physical health, reduced absenteeism, and fewer somatic symptoms, suggesting that flexible work arrangements can facilitate employees in maintaining their health. There was no association between FWA and physical activity, though these results should be interpreted cautiously given the limited number of primary studies examining this relationship. These findings hold implications for future research and practice, including support for offering individualised flexible work arrangements as means of promoting employee health.

An investigation was performed to describe the outbreak, including how the virus was introduced on board. We present the clinical pictures of COVID-19 cases with risk factors for infection and severity, effectiveness of preventive measures, and we discuss the real collective protective rate.Methods: A confirmed case was any service member with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and/or who presented symptoms of anosmia and/or ageusia. We considered the entire crew as a cohort and questioned them about individual, epidemiological, and clinical data. We performed viral genome sequencing and searched for SARS-CoV-2 in the environment.Results: The attack rate was 65% (1085/1767). The sex ratio was 69, and median age was 29 years. There were four clinical profiles: asymptomatic (130%), non-specific symptomatic (81%), specific symptomatic (763%), and severe (i.e. requiring oxygen therapy, 26%). Active smoking prevented severe COVID-19;age and obesity were risk factors.The instantaneous reproduction rate Rt and viral sequencing supported the hypothesis of several introductions of the virus on board, with an acceleration of the Rt when preventive measures were lifted. Physical distancing prevented infection (ORa, 055, 95% CI, 040-076). In the end, transmission stopped when the proportion of infected personnel was large enough to prevent the virus from circulating (65%, 95% CI, 62-68).Discussion: Asymptomatic and non-specific clinical pictures of COVID-19, combined with a lack of knowledge at that time about the specific symptoms of COVID-19 (anosmia, ageusia), delayed detection of the outbreak. Once it was identified, the lack of an isolation ward made it difficult to manage transmission on board, and the outbreak spread until a collective protective rate was reached. However, physical distancing was effective when applied. Syndromic surveillance and point-of-care biology could enable early detection of such viral emergences or outbreaks.Funding Information: No funding to declare.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: This was not an experimental protocol, but an outbreak investigation with routine care provided to infected individuals, so no ethical approval from any named institutional and/or licensing/ethics committee was required.

The successful treatment of acute stroke requires an organized, efficient and well-resourced emergency care system. However, debate exists surrounding the prioritization of stroke treatment programs given the high costs of treatment and the increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in LMICs. Economic data is helpful to guide evidence-based priority setting in health systems development, particularly in low-resource settings where scarcity requires careful stewardship of resources. This systematic review surveys the existing evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of interventions to address acute stroke in LMIC settings. Methods The authors conducted a PRISMA style systematic review of economic evaluations of interventions to address acute stroke in LMICs. Five databases were systematically searched for articles, which were then reviewed for inclusion. Results Of the 153 unique articles identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Four studies demonstrate the heavy economic burden on patients and households due to stroke. Two studies estimate that preventive measures are more cost-effective than acute treatments. Four studies directly examine the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis and thrombectomy in three middle-income countries (Iran, China, and Brazil) with results ranging from roughly $2578 to $34,052 (2019 USD) per quality adjusted life-year saved. These results are similar to the cost-effectiveness ratios estimated in high-income settings. Finally, one study examined a care bundle that included acute treatment elements. Conclusions The findings reinforce the need for additional research support informed decision-making. The available evidence suggests that preventive measures should be prioritized over emergency treatment for acute stroke, particularly in settings of resource scarcity. Cost-effectiveness ratios do not compare favorably to estimates for other emergency care interventions in LMICs, such as basic emergency care training, implementation of triage systems, and basic trauma care. Cost-effectiveness is also likely to vary depending on local epidemiology. Overall, decision-makers should balance the economic evidence alongside social, political and cultural priorities when making resource allocation choices.","output":"A systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of emergency interventions for stroke in low- and middle-income countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combination of lymphocyte count and not the serological response with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin for risk stratification in patients with possible COVID-19","output":"Combination of lymphocyte count and not the serological response with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin for risk stratification in patients with possible COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. No specific treatment of the underlying condition is available for the majority of patients, but ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARB) slows progression in albuminuric CKD. Adding a mineralocorticoid receptor-antagonist (MRA) like spironolactone has an additive effect. However, reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS)-blockade increases the risk of hyperkalaemia which is exacerbated by the presence of CKD. Thus, hyperkalaemia may prevent optimal use of RAAS-blockade in some patients. This project hypothesises that adding a potassium binder (patiromer) allows for improved RAAS-blockade including the use of MRA, thereby reducing albuminuria in patients with albuminuric CKD where full treatment is limited by hyperkalaemia. If successful, the study may lead to improved treatment of this subgroup of patients with CKD. Furthermore, the study will examine the feasibility of potassium binders in patients with CKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open-label, randomised controlled trial including 140 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25C60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) >500 mg/g (or 200 mg/g if diabetes mellitus) and a current or two previous plasma-potassium >4.5 mmol/L. Patients who develop hyperkaliaemia >5.5 mmol/L during a run-in phase, in which RAAS-blockade is intesified with the possible addition of spironolactone, are randomised to 12-month treatment with maximal tolerated ACE-I/ARB and spironolactone with or without patiromer. The primary endpoint is the difference in UACR measured at randomisation and 12 months compared between the two groups. Secondary endpoints include CKD progression, episodes of hyperkalaemia, blood pressure, eGFR, markers of cardiovascular disease, diet and quality of life. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (REFNO 1-10-72-110-20) and is registered in the EudraCT database (REFNO 2020-001595-15).

Objectives: To compare and evaluate the prognostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their derived immune-inflammatory indices (CRP/albumin (CRP/alb), lymphocyte/CRP (L/CRP), and lymphocyte/IL-6 (L/IL-6)) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: On admission, 85 confirmed COVID-19 patients' measured and collected laboratory data were obtained and compared. Results: Levels of CRP, IL-6 and CRP/alb were significantly higher (P=0.001) in severe patients and in non-survivors, but L/CRP and L/IL-6 were significantly lower (P=0.001). The best predictive performance for COVID-19 severity was observed at 1.65 for CRP/alb and 260.86 for L/CRP with 84.7% diagnostic accuracy for both. The best diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality was 87.1% by IL-6 at 120 pg/ml and 85.9% by L/IL-6 at 5.40. The performance of the combined prediction was better than the single prediction by one biomarker. IL-6 was an independent risk factor associated with severe disease development (odds ratio (OR): 1.033; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.002-1.066).

Besides, antimicrobial resistance impedes the effective infection prevention and treatment of ever-increasing bacteria. There was a paucity of data on urinary tract infections and the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of bacteria among post-fistula patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, and associated factors of urinary tract infections among women with post-fistula attending public health facilities, Harar, eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 146 consecutively enrolled women with post-fistula from February 2017 to December 2018. Risk factors were collected using a structured questionnaire. The midstream urine was collected, cultured and bacteria species were identified by using standard culture methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by the disk diffusion technique. The association between independent and outcome variables was computed by using logistic regression analysis. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The prevalence of urinary tract infections was 28.8% (95% confidence interval: 23.4, 33.6). Escherichia coli (19.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.3%), and Proteus species (11.9%) were the commonest isolates. E. coli showed (75%) resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin (62.5%), and ciprofloxacin (62.5%). Staphylococcus aureus was shown 80% resistance to amoxicillin and erythromycin.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate whether laparoscopic placement of a prophylactic, dual-component, intraperitoneal onlay mesh around a colostomy is safe and prevents parastomal hernia formation after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTINGS This study was conducted at 2 university and 3 central Finnish hospitals. PATIENTS From 2010 to 2013, 83 patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer were recruited. After withdrawals and exclusions, the outcome of 70 patients, 35 patients in each study group, could be examined. INTERVENTIONS In the intervention group, an end colostomy was created with placement of a intraperitoneal, dual-component onlay mesh and compared with a group with a traditional stoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures were the incidence of clinically and radiologically detected parastomal hernias and their extent 12 months after surgery. Stoma-related morbidity and the need for surgical repair of parastomal hernia were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Parastomal hernia was observed by clinical inspection in 5 intervention patients (14.3%) and in 12 control patients (32.3%; p = 0.049). Surgical repair of parastomal hernia was performed in 1 control patient (3.2%) and in none of the patients in the intervention group. CT detected parastomal hernia in 18 intervention patients (51.4%) and in 17 control patients (53.1%; p = 1.00). The extent of hernias was similar according to European Hernia Society classification (p = 0.41). Colostomy-related morbidity (32.3% vs 14.3%; p = 0.140) did not differ between the study groups. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by its small size and short follow-up time.

Additionally, our method provides an adaptive prioritization mechanism to maximize efficacy in use of human expert time by enabling radiologists to focus on the most difficult, yet important cases while maintaining full diagnostic autonomy. Our method offers an intuitive and reliable uncertainty estimation from segmentation ensembles and thereby closes an important gap toward successful translation of automatic segmentation into clinical routine.","output":"Robust, Primitive, and Unsupervised Quality Estimation for Segmentation Ensembles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with a high incidence of cerebrovascular injury. As these injuries are thought to be primarily embolic, neuroprotection strategies have focused on embolic protection devices. However, the topographical distribution of cerebral emboli and how this impacts on the effectiveness of these devices have not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we evaluated the anatomical characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined cerebral ischemic lesions occurring secondary to TAVI to enhance our understanding of the distribution of cardioembolic phenomena. METHODS Forty patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI with an Edwards SAPIEN-XT valve under general anesthesia were enrolled prospectively in this observational study. Participants underwent brain MRI preprocedure, and 3  1 days and 6  1 months postprocedure. RESULTS Mean  SD participant age was 82  7 years. Patients had an intermediate to high surgical risk, with a mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 6.3  3.5 and EuroSCORE of 18.1  10.6. Post-TAVI, there were no clinically apparent cerebrovascular events, but MRI assessments identified 83 new lesions across 19 of 31 (61%) participants, with a median  interquartile range number and volume of 1  2.8 lesions and 20  190 L per patient. By volume, 80% of the infarcts were cortical, 90% in the posterior circulation and 81% in the right hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS The distribution of lesions that we detected suggests that cortical gray matter, the posterior circulation, and the right hemisphere are all particularly vulnerable to perioperative cerebrovascular injury. This finding has implications for the use of intraoperative cerebral embolic protection devices, particularly those that leave the left subclavian and, therefore, left vertebral artery unprotected.","output":"Topographical distribution of perioperative cerebral infarction associated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial service disruption and transition from in-person services to telehealth for children with developmental disabilities. However, there is limited knowledge about the specific dimensions and consequences of the disruption and transition. This study aims to examine the extent of service disruption and transition, the experiences of client children and their caregivers with telehealth vis--vis in-person services, and the impacts of the disruption and transition on child wellbeing. The cross-sectional study collected data from parents of children with developmental disabilities using an online survey. McNemars tests were used to compare service changes before and after the pandemic outbreak, and multivariate analyses were used to examine how service changes were associated with child wellbeing. Results show that more than two-thirds of the children experienced reduction in service amount, and one-third lost services for more than two months in about five months into the pandemic. While telehealth had comparable features relative to in-person services, it had lower ratings with respect to diagnostic accuracy, treatment effectiveness, and rapport building. Service disruption/transition and social isolation were associated with behavioral and emotional deterioration in children. However, child and family stress may have confounded these adverse effects. We concluded that the magnitude of service disruption and transition was large in the first half year after the pandemic outbreak, and the amount and duration of service loss varied substantially across clients. Diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and rapport building were areas in which parents had major concerns toward telehealth relative to in-person services. However, such drawbacks may partially be due to the limited logistics in telehealth implementation during the pandemic. Service disruption and transition seemed to contribute to family stress, which played a direct role in eroding child wellbeing. Implications of these findings for future research and practices are discussed.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts on Children with Developmental Disabilities: Service Disruption, Transition to Telehealth, and Child Wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With each infectious pandemic or outbreak, the medical community feels the need to revisit basic concepts of immunology to understand and overcome the difficult times brought about by these infections. Regarding viruses, they have historically been responsible for many deaths, and such a peculiarity occurs because they are known to be obligate intracellular parasites that depend upon the host's cell machinery for their replication. Successful infection with the production of essential viral components requires constant viral evolution as a strategy to manipulate the cellular environment, including host internal factors, the host's nonspecific and adaptive immune responses to viruses, the metabolic and energetic state of the infected cell, and changes in the intracellular redox environment during the viral infection cycle. Based on this knowledge, it is fundamental to develop new therapeutic strategies for controlling viral dissemination, by means of antiviral therapies, vaccines, or antioxidants, or by targeting the inhibition or activation of cell signaling pathways or metabolic pathways that are altered during infection. The rapid recovery of altered cellular homeostasis during viral infection is still a major challenge. Here, we review the strategies by which viruses evade the host's immune response and potential tools used to develop more specific antiviral therapies to cure, control, or prevent viral diseases.","output":"HostCvirus interaction and viral evasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many couples are staying at home together for an extended period.

Viral RNA loads in feces decreased with time comparable with those in blood and effusion. Specific spike gene mutations linked to systemic FCoV spread were consistently found in blood and effusion from treated FIP cats, but not in feces from treated or companion cats. A new mutation that led to a not yet described amino acid change was identified, indicating that further mutations may be involved in the development of FIP.

This data using an animal model was further validated using autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we show that both human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-derived CMs) and adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that CCL2 is secreted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to monocyte recruitment. Increased CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration was also observed in the hearts of infected hamsters. Using single cell RNA-seq, we also show that macrophages are able to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection of CMs. Overall, our study provides direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects CMs in vivo and proposes a mechanism of immune-cell infiltration and pathology in heart tissue of COVID-19 patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cardiomyocytes Recruit Monocytes by Secreting CCL2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The largest world-wide vaccination rollout ever is currently underway to tackle the covid-19 pandemic.

METHODS We compared patients treated for acute cholecystitis between 1 March and 31 August 2020 (Group I) to patients admitted with the same diagnosis during the same months in 2019 (Group II). We evaluated demographics, presenting symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings at presentation, the disease's clinical course, management, and outcome. RESULTS Group I consisted of 101 patients and group II included 94 patients. No differences were noted for age (66 years, IQR 48-78 vs. 66 years, IQR 47-76; P = 0.50) and sex (57.4% vs. 51.1% females; P = 0.39) between the two groups.

Several antihypertensives increase ACE2 expression or activity, leading to concern that this may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and worsen COVID-19 disease. However, ACE2 is protective against lung injury while ANG II (which is catabolised by ACE2) is associated with lung injury both in mice and humans. We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials.

We investigated the feasibility and preliminary effects of an intervention to improve uptake of Irelands national DRS programme, Diabetic RetinaScreen, among patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. DESIGN/SETTING: We conducted a cluster randomised pilot trial, embedded process evaluation and cost analysis in general practice, July 2019 to January 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Eight practices participated in the trial. For the process evaluation, surveys were conducted with 25 staff at intervention practices. Interviews were conducted with nine staff at intervention practices, and 10 patients who received the intervention. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention comprised practice reimbursement, an audit of attendance, electronic prompts targeting professionals, General Practice-endorsed patient reminders and a patient information leaflet. Practices were randomly allocated to intervention (n=4) or wait-list control (n=4) (usual care). OUTCOMES: Staff and patient interviews explored their perspectives on the intervention. Patient registration and attendance, including intention to attend, were measured at baseline and 6 months. Microcosting was used to estimate intervention delivery cost. RESULTS: The process evaluation identified that enablers of feasibility included practice culture and capacity to protect time, systems to organise care, and staff skills, and workarounds to improve intervention fit. At 6 months, 22/71 (31%) of baseline non-attenders in intervention practices subsequently attended screening compared with 15/87 (17%) in control practices. The total delivery cost across intervention practices (patients=363) was 2509, averaging 627 per practice and 6.91 per audited patient. Continuation criteria supported proceeding to a definitive trial. CONCLUSIONS: The Improving Diabetes Eye screening Attendance intervention is feasible in primary care; however, consideration should be given to how best to facilitate local tailoring. A definitive trial of clinical and cost-effectiveness is required with preliminary results suggesting a positive effect on uptake.

To describe the association of demographics, clinical characteristics, and use of DMTs categories with the risk of contracting the disease. METHODS: We telephonically interviewed all the 275 MS patients followed in the MS center. The collected data included recent contact with a patient with COVID-19 diagnosis or a subject with respiratory symptoms and the developing of COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed diagnosis. RESULTS: 15 out of 275 patients reported symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 infection, only one of them with PCR-confirmed diagnosis. No one of them presented severe symptoms or needed hospitalization. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, the only factor associated with being in the COVID-suspect group was the report of a recent contact with a patient with a COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 within MS patients seems to resemble the prevalence in general population. The lack of associations with other factors assessed, including DMTs, may reflect a lack of statistical power.

We assessed if these associations were worsened by T2DM after adjustment by age, sex, obesity, and COVID-19. Three datasets were used: the Control Population, which enabled standardization of protein serum levels according to age and sex (N = 27,382); the NAFLD-Biopsy cohort for associations with liver features (N = 926); and the USA NAFLD-Serum cohort for protein kinetics before and during COVID-19 (N = 421,021).

But they are also involved in influencing the principles of scientific integrity. Our research objective was to study the extent of that involvement, with a case study of ILSI as a key actor in that space. We conducted a qualitative document analysis, triangulating data from an existing scoping review, publicly available information, internal industry documents, and existing freedom of information requests. RESULTS: Food companies have joined forces through ILSI to shape the development of scientific integrity principles. These activities started in 2007, in direct response to the growing criticism of the food industrys funding of research. ILSI first built a niche literature on COI in food science and nutrition at the individual and study levels. Because the literature was scarce on that topic, these publications were used and cited in ILSIs and others further work on COI, scientific integrity, and PPP, beyond the fields of nutrition and food science. In the past few years, ILSI started to shape the very principles of scientific integrity then and to propose that government agencies, professional associations, non-for-profits, and others, adopt these principles. In the process, ILSI built a reputation in the scientific integrity space. ILSIs work on scientific integrity ignores the risks of accepting corporate funding and fails to provide guidelines to protect from these risks. CONCLUSIONS: The activities developed by ILSI on scientific integrity principles are part of a broader set of political practices of industry actors to influence public health policy, research, and practice. It is important to learn about and counter these practices as they risk shaping scientific standards to suit the industrys interests rather than public health ones.

METHODS The recruitment of healthy subjects willing to donate marrow for BMSC production and the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) used for assessing potential donors, collecting marrow, culturing BMSCs and BMSC cryopreservation are described. RESULTS Seventeen subjects were enrolled in our marrow collection protocol for BMSC production. Six of the 17 subjects were found to be ineligible during the donor screening process and one became ill and their donation was cancelled. Approximately 12 ml of marrow was aspirated from one posterior iliac crest of 10 donors; one donor donated twice. The BMSCs were initially cultured in T-75 flasks and then expanded for three passages in multilayer cell factories. The final BMSC product was packaged into units of 100  106 viable cells, cryopreserved and stored in a vapor phase liquid nitrogen tank under continuous monitoring. BMSC products meeting all lot release criteria were obtained from 8 of the 11 marrow collections. The rate of growth of the primary cultures was similar for all products except those generated from the two oldest donors. One lot did not meet the criteria for final release; its CD34 antigen expression was greater than the cut off set at 5%.

Differences in technological affinity are likely to lead to differences in the adoption of digital health technology and subsequent inequalities in healthcare between older and younger people and between men and women. Design: The study represents an example of a technology adoption study employing a survey-based cross sectional correlational design. Attitude towards digital health technology was measured using the 20 item Digital Health Scale. Age, gender, frequency of use of health technology and employment status data were gathered using a demographics questionnaire. The opportunity sample (N = 247) included volunteer participants aged 16-84 years (M = 31.7, SD = 19.35, 156 females and 91 males). Results: Results indicated a significant negative correlation between age and positive attitude towards digital health technology (r = -0.24, p < .01). Gender differences in attitudes towards digital health technology were non-significant (p > .05). Significant differences in frequency of use were also found, where occasional and frequent use resulted in more positive attitudes than never having used digital health technology (p < 0.05) and participants reporting frequent use were significantly older than those reporting never or occasional use (p < .05) Conclusion: Findings identified age, but not gender, as a significant factor in attitude towards digital health technology, suggesting that continued and increased reliance on digital technology in healthcare may lead to age, but not gender, related inequalities in access to healthcare in the UK. That frequent users of digital health technology were also older, highlights the greater demand for healthcare services by older individuals and is further evidence for the potential of digital healthcare to lead to age related inequalities in access to and provision of healthcare.

It is defined by significant plasma leak, leading to intravascular volume depletion and eventually cardiovascular collapse. The compensatory reserve Index (CRI) is a new physiological parameter, derived from feature analysis of the pulse arterial waveform that tracks real-time changes in central volume. We investigated the utility of CRI to predict recurrent shock in severe dengue patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in the pediatric and adult intensive care units at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Patients were monitored with hourly clinical parameters and vital signs, in addition to continuous recording of the arterial waveform using pulse oximetry. The waveform data was wirelessly transmitted to a laptop where it was synchronized with the patients clinical data. RESULTS: One hundred three patients with suspected severe dengue were recruited to this study. Sixty-three patients had the minimum required dataset for analysis. Median age was 11 years (IQR 8C14 years). CRI had a negative correlation with heart rate and moderate negative association with blood pressure. CRI was found to predict recurrent shock within 12 h of being measured (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.54C3.26), P < 0.001). The median duration from CRI measurement to the first recurrent shock was 5.4 h (IQR 2.9C6.8). A CRI cutoff of 0.4 provided the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for predicting recurrent shock (0.66 [95% CI 0.47C0.85] and 0.86 [95% CI 0.80C0.92] respectively). CONCLUSION: CRI is a useful non-invasive method for monitoring intravascular volume status in patients with severe dengue.

We found that CMIP inhibits activation of the Src kinases Fyn and Lck after CD3/CD28 costimulation and the subsequent localization of Fyn and Lck to LRs. Video microscopy analysis showed that CMIP blocks the recruitment of LAT and the lipid raft marker cholera toxin B at the site of TCR engagement. Proteomic analysis identified several protein clusters differentially modulated by CMIP and, notably, Cofilin-1, which is inactivated in CMIP-expressing T cells. Moreover, transgenic T cells exhibited the downregulation of GM3 synthase, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides.

The prevalence of cancer in this cohort is approximately 20%. The optimal screening strategy in patients with NSSC remains unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate whether 18F-FDG PET/CT was superior to CT as an initial imaging modality in patients with NSSC. In a randomized prospective trial, the imaging modalities were compared with regard to diagnostic performance. Methods: Two hundred patients were randomized 1:1 to whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT or CT of the thorax and abdomen as the imaging modality. A tentative diagnosis was established after first-line imaging. The final referral diagnosis was adjudicated by the physician, when sufficient data were available. Results: One hundred ninety-seven patients were available for analysis because 3 patients withdrew consent before scanning. Thirty-nine (20%) patients were diagnosed with cancer, 10 (5%) with an infection, 15 (8%) with an autoimmune disease, and 76 (39%) with other diseases. In the remaining 57 patients (28%), no specific disease was found. 18F-FDG PET/CT had a higher specificity (96% vs. 85%; P = 0.028) and a higher accuracy (94% vs. 82%; P = 0.017) than CT. However, there were no statistically significant differences in sensitivity (83% vs. 70%) or negative predictive values (96% vs. 92%). No difference in days to final referral diagnosis according to randomization group could be shown (7.2 vs. 7.6 d). However, for the subgroups in which the imaging modality showed a suggestion of malignancy, there was a significant delay to final diagnosis in the CT group compared with the 18F-FDG PET/CT group (11.6 vs. 5.7 d; P = 0.02). Conclusion: Compared with CT, we found a higher diagnostic specificity and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting cancer in patients with NSSC. 18F-FDG PET/CT should therefore be considered as first-line imaging in this group of patients.","output":"Whole-Body 18F-FDG PET/CT Is Superior to CT as First-Line Diagnostic Imaging in Patients Referred with Serious Nonspecific Symptoms or Signs of Cancer: A Randomized Prospective Study of 200 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the results of a national survey conducted to help public health officials understand the publics response to community mitigation interventions for a severe outbreak of pandemic influenza.

Here, we assessed immunological adaptations in both blood and term decidua from 9 SARS-exposed pregnant women with asymptomatic/mild disease and 15 pregnant SARS-naive women. In addition to selective loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, we report attenuation of antigen presentation and type I IFN signaling but upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in blood monocyte derived decidual macrophages. On the other hand, infection was associated with remodeling of the T cell compartment with increased frequencies of activated CD69+ tissue-resident T cells and decreased abundance of Tregs. Interestingly, frequencies of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells increased only in the blood, while CD8 effector memory T cells were expanded in the decidua. In contrast to decidual macrophages, signatures of type I IFN signaling were increased in decidual T cells. Finally, T cell receptor diversity was significantly reduced with infection in both compartments, albeit to a much greater extent in the blood.

Lesions due to fungal infection and, in some cases, secondary bacterial infections, were restricted to the skin. However, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA from these sites. We therefore examined lungs for response at an epithelial surface not linked to the primary site of infection.

Family-centered care and its delivery rapidly changed and left the family behind-unable to actively participate in their loved one's care. LOCAL PROBLEM: A southeastern academic medical center pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU) needed to augment family-centered medical rounds when parents could not be at the bedside. No alternative to physical presence for daily medical rounds existed in the PCICU. METHODS: A virtual rounding (VR) program was implemented allowing parents of patients admitted to PCICU to join medical rounds remotely through teleconferencing. Preintervention and postintervention rounding times, staff perceptions of the program, and parental satisfaction scores using the Pediatric Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (pFS-ICU) tool were measured. INTERVENTIONS: This quality improvement project implemented a VR program offered to all families of patients in the PCICU. RESULTS: VR did not increase rounding times after implementation (p = .673). Staff satisfaction surveys revealed that staff felt the VR program did not prolong rounding times (p &#8804; 0.001), workload impact perceptions improved after intervention (p = <0.001), and staff felt VR should be offered to families in PCICU (p &#8804; 0.001).

These interventions have largely been unsuccessful, perhaps due to a lack of attention to patients social needs and engagement of patients in developing solutions. METHODS: The project team used a combination of administrative data, information culled from charts and interviews with high-risk patients to understand social needs, the current experience of addressing social needs in the hospital, and patient preferences and identified opportunities for improvement. Interviews were conducted in March and April 2020, and patients were asked to reflect on their experiences both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 4579 patients with 26 168 visits to the emergency department and 2904 inpatient admissions in the previous year were identified. Qualitative analysis resulted in three themes: (1) the interaction between social needs, demographics, and health; (2) the hospitals role in addressing social needs; and (3) the impact of social needs on experiences of care. Themes related to experiences before and during COVID-19 did not differ. Three opportunities were identified: (1) training for staff related to stigma and trauma, (2) improved documentation of social needs and (3) creation of navigation programmes. DISCUSSION: Certain demographic factors were clearly associated with an increased need for social support. Unfortunately, many factors identified by patients as mediating their need for such support were not consistently captured. Going forward, high-risk patients should be included in the development of quality improvement initiatives and programmes to address social needs.","output":"Opportunity to inform social needs within a hospital setting using data-driven patient engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metapneumoviruses, members of the family Pneumoviridae, have been identified in birds (avian metapneumoviruses; AMPVs) and humans (human metapneumoviruses; HMPVs). AMPV and HMPV are closely related viruses with a similar genomic organization and cause respiratory tract illnesses in birds and humans, respectively. AMPV can be classified into four subgroups, ACD, and is the etiological agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and swollen head syndrome in chickens. Epidemiological studies have indicated that AMPV also circulates in wild bird species which may act as reservoir hosts for novel subtypes. HMPV was first discovered in 2001, but retrospective studies have shown that HMPV has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years. AMPV subgroup C is more closely related to HMPV than to any other AMPV subgroup, suggesting that HMPV has evolved from AMPV-C following zoonotic transfer. In this review, we present a historical perspective on the discovery of metapneumoviruses and discuss the host tropism, pathogenicity, and molecular characteristics of the different AMPV and HMPV subgroups to provide increased focus on the necessity to better understand the evolutionary pathways through which HMPV emerged as a seasonal endemic human respiratory virus.","output":"Zoonotic Origins of Human Metapneumovirus: A Journey from Birds to Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China possibly from animal market in 2002 and 2019 respectively, bear resemblences in terms of structure, genome characteristics, incubation period, basic reproductive number, and symptoms However;the epidemic trajectory for both the viruses appears different While SARS was contained within eight months after causing 774 deaths across 26 countries;COVID-2019 caused 18,589 deaths across 197 countries within three months The future course of COVID-19 remains unclear There always remains a possibility that coronaviruses will surface from time to times in humans and cause outbreaks ? 2020 Wutan Huatan Jisuan Jishu All rights reserved","output":"SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: Similar viruses with different trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long-term outcome data of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are needed to understand their recovery trajectory and additional care needs.

Workup at 3 and 12 months following admission consisted of clinical review, pulmonary function testing, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), muscle strength, chest computed tomography (CT) and quality of life questionnaires. We evaluated factors correlating with recovery by linear mixed effects modelling. RESULTS: Of 695 patients admitted, 299 and 226 returned at 3 and 12 months, respectively (median age 59 years, 69% male, 31% severe disease). About half and a third of the patients reported fatigue, dyspnoea and/or cognitive impairment at 3 and 12 months, respectively.

During 21 days, nutrition and exercise were daily monitored, and the mood states assessed. A factor analysis was used to reduce the number of nutritional variables collected. The relationships between exercise, mood and nutrition were investigated using a multivariate general linear model and a mediation model. Seven factors were found, reflecting different nutritional choices. Exercise was positively associated with fruit, vegetables and fish consumption (p = 0.004). Depression and quality of life were, directly and inversely, associated with cereals, legumes (p = 0.005; p = 0.004) and low-fat meat intake (p = 0.040; p = 0.004). Exercise mediated the effect of mood states on fruit, vegetables and fish consumption, respectively, accounting for 4.2% and 1.8% of the total variance.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has declined. We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and mortality among US MSM. METHODS: We used a calibrated HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore, Maryland, and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to predict impacts of data-driven reductions in sexual partners(0%,25%,50%), condom use(5%), HIV testing(20%), viral suppression(10%), PrEP initiations(72%), PrEP use(9%) and ART initiations(50%), exploring different disruption durations and magnitudes. We estimated the median (95% credible interval) change in cumulative new HIV infections and deaths among MSM over one and five years, compared with a scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions. FINDINGS: A six-month 25% reduction in sexual partners among Baltimore MSM, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by 122%(117,128%) and 30%(26,34%) over one and five years, respectively. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the six-month data-driven disruptions to condom use, testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP use and ART initiations combined were predicted to increase new HIV infections by 105%(58,165%) over one year, and by 35%(21,54%) over five years. A 25% reduction in partnerships offsets the negative impact of these combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (overall reduction 39%(?10,74%), 00%(?14,09%) over one, five years, respectively), but not on HIV deaths (corresponding increases 110%(62,177%), 26%(15,43%)). The predicted impacts of reductions in partnerships or viral suppression doubled if they lasted 12 months or if disruptions were twice as large.

Cryo-Electron Microscopy structure revealed that up to 60 copies of this antigenic domain were bound on a single ADDomer particle with the symmetrical arrangements of a dodecahedron. Mouse immunization with the RBD decorated particles showed as early as the first immunization a significant anti-coronavirus humoral response, which was boosted after a second immunization. Neutralization assays with spike pseudo-typed-virus demonstrated the elicitation of strong neutralization titers. Remarkably, the existence of pre-existing immunity against adenoviral-derived particles enhanced the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. This plug and play vaccine platform revisits the way of using adenovirus to combat emergent pathogens while potentially taking advantage of the adenovirus pre-immunity.","output":"Elicitation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses through immunization using a versatile adenovirus-inspired multimerization platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce Multiple Interface String Alignment (MISA), a visualization tool to display coherently various sequence and structure based statistics at protein-protein interfaces (SSE elements, buried surface area, ASA, B factor values, etc).

There is conflicting evidence about how HIV infection influences COVID-19. We compared the presentation characteristics and outcomes of people with and without HIV hospitalised with COVID-19 at 207 centres across the United Kingdom. Methods. We analysed data from people with laboratory confirmed or highly likely COVID-19 enrolled into the ISARIC CCP-UK study. The primary endpoint was day-28 mortality after presentation. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression to describe the association with HIV status after adjustment for sex, ethnicity, age, indeterminate/probable hospital acquisition of COVID-19 (definite hospital acquisition excluded), presentation date, and presence/absence of ten comorbidities. We additionally adjusted for disease severity at presentation as defined by hypoxia/oxygen therapy. Findings. Among 47,539 patients, 115 (0.24%) had confirmed HIV-positive status and 103/115 (89.6%) had a record of antiretroviral therapy. At presentation, relative to the HIV-negative group, HIV-positive people were younger (median 55 versus 74 years; p<0.001), had a higher prevalence of obesity and moderate/severe liver disease, higher lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein, and more systemic symptoms. The cumulative incidence of day-28 mortality was 25.2% in the HIV-positive group versus 32.1% in the HIV-negative group (p=0.12); however, stratification for age revealed a higher mortality among HIV-positive people aged below 60 years. The effect of HIV-positive status was confirmed in adjusted analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-2.25; p=0.06). Following additional adjustment for disease severity at presentation, mortality was higher in HIV-positive people (adjusted HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.07-2.48; p=0.02).

However, the challenge remains to distinguish COVID-19 in the complex scenario of multi-type pneumonia classification and improve the overall diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose a novel periphery-aware COVID-19 diagnosis approach with contrastive representation enhancement to identify COVID-19 from influenza-A (H1N1) viral pneumonia, community acquired pneumonia (CAP), and healthy subjects using chest CT images. Our key contributions include: 1) an unsupervised Periphery-aware Spatial Prediction (PSP) task which is designed to introduce important spatial patterns into deep networks; 2) an adaptive Contrastive Repre-sentation Enhancement (CRE) mechanism which can effectively capture the intra-class similarity and inter-class difference of various types of pneumonia. We integrate PSP and CRE to obtain the representations which are highly discriminative in COVID-19 screening. We evaluate our approach comprehensively on our constructed large-scale dataset and two public datasets. Extensive experiments on both volume-level and slice-level CT images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with PSP and CRE for COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Periphery-aware COVID-19 Diagnosis with Contrastive Representation Enhancement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unexpected pandemic has provoked changes in all economic sectors worldwide. COVID-19 has had a direct and indirect effect on countries' development. Thus, the pandemic limits the movements of labour forces among countries, restricting migrants' remittances. In addition, it provokes the reorientation of consumer behaviour and changes in household expenditure. For developing countries, migrant remittances are one of the core drivers for improving household wellbeing. Therefore, the paper aims to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected household expenditure in Ukraine, as being representative of a developing country. For this purpose, the data series were compiled for 2010 to the second quarter of 2021. The data sources were as follows: Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, The World Bank, and the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The core variables were as follows: migrants' remittances and expenditure of households by the types. The following methods were applied to achieve the paper's aims: the DickeyCFuller Test Unit Root and the ARIMA model. The findings confirmed that COVID-19 has changed the structure of household expenditure in Ukraine. Considering the forecast of household expenditure until 2026, it was shown that due to changes in migrants' remittances, household expenditure in all categories tends to increase. The forecasted findings concluded that household expenditure on transport had the most significant growth due to changing migrants' remittances.","output":"Forecasting the Effect of Migrants' Remittances on Household Expenditure: COVID-19 Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus-related Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2002/2003, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-Cov) in 2012/2013, and especially the current 2019/2020 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested the national health systems' endurance worldwide.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the change in childrens and adolescents prevention and vaccination behaviors amid Chinas COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in mid-March 2020 using proportional quota sampling in Wuhan (the epidemic epicenter) and Shanghai (a nonepicenter). Data were collected from 1655 parents with children aged 3 to 17 years. Childrens and adolescents prevention behaviors and regular vaccination behaviors before and during the epidemic were assessed. Descriptive analyses were used to investigate respondents characteristics, public health prevention behaviors, unproven protection behaviors, and vaccination behaviors before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences in outcome measures between cities and family characteristics, using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests (if expected frequency was <5) and analyses of variance. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the factors and disparities associated with prevention and vaccination behaviors. RESULTS: Parent-reported prevention behaviors increased among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic compared with those before the epidemic. During the epidemic, 82.2% (638/776) of children or adolescents always wore masks when going out compared with 31.5% (521/1655) before the epidemic; in addition, 25.0% (414/1655) and 79.8% (1321/1655) had increased their frequency and duration of handwashing, respectively, although only 46.9% (776/1655) went out during the epidemic. Meanwhile, 56.1% (928/1655) of the families took unproven remedies against COVID-19. Parent-reported vaccination behaviors showed mixed results, with 74.8% (468/626) delaying scheduled vaccinations and 80.9% (1339/1655) planning to have their children get the influenza vaccination after the epidemic. Regarding socioeconomic status, children and adolescents from larger families and whose parents had lower education levels were less likely to improve prevention behaviors but more likely to take unproven remedies. Girls were less likely than boys to always wear a mask when going out and wash their hands. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention behaviors and attitudes toward influenza vaccination have improved during the COVID-19 epidemic. Public health prevention measures should be continuously promoted, particularly among girls, parents with lower education levels, and larger families. Meanwhile, misinformation about COVID-19 remains a serious challenge and needs to be addressed by public health stakeholders.","output":"The Influence of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Prevention and Vaccination Behaviors Among Chinese Children and Adolescents: Cross-sectional Online Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between antibody status and cycle threshold (Ct) values, the prognostic value of the latter for COVID-19 patients, and the inter-assay comparability of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values.

RESULTS: Ct values for 2 of 3 target genes showed significant differences between the 2 assays used (P=0.012 and P<0.0001). Ct values were significantly higher for antibody positive patients (P<0.0001) and positively correlated with the amount of time since onset of symptoms (R: 0.332-0.363; P<0.001). Patients with fatal outcomes showed higher viral loads than survivors (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Ct values depend strongly on assay used and target gene examined and should not be used as quantitative values to guide therapeutic or diagnostic decisions.

Knowledge on individual differences, as depicted by latent subgroups, in the full spectrum of mental health may provide valuable insights in how individuals transition between health states and factors that predict transitioning from resilient to symptomatic classes. Our aim is to (1) identify longitudinal classes (i.e., subgroups of individuals) based on indicators of PTSD, AD, and well-being in response to the pandemic and (2) examine predictors of transitioning between these subgroups. Methods and analysisWe will conduct a three-wave longitudinal online survey-study of n [] 2000 adults from the general Dutch population. The first measurement occasion takes place six months after the start of the pandemic, followed by two follow-up measurements with six months intervals.

COVID-19 has affected every country in different magnitudes. The absence of vaccine and changed lifestyle suddenly imposed upon masses affected their functioning as well. Those victimized by the virus have their own problems while others also have had their own sufferings. OBJECTIVES: Amidst all trials and tests for cure, this paper is an attempt to understand the psychological, spiritual and emotional response to COVID-19 and Government Interventions in India. It also tries to assess the differences in experiences across age, gender and educational qualifications. DESIGN: The study adopts a mixed approach and is an exploratory cross-sectional study. For the purpose of the study, a shortened version of Czech SWSB, RYFF's Psychological Wellbeing 18 point scale and STAI scale were customized for pandemic times, administered towards the end of Lockdown 1.0 in India. After reliability and validity tests, established scales are used to study the variable in the research. For the analysis of data Smart PLS SEM 3.3.2 is used. SETTING: General masses of India were a part of the study. A cohort of 100 respondents willing to participate in the survey during the initial 21 days lockdown in India was studied which was selected using snowball sampling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study measures the association of psychological, spiritual and emotional response to covid-19 pandemic experiences and also the response to interventions made. FINDINGS: The results show that there is trivial relation of age, education and gender to the experiences of COVID-19. It was also found that Psychological Wellbeing and Spiritual Wellbeing were significantly related to the experiences of COVID-19.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study using ambulatory BP monitoring, 801 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to once-daily treatment with telmisartan 80 mg for 14 weeks or ramipril 5 mg for 8 weeks and then force titrated to ramipril 10 mg for the last 6 weeks. Primary endpoints were the reduction from baseline in the last 6-h mean ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Secondary endpoints included changes in 24-h, morning, daytime and night-time mean ambulatory BP and ambulatory BP response rates. RESULTS Telmisartan 80 mg produced greater reductions in the last 6-h mean ambulatory SBP and DBP compared with ramipril 5 mg (P < 0.0001) and 10 mg (P < 0.0001), and was superior to ramipril for all secondary ambulatory SBP and DBP endpoints (P < 0.05). Ambulatory BP response rates (24-h mean ambulatory SBP/DBP < 130/80 mmHg or reduction from baseline > or = 10 mmHg) were greater with telmisartan 80 mg (P < 0.01) than with ramipril 5 and 10 mg. Ramipril was associated with a higher incidence of treatment-related cough (5.7 versus 0.5% for telmisartan). CONCLUSIONS Telmisartan was significantly more effective than ramipril in reducing BP throughout the 24-h dosing interval and particularly during the last 6 h, a time when patients appear to be at greatest risk of cerebro- and cardiovascular events.

METHODS Using patient specific 3D phantoms of the cervical and intracranial circulation, we recorded measure of force required to deliver three types of DACs beyond the ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery. Six different combinations of DAC-microcatheter-guidewire were tested. We intentionally included what we considered suboptimal combinations of DACs, microcatheters, and guidewires during our experiments to test the feasibility of measuring force under different conditions. A six axis force sensor was secured to the DAC with an adjustable torque used to track axially directed push and pull forces required to navigate the DAC to the target site. RESULTS In a total of 55 experiments, we found a significant difference in the amount of force used between different DACs (mean force for DAC A, 1.8870.531N; for DAC B, 2.1531.280 N; and for DAC C, 1.1940.521 N, P=0.007).

This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling. METHODS We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included. RESULTS No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0?10.8% vs. 33.8?75.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program. Regular testing strategies for viral RNA and antibodies directed against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, combined with hygiene rules and a comprehensive baseline assessment, are recommended to ensure avoidance of infections at workplace as reliably as possible.","output":"Pilot study of an occupational healthcare program to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune status of employees in a large pharmaceutical company."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Commercially available immunoassays have been developed for sensitive and specific detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: We collected a comprehensive dataset containing individual death records between 2015 and 2020 from the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Government. We computed the number of excess deaths across time, geographical locations and demographic groups using Poisson regression methods. RESULTS: Between January 1(st) and September 23(rd), 2020, the number of excess deaths in Ecuador is 36,402 (95% CI: 35,762C36,827) or 208 per 10(5) population, which is 171% of the expected deaths in that period in a typical year. Only 20% of the excess deaths are attributable to confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Strikingly, in provinces that were most affected by COVID-19, such as Guayas and Santa Elena, the all-cause deaths are more than double the expected number of deaths that would have occurred in a normal year. The extent of excess deaths in men is higher than in women, and the number of excess deaths increases with age. Indigenous populations had the highest level of excess deaths among all ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the exceptionally high level of excess deaths in Ecuador highlights the enormous burden and heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 on mortality especially in older age groups and indigenous populations in Ecuador that was not fully revealed by COVID-19 death counts. Together with the limited testing in Ecuador, our results suggest that the majority of the excess deaths were likely to be undocumented COVID-19 deaths.","output":"Excess deaths reveal the true spatial, temporal, and demographic impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical care in ophthalmology is rapidly evolving as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are being developed.

The impact of the pandemic was also noted in outpatient settings with various clinics adopting telehealth as the new normal. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the pandemic impacted the outpatient cardiology setting, specifically regarding the use of telehealth, and can the lessons learned from the adoption of telehealth in the backdrop of COVID-19 be applied to facilitate the wider and routine use of telemedicine in the outpatient cardiology clinic. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have been conducted showcasing COVID-19s impact on the telehealth field of cardiology. Studies showed advantages for patients. Among these advantages are reduction in wait and travel time, easier medication reconciliation, and convenience. They also showed a general comfortability with the transition to telehealth among cardiologists. Furthermore, the adoption of telehealth in the outpatient cardiology setting, specifically with respect to the management of common cardiac conditions of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease, revealed the potential of telemedicine to be used to adequately address these conditions. The transition to telehealth was not without its challenges, such as lack of a physical exam, barriers with certain patient populations to adopting the technology, and changes were noted in frequencies of medication ordering and cardiology-specific laboratory and diagnostic imaging. SUMMARY: This transition to telehealth during the pandemic allowed for various studies to be conducted on how telehealth impacted the field of cardiology in the outpatient setting. While patient and practitioner advantages were revealed when compared to traditional outpatient cardiology visits, barriers to the adoption of the technology among specific patient populations were noted as were changes in practice among cardiologists. The use of telemedicine to adequately address common cardiac conditions was also shown. Further investigation into understanding the barriers of specific patient populations and overcoming these barriers, understanding the reason for the changes in practice of cardiologists with the use telemedicine, and investigating the use and incorporation of existing technology such as smart watches and patient portals or apps to make the transition to telehealth not only simpler, but to also optimize the cardiologist management of common cardiac conditions, have the potential to lead to the wider and routine use of telemedicine in the outpatient cardiology clinic.","output":"Cardiac Outpatient Care in a Digital Age: Remote Cardiology Clinic Visits in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, a new infectious viral disease appeared. A new betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has been recognized as the pathogen responsible for this infection. Patients affected by tumors are more vulnerable to infection owing to poor health status, concomitant chronic diseases, and immunosuppressive conditions provoked by both the cancer and antitumor therapies. In this review, we have analyzed some lesser known aspects of the relationship between neoplasms and SARS-CoV-2 infection, starting from the different expression of the ACE2 receptor of the virus in the various neoplastic pathologies, and the roles that different cytokine patterns could have in vulnerability to infection and the appearance of complications. This review also reports the rationale for a possible use of drugs commonly employed in neoplastic therapy, such as bevacizumab, ibrutinib, selinexor, thalidomide, carfilzomib, and PD-1 inhibitors, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we have highlighted some diagnostic challenges in the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer-infected patients. The combination of these two health problemstumors and a pandemic viruscould become a catastrophe if not correctly handled.

To curb the spread of the virus many institutions restricted non-emergent clinic appointments, resulting in an increase in telemedicine use. We examined the value of telemedicine for patients presenting to a pediatric surgery clinic before and after COVID-19 METHODS: Perspectives and the potential value of telemedicine were assessed by surveying patients or caregivers of patients being evaluated by a general pediatric surgeon in-person prior to COVID-19 and by patients or caregivers of patients who completed a telemedicine appointment with a pediatric surgical provider during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: The pre-COVID survey was completed by 57 respondents and the post-COVID survey by 123. Most respondents were white and were caregivers 31C40 years of age. Prior to COVID-19, only 26% were familiar with telemedicine, 25% reported traveling more than 100 miles and >50% traveled more than 40 miles for their appointment. More than 25% estimated additional travel costs of at least $30 and in 43% of households, at least one adult had to miss time from work. Following a telemedicine appointment during the COVID-19 period, 76% reported the care received as excellent, 86% were very satisfied with their care, 87% reported the appointment was less stressful for their child than an in-person appointment, and 57% would choose a telemedicine appointment in the future. CONCLUSION: For families seeking an alternative to the in-person encounter, telemedicine can provide added value over the traditional in-person encounter by reducing the burden of travel without compromising the quality of care.

Symptomatic leaves were collected from various regions in Spain and Italy and mycelia associated to leaf lesions was harvested. Total RNA extractions were depleted of rRNA and metatranscriptomes were generated using a high-throughput sequencing approach.

In conventional morphing simulations, a simulation is performed while deforming a model shape and the computational grid using the boundary fitting grid. However, it is necessary to deform the computational grid each time, and it is difficult to apply to a model with complicated shape. The present method does not require grid regeneration or deformation. In order to apply the present method to models with various shapes on the Cartesian grid, the seamless immersed boundary method (SIBM) is used. Normally, when the SIBM is applied to a deformed object, the velocity condition on the boundary is imposed by the moving velocity of the boundary. In the present method, the velocity condition is imposed by zero velocity even if the object is deformed because the purpose of the present morphing simulation is to obtain simulation results for a stationary object. In order to verify the present method, two-dimensional simulations for the flow around an object were performed. In order to obtain drag coefficients of multiple models, the object was deformed in turn from the initial model to each model in the present morphing simulation. By using the present method, the drag coefficients for some models could be obtained by one simulation.

METHODS: We devised a reverse transcription multiple cross displacement amplification (RT-MCDA) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (BS) assay (RT-MCDA-BS) for rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of COVID-19. Two primer sets were designed to target the open reading frame 1a/b (F1ab) and nucleoprotein gene (N) of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 183 clinical samples, including 65 patients with COVID-19 infections and 118 patients with other pathogen infections, were used to testify the assay's feasibility. The diagnosis results were visually reported using BS. FINDINGS: The designed assay was performed using a simple instrument which could maintain the reaction in a constant temperature at 64C for only 35 min. The total procedure of COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS test could be finished within 1 h. The COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS could detect down to 5 copies of target sequences. Among 65 clinical samples from the COVID-19 patients, 22 (33.8%) positive results were obtained from face, nasal, pharyngeal and anal swabs via COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS assay, while rRT-PCR assay only detected 20 (30.7%) positive results in these samples. No positive results were obtained from clinical samples with non-COVID-19 infections.

There is little data on the use of on-demand telehealth to meet this need.Methods: The functional performance of on-demand telehealth as a COVID-19 remote patient screening approach was conducted by analysing 9270 patient requests.Results: Most on-demand telehealth requests (5712 of 9270 total requests; 61.6%) had a visit reason that was likely COVID-19 related. Of these, 79.1% (4518 of 5712) resulted in a completed encounter and 20.9% (1194 of 5712) resulted in left without being seen. Of the 4518 completed encounters, 19.1% were referred to an urgent care centre, emergency department or COVID-19 testing centre. The average completed encounter wait time was 26.5 min and the mean visit length was 8.8 min. For patients that completed an encounter 42.8% (1935 of 4518) stated they would have sought in-person care and 9.1% stated they would have done nothing if on-demand telehealth was unavailable.Discussion: On-demand telehealth can serve as a low-barrier approach to screen patients for COVID-19. This approach can prevent patients from visiting healthcare facilities, which reduces physical contact and reduces healthcare worker use of personal protective equipment.","output":"A descriptive analysis of an on-demand telehealth approach for remote COVID-19 patient screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Households are a significant venue for the transmission of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

This meta-analysis aims to assess the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in autoimmune diseases. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for observational and caseCcontrolled studies. We sorted medications into glucocorticoids, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs), which was also divided into monotherapy and b/tsDMARDsCcsDMARDs combination therapy. RESULTS: We analysed 62 observational studies with a total of 319 025 patients with autoimmune diseases. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.011 (95% CI: 0.005 to 0.025). Meta-analysis of seven caseCcontrolled studies demonstrated that the risk of COVID-19 in autoimmune diseases was significantly higher than in control patients (OR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.05 to 4.58, p=0.038). Meta-regression analysis showed glucocorticoids were significantly associated with the risk of COVID-19. For clinical outcomes, we assessed 65 studies with 2766 patients with autoimmune diseases diagnosed with COVID-19. The rates of hospitalisation and mortality were 0.35 (95% CI: 0.23 to 0.50) and 0.066 (95% CI: 0.036 to 0.12), respectively. Glucocorticoids, csDMARDs and b/tsDMARDsCcsDMARDs combination therapy increased the risk of these outcomes, whereas b/tsDMARDs monotherapy, particularly antitumour necrosis factor agents, were associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation and death.

One key social consequence of the infection has been the stigma associated with it. OBJECTIVES This study was conducted to explore the lived experiences of stigma among persons who have recovered from Covid-19 in Chennai, India. METHODS In depth telephonic interviews were conducted among 12 persons who had recovered from Covid-19 in Chennai. The participants were encouraged to narrate their experiences of stigma. The telephonic interviews were transcribed and coded by both the researchers. The codes were then grouped into meaningful themes and the lived experiences of stigma described with the help of rich narrative quotes. RESULTS The common manifestations of stigma were exclusion from public spaces and essential services, loss of livelihood, loss of social support and, in an extreme case, physical violence. The stigma was also manifested in health facilities in the form of neglect, and rude and insensitive treatment of patients. The factors that aggravated the stigma included fear of infection, lack of information, legitimisation of segregation by forced public health interventions, involvement of police in contact tracing, and isolation. Stigma was associated with psychosocial consequences such as loneliness, uncertainty, anxiety, anger, and humiliation. Demonstration of empathy, advances in communication technology, solidarity in communities and protecting confidentiality could potentially mitigate stigma. The intersectionality of age, gender, poverty, and disability worsened the experience of stigma. CONCLUSIONS People who had recovered from Covid-19 experienced various degrees of social stigma. The future impact of the pandemic will depend strongly on the ability of health systems to address stigma.","output":"A qualitative inquiry into stigma among patients with Covid-19 in Chennai, India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of CO2-insufflation with 5 and 10 mmHg on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in neonates. BACKGROUND An increasing percentage of surgical interventions in neonates are performed by minimal invasive techniques. Recently, concerns have been raised regarding a decrease of cerebral oxygenation in neonates during thoracoscopy as a result of CO2-insufflation. METHODS This was an animal experimental study. Piglets were anesthetized, intubated, ventilated, and surgically prepared for CO2-insufflation. Insufflation was done with 5 or 10 mmHg CO2 during 1 h. Arterial saturation (SaO2), heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) were monitored. CFTOE, an estimator of cerebral oxygen extraction ((SaO2 - rScO2)/SaO2)), was calculated. Arterial blood gases were drawn every 15': pre (T0), during (T1-T4) and after CO2-insufflation (T5). RESULTS Ten piglets (4 kg) were randomized for 5 (P5) and 10 (P10) mmHg CO2-insufflation. Two P10 piglets needed resuscitation after insufflation, none P5. Linear mixed-effect modeling of paCO2, pH, and SaO2 showed that values were dependent on time and time squared (p < 0.001) but were not different between the 5 and 10 mmHg groups. Analysis demonstrated significant changes over time in heart rate and MABP between the 5 and 10 mmHg groups, with a significant higher heart rate and lower blood pressure in the 10 mmHg group (p < 0.001). For rScO2 and cFTOE, no group differences could be demonstrated, but a significant effect of time was found: rScO2 increased and cFTOE decreased (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Insufflation of CO2 during thoracoscopy with 10 mmHg caused more severe hemodynamic instability and seems to be related with a decrease of cerebral perfusion as represented by a higher oxygen extraction. CO2-insufflation of 5 mmHg for thoracoscopy seems to have no adverse effects on cerebral oxygenation.","output":"The effects of CO2-insufflation with 5 and 10 mmHg during thoracoscopy on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in piglets: an animal experimental study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The article deals with a clinical case of new coronavirus infection in a 15-year-old child who was receiving treatment in an infectious diseases hospital of City Children's Clinical Hospital 3 during the period from 10 October to 1 December 2020.

In the intensive care units of Parisian hospitals in charge of patients with life-threatening viral contamination, caregivers had to resort to lopinavir-ritonavir-based tablets, crushing them and then dispersing the powder in milk to facilitate administration by nasogastric tube. The difficulties and poor control of this degraded mode, which does not always ensure control of the amount of the drug in the prepared dose and may induce insufficient antiviral exposure, led us to develop in a very short time, while ensuring quality control proportional to the risk, a liquid form as an alternative to Kaletra? oral solution shortage.

Based on the chemical and physical studies, the preparation was showed to be stable during at least 2 months between +2C and +8C and 1 week at room temperature. This has resulted in the design of kits that include multi-dose packaging and a measuring device and contain the appropriate quantities of drugs to ensure at least one week's treatment for each patient, during which time the kit in use can be stored at room temperature.

We explored the prognostic utility of procalcitonin (PCT), presepsin, and the Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) index for predicting 30-day-mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: In total, 54 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were enrolled. PCT and presepsin levels were measured using the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and HISCL Presepsin assay (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), respectively. The VACO index was calculated based on age, sex, and comorbidities. PCT and presepsin levels and the VACO index were compared using ROC curve, Kaplan-Meier method, and reclassification analysis for the 30-day mortality. Results: ROC curve analysis was used to measure PCT and presepsin levels and the VACO index to predict 30-day mortality; the optimal cut-off values were 0.138 ng/mL for PCT, 717 pg/mL for presepsin, and 12.1% for the VACO index. On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 15.9 (4.1-61.3) for PCT, 26.3 (6.4-108.0) for presepsin, and 6.0 (1.7-21.1) for the VACO index. On reclassification analysis, PCT and presepsin in addition to the VACO index significantly improved the prognostic value of the index. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the prognostic utility of measuring PCT and presepsin levels and the VACO index in COVID-19 patients.

Participants: In total, 187,783 participants (mean age 56.8 years, 54.9% women) who completed the 24-hour recall dietary questionnaire were included in the prospective study. A subgroup of 25,380 participants (mean age 55.7 years, 52.9% women) with brain structure data were included in the cross-sectional study. Main exposure and outcome measures: Cox proportional hazards models and linear regression models were used to examine the associations of seven diet quality scores, i.e., hPDI (Healthful Plant-based Diet index), MDS (Mediterranean Diet score), aMED (alternate Mediterranean diet), RFS (Recommended Food Score), DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet) and AHEI-2010 (the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010), with incident dementia and brain structure (estimated using magnetic resonance imaging), respectively. Results: During a total follow-up of 1,969,993 person-years, 1,363 (0.73%) participants developed dementia. Higher diet quality scores (except for hPDI) were consistently associated with a lower incidence risk of dementia (all P for trend<0.001). For instance, for RFS, the hazard ratios of the intermediate tertile group and the highest tertile group relative to the lowest tertile group were 0.85 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]=0.75 to 0.97) and 0.70 (95%CI=0.61 to 0.81), respectively. Moreover, higher diet quality scores were significantly associated with larger regional brain volumes including volumes of grey matter (GM) in the parietal and temporal cortex and volumes of the hippocampus and thalamus. For instance, higher RFS was associated with larger volumes of GM in the postcentral gyrus (Beta=16.05, SD=4.08, P<0.001) and the hippocampus (Beta=5.87,SD=1.26, P<0.001). A series of sensitivity analyses confirmed the main results. Conclusion: Greater adherence to MDS, aMED, RFS, DASH, MIND, and AHEI-2010 were individually associated with lower risk of incident dementia and larger brain volumes in specific regions.

The multifunctional protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is accepted as its primary target for entry into host cells. In its enzymatic function, ACE2, like its homologue ACE, regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) critical for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis in mammals. Unlike ACE, however, ACE2 drives an alternative RAS pathway by degrading Ang-II and thus operates to balance RAS homeostasis in the context of hypertension, heart failure, and cardiovascular as well as renal complications of diabetes. Outside the RAS, ACE2 hydrolyzes key peptides, such as amyloid-, apelin, and [des-Arg9]-bradykinin. In addition to its enzymatic functions, ACE2 is found to regulate intestinal amino acid homeostasis and the gut microbiome. Although the non-enzymatic function of ACE2 as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has been well established, the contribution of enzymatic functions of ACE2 to the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related lung injury has been a matter of debate. A complete understanding of this central enzyme may begin to explain the various symptoms and pathologies seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and may aid in the development of novel treatments for COVID-19.","output":"Multifunctional angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, and critical appraisal of its role in acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the middle of March, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection a global pandemic. While China experienced a dramatic decline in daily growth rate of COVID-19, multiple importations of new cases from other countries and their related local infections caused a rapid rise. Between March 12 and April 15, we collected nasopharyngeal samples from 109 imported cases from 25 countries and 69 local cases in Guangzhou, China. In order to characterize the transmission patterns and genetic evolution of this virus among different populations, we sequenced the genome of SARS-CoV-2. The imported viral strains were assigned to lineages distributed in Europe (33.0%), America (17.4%), Africa (25.7%), or Southeast/West Asia (23.9%). Importantly, 10 imported cases from Africa formed two novel sub-lineages not identified in global tree previously. A detailed analysis showed that the imported viral strains from Philippines and Pakistan were closely related and within the same sub-lineage, whereas Ethiopia had varied lineages in the African phylogenetic tree. In spite of the diversity of imported SARS-CoV-2, 60 of 69 local infections could be traced back to two specific small lineages imported from Africa. A combined genetic and epidemiological analysis revealed a high-resolution transmission network of the imported SARS-CoV-2 in local communities, which might help inform the public health response and genomic surveillance in other cities and regions. Finally, we observed in-frame deletions on seven loci of SARS-CoV-2 genome, some of which were intra-host mutations, and they exhibited no enrichment on the S protein. Our findings provide new insight into the viral phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and beta coronavirus.","output":"Genomic surveillance of a resurgence of COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This exploration assumes the universality of certain aspects of the psyche which enmesh with an ideology like fascism, while examining the phenomenon in India It attempts to understand the support of a sizable section of people to the discernible growth of fascism in the past three decades in Indian society The purpose is to explore group processes and individual psyche The article attempts to articulate the factors?pre-dominantly unconscious?in the psyche of the Indian Hindu male which might fit into or play a role in the mobilization toward a fascist political and social agenda The nature of marital relations in society and the close ?mother?son? bond are examined in the context of the development of the personality of a growing boy The extreme suppression of sexuality, valorization of celibacy, idealization of mother, the model of the obedient son with no room for ambivalence and the feelings of inadequacy, frustrations and rage engendered form a central focus The processes of splitting, idealization, and projective identification which result in the demonization by the Hindu community of the ?other?

Based on the genomic analysis of 51 complete dengue virus sequences, all of which cocirculated in Thailand between 1974 and 2001, we report here the occurrence of homologous recombination in the NS5 nonstructural gene region of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) strains. In order to analyze those 51 virus sequences at one time, we chose to use a highly sensitive recombination detection program called RDP. When RDP detects a possible recombination event, further bootscanning and phylogenetic tree analyses are applied to these candidate sequences to identify this recombination event. We found that within the DENV-2 subfamily, the strain ThNH63/93 is the evolutionary product of a recombination event between ThNH62/93 and ThD2_0284_90 strains. The strain ThNH62/93 was identified as the major parent, while the strain ThD2_0284_90 was the minor parent. The recombination site was determined to localize between positions 7967 ( 36 nt) and 8283 ( 36 nt) with a significance level of p < 0.001. Our results showed, for the first time, that an intraserotype recombination event occurred between DENV-2 strains in the nonstructural gene region; by contrast, an interserotype recombination between different serotypes of dengue strains was not identified. This study thus supports the theory that homologous recombination plays a key role in dengue virus evolution.","output":"Recombination in the nonstructural gene region in type 2 dengue viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction of distance learning in Ukrainian schools during quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic has updated the study of use of different types of electronic educational resources by teachers to ensure qualitative distance learning.

Local trainees highlighted that, whilst induction to their obstetric rotation was useful, they felt unprepared for the practical aspects of the job;the different anaesthetic techniques and also the change in working environment with an unfamiliar multidisciplinary team dynamic. Furthermore, the unfamiliar obstetric terms meant that many felt they had little confidence and struggled to catch up to where they felt they needed to be to work comfortably. We decided to arrange a one-day teaching programme for trainees who were about to rotate into obstetrics to address these shortcomings and demystify some aspects of labour ward. Methods: A survey was sent to core trainees across South Wales to identify interest in the course and main areas of concern. These areas were: anaesthetic techniques, labour ward tips and tricks, communication and team-working, basic obstetric physiology and jargon-busting, basics of cardiotocography, management of obstetric emergencies, and topics relevant to the Primary FRCA. Colleagues from anaesthetics, obstetrics and midwifery kindly agreed to provide this teaching via lectures, interactive small-group skills stations and faculty-led demonstrations. Delegate numbers were restricted to 12 due to COVID-19 social distancing regulations and a small fee was charged to cover personal protective equipment costs, lunch and refreshments. Results: In the pre-course questionnaire, 91% of respondents felt they would benefit from a course, 63% felt between ambivalent and very uncomfortable with their understanding for how labour ward works, 54% were uncomfortable with their technical skills relating to obstetric anaesthesia, 77% were not comfortable with managing obstetric emergencies and 64% were not comfortable with obstetric terminology and jargon. Post-course feedback was as follows: 86% of candidates reported feeling somewhat or very comfortable with how labour ward worked. 86% felt confident in their obstetric technical skills, 72% felt confident managing obstetric emergencies and 100% of respondents were comfortable with obstetric terminology. Discussion: We are not aware of any teaching programme in our region for trainees rotating into obstetrics for the first time. Our aim was to address the anxieties identified by junior trainees by providing additional teaching to enhance induction into working on labour ward. The BOAST course was attended by trainees from several hospitals across South Wales. Feedback was extremely positive and as a result we plan to run the course twice a year to facilitate up-to-date teaching for those rotating into obstetric departments.","output":"P.89 A new teaching programme for novices in obstetric anaesthesia: Basic Obstetric Anaesthetic Skills Training (BOAST)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic forced many countries to apply restrictive measures.

All the data from discharge notes were collected between March 15th and June 15th of 2020 (n=59), and in the homologous period of the previous year (n=178). The referral after evaluation (primary care, child and adolescent psychiatry consultation, inpatient unit) was considered a measure of severity.ResultsThe demographic variables (sex, age) were homogeneous between the two groups (p  0,05). 17,4% (n=31) of the sample from 2019, and 16,9% (n=10) of the sample of 2020 had suicidal ideation, which was not statistically different between groups (p=1,000).

Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. We assessed the efficacy of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-centre, randomized controlled trial in adults with moderate COVID-19 admitted to the Ghaem Shahr Razi Hospital in Mazandaran Province, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to 400 mg sofosbuvir, 60 mg daclatasvir and 1200 mg ribavirin (intervention group) or to standard care (control group). The primary endpoint of this study was length of hospital stay. This study is registered by IRCT.ir under the ID: IRCT20200328046886N1. RESULTS: Between 20 March 2020 and 8 April 2020, 48 patients were recruited; 24 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 24 to the control group. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days in both groups (P = 0.398). The number of ICU admissions in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin group was not significantly lower than the control group (0 versus 4, P = 0.109).

The current management of COVID-19 is based generally on supportive therapy and treatment to prevent respiratory failure. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. AREAS COVERED A literature search was performed using PubMed between December 1, 2019-June 23, 2020. This review highlights the current state of knowledge on the viral replication and pathogenicity, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and management of COVID-19. This review will be of interest to scientists and clinicians and make a significant contribution toward development of vaccines and targeted therapies to contain the pandemic. EXPERT OPINION The exit strategy for a path back to normal life is required, which should involve a multi-prong effort toward development of new treatment and a successful vaccine to protect public health worldwide and prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks. Therefore, the bench to bedside translational research as well as reverse translational works focusing bedside to bench is very important and would provide the foundation for the development of targeted drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 infections.","output":"Resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intestinal microbiota comprises diverse fungal and viral components, in addition to bacteria.

Misconceptions have relied on seasonal mediation of respiratory diseases driven solely by environmental variables. However, seasonality is expected to be driven by host social behavior, particularly in highly susceptible populations. A key gap in understanding the role of social behavior in respiratory disease seasonality is our incomplete understanding of the seasonality of indoor human activity. We leverage a novel data stream on human mobility to characterize activity in indoor versus outdoor environments in the United States. We use a mobile app-based location dataset encompassing over 5 million locations nationally. We classify locations as primarily indoor (e.g. stores, offices) or outdoor (e.g. playgrounds, farmers markets), disentangling location-specific visitor counts into indoor and outdoor, to arrive at a fine-scale measure of indoor to outdoor human activity across time and space. We find the proportion of indoor to outdoor activity during a baseline year is seasonal, peaking in winter months. The measure displays a latitudinal gradient with stronger seasonality at northern latitudes and an additional summer peak in southern latitudes. We statistically fit this baseline indoor-outdoor activity measure to inform incorporation of this complex empirical pattern into infectious disease dynamic models. However, we find that the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic caused these patterns to shift significantly from baseline, and the empirical patterns are necessary to predict spatio-temporal heterogeneity in disease dynamics. Our work empirically characterizes, for the first time, the seasonality of human social behavior at a large-scale with high spatio-temporal resolution, and provides a parsimonious parameterization of seasonal behavior that can be included in infectious disease dynamics models. We provide critical evidence and methods necessary to inform the public health of seasonal and pandemic respiratory pathogens and improve our understanding of the relationship between the physical environment and infection risk in the context of global ecological change.","output":"Disentangling the rhythms of human activity in the built environment for airborne transmission risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present experiments on molecular density fluctuations in liquid and supercritical (SC) CO2 using small-angle neutron scattering.

METHODS Patients with PHN  3 months, who had completed participation in a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of G-GR in PHN, who wished to continue treatment with G-GR, and who the investigator thought would benefit from study participation received G-GR 1800 mg as an asymmetrically divided dose (600 mg AM/1200 mg PM) for an additional 14 weeks. Analyses were performed on safety data from patients who received G-GR for 10 weeks in the randomized controlled study and who then received an additional 14 weeks of G-GR, asymmetrically dosed in the current study. Safety assessments included the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), the occurrence of serious AEs, changes in physical and neurological examination findings, clinical laboratory assessments, and changes in weight. RESULTS Eighty patients treated with G-GR in the randomized, controlled study participated in this 14-week extension study. The incidence of AEs commonly observed with gabapentin (dizziness, somnolence) was low and the frequency, intensity, and severity of AEs did not change with long-term treatment.

METHODS: COVID-19 cases and deaths from 28 February to 21 May 2020 of 37 WHO European countries were aggregated into 12 consecutive weeks. The fuzzy C-means clustering was performed to identify similar countries in COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and log-log linear regression analyses were performed to set up relation between COVID-19 mortality rate and age. Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test was used to explore differences between countries possessing higher mortality rate and age. RESULTS: Based on the highest value of the coefficient of overall separation five clusters of similar countries were identified for incidence rate, mortality rate and in total. Analysis according to weeks offered trends where progress of COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate was visible. Pearson coefficient (0.69) suggested moderately strong connection between mortality rate and age, Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant differences between countries experiencing higher mortality rate and age vs. countries having both indicators lower (p < 0.001).

One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup integrates existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, and built the system around a low-cost camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and an inexpensive tablet computer to present view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. In this paper, we thoroughly document the improved system; the accompanying repository incorporates CAD files, parts lists, source code, and detailed instructions. We detail a complete ~$300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories.

We report the current state of this system, which started with a 1-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues toward a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems.

Several risk factors for severe disease have been identified, most of which coincide with advanced age. In younger individuals, severe COVID-19 often occurs in the absence of obvious comorbidities. Guided by the finding of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells with some cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patient, we decided to investigate whether CMV seropositivity is associated with severe or critical COVID-19. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) serostatus was investigated as control. METHODS: National German COVID-19 bio-sample and data banks were used to retrospectively analyze the CMV and HSV serostatus of patients who experienced mild (n = 101), moderate (n = 130) or severe to critical (n = 80) disease by IgG serology. We then investigated the relationship between disease severity and herpesvirus serostatus via statistical models. RESULTS: Non-geriatric patients (< 60 years) with severe COVID-19 were found to have a very high prevalence of CMV-seropositivity, while CMV status distribution in individuals with mild disease was similar to the prevalence in the German population; interestingly, this was not detectable in older patients. Prediction models support the hypothesis that the CMV serostatus, unlike HSV, might be a strong biomarker in identifying younger individuals with a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, in particular in absence of other co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified CMV-seropositivity as a potential novel risk factor for severe COVID-19 in non-geriatric individuals in the studied cohorts.

Tetraspanin homology and susceptibility to HCV correlate positively. For some chimeras, infectivity correlates with surface expression.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included a retrospective analysis of all prostate biopsies performed on patients in the VAHCS without a preexisting PC diagnosis between January 2018 and March 2021. The base population included all living male patients who had at least 1 visit to the VAHCS during the 3 years prior to each month of the study. Exposure: The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were the number of prostate biopsies and PC diagnoses by month. The influence of the pandemic on prostate biopsy volume and the incidence of PC diagnoses was modeled using an interrupted time-series analysis. Poisson generalized linear models were fitted to project the expected number of prostate biopsies and PC diagnoses had there been no pandemic interruption. Additional models were used to test for differences by race. Results: Prior to the pandemic (January 2018 through February 2020), monthly biopsy numbers among 51a?606 included men ranged between 1230 and 1695, of which 56% to 60% of results were positive for PC. The estimated number of missed PC diagnoses from March 2020 through March 2021 ranged from 97 cases (October 2020: 752 cases expected, 655 cases observed) to 573 cases (April 2020: 794 cases expected, 221 cases observed). Prior to the pandemic, biopsy rates were statistically significantly higher among Black vs White men (incidence rate ratio, 2.25; 95% CI, 2.06-2.46; P < .001).

We evaluated the effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on RA and identified the relationship between the c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and MMP-3. We hypothesized that elucidating this relationship would lead to novel therapeutic approaches to RA treatment and management. METHODS: We investigated the effect of administering a low dose (1000 M or less) of an antioxidant (NAC) to human rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (MH7A cells). We also investigated the response of antioxidant genes such as nuclear factor erythroid -derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Sequestosome 1 (p62). The influence of MMP-3 expression on the JNK pathway leading to joint destruction and the mechanisms underlying this relationship were investigated through primary dispersion culture cells collected from the synovial membranes of RA patients, consisting of rheumatoid arthritis-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS). RESULTS: Low-dose NAC (1000 M) increased the expression of Nrf2 and phospho-p62 in MH7A cells, activating antioxidant genes, suppressing the expression of MMP-3, and inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK. ROS, MMP-3 expression, and IL-6 was suppressed by administering 30 M of SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) in MH7A cells. Furthermore, the administration of SP600125 (30 M) to RA-FLS suppressed MMP-3. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the existence of an MMP-3 suppression mechanism that utilizes the JNK pathway in RA-FLS. We consider that the JNK pathway could be a target for future RA therapies.","output":"The JNK pathway represents a novel target in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis through the suppression of MMP-3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-Cov2 has raised concerns among dermatologists regarding psoriasis and its respective treatments. Comorbidities, which induce the expression of the proprotease furin have been associated with severe course of COVID-19. Furin and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) play a major role in viral host cell entry of SARS-Cov2. Objective: To evaluate mRNA expression of Furin and ACE2 from blood cells in psoriasis patients, and whether systemic or topical treatment reduces expression levels. Methods: This observational translational study analyzed blood samples from patients from a clinical trial and samples retrieved from the biobank of the Psoriasis Registry Austria (PsoRA). Furin and ACE2 expression levels were analyzed prior to as well as 3 and 12C24 months after start of biologic treatment with either ustekinumab or secukinumab. Additionally, the study analyzed expression levels prior to, 6 days after start of dithranol treatment and 4C6 weeks after end of dithranol treatment. Results: Furin mRNA expression was significantly increased at baseline in the biologic (4.9  2.6 fold, p < 0.0001) and in the dithranol group (2.7  1.4 fold, p < 0.001) compared to controls. There was a trend for arthritis patients to express more furin than patients with psoriatic skin involvement only (5.26  2.30 vs. 3.48  2.27, p = 0.078). Analyzing furin mRNA expression after treatment initiation with secukinumab or ustekinumab revealed a normalization of levels after 3 and 12 to 24 months. Similar findings were obtained for patients treated with dithranol, with significantly decreased expression levels 6 days after start of dithranol treatment and also at follow-up, (4C6 weeks after dithranol treatment had been terminated). ACE2 expression levels did not differ from controls at any timepoint, regardless of biologic or topical treatment. Conclusion: Significantly overexpressed levels of furin were observed in untreated patients, and, thus, these patients may be at risk for infection and a severe course of COVID-19. However, the data indicate that successful therapeutic intervention in psoriasis, by systemic biologic or topical treatment, can efficiently reduce furin levels in blood cells, possibly limiting the risk of psoriasis patients for a severe COVID-19 course.

Standard precautions are embedded in modern healthcare policies, but not uniformly observed by all clinicians. Well-documented differences in attitudes to IPC, between doctors and nurses, contribute to suboptimal IPC practices and persistence of preventable healthcare-associated infections. The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected healthcare professionals work-practices, lives and health and increased awareness and observance of IPC. Successful transition of health services to a post-COVID-19 future, will depend on sustainable integration of lessons learnt into routine practice. METHODS: The aim of this pre-COVID-19 qualitative study was to investigate factors influencing doctors IPC attitudes and practices, whether they differ from those of nurses and, if so, how this affects interprofessional relationships. We hypothesised that better understanding would guide new strategies to achieve more effective IPC. We interviewed 26 senior clinicians (16 doctors and 10 nurses) from a range of specialties, at a large Australian tertiary hospital. Interview transcripts were reviewed iteratively, and themes identified inductively, using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants from both professions painted clichd portraits of typical doctors and nurses and recounted unflattering anecdotes of their IPC behaviours. Doctors were described as self-directed and often unaware or disdainful of IPC rules; while nurses were portrayed as slavishly following rules, ostensibly to protect patients, irrespective of risk or evidence. Many participants believed that doctors object to being reminded of IPC requirements by nurses, despite many senior doctors having limited knowledge of correct IPC practice. Overall, participants comments suggested that the doctor-nurse gamedescribed in the 1960s, to exemplify the complex power disparity between professionsis still in play, despite changes in both professions, in the interim. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that interprofessional differences and inconsistencies constrain IPC practice improvement. IPC inconsistencies and failures can be catastrophic, but the common threat of COVID-19 has promoted focus and unity. Appropriate implementation of IPC policies should be context-specific and respect the needs and expertise of all stakeholders. We propose an ethical framework to guide interprofessional collaboration in establishing a path towards sustained improvements in IPC and bio-preparedness.","output":"What is needed to sustain improvements in hospital practices post-COVID-19? a qualitative study of interprofessional dissonance in hospital infection prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with specific health profiles and diseases (such as diabetes, lung and heart conditions) have been classified as 'clinically vulnerable' (CV) to COVID-19, that is, at higher risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19, and were targeted for shielding. However, there is as yet little evidence on how the pandemic and shielding impacted the health and social well-being of CV older people. METHODS: We used data from wave 9 (2018/2019) and the first COVID-19 substudy (June/July 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Using logistic and linear regression models, we investigated associations between being CV and health and social well-being during the pandemic, while controlling for prepandemic levels of the outcome variables. We also explored the interactions between CV and age group (50s, 60s, 70s, 80+), and between CV and shielding. RESULTS: CV people were more likely to report worse health and social well-being outcomes during the pandemic, even taking into account prepandemic differences. However, changes in health were not uniform across different age groups, and CV respondents were generally at greater risks of deterioration in health and social well-being compared with those not CV in the same age group. CV respondents who were shielding reported worse outcomes compared with those not CV and not shielding.

Here, we report our finding that even in a molecule with D and A not resolvable, CT can be induced by electronic state mixing (ESM) in a symmetric multi-chromophore system (MCS), namely 1,4-di(1-pyrenyl)benzene (Py-Benz-Py). Unlike Py and Py-Benz, Py-Benz-Py exhibits unique photophysical properties attributable to the reduction of the energy gap between two electronic states induced by ESM. The ESM for Py-Benz-Py is due to the extended &#960;-conjugation owing to the further introduction of Py into Py-Benz, and consequently leads to the favorable intramolecular CT, followed by the planarization due to the twisting motion between Py and phenyl moieties. Time-resolved spectroscopic data demonstrate that the twisting process of the Py moiety in acetonitrile occurs with two unequal time constants, suggesting the localized CT state and the asynchronous twisting dynamics of two Py moieties unlike the delocalized CT state in nonpolar and low-polarity solvents leading to the synchronous twisting of two Py moieties. This means that the symmetry-breaking CT in MCSs can induce an asynchronous twisting motion. The results reported here support that a molecule without CT can be turned into another molecule with CT induced by ESM and demonstrate that the excited-state relaxation dynamics can be regulated through the ESM induced by introducing the substituents or changing the environmental factors such as solvent polarities.","output":"Charge transfer induced by electronic state mixing in a symmetric X-Y-X-type multi-chromophore system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Starting from historic reflections, the current SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 pandemic is examined from various perspectives, in terms of what it implies for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the modeling and monitoring of the epidemic, the development of early-warning systems, the study of mortality, prevalence estimation, diagnostic and serological testing, vaccine development, and ultimately clinical trials.

The ferroptosis-related gene expression, one-way Cox analysis, and least-selection absolute regression algorithm (LASSO) are used to track prognostic-related genes and create risk assessment models. Finally, immune system infiltration and immune control point analysis are used to study the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment related to risk assessment.

Screening programmes and non-urgent tests have been postponed; clinical trials have suffered a setback. Similarly, in the area of cardiology care, a significant decline in STEMI accesses and an increase in cases of late presenting heart attacks with increased mortality and complication rates have been reported.

We also found that a chemical SAP inhibitor strongly recovered the suppressed innate immune responses to DNA in the presence of human serum and enhanced the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in vivo.

Social touch is a common and mutual way of expressing affection, care, and intimacy. From an evolutionary perspective, affiliative and affectionate touch are considered necessary for social and cognitive development throughout life-stages and across species. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic as a public health threat has mandated social distancing as a measure to contain the global outbreak. Travel restrictions, lockdown, and quarantine have led to separation and segregation, giving rise to social touch deprivation that might have adverse biopsychosocial consequences. METHODS Affective touch has rarely been discussed within the purview of social psychiatry. We attempted to review the neurobiological, social, and behavioural correlates of social and sexual touch, as well as the neurophysiological models involved. RESULTS The unmyelinated peripheral C-fibre afferents projecting to insular cortex and somatosensory areas form the prime pathway for affective touch. 'Top-down' modulation via the periaqueductal grey area, rostroventral medulla and sub-cortical structures, and 'Bottom-up' approach via the dorsal horn of the spine form the two theoretical models of 'social touch' system.

Sexual intimacy involves other neurotransmitters, with increased oxytocin activity in the limbic structures, Nucleus Accumbens, Anterior Cingulate, and Prefrontal Cortex. The discrimination and amalgamation of touch senses, their affiliative value and emotional valence in humans are based on a complex interplay between psychobiological, environmental, and personal factors.

Heifers were offered meadow hay (8 to 11% CP) from early November to mid-February and provided no supplement (CON; n = 37), 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried distillers grains with solublesCbased supplement (HI; n = 39), or 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried corn gluten feedCbased supplement (LO; n = 38). Supplements were designed to be isonitrogenous (28% CP) and isocaloric but to differ in RUP with HI (59% RUP) having greater levels of RUP than LO (34% RUP). After the individual feeding period, heifers were placed in a drylot for calving. All heifers were bred using a fixed-timed AI protocol and pairs were moved to a commercial ranch in the Nebraska Sandhills for summer grazing. Calf weaning BW did not differ (P = 0.14) based on maternal diet. However, feedlot entry BW was greater (P = 0.03) for HI compared with CON calves. Average daily gain during the initial feedlot phase tended (P = 0.10) to be greatest for calves born to CON dams and lowest for calves born to LO dams. However, overall ADG was similar (P = 0.50) for the entire feedlot period. Residual feed intake during the reimplant and total feeding period was improved in calves born to supplemented dams in yr 2 and 3 compared with calves born to CON dams. There was no difference in final BW among treatments (P = 0.71). Hot carcass weight was similar (P = 0.72) among treatments; however, steers had greater (P < 0.01) HCW than heifers. Furthermore, percent empty body fat and 12th rib fat thickness were lowest (P = 0.05 and P = 0.04) for calves born to LO dams. Tenderness measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force was increased (P = 0.03) in longissimus samples from calves from CON dams compared to calves from LO dams. Similarly, crude fat levels tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for calves from CON dams compared with calves from LO dams. Based on these data, providing RUP supplements, similar to those used in this study, to primiparous heifers in late gestation consuming ad libitum grass hay resulted in increased initial feedlot BW for HI compared to CON calves, improved feed efficiency, and altered carcass characteristics in calves born to supplemented compared with CON dams.","output":"Impact of supplemental protein source offered to primiparous heifers during gestation on II.

PROCEDURES: Proteins expressed in the islets of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) with extensive insulitis were identified by laser-capture microdissection mass spectrometry using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues. RESULTS: Thirty-eight proteins were identified solely in FT1DM islets, most of which have not been previously linked to type 1 diabetes. Five protein-protein interacting clusters were identified, and the cellular localization of selected proteins was validated immunohistochemically. Migratory activity-related proteins, including plastin-2 (LCP1), moesin (MSN), lamin-B1 (LMNB1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1) and others, were identified in CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages infiltrated to inflamed FT1DM islets. Proteins involved in successive signaling in innate/adaptive immunity were identified, including SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1), proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1), HLA class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA-C), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1). Angiogenic (thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP)) and anti-angiogenic (tryptophan-tRNA ligase (WARS)) factors were identified in migrating CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages. Proteins related to virus replication and cell proliferation, including probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 5 (DDX5) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH1), were identified. The anti-apoptotic protein T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5), the anti-oxidative enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PDG), and the anti-viral and anti-apoptotic proteins serpin B6 (SERPINB6) and heat shock 70 kDa protein1-like (HSPA1L), were identified in FT1DM-affected islet cells.

Unscheduled healthcare constitutes a substantial portion of healthcare delivery. A systematic review was conducted to establish the factors that influence parents decision making when seeking unscheduled healthcare for their children. The systematic review question was What are the factors that influence the decision making of parents and families seeking unscheduled paediatric healthcare? METHOD: Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, PsycInfo, EconLit) and four grey literature databases (Proquest, Lenus, OpenGrey, Google Scholar) were searched. The titles and abstracts of 3746 articles were screened and full-text screening was performed on 177 of these articles. Fifty-six papers were selected for inclusion in the review. Data relating to different types of unscheduled health services (namely primary care, the emergency department and out-of-hours services) were extracted from these articles. A narrative approach was used to synthesise the extracted data. RESULTS: Several factors were identified as influencing parental preferences and decision making when seeking unscheduled healthcare for their children. A number of the included studies identified pre-disposing factors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) as impacting the healthcare-seeking behaviour of parents. Unscheduled healthcare use was often initiated by the parents perception that the childs condition was urgent and their need for reassurance. The choice of unscheduled service was influenced by a myriad of factors such as: waiting times, availability of GP appointments, location of the ED, and the relationship that the parent or caregiver had with their GP. CONCLUSION: Policy and planning initiatives do not always reflect how patients negotiate the health system as a single entity with numerous entry points. Altering patients behaviour through public health initiatives that seek to improve, for instance, health literacy or reducing emergency hospital admissions through preventative primary care requires an understanding of the relative importance of factors that influence behaviour and decision making, and the interactions between these factors.","output":"Factors that influence family and parental preferences and decision making for unscheduled paediatric healthcare C systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) has become the reason for the world to declare it as a global pandemic, which has already taken many lives from all around the world. This pandemic has become a disaster since the spreading rate from person to person is incredibly high and many techniques have come forth to aid in stopping the infection. Although various types of methods have been put into implementation, the search and suggestions of new approaches to reduce the increasing rate of infection will never come to an end until a vaccine terminates this pandemic. This study focuses on proposing a new framework that is based on Deep Learning algorithms for recognizing the COVID-19 cases, mostly in public places. The algorithms include Background Subtraction for extracting the foreground of thermal images from thermal videos generated by Thermal Cameras through the Thermal Imaging process and the Convolutional Neural Network for detecting people infected with the virus. This automated prototype works in a real-time scenario that helps identify people with the disease and will try to trace it while separating them from having any other contact.

To analyze these data, researchers use techniques commonly referred to as statistical learning or machine learning (ML). The latter is known for large successes in the field of diagnostics, for example, by identification of radiological anomalies. In other research areas, such as clustering and prediction studies, there is more discussion regarding the benefit and efficiency of ML techniques compared with statistical learning. In this viewpoint, we aim to explain commonly used statistical learning and ML techniques and provide guidance for responsible use in the case of clustering and prediction questions in critical care. Clustering studies have been increasingly popular in critical care research, aiming to inform how patients can be characterized, classified, or treated differently. An important challenge for clustering studies is to ensure and assess generalizability. This limits the application of findings in these studies toward individual patients. In the case of predictive questions, there is much discussion as to what algorithm should be used to most accurately predict outcome. Aspects that determine usefulness of ML, compared with statistical techniques, include the volume of the data, the dimensionality of the preferred model, and the extent of missing data. There are areas in which modern ML methods may be preferred. However, efforts should be made to implement statistical frameworks (e.g., for dealing with missing data or measurement error, both omnipresent in clinical data) in ML methods. To conclude, there are important opportunities but also pitfalls to consider when performing clustering or predictive studies with ML techniques. We advocate careful valuation of new data-driven findings. More interaction is needed between the engineer mindset of experts in ML methods, the insight in bias of epidemiologists, and the probabilistic thinking of statisticians to extract as much information and knowledge from data as possible, while avoiding harm.

As the virus entrance into the organism via the lungs, this organ is involved in a unique manner. As a consequence of COVID-19, abnormalities of the lungs may lead to impaired gas exchange and result in a reduced blood oxygenation, especially during exercise. In order to address the intensity and diversity of symptoms, an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program is recommended. Beside diagnostics and pharmaceutical optimization, the multimodal approach includes several therapeutic components like exercise training, breathing therapy and psychological counseling. According to constantly new insights into this field, therapies have to be adapted permanently.

This study is based on a questionnaire survey on the perception and reception of robots used for medical care in the pandemic among the Chinese population. A total of 1667 people participated in the survey, 93.6% of respondents were pursuing or had completed a bachelor, master or even doctorate degree. The results show that Chinese people generally held positive attitudes towards anti-pandemic robots and affirmed their contribution to reducing the burden of medical care and virus transmission. A few respondents were concerned about the issues of robots replacing humans and it was apparent that their ethical views on robots were not completely consistent across their demographics (e.g., age, industry). Nevertheless, most respondents tended to be optimistic about robot applications and dialectical about the ethical issues involved. This is related to the prominent role robots played during the pandemic, the Chinese publics expectations of new technologies and technology-friendly public opinion in China. Exploring the perception and reception of anti-pandemic robots in different countries or cultures is important because it can shed some light on the future applications of robots, especially in the field of infectious disease control.","output":"Public Perception and Reception of Robotic Applications in Public Health Emergencies Based on a Questionnaire Survey Conducted during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Outcomes of lung transplant recipients (LTR) hospitalized for COVID-19 and comparisons to non-lung solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) are incompletely described Methods Using a multicenter prospective registry of SOTR, we examined 28-day outcomes (mortality [primary outcome], intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and bacterial pneumonia) among both LTR and non-lung SOTR hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed between March 1, 2020 and September 21, 2020 Data were analyzed using Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX);chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for mortality Results The cohort included 72 LTR and 392 non-lung SOTR (Table 1) Overall, 28-day mortality trended higher in LTR vs non-lung SOTR (27 8% vs 19 9%, P=0 136) Other 28-day outcomes were similar between LTR and non-lung SOTR: ICU admission (45 8% vs 39 1%, P=0 28), mechanical ventilation (32 9% vs 31 1%, P=0 78), and bacterial pneumonia (15 3% vs 8 2%, P=0 063) Congestive heart failure, diabetes, age &gt;65 years, and obesity (BMI &gt;= 30) were independently associated with mortality in non-lung SOTR, but not in LTR (Table 2) Conclusion In this large prospective cohort comparing lung and non-lung SOTR hospitalized for COVID-19, there were high but not significantly different rates of short-term morbidity and mortality Baseline comorbidities appeared to drive mortality in non-lung SOTR but not LTR Further studies are needed to identify risk factors for mortality among LTR","output":"A Multicenter Prospective Registry Study of Lung Transplant Recipients Hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The long-term health outcomes and symptom burden of COVID-19 remain largely unclear.

METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study of patients visiting a rheumatology clinic was conducted in 2018. We used a survey to assess patients attitude on the perceived effectiveness when comparing TM versus in-person visits, as well as patients access to technology, distance traveled by the patient to attend the clinic visit, and demographic parameters. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients were included. Negative correlations were found between the increase in age and access to technologies (front-facing camera (mean age difference ? 12.8), telephone (mean age difference ? 14.4), and stable internet connection (mean age difference ? 15.1)), as well as believing that their needs could be met through TM (r ? .224, p < 0.001) and thinking that TM could be an appropriate alternative method of healthcare (r ? .298, p < 0.001). Younger patients reported more conflict between appointments and work hours (mean age difference ? 11.73). Follow-up patients were more likely to feel that their visit could have been possible over the phone (mean difference ? 1.13) or video conferencing (mean difference ? 1.13) compared to new patients. Older patients were less likely to think that the purpose of their rheumatology visits could be achieved over the phone (r ? .207, p = 0.003) or video conferencing (r ? .331, p = 0.001).

We then apply this framework to our behavioural responses to COVID-19 and demonstrate that three types of conflicts are occurring: (1) conflicting selection pressures on individuals, (2) evolutionary mismatches between the context in which our healthcare behaviours evolved and our globalized world of today and (3) evolutionary displacements in which older forms of care are currently dispensed through more derived forms. We discuss the significance of understanding how healthcare systems evolve and change for thinking about the role of healthcare systems in society during and after the time of COVID-19and for us as a species as we continue to face selection from infectious diseases.","output":"The evolution of the human healthcare system and implications for understanding our responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Numerous genetic testing options for individuals with epilepsy have emerged over the past decade without clear guidelines regarding optimal testing strategies. We performed a systematic evidence review (SER) and conducted meta-analyses of the diagnostic yield of genetic tests commonly utilized for patients with epilepsy. We also assessed nonyield outcomes (NYOs) such as changes in treatment and/or management, prognostic information, recurrence risk determination, and genetic counseling. METHODS We performed an SER, in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central through December of 2020. We included studies that utilized genome sequencing (GS), exome sequencing (ES), multigene panel (MGP), and/or genome-wide comparative genomic hybridization/chromosomal microarray (CGH/CMA) in cohorts (n  10) ascertained for epilepsy. Quality assessment was undertaken using ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions). We estimated diagnostic yields and 95% confidence intervals with random effects meta-analyses and narratively synthesized NYOs. RESULTS From 5985 nonduplicated articles published through 2020, 154 met inclusion criteria and were included in meta-analyses of diagnostic yield; 43 of those were included in the NYO synthesis. The overall diagnostic yield across all test modalities was 17%, with the highest yield for GS (48%), followed by ES (24%), MGP (19%), and CGH/CMA (9%). The only phenotypic factors that were significantly associated with increased yield were (1) the presence of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and/or (2) the presence of neurodevelopmental comorbidities. Studies reporting NYOs addressed clinical and personal utility of testing. SIGNIFICANCE This comprehensive SER, focused specifically on the literature regarding patients with epilepsy, provides a comparative assessment of the yield of clinically available tests, which will help shape clinician decision-making and policy regarding insurance coverage for genetic testing. We highlight the need for prospective assessment of the clinical and personal utility of genetic testing for patients with epilepsy and for standardization in reporting patient characteristics.","output":"Genetic testing for the epilepsies: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Primary care professionals can play an important role in both prevention and early detection of CRC. Most CRCs are attributed to modifiable lifestyle factors, which can be addressed within primary care, and promotion of population-based screening programmes can aid early cancer detection in asymptomatic patients. Primary care professionals have a vital role in clinically assessing patients presenting with symptoms that may indicate cancer, as most patients with CRC first present with symptoms. These assessments are often challengingmany of the symptoms of CRC are non-specific and commonly occur in patients presenting with non-malignant disease. The range of options for investigating symptomatic patients in primary care is rapidly growing. Simple tests, such as faecal immunochemical testing (FIT), are now being used to guide decisions around referral for more invasive tests, such as colonoscopy, while direct access to specialist investigations is also becoming more common. Clinical decision support tools (CDSTs) which calculate cancer risk based on symptomatology, patient characteristics and test results can provide an additional resource to guide decisions on further investigation. This article explores the challenges of CRC prevention and detection from the primary care perspective, discusses current evidence-based approaches for CRC detection used in primary care (with examples from UK guidelines), and highlights emerging research which may likely alter practice in the future.","output":"Recognising Colorectal Cancer in Primary Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Personal support workers (PSWs) are considered the backbone of homecare however their working conditions remain precarious and unregulated suggesting increased vulnerability in the face of a pandemic. The purpose of this study is to better understand the experiences of PSWs working in homecare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This qualitative descriptive study used a social constructivist approach to understand the experiences of Toronto-based PSWs working at a local homecare agency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured virtual interviews were conducted. All transcribed interviews were coded and analyzed using the DEPICT framework. Results: 19 interviews were completed. PSWs shared a strong belief in duty to work during a health crisis and responsibility to support their vulnerable clients despite feeling vulnerable themselves to transmission and infection;the weight of pandemic anxiety was felt daily and intensely for most. PSWs described existing system challenges exacerbated by the pandemic that tested the limits of their motivations to work, emotional wellbeing and perception of organizational support. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to increased occupational stress among PSWs. Longstanding system-level issues coupled with increased emotional labour has positioned this workforce at- risk for burnout indicating that health human resource issues may persist if unaddressed. Homecare organizations can implement strategies that promote and protect the mental wellbeing of PSWs while aggressively lobbying for system changes such as higher wages and better labour protections.","output":"Homecare personal support worker experiences working during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Suicide remains a major public health issue around the world. People bereaved by suicide are a vulnerable group who are at considerable risk of developing mental and physical health problems, such as complicated grief, post-traumatic stress disorder or cardiovascular disease.

This protocol describes how we aim to systematically scope the existing literature on the professional follow-up and health service use by families bereaved by suicide. The scoping review will help to identify research gaps in the literature and aid in the planning and commission of future research. We will provide a summary of research findings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use the scoping review framework provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews will be used as a guide for reporting our results. We plan to conduct an extensive literature search using relevant health-related databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL) and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers will screen the articles in a two-stage process: (1) titles and abstracts and (2) full-text documents.

Two types of stimuli were developed for the experiments: consumers VR store experience (106 data) (i.e., having respondents experience 360-degree-based VR store videos recorded at a fashion retailer) and store website experience (107 data) (i.e., having respondents experience the same stores website). The results revealed that relative to an ordinary store website, consumers VR store experience evoked positive emotions and increased perceived store attractiveness. This study also discovered that store familiarity does not moderate the relationship between the two store experience types and evoked emotions, implying that VR technology is effective regardless of consumers familiarity with a store. Text analytics were also utilized, providing additional insights about their VR store experiences. This study suggests an effective method for online retailers to emulate an attractive store environment and entice consumers through VR, regardless of the retailers fame.

Since then, there have been over 400 million confirmed cases and 5.8 million deaths by COVID-19 reported worldwide. The urgent need for therapies against SARS-CoV-2 led researchers to use drug repurposing approaches. This strategy allows the reduction in risks, time, and costs associated with drug development. In many cases, a repurposed drug can enter directly to preclinical testing and clinical trials, thus accelerating the whole drug discovery process. In this work, we will give a general overview of the main developments in COVID-19 treatment, focusing on the contribution of the drug repurposing paradigm to find effective drugs against this disease. Finally, we will present our findings using a new drug repurposing strategy that identified 11 compounds that may be potentially effective against COVID-19.

Although early screening has been proved to be the most effective way to prevent and control colorectal cancer, the current situation of colorectal cancer screening remains not optimistic. The aim of this article is to apply the protection motivation theory (PMT) to examine the influencing factors on screening intention of colorectal cancer (CRC). This cross-sectional survey was launched in five communities in Wuhan, China. All the eligible urban Chinese were recruited and interviewed using paper-and-pencil questionnaires. The intention of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) was measured using six PMT subconstructs, including perceived risk, perceived severity, fear arousal, response efficacy, response cost, and self-efficacy. Data on sociodemographic variables and knowledge of CRC were also collected. The structural equation modeling (SEM) method was used for data analysis. Among all the 569 respondents, 83.66% expressed willingness to participate in CRCS. Data of the research fit the proposed SEM model well (Chi-square/df = 2.04, GFI = 0.93, AGFI = 0.91, CFI = 0.91, IFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.04). Two subconstructs of PMT (response efficacy and self-efficacy) and CRC knowledge were directly and positively associated with screening intention. Age, social status, medical history, physical activity, and CRC knowledge were indirectly related to the screening intention through at least one of the two PMT subconstructs (response efficacy and self-efficacy). The findings of this study suggest the significance of enhancing response efficacy and self-efficacy in motivating urban Chinese adults to participate in CRC screening.

In critically ill patients with COVID-19, multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. This review focuses briefly on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI as well as options for management. RECENT FINDINGS: The risk factors for AKI are common to both noncovid-related AKI and COVID-19 associated AKI. Kidney injury in COVID-19 associated AKI may arise through several mechanisms, including not only direct effects on the kidney leading to tubular injury but also through the effects of treatment of multiorgan failure complicating infection. During surge conditions, the use of kidney replacement therapy has embraced all modalities including the use of peritoneal dialysis. The use of blood purification techniques has been proposed, but to date, the results are variable.

Analyzed factors included demographics, stroke mechanism, admission NIHSS, reperfusion therapy rates (IV TPA and EVT), reperfusion performance metrics (door-to-CT, door-to-needle, door-topuncture, door-to-first pass), TICI score, discharge and 90-day mRS, discharge disposition, and length of stay. Analyses were conducted using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or Person's Chi-square test, as appropriate, adjusting for multiple comparisons. Results: Among the 7,201 analyzed patients, 2,378 (33.0%) were admitted in 2018, 2,613 (36.3%) in 2019 and 2,210 (30.7%) in 2020.

However, it is largely unknown to what extent income and education affect the probability of being a nursing home resident. If the probability of residing in a nursing home is stratified by socio-economic status, under the current COVID-19 pandemic socio-economic inequality in the probability of living in a nursing home could contribute to enlarge socio-economic inequalities in the risk of mortality with COVID-19. In this article, we investigate whether there are income and educational differences in the likelihood of being a resident in a nursing home across 12 European countries. We use SHARE data (waves 5C7) and compute logistic regression models for rare events. We find that low-educated individuals and those having household income below the national median are more likely to live in a nursing home. This general pattern holds across all the European countries considered. However, there is considerable uncertainty in our estimates due to a small sample size, and firm conclusions on how the effect of socio-economic characteristics varies across countries cannot be drawn. Still, there is some indication that educational and income differences are the largest in the Scandinavian countries (Denmark and Sweden) and the Netherlands, while the smallest ones are found in Italy, with the remaining countries laying in between.","output":"Social inequality and the risk of living in a nursing home: implications for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

The incidence ratio of near miss was 6.85/ 1000, and severe morbidity was 11.38/1000 live births. Hypertensive disorders and haemorrhage were the common causes of cases of near miss and severe morbidity. Coagulation dysfunction (62%) was the most common organ dysfunction, followed by uterine dysfunction (22%). Older age (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, confidence interval [CI] 1.02-3.93), the absence of formal education (OR 2.05, CI 1.11-3.75), <18 years of age at marriage (OR 2.01, CI 1.21-3.32), lower income (OR 3.8, CI 1.88-7.64), gravida of four or more (OR 2.25, CI 1.21-4.17) and residence outside Delhi (OR 9.31, CI 4.36-19.90) were significant predictors of near miss. Sepsis, hypertensive disorders and haemorrhage were the most common underlying conditions in women who died. The foetal outcome was a live birth in 64% of near-miss cases and 62% among severe morbidity. Conclusions. The burden of severe maternal morbidity and near miss is high. These need to be identified and managed at the earliest.","output":"Severe maternal morbidity and maternal near miss in a tertiary hospital of Delhi."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid breakout of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared pandemic with serious global concern due to high morbidity and mortality As we enter the phase beyond limitations there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against COVID-19 To face this immediate global challenge, drug development from scratch is a lengthy process and unrealistic to conquer this battle Drug repurposing is an emerging and practical approach where existing drugs, safe for humans, are redeployed to fight this harder to treat disease A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against COVID-19 However, the exact mechanistic aspect has not yet been revealed In the present study, we have tried to decipher the mechanistic aspects of existing medicines at the viral entry and replication stage via the structural viroinformatics approach Here we implied the molecular docking and dynamic simulations with emphasis on the unique structural properties of host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV2 spike protein and RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV2 Deep structural analysis of target molecules exposed key binding residues and structural twists involved in binding with important pharmacophore features of existing drugs [(7-chloro-N-[5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]quinolin-4-amine (chloroquine),N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide) (SSAA09E2), 2-ethylbutyl (2S)-2-{[(S)-{[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-{4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl}-5-cyano-3 (remdesivir) and 6-Fluor-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazincarboxamid (favipiravir)] It is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage Thus, drug repurposition is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost to treat COVID-19, we don't have enough time as the whole world is lockdown and we are in urgent need of an obvious therapeutics' measures","output":"Viroinformatics approach to explore the inhibitory mechanism of existing drugs repurposed to fight against COVID-19.

The results of our study suggest that risk perceptions may vary across preferences for conservative or liberal bias; however, our results do not support differences in the mitigation behavior across patterns of media use. Further, our findings do not support the notion of echo chambers, but rather suggest that people with lower information-seeking behavior may be more strongly influenced by politicized COVID-19 news. Risk estimates converge at higher levels of information seeking, suggesting that high information seekers consume news from sources across the political spectrum.

Additionally, ox-LDL increased PAR2 and inhibited Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) expression, which is a Wnt signaling inhibitor. PAR2 knocked-down decreased DKK1 and enhanced expression of Wnt3a, -catenin. Meanwhile, DKK1 overexpression reversed the effects of PAR2 on foam cell formation, inflammation, and apoptosis. In summary, PAR2 is essential for the formation of foam cells, inflammation, and apoptosis in macrophages which plays a critical role during atherosclerosis.

Subsequent unlocks to reopen the economies started next waves and imposed extra burden on quarantine to keep the reproduction number ( R 0 <1 ). Even with initial strict lockdowns and recent launching of vaccination programs, many countries are still struggling to contain the infection which suggests that revisiting the mechanism of lockdown-unlock implementation and simultaneous underpinning of the potential sources diluting the effort of such lockdowns could help better contain the spread of infection. Here, building epidemic models and analyzing the metadata of 50 countries, we first found that the estimated values of R 0 , adjusted w.r.t the distribution of medical facilities and virus clades, correlates strongly with the testing rates across countries. However, testing capacity of a country is limited by its medical resources, hence, as we demonstrate, optimizing a cost-benefit trade-off between testing rate and unlocking extents implemented in a country specific manner can help in devising the strategies of unlocking the economy. Our study delineates a strategy to optimize this trade-off by utilizing country specific infection spread parameters estimated in the epidemic models and implementing them in a stochastic agent based contact tracing models. The analysis provides a quantitative estimate of testing rates required to maintain a low for different extents of unlock. We further found that a small fraction of superspreaders can drastically increase the number of infected individuals even during lockdowns, primarily due to a switch-like response stemming from the implicit systems-level positive feedback loop driving the spread of infection. Our model suggests that with a country specific optimal combination of unlock extents and testing rates, R 0 <1 can be stabilized during a pandemic like COVID19. To harness the benefit of improved testing rates and minimize the infection spread, strict social distancing norms to restrict the movement of superspreaders is necessary, such that onset of the positive feedback loop mediated exponential infection spread can be avoided.","output":"Country-specific Optimization Strategy for Testing Through Contact Tracing Can Help Maintain a Low Reproduction Number (R_0) During Unlock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been mutating since it was first sequenced in early January 2020.

It assesses the effect of an advance care planning (ACP) intervention delivered by trained nurses to older care-dependent patients. Patients received two ACP conversations and an information brochure. Nurses were educated through a two-day programme and topic guides structuring the conversations. Objectives of the process evaluation were to determine: [1] whether the intervention was implemented as planned, [2] which change mechanisms were observed, [3] whether targeted process outcomes were achieved and [4] in which way contextual factors influenced the implementation process. METHODS: The process evaluation is based on a mixed methods approach following the recommendations of the UK-MRC framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were developed and analysed guided by a logic model comprising intervention, participants, mechanisms of change and context factors. The results of the main trial will be published elsewhere. RESULTS: Educational programme and topic guides were mostly implemented as planned and resulted in motivation, knowledge, and perceived competencies to facilitate ACP conversations in nurses. Deviances in the performance of ACP conversations indicated patients varied individual needs, but also obstacles like reluctance of patients and caregivers to participate actively and time constraints of nurse facilitators. Patients and caregivers reported increased awareness of ACP, planning and other activities indicating that targeted process outcomes could be achieved. The relevance of multifaceted contextual factors acting as barriers or facilitators for the engagement in ACP interventions on the individual, organisational and macro level was evident. CONCLUSIONS: The process evaluation elicits obstacles and achievements of the ACP intervention. The logic model organised a plethora of mixed methods data into a holistic picture of multifaceted results. Nurses as ACP facilitators in home care can fulfil a crucial initiating role based on a trusting relationship with their patients. To support older care-dependent peoples ACP engagement, access should be simplified. Furthermore, education for nurse facilitators and sufficient resources for service provision are needed.

This virus causes significant economic losses in most pig-producing countries. The clinical presentation of PRRSV ranges from asymptomatic to devastating. In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific zip nucleic acid probe-based real-time PCR assay to evaluate the viremia of natural PRRSV-infected pigs in Taiwan. Serum samples were collected from 577 pigs aged 5C12 weeks. These include 444 clinically healthy pigs and 133 symptomatic pigs were confirmed to have porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). RESULTS: Viremia was quantified in 79 of the 444 (17.8%) clinically healthy pigs and in 112 of the 133 (84.2%) PRDC cases. Viremias were significantly more common in pigs with PRDC compared with the clinically healthy pigs (P <0.0001). These results suggest that a high viral load is a major feature of PRRSV-affected pigs. CONCLUSIONS: ZNA probe-based real-time PCR can be a useful tool to diagnose symptomatic and asymptomatic PRRSV-infected pigs.

This paper highlights the potential of azithromycin and ambroxol to treat COVID-19. Azithromycin and ambroxol share lysosomotropic characteristics, i.e. they penetrate and accumulate inside the late endosomes and lysosomes and may possibly interfere with multiplication of the virus inside cells. In addition, both of these drugs have anti-inflammatory effects. Ambroxol has a proven antiviral effect and a unique stimulatory action on the secretion of surfactant by alveolar type II cells, the main target of SARS-CoV-2. Surfactant may form a fundamental defence mechanism against the virus. Involvement of nasal epithelial cells in SARS-CoV-2 entry suggested advantageous use of inhaled drug delivery of these two drugs over the use of systemic administration. Inhaled drug delivery could aid in targeting the drug to the exact site of action with little or no side effects. To conclude, administration of these two drugs using a special drug delivery system provides two kinds of drug targeting: (i) tissue targeting through using an inhaled drug delivery system to achieve high drug concentrations at the respiratory epithelial tissue that overexpress the ACE2 receptor for virus binding; and (ii) cellular targeting of the virus in the acidic vesicles (late endosomes and lysosomes), which represent the fate of endocytic viruses.","output":"Azithromycin and ambroxol as potential pharmacotherapy for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The purpose of the study is to assess the etiology detection ability of Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) on formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) tissue from postoperative biopsy specimen.

This article aims to use empirical data from all cases from a prefecture-level city of China to introduce and examine the feasibility and efficiency of the screening and isolation strategies and how these were essential in combatting the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: For this retrospective study, all confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited from the Taizhou prefecture-level city of Zhejiang province, China. RESULTS: Of the citys total population, 24% were screened for COVID-19 and isolated at home or designated locations for two weeks. From these, a total of 146 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analysed. Of all cases, 51% were traced from Wuhan, and 21% of patients were in close contact with confirmed cases from outside of the city. Initially, 13% of all patients reported having no clear symptoms, while 42% of patients presented with fever and/or other symptoms. Compared with local patients, new arrivals to the city had fewer days between their exposure and the development of symptoms of COVID-19 (P<0.001), and fewer days from the time they developed symptoms to the confirmation of COVID-19 (P<0.001), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the medical activities initiated and difficulties in implementing quarantine on a cruise ship. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all 3711 people (2666 passengers and 1045 crew) on board. RESULTS: Of those tested, 696 (18.8%) tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR result had lung opacities on chest computed tomography. There were many difficulties in implementing quarantine, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and noninfectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation providers willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized and required ventilator support or intensive care, and 7 patients (1.0% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) had died.

The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive deficits and emotional distress among COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients who required functional rehabilitation. Specifically, this study explored and compared cognitive and psychological status of patients in the subacute phase of the disease (COVID-19 group) and patients in the postillness period (post-COVID-19 group). Forty patients admitted to rehabilitation units were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups according to the phase of the disease: (a) COVID-19 group (n = 20) and (b) post-COVID-19 group (n = 20). All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A larger part of the COVID group showed neuropsychological deficits in the total MMSE (35%) compared to the post-COVID group (5%), whereas the majority of both groups (75-70%) reported cognitive impairments in the total MoCA. The post-COVID group reported significantly higher score in MMSE subtests of language (p = 0.02) and in MoCA subtests of executive functions (p = 0.05), language (p = 0.01), and abstraction (p = 0.02) compared to the COVID group.

Identifying social and environmental factors associated with SIM and suicide may inform etiologic understanding and intervention design. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with interstate SIM and suicide rate variation and to assess potential for differential suicide misclassification. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used a partial panel time series with underlying cause-of-death data from 50 US states and the District of Columbia for 1999-2000, 2007-2008, 2013-2014 and 2018-2019. Applying data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SIM includes all suicides and the preponderance of unintentional and undetermined drug intoxication deaths, reflecting self-harm behaviors. Data were analyzed from February to June 2021. EXPOSURES: Exposures included inequity, isolation, demographic characteristics, injury mechanism, health care access, and medicolegal death investigation system type. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome, SIM, was assessed using unstandardized regression coefficients of interstate variation associations, identified by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; ratios of crude SIM to suicide rates per 100 000 population were assessed for potential differential suicide misclassification. RESULTS: A total of 101 325 SIMs were identified, including 74 506 (73.5%) among males and 26 819 (26.5%) among females. SIM to suicide rate ratios trended upwards, with an accelerating increase in overdose fatalities classified as unintentional or undetermined (SIM to suicide rate ratio, 1999-2000: 1.39; 95% CI, 1.38-1.41; 2018-2019: 2.12; 95% CI, 2.11-2.14). Eight states recorded a SIM to suicide rate ratio less than 1.50 in 2018-2019 vs 39 states in 1999-2000. Northeastern states concentrated in the highest category (range, 2.10-6.00); only the West remained unrepresented. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator identified 8 factors associated with the SIM rate in 2018-2019: centralized medical examiner system ( = 4.362), labor underutilization rate ( = 0.728), manufacturing employment ( = ?0.056), homelessness rate ( = ?0.125), percentage nonreligious ( = 0.041), non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity ( = 0.087), prescribed opioids for 30 days or more ( = 0.117), and percentage without health insurance ( = ?0.013) and 5 factors associated with the suicide rate: percentage male ( = 1.046), military veteran ( = 0.747), rural ( = 0.031), firearm ownership ( = 0.030), and pain reliever misuse ( = 1.131). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that SIM rates were associated with modifiable, upstream factors. Although embedded in SIM, suicide unexpectedly deviated in proposed social and environmental determinants.

Research indicates that this burden is not equally distributed in the community, and vulnerable groups, such as violence-exposed individuals may pay a particularly high prize. Perceived social support is known to buffer against negative effects of trauma and adversity, but it is not clear whether this is the case during times of social restrictions and lockdowns. In this study, we tested if perceived social support could buffer the link between pandemic worry and psychological distress in a community sample and in the subgroup exposed to violence during the pandemic.

Fifty-nine participants (5.7%) had been exposed to physical, sexual, and/or psychological violence during the last month. RESULTS: Current violence, pandemic worry, and perceived social support were independently associated with psychological distress. In the total sample, perceived social support moderated the relationship between pandemic worry and psychological distress. However, this was not found in individuals who were exposed to current violence.

These proteins bind to and regulate target mRNA localization, stability, and translation. Their structure, expression and functions in bony fish are not well understood. Here, we characterized the zebrafish igf2bp2 gene and investigated its functional role in early development. Zebrafish igf2bp2 gives rise to 4 alternatively spliced transcripts. When expressed in cultured cells, all 4 proteins were detected in the cytoplasm. Igf2bp2-A, the longest isoform, has a domain structure similar to its mammalian counterpart. Igf2bp2-B lacks one of the C-terminal KH domains, while Igf2bp2-C lacks the two N-terminal RRM domains. Igf2bp2-D lacks both regions. In adult fish, these igf2bp2 isoforms were detected exclusively in the oocyte. After fertilization, they disappeared within 6 h post fertilization (hpf). At 20 ~ 24 hpf, igf2bp2-A mRNA, but not other mRNAs, was re-expressed in the embryos including in primordial germ cells. Targeted knockdown of Igf2bp2s reduced the numbers of primordial germ cells but did not affect global patterning or growth. The effect was rescued by overexpression of Igf2bp2-A. Likewise, dominant-negative inhibition of Igf2bp2 resulted in a similar reduction in primordial germ cell number. These results not only provide new information about the structure and expression of zebrafish Igf2bp2, but also reveal a critical role of this conserved RNA binding protein in primordial germ cell development.","output":"IGF-2 mRNA binding protein 2 regulates primordial germ cell development in zebrafish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paneth cells are secretory epithelial cells of the innate immune system of the intestine of several mammals, including alpacas. Little is known about the latter; thus, in the present study we described the morphology and histochemical characteristics of Paneth cells in healthy fetuses, and young and adult alpacas. For this purpose, samples of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were taken from 6 fetuses at different days of pregnancy (between days 221C330), 66 offsprings (between 0 and 45-days-old) and 5 adult alpacas (>2-years-old). Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for histological and morphometrical analysis using HE and Masson Trichomi?s technique. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify Paneth cells using anti-lysozyme antibody. In addition, the lectinhistochemichal binding-pattern of Paneth cel?s granules was evaluated. Lyzozyme was immunohistochemically detected in the granules of Paneth cells from day 283 of pregnancy in all the small intestinal sections of the studied fetuses. In newborn alpacas Paneth cells were initially found in the duodenum, but the following days (days 18C21 after birth) they were also found in the ileum. Their size gradually increased after birth, but then no significant differences were found. In adult alpacas the number was lower than offsprings. We suggest that Paneth cells early differentiate in the small intestine of alpacas, and the increase in their number during the first two weeks of life strongly support their possible involvement in the intestinal defensive functions against the enteric diseases that occur during the lactancy stage.","output":"Characterization of paneth cells in alpacas (Vicugna pacos, Mammalia, Camelidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perubahan nomenklatur Badan Pelayanan Pajak Daerah menjadi Badan Pendapatan Daerah Kota Malang di awal tahun 2020 menyebabkan bertambahnya beban kerja yang harus dijalankan.

A total of 921 responses from allied health professionals in a variety of work settings were analyzed. The majority of allied health professionals had access to medical-grade PPE and agreed with their clinics decisions to stay open or closed. Private practices appeared to be the most negatively impacted with regards to employment in the form of pay reductions, furloughs, lay-offs, or the requirement of using paid time off. Importantly, 86% of all respondents, irrespective of employment status, reported feeling stressed with regards to changes in their work environment and transmission of the virus. However, levels of stress were dependent upon access to PPE and mental health resources.

METHODS: Using a community practice-based rheumatologist network, we examined trends in in-person vs. telehealth visits vs. canceled visits in three time periods: pre-COVID19, COVID19-Transition (6-weeks beginning 3/23/20), and post-COVID19-Transition (May-August). In the Transition period, we compared patients who received in-person care vs. telehealth visits vs. cancelled all visits. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with canceled or telehealth visits. RESULTS: Pre-COVID19, there were 7,075 visits/week among 60,002 unique rheumatology patients cared for by approximately 300 providers practicing in 92 offices. This decreased substantially (24.6% reduction) during COVID19-Transition period for in-person but rebounded to pre-COVID19 levels during post-COVID19 transition. There were almost no telehealth visits pre-COVID19, but telehealth increased substantially during the COVID19-Transition (41.4% of all follow-up visits) and slightly decreased during post-COVID19-Transition (27.7% of visits). Older age, female sex, Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and rural residence were associated with greater likelihood of cancelling visits. Most factors were also associated with a lower likelihood of having telehealth vs. in-office visits. Patients living further from the rheumatologists' office were more likely to use telehealth. CONCLUSION: COVID19 led to large disruptions in rheumatology care; these disruptions were only partially offset by increases in telehealth use and disproportionately affected racial/ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. During the COVID-19 era, telehealth continues to be an important part of rheumatology practice, but disparities in access to care exist for some vulnerable groups.","output":"Disruptions in Rheumatology Care and the Rise of Telehealth in Response to the COVID19 Pandemic in a Community Practice-Based Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) found locus 3p21.31 associated with severe COVID-19.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient flows, patient pathways and use of hospital resources during the pandemic were simulated using a discrete event simulation model and patient-level data from a large French comprehensive cancer centre's discharge database, considering two scenarios of delays: massive return of patients from November 2020 (early-return) or March 2021 (late-return). Expected additional cancer deaths at 5 years and mortality rate were estimated using individual hazard ratios based on literature. RESULTS: The number of patients requiring hospital care during the simulation period was 13,000. In both scenarios, 6-8% of patients were estimated to present a delay of >2 months. The overall additional cancer deaths at 5 years were estimated at 88 in early-return and 145 in late-return scenario, with increased additional deaths estimated for sarcomas, gynaecological, liver, head and neck, breast cancer and acute leukaemia. This represents a relative additional cancer mortality rate at 5 years of 4.4 and 6.8% for patients expected in year 2020, 0.5 and 1.3% in 2021 and 0.5 and 0.5% in 2022 for each scenario, respectively.

Domestic and mainly wild animals such as bats, small rodents and birds are highly diversified animals in relation to their habitats and ecological niches and are widely distributed geographically in environments of forest fragmentation in some areas of the Amazon, being considered important sources for viruses that affect humans and other animals. Due to the anthropical activities, these animals changed their natural habitat and adapted to urbanized environments, thus representing risks to human and animal health. Although the knowledge of the global diversity of enteric viruses is scarce, there are reports demonstrating the detection of rotavirus in domestic animals and animals of productive systems, such as bovines and pigs. The present study investigated the prevalence of Rotavirus A in 648 fecal samples of different animal species from the northeastern mesoregion of the state of Par, Brazil, which is characterized as an urbanized area with forest fragments.

In addition to the fact that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and that medical surveillance has to be adjusted in infected women and their offspring, knowledge about infection status can provide the opportunity to protect other patients and healthcare workers against virus transmission. The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in the hospital setting. Material and Methods All eligible pregnant women admitted to the nine participating hospitals in Franconia, Germany, from 2 June 2020 to 24 January 2021 were included. COVID-19-related symptoms, secondary diseases and pregnancy abnormalities were documented. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. The prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated by correcting the positive rate using the RoganCGladen method. The risk of infection for healthcare workers during delivery was estimated using a risk calculator. Results Of 2414 recruited pregnant women, six were newly diagnosed RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, which yielded a prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 0.26% (95% CI, 0.10 C 0.57%). Combining active room ventilation and wearing FFP2 masks showed an estimated reduction of risk of infection for healthcare workers in the delivery room to < 1%. Conclusions The prevalence of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in this study is low.

Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N1 viruses can be divided into 10 clades based on their HA sequences, with most human IVs centered from clade 1 and clade 2.1 to clade 2.3. Protein sequence alignment in various clades indicates the high conservation in the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) is essential for binding with the SA receptor.

This forum brings together palliative care physicians who have faced mental illness and reflected carefully on how the experience has affected their practice. During the session, clinicians will share their personal and professional experiences, highlighting challenges, helpful strategies, and opportunities for a pathway forward. There is growing societal awareness of the mental health crisis among healthcare workers, catalyzed in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the stigma and poor access to care faced by most people with mental illness, healthcare workers face concerns about transparency in the workplace, job security, and licensing as they seek evaluation and treatment. Palliative care practice is challenging even in times of emotional stability and presents unique work-related mental health threats and opportunities. Clinicians support patients and families struggling with crises and difficult emotions, often at the intersection of life and death. This close proximity to death heightens the awareness of the shared vicissitudes of life, serving as both an opportunity for transformation and a professional hazard. As mental illness is a biopsychosocial process, treatment often requires a multidimensional approach. Individuals, teams, extended support networks, and the field of palliative care can employ physical, emotional, practical, spiritual, and social approaches to management and healing. Additionally, despite the many challenges, positive reflections and unexpected opportunities may arise as clinicians navigate mental health concerns. Vulnerability can foster strength in our shared experiences and empathy in our work. Ultimately, these experiences may help us grow in our roles as clinicians and educators.

African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and COVID-19-related mortality compared with non-Hispanic White populations, but not higher case-fatality rates (mostly reported as in-hospital mortality) (moderate- to high-strength evidence). Asian populations experience similar outcomes to non-Hispanic White populations (low-strength evidence). Outcomes for other racial/ethnic groups have been insufficiently studied. Health care access and exposure factors may underlie the observed disparities more than susceptibility due to comorbid conditions (low-strength evidence). LIMITATIONS: Selection bias, missing race/ethnicity data, and incomplete outcome assessments in cohort and cross-sectional studies must be considered. In addition, adjustment for key demographic covariates was lacking in ecological studies. CONCLUSION: African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality but similar rates of case fatality. Differences in health care access and exposure risk may be driving higher infection and mortality rates.

For effective inactivation strategies, design and implementation of UVC disinfection, knowledge of wavelength sensitivity, and disinfection rate of the relevant pathogen are required. This study aimed to determine the inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2 using UVC irradiation with different wavelengths, in addition to validating surrogate models for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the study determined dosage, inactivation levels, and wavelength sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2. Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 (Strain USA/WA1-2020) inactivation at peak wavelength of 259, 268, 270, 275 and 280 nm was performed using plaque assay method. The UVC dose of 3.1 mJ/cm2 using 259 and 268 nm arrays yielded LRV2.32 and LRV2.44 respectively. With a dose of 5mJ/cm2, arrays of peak wavelengths at 259 and 268 nm obtained similar inactivation (LRV2.97 and LRV 2.80 respectively). The remaining arrays of longer wavelength, 270, 275 and 280 nm, demonstrated lower performances (LRV2.0 or less) with 5mJ/cm2. Additional study with the 268 nm array revealed that a dose of 6.25 mJ/cm2 (with 5 seconds or irradiation) is enough to obtain LRV3. These results determine that 259 and 268 nm are the most efficient wavelengths compared to longer UVC wavelengths, allowing the calculation of disinfection systems efficacy, and providing a benchmark for surrogates.","output":"Disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 using UVC reveals wavelength sensitivity contributes towards rapid virucidal activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan city and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Although the virus is not restricted to the lung parenchyma, the use of chest imaging in COVID-19 can be especially useful for patients with moderate to severe symptoms or comorbidities. This article aimed to demonstrate the chest imaging findings of COVID-19 on different modalities: chest radiography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography. In addition, it intended to review recommendations on imaging assessment of COVID-19 and to discuss the use of a structured chest computed tomography report. Chest radiography, despite being a low-cost and easily available method, has low sensitivity for screening patients. It can be useful in monitoring hospitalized patients, especially for the evaluation of complications such as pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Chest computed tomography, despite being highly sensitive, has a low specificity, and hence cannot replace the reference diagnostic test (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). To facilitate the confection and reduce the variability of radiological reports, some standardizations with structured reports have been proposed. Among the available classifications, it is possible to divide the radiological findings into typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative findings. The structured report can also contain an estimate of the extent of lung involvement (e.g., more or less than 50% of the lung parenchyma). Pulmonary ultrasonography can also be an auxiliary method, especially for monitoring hospitalized patients in intensive care units, where transfer to a tomography scanner is difficult.","output":"Imaging findings in COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study identifies the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and its association with meteorological and social variables in Punjab (densely populated province of Pakistan). To identify the COVID-19 propagation, the weekly growth, recovery, and deaths rate have also been calculated.

Our results show that 43 peak days (where daily positive cases were above 900) have been observed in Punjab during 27th May to 8th July, 2020. The high population density districts, i.e., Lahore and Islamabad, have been affected (five persons per square kilometers) due to COVID-19, whereas the maximum death tolls (> 50 persons per millions) have also been observed in these urban districts. The meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, heat index, and ultraviolet index) show negative significant relationship to basic reproduction number (R0), whereas daily COVID-19 cases are positively correlated to aerosols concentration at 95% confidence level.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this transformation. This paper highlights the importance of digital project management (DPM), its adoption of digital technologies, the changing role of digital project manager, significant and abrupt swing in the rise of virtual teams and the benefits and challenges of remote project teams. This paper aims to discuss the latest development in project management and to lay out the rationale why DPM is here to stay even after the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The author has based this research on reviewing publications from the project management journals and publications, interviews of project management professionals and analyzing data from a project management consultancy. Findings: The pandemic accelerated the digitalization of project management including the adoption of digital tools and technologies, embracing an agile approach to implementing projects;working collaborative in remote teams;and breaking traditional barriers of geography, time zones and fundamentally how project teams collaborate. Practical implications: Project management is being digitized, changing how teams work. Fueled by the pandemic, DPM accelerated its momentum. The rate of adoption is likely to be strong after the pandemic. Organizations and individuals should consider embracing DPM but with the full knowledge of both benefits and challenges. Originality/value: DPM is still in its early days even though the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated its use. Today and likely after the pandemic, organizations and people are increasingly embracing digital technologies, remote teams and agile project management approaches to project management. It is likely that in the foreseeable future, nearly all project managers will be digital project managers, giving rise to the importance of understanding the challenges and benefits and building the digital skills for both individuals and organizations. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Digital project management: rapid changes define new working environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, endoscopic procedures have been separated for only urgent and semi-urgent cases for the last few months to prevent transmission in endoscopy units.

The multiple-choice questionnaire was administered at 4-6 weekly intervals from April 2020 to October 2020 for a total of four series.Result(s)*483 questionnaires were completed. The majority of participants were gynecological oncologists (83.3%) in certified gynecologic cancer centers (61%) and breast cancer (BC) centers (80.4%). The majority stated a 50% reduction in surgical interventions for gyne-oncological cases. Cases that were prioritized for surgery across all tumors were those with early stage disease, at primary situation and with a good ECOG status. For BC, patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment and those with high-risk or locally-advanced BC were prioritized. The majority (73%) continued to conduct clinical trials throughout the pandemic. In cases were trials were discontinued, this decision was made by sponsors, and hospital officers. Other reasons for discontinuation included lack of patient-participation (due to fear of attending appointments). Almost 100% of the responders refuted any increased tendency to treat with a neoadjuvant approach (cytotoxic, hormonal, radiation) patients that would qualify for surgery under normal circumstances . This comes in direct contrast to the increased attitude to treat with neoadjuvant anticancer therapy of advanced cancers in other European countries.Only 18% of the clinicians reported feeling adequately informed about established safety pathways for COVID-19 positive patients with gynecological cancers.

Venous and arterial thromboembolisms also are frequent in COVID-19 patients with the increased risk of some life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. In this regard, overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNF- induce cytokine storms, increase the risk of clot formation, platelet activation, and multiorgan failure that may eventually lead to death among these patients. Surface S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target transmembrane receptor, named as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2(, on various cells such as lymphocyte, alveolar cells, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets. Notably, the activation of the coagulation cascade occurs through tissue factor (TF)/FVIIa-initiated hemostasis. Accordingly, TF plays the major role in the activation of coagulation system during viral infection. In viral infections, the related coagulopathy multiple factors such as inflammatory cytokines and viral specific TLRs are involved, which consequently induce TF expression aberrantly. SARS-COV-2 may directly infect monocytes/ macrophages. In addition, TF expression/release from these cells may play a critical role in the development of COVID-19 coagulopathy.

We report herein a CCR5-selective RNA aptamer that acts to facilitate entry through a simplified BBB model and that drives the uptake of LNPs into CCR5-expressing cells, while the gp160 aptamer did not. We further observed that the addition of cell-penetrating peptides, Tat and T7, did not increase BBB penetration above the aptamer-loaded LNPs alone. Moreover, we found that these targeted LNPs exhibit low immunogenic and low toxic profiles and that targeted LNPs can traverse the BBB to potentially deliver drugs into the target tissue.

Urgent/emergency procedures accounted for more than 60% of procedures performed during the lockdown compared to 39% previously. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 4 sternal wound infections with an overall incidence of 0.8%. In comparison, the incidence of sternal wound infections was significantly higher at 3.0% in the 12-month period prior to lockdown with 63 sternal wound infections (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION This report suggests a significant role of iatrogenic causes in sternal wound infections prior to the pandemic. The strict implementation of guidelines in the perioperative period suggests that sternal wound infections can be prevented. We propose that the now widespread COVID-19 guidelines to reduce transmission risk be adapted to help reduce the incidence of sternal wound infections.","output":"Sternal wound infections during the COVID-19 pandemic: an unexpected benefit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Telemedicine involves the innovative application of technology to provide remote patient healthcare services especially those relating to emergency care and contagious disease spread. Telemedicine is less developed in low-and-middle-income countries like Pakistan and there is little published literature on its function and efficiency. Our institution was established to triage patients with COVID-19 symptoms to ease the load on emergency departments. Objective To conduct an analysis of the first month of function of a telemedicine/tele-triage center in Pakistan. To determine in which ways it was beneficial to hospital management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This study was carried out at the newly established telemedicine/tele-triage center at the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU) in Islamabad Pakistan between the 26th March and the 25th April 2020. Data were collected over telephone interview using a proforma to provide each caller with a C-Score (a C-score of <3 indicated observe at home 3-5- indicated home isolation with confirmatory testing and >5 indicated testing and transfer to hospital) representing their COVID-19 risk and informing the nature of the advice given to them. Data were presented using descriptive statistics. Results The center received total of 857 calls. Fever cough dyspnea and flu were present in 327(38.2%) 268(31.3%) 107(12.5%) and 124(14.5%) callers respectively. Based on the completion of the proforma 774(90.3%) callers had a C-Score of <3 75(8.8%) callers had a C-Score of 3-5 and 8 (0.9%) callers had a C-Score of >5. We recommended COVID-19 testing in 83 patients (9.68%) based on C-score. Out of these 83 patients 64 underwent testing and only 1 tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusion In a one-month period the center was able to support patients by providing a triage service thereby preventing numerous unnecessary hospital visits and helping to protect healthcare professionals during a global pandemic.

The mortality rate of severely ill patients in the early stage is 32.5%. The exacerbation of the condition and death of patients are closely associated with inflammatory cytokine storms, which are caused by excessive activation of the immune and complement systems as well as the coinfection of other pathogens. However, the immunological characteristics and the mechanisms underlying inflammatory storms have not been well elucidated. Here, we analyzed the clinical and immunological characteristics of 71 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Based on the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) guidelines, patients were stratified into mild and severe types. We compared the clinical and laboratory data obtained from electronic medical records between the two types. In regard to the hematological parameters, COVID-19 patients showed decreased erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and complement C1q, whereas neutrophils, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were significantly increased, especially in severe cases. We also found that CD3+ CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD19+ B lymphocytes, and CD16+ CD56+ NK cells in the peripheral blood of all patients were decreased. In addition, CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, and complement C1q in severely ill patients decreased more significantly. Additionally, interleukin 6 (IL-6) elevation was particularly prominent in all patients, especially in severe cases. These results suggest that CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, C1q as well as IL-6 may play critical roles in the inflammatory cytokine storm. The dysregulation of these aforementioned immune parameters, along with bacterial coinfection, were the important causes of exacerbation of the patients' condition and death. This study improves our understanding of the immune dysregulation of COVID-19 and provides potential immunotherapeutic strategies.IMPORTANCE The dysregulation of CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, C1q as well as IL-6, along with bacterial coinfection, were important causes of exacerbation of the patients' condition and death.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Immune Injury Mechanisms in 71 Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The folding of monomeric antigens and their subsequent assembly into higher ordered structures are crucial for robust and effective production of nanoparticle (NP) vaccines in a timely and reproducible manner. Despite significant advances in in silico design and structure-based assembly, most engineered NPs are refractory to soluble expression and fail to assemble as designed, presenting major challenges in the manufacturing process. The failure is due to a lack of understanding of the kinetic pathways and enabling technical platforms to ensure successful folding of the monomer antigens into regular assemblages. Capitalizing on a novel function of RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna: chaperone + RNA), we provide a robust protein-folding vehicle that may be implemented to NP assembly in bacterial hosts. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was fused with the RNA-interaction domain (RID) and bacterioferritin, and expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. Site-specific proteolytic removal of the RID prompted the assemblage of monomers into NPs, which was confirmed by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The mutations that affected the RNA binding to RBD significantly increased the soluble aggregation into amorphous structures, reducing the overall yield of NPs of a defined size. This underscored the RNA-antigen interactions during NP assembly. The sera after mouse immunization effectively interfered with the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the cellular receptor hDPP4. The results suggest that RNA-binding controls the overall kinetic network of the antigen folding pathway in favor of enhanced assemblage of NPs into highly regular and immunologically relevant conformations. The concentration of the ion Fe(2+), salt, and fusion linker also contributed to the assembly in vitro, and the stability of the NPs. The kinetic pace-keeping role of chaperna in the super molecular assembly of antigen monomers holds promise for the development and delivery of NPs and virus-like particles as recombinant vaccines and for serological detection of viral infections.","output":"Chaperna-Mediated Assembly of Ferritin-Based Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans or gattii.

Further, the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2) software was used to predict the potential functional capabilities of the bacterial communities. Sequencing analysis led to the identification of five major bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. At genus level, Mycobacterium, Bacillus, Cupriavidus, Hyphomicrobium and Mesorhizobium were the most dominant. With the exception of the later two bacterial genera, the first three are potential pathogens whose presence in HVAC systems poses a significant public health risk, especially among immunocompromised individuals. Nine pathways associated with antibiotics resistance and bacterial pathogenicity were identified, including polymyxin resistance and peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathways. Further, investigation of the relationship between the detected bacterial meta-communities and predicted potential virulence factors (antibiotic resistance and pathogenic genes) led to the detection of 350 positive associations among 43 core bacteria, 2 pathogenic genes (sitA and uidA) and 14 resistance genes.

Retrospective studies assessing the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and levels of troponin I (TnI) and other cardiac injury biomarkers (creatine kinase [CK], CK myocardial band [CK-MB], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were included. The data were extracted independently by two investigators. RESULTS: The analysis included 23 studies with 4631 total individuals. The proportions of severe disease, ICU admission, or death among patients with non-elevated TnI (or troponin T [TnT]), and those with elevated TnI (or TnT) were 12.0% and 64.5%, 11.8% and 56.0%, and 8.2% and. 59.3%, respectively. Patients with elevated TnI levels had significantly higher risks of severe disease, ICU admission, and death (RR 5.57, 95% CI 3.04 to 10.22, P < 0.001; RR 6.20, 95% CI 2.52 to 15.29, P < 0.001; RR 5.64, 95% CI 2.69 to 11.83, P < 0.001). Patients with an elevated CK level were at significantly increased risk of severe disease or ICU admission (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.61, P < 0.001). Patients with elevated CK-MB levels were at a higher risk of developing severe disease or requiring ICU admission (RR 3.24, 95% CI 1.66 to 6.34, P = 0.001). Patients with newly occurring arrhythmias were at higher risk of developing severe disease or requiring ICU admission (RR 13.09, 95% CI 7.00 to 24.47, P < 0.001).

Blockade of the gut-tropic integrin 47 and its subunits has been exploited as a therapeutic target in IBD. Natalizumab (anti-4) is approved for moderate to severe Crohns disease (CD), but its use is limited due to potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Vedolizumab (anti-47) is approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD.

Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and Other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To validate the PICTURE model's ability to predict unexpected deterioration in general ward and COVID-19 patients, and to compare its performance with the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), an existing model which has recently been assessed for use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to EDI and NEWS scores for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death). Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. RESULTS: In non-COVID-19 general ward patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) per observation, compared to the EDI's 0.763 (0.746 - 0.781) (n = 21,740, P < 0.001). In patients testing positive for COVID-19, PICTURE again outperformed the EDI with an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.849 (0.820 - 0.878) compared to the EDI's 0.803 (0.772 - 0.838) (n = 607, P < 0.001). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). CONCLUSIONS: The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering potential incipient waves of COVID-19 infections.

Primary study end point was defined as primary clinical success. Secondary endpoints were defined as in-hospital mortality and/or any in hospital major adverse event (MAE) or lower limb amputation. RESULTS: one hundred and sixteen patients were treated (81 men, 70%; median age: 71 years, IQR 65-81). Thirty-two patients (28%) were addressed from Spoke hospitals directly referring to our Hub, 19 (16%) from hospitals belonging to other Hub/Spoke nets, 48 (41%) came directly from our Emergency Department, and 17 (15%) were already hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. Acute limb ischemia was the most observed disease, occurring in 31 (26.7%), 12 (38.7%) of whom were found positive for COVID-19 pneumonia on admission, while 3 (9.7%) became positive during hospitalization. Chronic limb ischemia was the indication to treatment in 24 (20.7%) patients. Six (5.2%) patients underwent primary amputation for irreversible ischemia. Aortic emergencies included 21 cases (18.1%), including 13 (61.9%) symptomatic abdominal aortic or iliac aneurysms, 4 (19.0%) thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 2 (9.5%) cases of acute type B aortic dissection (one post-traumatic). Seventeen (14.7%) patients were admitted for symptomatic carotid stenosis (no Covid-19 patients), all of them underwent carotid endarterectomy. Seventeen (14.7%) cases were treated for other vascular emergencies. Overall, at a median follow-up of 2313 days, primary clinical success was 87.1% and secondary clinical success was 95.9%. We recorded 3 in-hospital deaths for an overall mortality rate of 2.6%. Compared with the 2019 cohort, COVID era patients were older (72 vs 63 years, p=.002), more frequently transferred from other hospitals (44% vs 21%, p=.014) and more frequently with decompensated chronic limb threatening ischemia (21% vs 3%, p=.015); surgical outcomes were similar between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Since its appearance, SARS-CoV-2 has been testing all national health systems which founds themselves having to face an unprecedented emergency. Late referral in the pandemic period could seriously worsen limb prognosis, this aspect should be known and addressed by healthcare providers. Vascular surgical outcomes in pre-COVID and COVID-era were comparable in our experience.","output":"Single center vascular Hub experience after 7 weeks of COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy (Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is thought to release its RNA genome at either the cell surface or within endosomes, the balance being dependent on spike protein stability, and the complement of receptors, co-receptors and proteases. To investigate possible mediators of pH-dependence, pKa calculations have been made on a set of structures for spike protein ectodomain and fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, 3 histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilising in pre-fusion (all 3) and post-fusion (2 of 3) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface salt-bridge interactions, and sidechain-mainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilising. Notably, the degree of destabilisation is predicted to vary between open and closed receptor binding domain conformations. It is therefore suggested that these groups contribute to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium. These observations are discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mutagenesis studies, and other human coronaviruses.","output":"A model for pH coupling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein open/closed equilibrium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the opportunities and challenges of running virtual reality (VR) studies remotely.

SOURCES Systematic review of Medline and Lilacs databases. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS The use of new diagnostic methods such as immunological techniques and polymerase chain reaction has proven invaluable for specific diagnosis and epidemiological investigation, showing adequate sensitivity, specificity and promptness of results, with the aim of guiding therapy properly. Review of epidemiological studies of community acquired pneumonia showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae is still one of the most significant etiologic agents in all age groups, in developing and industrialized countries. Resistance of this agent to penicillin and cephalosporins is increasing in all continents and is worrisome. Atypical agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are common in community acquired pneumonia, mainly in children older than 4 years, representing one third of the cases in industrial countries. However, their prevalence in developing countries remain to be determined. Respiratory syncytial virus is also a very common etiology of community acquired pneumonia and may cause severe infections, mainly in infants and younger children. The introduction of new conjugated vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b resulted in significant reduction of morbidity and mortality of pneumonia in children. CONCLUSIONS A significant impact on morbidity and mortality of acute pneumonia in children is likely to occur if microbiological and antimicrobial control is continuously and dynamically performed, thus allowing for the development of new vaccines, particularly against the respiratory syncytial virus.","output":"[Etiological diagnosis of pneumonia--a critical view]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading globally.

It is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19.

The treatment groups were almost identical after randomisation in terms of age, sex, level of parental education, history of measles immunisation, and fever. After 1 week the percentages cured were nearly identical (204 [46%] ampicillin; 209 [47%] control), as were the percentages of cases progressing to moderate ARI (56 [13%] vs 53 [12%]). The effect of treatment was not modified by age, sex, measles immunisation status, or the educational level of the parents. At the 2-week follow-up, the percentages cured were 62% (277) in the ampicillin group and 58% (256) in the control group; 14% of both groups had progressed to moderate ARI; and 24% (107) and 28% (123), respectively, still had mild ARI.

Infection with this virus has commonly been associated with thrombotic events. However, little is known about bleeding risk and anticoagulation therapy. This study aims to determine factors that are associated with increased risk of bleeding in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the records of COVID-19 patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 through May 2020. Using patient charts, investigators manually collected data regarding patient characteristics and bleeding. Patients were included in the analysis if they had a confirmed COVID-19 PCR test, were older than 18 years of age and were admitted to the hospital. Patients who were pregnant or had incomplete charts were excluded from the study. ANOVA and logistic regression were used to determine the statistical significance of the data using SPSS version 27. Results: A total of 651 patients were included in the analysis out of 685 patients located in the database of COVID-19 infected patients during that time frame. The general characteristics of the patients were as follows: 54.2% were males; females 45.8% ages ranged from 28 to 83 years old (median age = 66 years old). There were 31 patients (4.9%) who required more than 1 unit of packed red blood cell (PRBC). A total of 16 (2.85%) patients had a documented gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), of which 8 received a total of 29 units of PRBC transfusions. The HAS-BLED score (without alcohol/drug due to inadequate charting) is calculated for patients who had a documented GI bleed and who received more than one unit of PRBC. It was noted that the higher the HAS-BLED score the greater the likelihood of having a GI bleed (p < 0.001). The HAS-BLED score (not including alcohol/drug) was also predictive for patients who received more than one unit of PRBC during their hospital stay (p < 0.001). Discussion: Using the HAS-BLED score without alcohol/drugs, patients with COVID-19 can be stratified in regard to their risk of GI bleeding and their risk of transfusion while in the hospital. When administering anticoagulation therapy, cautious monitoring should be carried out. Decisions regarding anticoagulant therapy should be based on individual patient characteristics.","output":"Assessment of Bleeding Risk in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Tertiary Hospital Experience during the Pandemic in a Predominant Minority PopulationBleeding Risk Factors in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even in countries with extensive sanitation systems, outbreaks of waterborne infectious diseases are being reported. Current tendencies, such as the growing concentration of populations in large urban conurbations, climate change, aging of existing infrastructures, and emerging pathogens, indicate that the management of water resources will become increasingly challenging in the near future. In this context, there is an urgent need to control the fate of fecal microorganisms in wastewater to avoid the negative health consequences of releasing treated effluents into surface waters (rivers, lakes, etc.) or marine coastal water. On the other hand, the measurement of bacterial indicators yields insufficient information to gauge the human health risk associated with viral infections. It would therefore seem advisable to include a viral indicatorfor example, somatic coliphagesto monitor the functioning of wastewater treatments. As indicated in the studies reviewed herein, the concentrations of somatic coliphages in raw sewage remain consistently high throughout the year worldwide, as occurs with bacterial indicators. The removal process for bacterial indicators and coliphages in traditional sewage treatments is similar, the concentrations in secondary effluents remaining sufficiently high for enumeration, without the need for cumbersome and costly concentration procedures. Additionally, according to the available data on indicator behavior, which is still limited for sewers but abundant for surface waters, coliphages persist longer than bacterial indicators once outside the gut. Based on these data, coliphages can be recommended as indicators to assess the efficiency of wastewater management procedures with the aim of minimizing the health impact of urban wastewater release in surface waters.","output":"Coliphages as a Complementary Tool to Improve the Management of Urban Wastewater Treatments and Minimize Health Risks in Receiving Waters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic is predicted to compromise the achievement of global reproductive, maternal, and newborn health (RMNH) targets.

An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from to July 1-21, 2020 in Lagos State, Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. In all, 256 RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 87.1% felt work-related burnout, 97.7% were concerned about the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation observed.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for con- trolling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by Rc), is less than unity. This equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable, for a special case of the model where quarantined-susceptible individuals do not acquire COVID-19 infection during quarantine, when Rc is less than unity. The epidemiological consequence of this theoretical result is that, the community-wide implementation of control interventions that can bring (and maintain) Rc to a value less than unity will lead to the effective control (or elimination) of COVID-19 in the community. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on baseline levels of interventions) are 105, 100 for New York state and 164, 000 for the entire US by the end of the pandemic. These numbers dramatically decreased by 80% and 64%, respectively, if adherence to strict social-distancing measures is improved and maintained until the end of May or June. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distance measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy  70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.","output":"Mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penicillium marneffei is the etiologic agent of a severe systemic disease in immunocompromised hosts in Southeast Asia.

Our results indicate that Crenigacestat significantly inhibited NOTCH1 and HES1, whereas tumor progression was not affected. In addition, the drug triggered a strong immune response and blocked neovascularization in the tumor ecosystem of the HuCCT1-xenograft model without affecting the occurrence of fibrotic reactions. Therefore, although these data need further investigation, our observations confirm that Crenigacestat selectively targets NOTCH1 and that the desmoplastic response in iCCA likely plays a key role in both drug effectiveness and tumor progression.","output":"The Tumor Microenvironment Drives Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Colistin is a polymyxin antibiotic which has been used for treatment of Gram-negative infections, but it was withdrawn due to its nephrotoxicity. However, colistin has gained its popularity in recent years due to the reemergence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative infections and drug-induced toxicity is considered as the main obstacle for using this valuable antibiotic. RESULTS: In total, 30 articles, including 29 animal studies and one clinical trial were included in this study. These compounds, including aged black garlic extract, albumin fragments, alpha lipoic acid, astaxanthin, baicalein, chrysin, cilastatin, colchicine, curcumin, cytochrome c, dexmedetomidine, gelofusine, grape seed proanthocyanidin extract, hesperidin, luteolin, lycopene, melatonin, methionine, N-acetylcysteine, silymarin, taurine, vitamin C, and vitamin E exhibited beneficial effects in most of the published works. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, the authors have attempted to review the available literature on the use of several compounds for prevention or attenuation of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity.

Recent global events including the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic means that human encounter with viruses is increased. Cancer development in individuals with viral infection can take many years after infection, demonstrating that the involvement of viruses in cancer development is a long and complex process. This complexity emanates from individual genetic heterogeneity and the many steps involved in cancer development owing to viruses. The process of tumorigenesis is driven by the complex interaction between several viral factors and host factors leading to the creation of a tumor microenvironment (TME) that is ideal and promotes tumor formation. Viruses associated with human cancers ensure their survival and proliferation through activation of several cellular processes including inflammation, migration, and invasion, resistance to apoptosis and growth suppressors. In addition, most human oncoviruses evade immune detection and can activate signaling cascades including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, Notch and Wnt pathways associated with enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis. This expert review examines and synthesizes the multiple biological factors related to oncoviruses, and the signaling cascades activated by these viruses contributing to viral oncogenesis. In particular, I examine and review the Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomaviruses, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus in a context of cancer pathogenesis. I conclude with a future outlook on therapeutic targeting of the viruses and their associated oncogenic pathways within the TME.

Studies have suggested that consistently engaging in these behaviours can cause difficulties within relationships and contribute to the development of a personality disorder. Most of the literature thus far has focused on engagement in controlling behaviours by children with a disorganised attachment style, despite there being theoretical grounds to suggest they may also be used by adults and across all types of insecure attachment. This study aimed to address these gaps by looking at adult attachment style and engagement in controlling behaviours in romantic relationships, across all insecure attachment styles; avoidant, anxious and disorganised. The current study recruited a non-clinical sample; specifically, 149 English-speaking adults, living in the UK, between the ages of 18 and 77 years old (M = 34.28, SD = 14.90). The participants answered an anonymous online questionnaire containing four self-report measures which assessed the participants' attachment security and organisation, caregiving style and engagement in punitive behaviours. The results indicated that participants who scored higher in disorganised attachment were more likely to use controlling punitive behaviours in their romantic relationships. Moreover, participants who reported a more insecure-anxious attachment style were more likely to use compulsive caregiving behaviours in their romantic relationships. In contrast, participants who reported a higher insecure avoidant attachment style were less likely to use compulsive caregiving behaviours in their romantic relationships. These results have implications for adult attachment theory and aid the understanding of some of the behaviours that can be harmful within romantic relationships.

Recanalization (defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [TICI] score 2b-3) and collateral status (using the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology collateral grading system) were assessed by a blinded core laboratory. Good (moderate) outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 (0-3) assessed after at least 3 months (median time to follow-up = 120 days). RESULTS Thirty-four percent had good and 42% had moderate clinical outcome; mortality was 35%. TICI 2b-3 recanalization was achieved by 79%. Age, hypertension, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores, collateral status, and the use of magnetic resonance imaging prior to EVT predicted clinical outcome, the latter 3 remaining independent predictors in multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of recanalization were better collateral status and the use of a stent retriever. However, recanalization did not significantly predict clinical outcome. INTERPRETATION Beside initial stroke severity, the collateral status predicts clinical outcome and recanalization in BA occlusion. Our data suggest that the use of a stent retriever is associated with high recanalization rates, but recanalization on its own does not predict outcome.

Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress.

TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes.

In vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA is engineered to structurally resemble naturally occurring mature and processed eukaryotic mRNA. Such synthetic mRNAs deliver genetic information that allows the translational machinery of the host cells to produce many copies of the encoded proteins, which can function as antigens to boost immune responses or as supplementary beneficial proteins, resulting in a therapeutic effect. With recent developments in mRNA in vivo delivery platforms and the improvement of modified regulatory systems, the stability and transfection efficiency of mRNA have been greatly improved. Modified regulatory systems utilize caps, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, open reading frames, Poly(A) tails, and chemically modified nucleotides. Notably, in vivo delivery platforms can either be a non-targeted or targeted delivery system. Currently, mRNA-based therapeutics, including vaccines and protein replacement therapy, are being clinically developed for cancers, infectious diseases, and rare diseases. Common mRNA cancer vaccines include dendritic cell mRNA cancer vaccine, naked mRNA injection, mRNA encoding CAR, and other combination therapies. There are two main types of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases: Non-replicating and self-amplifying. In addition, mRNA protein replacement therapies are available;these are therapies in which body cells are transfected with mRNA, and the translated proteins are used to supplement the lack of proteins in the body or replace abnormal proteins that hinder normal cellular pathways. mRNA therapies are also used in treatment of rare genetic diseases, such as Fabry disease, methylmalonic acidemia, ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency, and acute intermittent porphyria. Furthermore, IVT mRNA encoding genome-editing nucleases has been used as a novel method to perform gene editing. mRNA therapies have the advantages of fast preparation, low production costs, and safety. However, there are still challenges to be overcome for the successful clinical application of mRNA-based therapies. For example, mRNA stability and target specificity still require improvement. In terms of stability, quality control needs to be improved and the negative impact of immunogenicity should be reduced.

Harm reduction (HR) services, which aim to reduce the negative effects of drug use on health, are likely to be diminished in a pandemic. However, innovative HR interventions and messaging may also develop in response to such a crisis. It is vital to understand the most effective ways to deliver HR in pandemic situations so that guidance can be provided for current and future disruptions to service provision. METHODS: A rapid evidence review was conducted with the aim of exploring what HR interventions and messaging are most effective during a pandemic-type situation. Ten health databases were systematically searched using terms relevant to the research aim. A search was also made of grey literature, including a targeted search of HR messaging from key national and service provider websites. RESULTS: In the initial search, 121 pieces of evidence were identified which, after screening and de-duplication, resulted in 60 for inclusion. The included evidence consists mainly of non-peer reviewed, pre-publication or expert opinion pieces. The rapid findings suggest that HR services should be deemed essential during a pandemic, with staff supported to work safely and social distancing adaptations implemented. Services should be encouraged to operate more flexibly; for instance, in deciding the amounts of take-home supplies of injecting equipment and medications. The evidence on HR communication was very limited but key messages on infection control, uncertain drug supply and accessing services were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid evidence review identifies implications for national policy makers, commissioners and HR service providers. A person-centred rather than disease-centred approach to HR delivered by collaborating partners, as well as prioritizing tailored HR messaging, is recommended. Further research evaluating the delivery of HR services and messaging, particularly focusing on health inequalities, is urgently needed.","output":"Rapid evidence review of harm reduction interventions and messaging for people who inject drugs during pandemic events: implications for the ongoing COVID-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advanced age is a key predictor of severe COVID-19. To gain insight into this relationship, particularly with respect to immune responses, we utilized the rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two cohorts of eight older (16-23 years) and eight younger (3-5 years) rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Animals were evaluated using viral RNA quantification, clinical observations, thoracic radiographs, single-cell transcriptomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, cytokine detection, and lipidomics analysis at pre-defined timepoints in various tissues. Differences in clinical signs, pulmonary infiltrates, and virus replication dynamics were limited between age cohorts. Transcriptional signatures of inflammation-associated genes in cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 3 dpi revealed efficient mounting of innate immune defenses in both younger and older animals. These findings suggested that age did not substantially skew major facets of acute disease in this model. However, age-specific divergence of immune responses emerged during the post-acute phase of infection (7-21 dpi). Older animals exhibited sustained local inflammatory innate responses while local effector T-cell responses were induced earlier in the younger animals. Circulating lipid mediator and cytokine levels highlighted increased repair-associated signals in the younger animals, in contrast to persistent pro-inflammatory responses in the older animals.

Children whose parents are exposed to such scheduling practices may experience higher levels of household economic strain (Schneider & Harknett, 2020), more time-based conflict that could deplete quality time with parents (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), and may experience more parental stress (Schneider & Harknett, 2019a). While prior work on scheduling has focused on nonstandard shifts (Li et al., 2014) or on schedule flexibility and control (Kelly et al., 2011), the reality of work scheduling for parents in the large retail and food service sector is of unpredictable work schedules (Lambert et al., 2014;Schneider & Harknett, 2019a). Recent research focusing specifically on retail and food service workers finds that exposure to unpredictable work schedules, in the form of on-call shifts, canceled shifts, short advance notice, last-minute changes to schedule timing, and work hour volatility, increases the risk of material hardships, net of controls for hourly wage, and household income (Schneider & Harknett, 2020).","output":"Maternal exposure to work schedule unpredictability and child behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The wellbeing of patients with eating disorders is one of the priorities in the bigger picture of treatment for eating disorders. Sensory soothing strategies for sensory sensitivities are supportive tools which could be useful in day-care and inpatient clinical programmes. METHODS: Evaluation of multiple separate sensory wellbeing workshops consisting of psychoeducation and experiential components delivered in inpatient and intensive day-care services was performed. Participants self-report questionnaires were evaluated pre- and post-workshop. Additionally, patients comments and qualitative feedback was collected after completion of the workshop. RESULTS: There was strong evidence that self-reported awareness of sensory wellbeing, awareness of strategies to enhance sensory wellbeing, and confidence in managing sensory wellbeing increased after the workshops with positive qualitative feedback from participants. The feedback questionnaires highlighted that patients found the sessions useful and were able to use some of the skills and strategies they learned in the workshop. CONCLUSION: This pilot work on sensory wellbeing workshops with a protocol-based format was feasible and beneficial for the patient group.

Approximately 1% of the US population have external genital warts. Although cantharidin has been used to treat external genital warts for decades, there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved cantharidin products and no reliable or controlled sources of cantharidin available. VP-102 is a drug-device combination product containing cantharidin (0.7% w/v) in a single-use shelf-stable applicator. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, phase II clinical trial was to determine the optimal regimen for the treatment, safety, and efficacy of VP-102 in external genital warts. METHODS: The study was conducted in two parts. Part A was dose finding and Part B was performed following the completion of Part A for a safety and efficacy evaluation. Following completion of Part A, 6-h and 24-h VP-102 regimens under occlusion were selected to be evaluated in Part B. RESULTS: Pooled results from Part B and Part A of the 6-h and 24-h VP-102 treatment regimens showed that 36.7% and 33.3% of participants achieved complete clearance of all treatable external genital warts at the end of treatment vs 4.2% (p < 0.0048) and 0% (p < 0.0075) with the vehicle. Adverse events experienced by the VP-102-treated participants were consistent with the pharmacodynamic action of cantharidin as a vesicant and were primarily mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events included application-site vesicles, pain, and erythema. No participants discontinued the study because of adverse events and no serious adverse events were deemed treatment related. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse event profile and efficacy of VP-102 under occlusion demonstrated in this study support the conclusion that a 6-h or up to 24-h exposure regimen represents an acceptable risk:benefit profile and justifies the conduct of a larger vehicle-controlled phase III study in external genital warts.

The vanilloid phytochemicals, which include curcumin, capsaicin, and gingerol, have been shown to alleviate pain. However, there is little to no literature on the interaction of vanilloid phytochemicals with ARs. In this study, photochemical methods were used to generate a novel isomer of curcumin (cis-trans curcumin or CTCUR), and the interactions of both curcumin and CTCUR with the two Gs-linked AR subtypes were studied. Competitive binding assays, docking analysis, and confocal fluorescence microscopy were performed to measure binding affinity; cell survival assays were used to measure toxicity; and cAMP assays were performed to measure receptor activation. Competitive binding results indicated that CTCUR binds to both AR A2A and AR A2B with Ki values of 5 M and 7 M, respectively, which is consistent with our docking results. Fluorescence microscopy data also shows binding for A2B and A2A. Cell survival results show that CTCUR and CUR are nontoxic at the tested concentrations in these cell lines.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Lack of adherence (non-adherence) or under-treatment (non-persistence) with respect to evidence from clinical trials remains a significant barrier to optimizing real-world outcomes for patients with nAMD. Contributing factors and strategies to address this are poorly understood. METHODS: Studies that reported factors for non-adherence and/or non-persistence to anti-VEGF therapy as well as studies examining strategies to improve this were included. Trial eligibility and data extraction were conducted according to Cochrane review methods. Risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Method Assessment Tool and certainty of evidence evaluated according to the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) tool. Data were collated descriptively. RESULTS: Of the 1284 abstract results screened, 124 articles were assessed in full and 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. Definitions of non-adherence and non-persistence varied or were not reported. Non-persistence occurred early with up to 50% of patients stopping treatment by 24 months. High rates of non-adherence were similarly reported, occurring in 32 - 95% of patients. Certainty of this finding was downgraded to moderate level due to heterogeneity in definitions used across studies. Multiple factors determine non-adherence and non-persistence, including at condition, therapy, patient, social/economic and health systems/health-care team level. Moderate quality evidence points to lower baseline vision and poorer response to treatment as condition-related variables. The effects of other factors were of lower certainty, predominantly due to small numbers and potential biases in retrospective assessment. Although many factors are non-modifiable (e.g., patient co-morbidity), other factors are potentially correctable (e.g., lack of transport or mismatched patient expectations). Evidence on strategies to improve adherence and persistence is limited, but where available, these have proven effective. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of factors related to poor patient adherence and persistence in nAMD could help identify at-risk populations and improve real world outcomes. Further work is required to develop uniform definitions as well as establishing high quality evidence on interventions that can be easily implemented.","output":"Non-adherence or non-persistence to intravitreal injection therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a mixed-methods systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Grayscale image attributes from 456 images extracted from CT scan slices of 53 patients (49 with COVID-19 and 4 without) are used to establish a visual scale of severity of lung abnormalities (five classes: 0 to 4).

This problem leads to ensure giving specific cares to people in need either in illness or disability in their own homes. Home Health Care (HHC) proposes this kind of services for patients demanding it. These services have to be done at the request of the patient which appears to be the client in a way that gives satisfaction to the requester of the service. Often, these demands are bound by a specific time that the workforce (caregivers) are obligated to respect in addition to the precedence (priority) constraint. The main purpose of the HHC structures is to provide a service that is good in term of quality, minimize the overall costs and shorten the losses. To reduce the costs of these HHC structures, it is mandatory to find comprehensible and logical ways to do it, for it is not permissible to touch the caregiver salary, HHC structures find themselves in the obligation to optimize by other means such as reducing the travel cost. Note that these structures give cares in one's home, which means that the travel aspect is important and is considered the core spending charges of the institution. Another fact is the satisfaction of the patients toward caregivers;this is an essential element to optimize in order to obtain a good quality service, to give a realistic aspect for the problem the lunch break of caregivers is introduced as a parameter. For those arguments, a conception of an efficient planning of caregivers involves using decision tools and optimization methods. A caregiver (vehicle) is attributed to a patient (customer) to do a number of cares with several options in accordance to the customer wishes like time windows requirement often specified by the client, the priority or precedence constraints are usually performed if a care have to be performed before another and could need the intervention of more than one caregiver and must have at least one lunch break a day and it is not always taken at a set time of the day and must be versatile to optimize customer demand satisfaction.

METHOD: We aimed to illustrate annual distribution of confirmed viral infections between 2017 and 2021 based on 32,506 clinical samples in a German pediatric tertiary care center and to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of these infections in children. RESULTS: While a decrease in overall viral infections was observed during the first and second lockdown period, an extraordinary increase in the number of viral respiratory infections, predominantly caused by human Rhino-/Enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), was observed after relaxation of preventive measures. Notably, Rhino-/Enterovirus infections increased 4-fold (2020 vs. 2019) and 16-fold (2021 vs. 2019). The occurrence of RSV was observed beginning from June to August 2021 and reached an all-time record with a 25- to 50-fold increase in numbers in September and October 2021 in relation to previous pre-pandemic years (2017C2019).

A substantial rate of economic instability, as well as social discrim-ination, was visible before the pandemic, thereby worsening their situation with a lack of food, fund, insecurity, safety, and mental health concern during COVID-19. This study focuses on the impact of the Coronavirus crisis on the socioeconomic life of Transgender people taking into account the explosion in unemployment, adding to an already disproportionate healthcare support system pushing them further to the margins. The study comes forward with useful suggestions based on content analysis of published and aired informa-tion to reduce the existing woes of transgender people during COVID-19.","output":"Impact of covid-19 on the socioeconomic life and psychology of transgenders: Insights from india"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, a multi-subunit vesicle tethering complex of the CATCHR (Complexes Associated with Tethering Containing Helical Rods) family, controls several aspects of cellular homeostasis by orchestrating retrograde vesicle traffic within the Golgi. The COG complex interacts with all key players regulating intra-Golgi trafficking, namely SNAREs, SNARE-interacting proteins, Rabs, coiled-coil tethers, and vesicular coats. In cells, COG deficiencies result in the accumulation of non-tethered COG-complex dependent (CCD) vesicles, dramatic morphological and functional abnormalities of the Golgi and endosomes, severe defects in N- and O- glycosylation, Golgi retrograde trafficking, sorting and protein secretion. In humans, COG mutations lead to severe multi-systemic diseases known as COG-Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (COG-CDG).

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pre-season physical measurements in collegiate baseball players and track in-season baseball throwing volume to determine which factors may predict throwing overuse injuries. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. METHODS: Baseline preseason mobility, strength, endurance, and perception of function were measured in 17 collegiate baseball pitchers. Participants were then followed during the course of the season to collect rate of individual exposure, estimated pitch volume, and rating of perceived exertion in order to determine if changes in workload contributed to risk of injury using an Acute-to-Chronic Workload ratio (ACWR). RESULTS: Participants developing an injury had greater shoulder internal rotator strength (p=0.04) and grip strength in a neutral position (p=0.03). A significant relationship was identified between ACWR and UE injuries (p <0.001). Athletes with an ACWR above or below 33% were 8.3 (CI(95) 1.8-54.1) times more likely to suffer a throwing overuse injury occurring to the upper or lower extremity in the subsequent week. CONCLUSION: ACWR change in a positive or negative direction by 33% was the primary predictor of subsequent injury. This finding may assist sports medicine clinicians by using this threshold when tracking pitch volume to ensure a safe progression in workload during a baseball season to reduce the risk of sustaining overuse upper or lower extremity injuries.

The work presented here addresses this problem from a Data Quality (DQ) perspective, adapting the traditional methods used in relational databases, based on quality dimensions and metrics, to capture the characteristics of Twitter data streams in particular, and of Big Data in a more general sense. Therefore, as a first contribution, this paper re-defines the classic DQ dimensions and metrics for the scenario under study. Second, the paper introduces a software tool that allows capturing Twitter data streams in real time, computing their DQ and displaying the results through a wide variety of graphics. As a third contribution of this paper, using the aforementioned machinery, a thorough analysis of the DQ of Twitter streams is performed, based on four dimensions: Readability, Completeness, Usefulness, and Trustworthiness. These dimensions are studied for several different cases, namely unfiltered data streams, data streams filtered using a collection of keywords, and classifying tweets referring to different topics, studying the DQ for each topic. Further, although it is well known that the number of geolocalized tweets is very low, the paper studies the DQ of tweets with respect to the place from where they are posted. Last but not least, the tool allows changing the weights of each quality dimension considered in the computation of the overall data quality of a tweet. This allows defining weights that fit different analysis contexts and/or different user profiles. Interestingly, this study reveals that the quality of Twitter streams is higher than what would have been expected.","output":"Analyzing the Quality of Twitter Data Streams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The efficacy of combined stent retriever (SR) and aspiration catheter (AC; combined technique: CBT) use for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is unclear. We investigated the safety and efficacy of single-unit CBT (SCBT)-retrieving the thrombus as a single unit with SR and AC into the guide catheter-compared with single use of either SR or contact aspiration (CA). METHODS We analysed 763 consecutive patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for AIS between January 2013 and January 2020, at six comprehensive stroke centers. Patients were divided into SCBT and single device (SR/CA) groups. The successful recanalization with first pass (SRFP) and other procedural outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS Overall, 240 SCBT and 301 SR/CA (SR 128, CA 173) patients were analyzed. SRFP (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2c, 43.3% vs 27.9%, p<0.001; mTICI 3, 35.8% vs 25.5%, p=0.009) and final mTICI 2b recanalization (89.1% vs 82.0%, p=0.020) rates were significantly higher, puncture-to-reperfusion time was shorter (median (IQR) 43 (31.5-69) vs 55 (38-82.2) min, p<0.001), and the number of passes were fewer (meanSD 1.720.92 vs 1.991.01, p<0.001) in the SCBT group. Procedural complications were similar between the groups. In subgroup analysis, SCBT was more effective in women, cardioembolic stroke patients, and internal carotid artery and M2 occlusions.

Limited clinical information about COVID-19 on solid organ transplant (SOT) are available so far. We herein report our preliminary experience with COVID-19 in SOT recipients in the first few weeks of the outbreak in Qatar. Method: All SOT recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 up to 23 May 2020 were included. Baseline characteristics, antivirals and immunosuppressive management, complications, and outcomes were retrospectively extracted from the electronic health system. Categorical data are summarized as frequency and percentages, while continuous variables are presented as medians and ranges. Results: Twenty-four SOT patients with COVID-19 were included in this report (kidney: 16, liver: 6, heart: 1, and combined liver and kidney: 1). The median age was 57 years (range 24C72). Thanks to proactive screening, five (21%) asymptomatic cases were diagnosed (Table S1). Among the other 19 symptomatic patients, fever (15/19) and cough (13/19) were the most frequent presenting symptoms (Table S1). All patients were hospitalized;5 (21%) required invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) (Table S2). Eleven (46%) patients developed acute kidney injury as a complication, including 3 in association with drug-drug interactions involving investigational COVID-19 therapies (Table S2). Maintenance of immunosuppressive therapy was changed in 18 (75%) patients, but systemic corticosteroids were not withdrawn in any. After a median follow up of 43 days (26C89), 18 (75%) patients had been discharged home, 3 (12.3%) were still hospitalized, 2 (8.3%) were still in ICU, and 1 (4.2%) had died (Table S2). Conclusion: Although higher mortality rates were observed in other reports,2,3 our results suggest that asymptomatic COVID-19 is possible in SOT recipients and that overall outcomes are not consistently worse than other immunocompetent patients. The results require validation in larger cohorts.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 in solid organ transplant recipients in a setting of proactive screening and contact tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Building on theories of cultural trauma, this research examines institutional trauma engendered by the pandemic in relation to journalism and public health in the US and Brazil.

The aim of this observational study is to explore the impact of healthcare professional involvement on the adherence of patients to an eHealth platform. We evaluated the usage of an eHealth platform by patients who used the platform individually compared with patients in a blended setting, where healthcare professionals were involved. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, log data from September 2011 until January 2018 were extracted from the eHealth platform Curavista. Patients with COPD who completed at least one Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were included for analyses (n = 299). In 57% (n = 171) of the patients, the eHealth platform was used in a blended setting, either in hospital (n = 128) or primary care (n = 29). To compare usage of the platform between patients who used the platform independently or with a healthcare professional, we applied propensity score matching and performed adjusted Poisson regression analysis on CCQ-submission rate. RESULTS: Using the eHealth platform in a blended setting was associated with a 3.25 higher CCQ-submission rate compared to patients using the eHealth platform independently. Within the blended setting, the CCQ-submission rate was 1.83 higher in the hospital care group than in the primary care group. CONCLUSION: It is shown that COPD patients used the platform more frequently in a blended care setting compared to patients who used the eHealth platform independently, adjusted for age, sex and disease burden. Blended care seems essential for adherence to eHealth programs in COPD, which in turn may improve self-management.","output":"The impact of the involvement of a healthcare professional on the usage of an eHealth platform: a retrospective observational COPD study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Use of extended cold storage of platelets promises to increase PLT availability and the bacterial safety of bleeding patients.

One of the units was then stored at 1-6C while the other unit was placed on an agitator at 20-24C. Eight hours after collection, the unit stored at room temperature was transferred to 1-6C storage without agitation. Units were sampled for an array of PLT in vitro parameters on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21.

In response, athletes, coaches, managers, and other change agents with institutional power in sport organisations across the globe have begun to utilise their platforms to champion social justice generally, and racial justice in particular, in solidarity. Historically, in concert with trends in neoliberal and neocolonial hegemonic societies, sport has reproduced various oppressive ideologies, discourses, and systems grounded in racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia and related systemically oppressive forces. Given the visibility of sport in the global marketplace, racialized groups have used sport as a site of resistance and activism for social justice. Since the athlete activist has re-emerged as an important change agent in the public consciousness, an increasing number of supporters holding privileged identities, within and beyond sport, have backed social justice movements through their allyship. However, scholarship has focussed largely on the allyship of athletes. Perhaps more problematically, the ambiguity of allyship has resulted in instances of decentring the core targets or victims of oppressive systems, who are best positioned to lead social movements. In an effort to cultivate a deeper understanding of allyship and how allies can optimise social movements, the purpose of this conceptual paper is to call for more intentional, critically reflexive, and culturally conscious allyship that is reflective of a transformation of allyship from reactive advocacy to proactive activism for long-term substantive gains. The authors posit that transformational allyship is allyship as activism on both individual and institutional levels. Allyship as activism should consist of intentionality to centre the core targets and victims of oppression, critical reflexivity of the relationship between ally and core activist, the presence of a clear opposition, a challenge or disruption to hegemonic systems, and a connection to a broader social movement. Implications for coaches, administrators, sport managers, and athletes are discussed.","output":"Allyship as activism: advancing social change in global sport through transformational allyship.

Reduction of such pain by local anesthetics that are delivered for several days postoperatively is a desirable clinical objective, which is approached by a new formulation and applied in animal studies reported here. METHODS We subcutaneously injected a new formulation of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid polymer microspheres, which provides steady drug release for 96+ hours into rats at the dorsal region 2 hours before surgery. A single 1.2-cm-long skin incision was followed by blunt dissection of skin away from the underlying fascia, and closed by 2 sutures, followed by 14 days of testing. Microspheres containing 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg bupivacaine were injected locally 2 hours before surgery; bupivacaine-free microspheres were the vehicle control, and bupivacaine HCl solution (0.5%), the positive control. Mechanical sensitivity was determined by the frequency of local muscle contractions to repeated pokes with nylon monofilaments (von Frey hairs) exerting 4 and 15 g forces, testing, respectively, allodynia and hyperalgesia, and by pinprick. RESULTS Injection of bupivacaine microspheres (40 mg drug) into intact skin reduced responses to 15 g von Frey hairs for 6 hours and to pinprick for 36 hours. Respective reductions from bupivacaine HCl lasted for 3 and 2 hours. Skin incision and dissection alone caused mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia for 14 days. Microspheres containing 20 or 40 mg bupivacaine suppressed postoperative hypersensitivity for up to 3 days, reduced integrated allodynia (area under curve of response versus time) over postoperative days 1 to 5 by 51%  20% (mean  SE) and 78%  12%, and reduced integrated hyperalgesia by 55%  13% and 64%  11%, for the respective doses.

The CL segmentation is challenging due to its thin, sheet-like structure, heterogeneity of its image modalities and formats, imperfect labels, and data imbalance. We propose an automatic optimized U-Net-based 3D segmentation model, called AM-UNet, designed as an end-to-end process of the pre and post-process techniques and a U-Net model for CL segmentation. It is a lightweight and scalable solution which has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy for automatic CL segmentation on 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI). On the T1/T2 combined MRI CL dataset, AM-UNet has obtained excellent results, including Dice, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) scores of 82%, 70%, and 90%, respectively. We have conducted the comparative evaluation of AM-UNet with other pre-existing models for segmentation on the MRI CL dataset.

However, the molecule also has many other biological properties that are unrelated to the oncotic activity. The purpose of this review is to examine the hemodynamic and systemic effects of albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Besides plasma expansion, albumin appears to act against inflammation, facilitate immunocompetence, and improve cardiac and endothelial function, thus antagonizing critical steps in the pathophysiological cascade underlying decompensated cirrhosis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, as well the pleiotropic properties of the molecule, provides the rationale for considering albumin as a multi-target disease-modifying agent in decompensated cirrhosis. Both oncotic and non-oncotic properties likely concur with the clinical benefits of long-term albumin administration recently demonstrated in these patients.","output":"Hemodynamic and Systemic Effects of Albumin in Patients with Advanced Liver Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To summarize recent research and to propose a selection of best papers published in 2017 in the field of Clinical Information Systems (CIS). METHOD Each year a systematic process is carried out to retrieve articles and to select a set of best papers for the CIS section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook of Medical Informatics. The query aiming at identifying relevant publications in the field of CIS was refined by the section editors during the last years. For three years now, the query is stable. It comprises search terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus as well as additional free text search terms from PubMed and Web of Science?. The retrieved articles were categorized in a multi-pass review carried out by the two section editors. The final selection of candidate papers was then peer-reviewed by Yearbook editors and external reviewers. Based on the review results, the best papers were then selected by the IMIA Yearbook editorial board. Text mining, and term co-occurrence mapping techniques were used to get an overview on the content of the retrieved articles. RESULTS The query was carried out in mid-January 2018, yielding a consolidated result set of 2,255 articles which had been published in 939 different journals. Out of them, 15 papers were nominated as candidate best papers and four of them were finally selected as best papers in the CIS section. Again, the content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics which is covered by CIS research.

Methods: Inspired by possibly different values of the time-varying reproduction number for the imported cases and the local cases in China, we divided all transmission events into three subsets: imported (the zeroth generation) infecting 1st-generation locals, 1st-generation locals infecting 2nd-generation locals, and others transmissions among 2+ generations.

A Bayesian approach with doubly interval-censored likelihood is employed to fit the lognormal, gamma, and Weibull distribution function of the SI and GI using the identified 337 transmission chains. Findings: It is found that the estimated $\\\\mbox{SI}^{0}_{1}$ = 6.27 (95%CI : 5.62 - 6.98), $\\\\mbox{SI}^{1}_{2}$ = 5.92 (95%CI : 5.27 - 6.66), $\\\\mbox{SI}^{2+}_{3+}$ = 4.36 (95%CI : 3.65 - 5.20), and $\\\\mbox{GI}^{0}_{1}$ = 8.15 (95%CI : 6.73 - 9.91), $\\\\mbox{GI}^{1}_{2}$ = 5.26 (95%CI : 4.25 - 6.69), $\\\\mbox{GI}^{2+}_{3+}$ = 3.85 (95%CI : 2.18 - 6.72), thus overall both SI and GI decrease when generation increases.","output":"Serial interval and generation interval for respectively the imported and local infectors estimated using reported contact-tracing data of COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In India, the first confirmed case of novel corona virus (COVID-19) was discovered on January 30, 2020 The number of confirmed cases is increasing day by day, and it crossed 21,53,010 on August 9, 2020 In this paper, a hybrid forecasting model has been proposed to determine the number of confirmed cases for upcoming 10 days based on the earlier confirmed cases found in India The proposed model is based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and mutation-based Bees Algorithm (mBA) The meta-heuristic Bees Algorithm (BA) has been modified applying 4 types of mutation, and mutation-based Bees Algorithm (mBA) is applied to enhance the performance of ANFIS by optimizing its parameters Proposed mBA-ANFIS model has been assessed using COVID-19 outbreak dataset for India and USA, and the number of confirmed cases in the next 10 days in India has been forecasted Proposed mBA-ANFIS model has been compared to standard ANFIS model as well as other hybrid models such as GA-ANFIS, DE-ANFIS, HS-ANFIS, TLBO-ANFIS, FF-ANFIS, PSO-ANFIS and BA-ANFIS All these models have been implemented using Matlab 2015 with 10 iterations each Experimental results show that the proposed model has achieved better performance in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean absolute error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) It has obtained RMSE of 1280 24, MAE of 685 68, MAPE of 6 24 and NRMSE of 0 000673 for India Data Similarly, for USA the values are 4468 72, 3082 07, 6 1, and 0 000952 for RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and NRMSE, respectively ? 2021, The Institution of Engineers (India)","output":"A Hybrid Model based on mBA-ANFIS for COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Prediction and Forecast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After more than one year of the COVID-19 pandemic, antiviral treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 are still severely limited.

Studies were excluded if patients had prior radiosurgery/radiotherapy, mixed pathologies or interventions without separated data, follow-up not reported or population size < 20. For recurrence rate syntheses, studies with follow-up < 6 months were excluded. RESULTS The search produced 2663 studies, of which n = 68 were included, involving 5664 patients. Remission rates after primary and revision TSS were 80% [77-82] and 58% [50-66] at last follow-up. After primary TSS, predictors of remission were micro- v macroadenomas (83% v 68%, p < 0.01), imaging-visible adenomas (81% v 69%, p < 0.01), adenomas confirmed on histopathology (87% v 45%, p < 0.01), absence of cavernous sinus invasion (80% v 30%, p < 0.01), postoperative serum cortisol (MSeC) nadir < 2 g/dL (< 55 nmol/L; 95% v 46%, p < 0.01) and lower preoperative 24-h urine free cortisol (1250 nmol v 1726 nmol, p < 0.01).

Although ethical issues receive considerable attention in medical and research settings, less is known about ethical challenges faced by field epidemiologists in public health programs. Similarly, little is known about moral distress among field epidemiologists, i.e., situations in which they are constrained from acting on what they know to be morally right. Moral distress is strongly associated with empathy fatigue, burnout, reduced job retention, and disengagement. To better understand ethics training needs for field epidemiologists, in February 2019, members of TEPHIConnect, an online and mobile networking platform for Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) alumni, were invited to participate in an anonymous survey about ethical challenges and moral distress. RESULTS: Among 126 respondents from 54 countries, leading causes of ethical dilemmas included inadequate informed consent (61%), inequitable allocation of resources (49%), and conflicts of interest (43%). These occur primarily in settings of disease outbreaks (60%); research (55%); and public health programs at the state, province, or national level (45%) or community level (43%). Work-related moral distress was reported by 91% of respondents, including 26% who experience it frequently or almost always. Field epidemiologists working in low- and low-middle income countries were more likely to report moral distress frequently or almost always than those in higher-income countries (33.0% vs 9.1%, P = 0.006). The most common perceived contributors to moral distress included excessive stress and work demands (30%) and inadequate support from leaders (25%). CONCLUSIONS: Field epidemiologists face significant work-related ethical challenges, which are endemic to public health and political systems. A substantial proportion of field epidemiologists also experience some degree of moral distress, often in association with these challenges. These findings indicate an unmet need among field epidemiologists for support in navigating ethical challenges, as well as for resources to address the human and professional consequences of moral distress.

A few longitudinal studies have reported on the persistent health effects of COVID-19, but the follow-up was limited to 1 year after acute infection. The aim of our study was to characterise the longitudinal evolution of health outcomes in hospital survivors with different initial disease severity throughout 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection and to determine their recovery status. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional, longitudinal cohort study of individuals who had survived hospitalisation with COVID-19 and who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. We measured health outcomes 6 months (June 16CSept 3, 2020), 12 months (Dec 16, 2020CFeb 7, 2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021CJan 10, 2022) after symptom onset with a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test, laboratory tests, and a series of questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), return to work, and health-care use after discharge. A subset of COVID-19 survivors received pulmonary function tests and chest imaging at each visit. Age-matched, sex-matched, and comorbidities-matched participants without COVID-19 infection (controls) were introduced to determine the recovery status of COVID-19 survivors at 2 years. The primary outcomes included symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, HRQoL, 6MWD, and return to work, and were assessed in all COVID-19 survivors who attended all three follow-up visits. Symptoms, mMRC dyspnoea scale, and HRQoL were also assessed in controls. FINDINGS: 2469 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. 1192 COVID-19 survivors completed assessments at the three follow-up visits and were included in the final analysis, 1119 (94%) of whom attended the face-to-face interview 2 years after infection. The median age at discharge was 570 years (480C650) and 551 (46%) were women. The median follow-up time after symptom onset was 1850 days (IQR 1750C1970) for the visit at 6 months, 3490 days (3370C3600) for the visit at 12 months, and 6850 days (6750C6980) for the visit at 2 years. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with at least one sequelae symptom decreased significantly from 777 (68%) of 1149 at 6 months to 650 (55%) of 1190 at 2 years (p<00001), with fatigue or muscle weakness always being the most frequent. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with an mMRC score of at least 1 was 168 (14%) of 1191 at 2 years, significantly lower than the 288 (26%) of 1104 at 6 months (p<00001). HRQoL continued to improve in almost all domains, especially in terms of anxiety or depression: the proportion of individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression decreased from 256 (23%) of 1105 at 6 months to 143 (12%) 1191 at 2 years (p<00001). The proportion of individuals with a 6MWD less than the lower limit of the normal range declined continuously in COVID-19 survivors overall and in the three subgroups of varying initial disease severity. 438 (89%) of 494 COVID-19 survivors had returned to their original work at 2 years. Survivors with long COVID symptoms at 2 years had lower HRQoL, worse exercise capacity, more mental health abnormality, and increased health-care use after discharge than survivors without long COVID symptoms. COVID-19 survivors still had more prevalent symptoms and more problems in pain or discomfort, as well as anxiety or depression, at 2 years than did controls. Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of survivors who had received higher-level respiratory support during hospitalisation had lung diffusion impairment (43 [65%] of 66 vs 24 [36%] of 66, p=00009), reduced residual volume (41 [62%] vs 13 [20%], p<00001), and total lung capacity (26 [39%] vs four [6%], p<00001) than did controls. INTERPRETATION: Regardless of initial disease severity, COVID-19 survivors had longitudinal improvements in physical and mental health, with most returning to their original work within 2 years; however, the burden of symptomatic sequelae remained fairly high. COVID-19 survivors had a remarkably lower health status than the general population at 2 years.

Methods: Acute respiratory tract infections were collected from 3 hospitals in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019. Relevant information was registered and respiratory specimens were sampled for detection of respiratory pathogens by multiplex PCR. Results: A total of 1 543 cases of acute respiratory tract infection were included. The positive rate of adenovirus was 2.92%(45/1 543), the positive rates of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were 2.74%(29/1 058) and 3.30%(16/485), respectively. The positive rate of ILI during January-May 2019 was 5.43%(7/129), higher than that in the same period of 2015- 2018 (0.52%-4.48%) (Fisher's exact test value=8.92, P=0.036). The incidence of adenovirus-positive cases was mainly distributed in the first and second quarters, accounting for 62.22% (28/45). The difference of the incidence of adenovirus-positive cases in each quarter was significant ((2)= 12.52, P=0.006). The positive rate in the second quarter was highest (6.03%), which was higher than that in other quarters (1.89%-2.93%). There were significant differences among different age groups ((2)=16.94, P=0.001), and the positive rate decreased with age ((2)=10.16, P=0.001). The positive rate of 13-19 years old group (9.43%) was higher than that of other age groups (1.48%-4.81%). The positive rate of student group (12.07%) was higher than that of other occupations (2.61%). The difference was systematic ((2)=11.53, P=0.001). Mixed infection accounted for 31.11% (14/45) of 45 adenovirus positive cases. The mixed infection rates of ILI and SARI were 34.48% (10/29) and 25.00% (4/16), respectively. Among 14 cases of mixed infection, the main mixed infection pathogens of adenovirus were influenza A virus and coronavirus.

Like SARS CoV-1, SARS CoV-2 enters host cells via its spike protein, which attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As SARS CoV-1 spike protein is reported to induce cytokine production, we hypothesized that this pathway could be a shared mechanism underlying pathogenic immune responses. We herein compared the capabilities of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 spike proteins to induce cytokine expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We observed that only specific commercial lots of SARS CoV-2 induce cytokine production. Surprisingly, recombinant SARS CoV-2 spike proteins from different vendors and batches exhibited different patterns of cytokine induction, and these activities were not inhibited by blockade of spike protein-ACE2 binding using either soluble ACE2 or neutralizing anti-S1 antibody. Moreover, commercial spike protein reagents contained varying levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which correlated directly with their abilities to induce cytokine production. The LPS inhibitor, polymyxin B, blocked this cytokine induction activity. In addition, SARS CoV-2 spike protein avidly bound soluble LPS in vitro, rendering it a cytokine inducer. These results not only suggest caution in monitoring the purity of SARS CoV-2 spike protein reagents, but they indicate the possibility that interactions of SARS CoV-2 spike protein with LPS from commensal bacteria in virally infected mucosal tissues could promote pathogenic inflammatory cytokine production.","output":"Variable Induction of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines by Commercial SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein Reagents: Potential Impacts of LPS on In Vitro Modeling and Pathogenic Mechanisms In Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atrial fibrillation is a frequently detected cardiac arrhythmia in the etiology of ischemic stroke.

We searched multiple databases and followed Cochrane guidelines for conducting the review. The primary outcomes were anemia, gastrointestinal blood loss, weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length. Nine studies were included: four randomized controlled trials (RCT) and five cohort studies. All studies, except one, were conducted in high income countries. There was a low certainty of evidence that cow's milk increased the risk of anemia compared to formula milk (Cohort studies RR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.15, 4.43, RCTs: RR: 4.03, 95% CI: 1.68, 9.65) and gastrointestinal blood loss (Cohort study RR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.73, 3.16, RCTs: RR: 3.14, 95% CI: 0.98, 10.04).

This factor delivers the initiator Met-tRNA to the ribosome, a process that is conserved in all eukaryotic cells. Many types of stress reduce global translation by triggering the phosphorylation of the  subunit of eIF2, which reduces the formation of the preinitiation translation complexes. Early during rotavirus infection, eIF2 becomes phosphorylated, and even under these conditions viral protein synthesis is not affected, while most of the cell protein synthesis is blocked. Here, we found that the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of eIF2 in rotavirus-infected cells is PKR, since in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in the kinase domain of PKR, or in MA104 cells where the expression of PKR was knocked down by RNA interference, eIF2 was not phosphorylated upon rotavirus infection. The viral component responsible for the activation of PKR seems to be viral double-stranded RNA, which is found in the cytoplasm of infected cells, outside viroplasms. Taken together, these results suggest that rotaviruses induce the PKR branch of the interferon system and have evolved a mechanism to translate its proteins, surpassing the block imposed by eIF2 phosphorylation.","output":"Protein kinase R is responsible for the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha in rotavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to describe clinical, hematological and fecal PCR results from 161 horses involved in outbreaks associated with ECoV.

However, learning environments and activities in this field are often dictated by the requirement for access to microscope facilities and supplementary resources which are highly variable in their academic level, availability, design, and scale, ranging from traditional textbooks to online resources.A resource was created which allows individuals to experience some of the aspects of petrographic microscopy in a digital manner. In particular, specific features of the materials observed and how microscopes work were included. The resource was disseminated to a population of learners and educators, who provided responses to a questionnaire. Responses were overwhelmingly positive and indicate considerable interest from learner and teacher alike. Critical areas for improvement include the need for clarity in the user interface and the inclusion of a recorded human voice rather than automated text narration. This study highlights the need for, and benefits of, interactive online learning resources in petrology and associated fields. This type of resource has positive implications for the flexibility, inclusivity, and accessibility of teaching materials. Such resources may prove particularly valuable when distance learning is unavoidable (e.g. the COVID-19 crisis) and/or hybrid, blended learning environments are being deployed. The method and platform used in this study are highly transferable to other subject areas (or other areas of the geosciences).","output":"A flexible, open, and interactive digital platform to support online and blended experiential learning environments: Thinglink and thin sections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has led to a great deal of general suffering and an increased prevalence of psychiatric illness worldwide.

Our study seeks to examine how the biophysical parameters of the Delta variant correlate to the clinical observations. Receptor binding domain (RBD) is the first point of contact with the human host cells and is the immunodominant form of the spike protein. Delta variant RBD contains two novel mutations L452R and T478K. We examined the effect of single mutations as well as the double mutation on RBD expression in human Expi293 cells, RBD stability using urea and thermal denaturation, and RBD binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to neutralizing antibodies using isothermal titration calorimetry. Delta variant RBD showed significantly higher expression compared to the wild-type RBD, and the increased expression is due to L452R mutation. Despite their non-conservative nature, none of the mutations significantly affected RBD structure and stability. All mutants showed similar binding affinity to ACE2 and to Class 1 antibodies (CC12.1 and LY-CoV016) as that of the wild-type. Delta double mutant L452R/T478K showed no binding to Class 2 antibodies (P2B-2F6 and LY-CoV555) and a hundred-fold weaker binding to a Class 3 antibody (REGN10987), and the decreased antibody binding is determined by the L452R mutation. These results indicate that the immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, rather than receptor binding, is the main biophysical parameter determining the fitness landscape of the Delta variant RBD and is determined by the L452R mutation.","output":"Biophysical fitness landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant receptor binding domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Alfredson isolated eccentric loading and Silbernagel concentricCeccentric loading have both shown beneficial effects on clinical symptoms in midportion Achilles tendinopathy (AT), but they have never been compared directly. PURPOSE: To test for differences in clinical effects at 1-year follow-up between Alfredson and Silbernagel loading in midportion AT. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 40 recreational athletes were allocated to the Alfredson group (AG) or the Silbernagel group (SG). The primary outcome was the difference in the Victorian Institute of Sports AssessmentCAchilles (VISA-A) at 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the visual analog scale for pain during activities of daily living (VAS-ADL) and sports activities (VASCsports), the EuroQol 5 Dimensions instrument (EQ-5D), and global perceived effect score. Measurements were performed at baseline and 12-week, 26-week, and 1-year follow-up. Analysis was performed using a linear mixed-regression model with intervention (AG vs SG), time (12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 1 year postoperatively), and intervention-by-time interaction. RESULTS: The VISA-A score improved for both AG and SG, from 60.7  17.1 at baseline to 89.4  13.0 at 1-year follow-up and from 59.8  22.2 to 83.2  22.4, respectively (P < .001 for both). Because the interaction term did not significantly improve the model, we reported a treatment effect without interaction term, indicating a constant difference at each follow-up. The linear mixed model with correction for baseline VISA-A and confounders revealed a nonsignificant treatment effect (2.4 [95% CI, C8.5 to 13.3]; P = .656). In addition, after adjustment for the respective baseline values and confounders, nonsignificant treatment effects were found for the VAS-ADL (C2.0 [95% CI, C11.3 to 7.3]; P = .665) and VAS-sports (1.3 [95% CI, C12.8 to 15.3], P = .858). The EQ-5D subscales improved in both groups. After 1 year, significantly more SG participants considered themselves improved (77.3% [SG] vs 50.0% [AG]; P = .04). CONCLUSION: No differences in clinical effects were found between Alfredson and Silbernagel loading at up to 1-year follow-up. Both programs significantly improved clinical symptoms, and given their high adherence rates, offering either of them as a home-based program with limited supervision appears to be an effective treatment strategy for midportion AT.

Multiple repurposed drugs have shown promise in treating COVID-19. We describe a master protocol that will assess the efficacy of different repurposed drugs as treatments for early COVID-19 among outpatients at a high risk for severe complications. Methods: The TOGETHER Trial is an international (currently in Brazil and Africa), multi-center platform adaptive randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Patients are included if they are at least 18 years of age, have a positive antigen test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and have an indication for high risk of disease severity, including co-morbidities, older age, or high body mass index. Eligible patients are randomized with equal chance to an investigational product (IP) or to placebo. The primary endpoint is hospitalization due to clinical worsening of COVID-19 or emergency room required observation for more than 6 hours up to 28 days after randomization. Key secondary endpoints include viral clearance, clinical improvement, hospitalization for any cause, mortality for any cause, and safety and tolerability of each IP. Scheduled interim analyses are conducted and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), who make recommendations on continuing or stopping each IP. The platform adaptive design go-no-go decision rules are extended to dynamically incorporate external evidence on COVID-19 interventions from ongoing independent randomized clinical trials. Discussion: Results from this trial will assist in the identification of therapeutics for COVID-19 that can easily be scaled in low- and middle-income settings. The novel methodological extension of the platform adaptive design to dynamically incorporate external evidence is one of the first of its kind and may provide highly valuable information for all COVID-19 trials going forward.

By seeding distal sites with antigen-specific effector or memory lymphocytes, the foundation is laid for the animal's mucosal immune system to respond with a secondary response should to this antigen be encountered at this site in the future. The common mucosal immune system has been studied quite extensively in rodent models but less so in large animal models such as the pig. Reasons for this paucity of reported induction of the common mucosal immune system in this species may be that distal mucosal sites were examined but no induction was observed and therefore it was not reported. However, we suspect that the majority of investigators simply did not sample distal mucosal sites and therefore there is little evidence of immune response induction in the literature. It is our hope that more pig immunologists and infectious disease experts who perform mucosal immunizations or inoculations on pigs will sample distal mucosal sites and report their findings, whether results are positive or negative. In this review, we highlight papers that show that immunization/inoculation using one route triggers mucosal immune system induction locally, systemically, and within at least one distal mucosal site. Only by understanding whether immunizations at one site triggers immunity throughout the common mucosal immune system can we rationally develop vaccines for the pig, and through these works we can gather evidence about the mucosal immune system that may be extrapolated to other livestock species or humans.","output":"Evidence for a common mucosal immune system in the pig()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cu, Zn, and amyloid-? (A?) peptides play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their interaction indeed modifies the self-assembly propensity of the peptide that is at the origin of the deposition of insoluble peptide aggregates in the amyloid plaque, a hallmark found in AD brains. Another even more important fallout of the Cu binding to A? peptide is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contributes to the overall oxidative stress detected in the disease and is due to the redox ability of the Cu ions. Many therapeutic approaches are currently developed to aid fighting against AD, one of them targeting the redox-active Cu ions. Along this research line, we report in the present article the use of a phenanthroline-based peptide-like ligand (L), which is able to withdraw Cu from A? and redox-silence it in a very stable 4N Cu(II) binding site even in the presence of Zn(II). In addition and in contrast to what is usually observed, the presence of excess of L lessens the searched effect of ROS production prevention, but it is counterbalanced by the co-presence of Zn(II). To explain such unprecedented trends, we proposed a mechanism that involves the redox reaction between Cu(II)L and Cu(I)L2. We thus illustrated (i) how speciation and redox chemistry can weaken the effect of a ligand that would have appeared perfectly suitable if only tested in a 1:1 ratio and on CuA? and (ii) how Zn overcomes the undesired lessening of ROS arrest due to excess of ligand. In brief, we have shown how working in biologically relevant conditions is important for the understanding of all of the reactions at play and this must be taken into consideration for the further rational design of ligands aiming to become drug candidates.","output":"Unexpected Trends in Copper Removal from A?

Continuous, unresolved dyspnea often indicates the progression of lung lesions. The mechanism that underlies the chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. Chest CT has a higher sensitivity and can play an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. However, our clinical observations showed that although some patients had significant chest distress and dyspnea, the lesions that were observed in the lungs during computed tomography were milder and not completely consistent with clinical symptoms. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, and imaging findings of these patients. We found that extensive inflammation of the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles in patients with COVID-19 due to excessive activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic aggregation of T-lymphocytes at the site of inflammation are possible mechanisms underlying chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19. Short-time and lose-dose use of corticosteroid may be helpful to treat chest tightness and dyspnea in mild COVID-19 patients.

Outcomes of interest included impact of decontamination interventions on surgical mask performance and germicidal effects. FINDINGS: Seven studies met eligibility criteria: one evaluated the effects of heat and chemical interventions applied after mask use on mask performance, and six evaluated interventions applied prior to mask use to enhance antimicrobial properties and/or mask performance. Mask performance and germicidal effects were evaluated with heterogeneous test conditions. Safety outcomes were infrequently evaluated.

However, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter continue to pose unique challenges for clinical health care providers and public health officials alike. In order to effectively communicate during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is increasingly critical for health care providers and public health officials to understand how patients gather health-related information on the internet and adjudicate the merits of such information. OBJECTIVE: With that goal in mind, we conducted a survey of 1003 US-based adults to better understand how health consumers have used social media to learn and stay informed about the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which they have relied on credible scientific information sources, and how they have gone about fact-checking pandemic-related information. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted with a sample that was purchased through an industry-leading market research provider. The results were reported with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 3. Participants included 1003 US-based adults (aged &#8805;18 years). Participants were selected via a stratified quota sampling approach to ensure that the sample was representative of the US population. Balanced quotas were determined (by region of the country) for gender, age, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: The results showed a heavy reliance on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic; more than three-quarters of respondents (762/1003, 76%) reported that they have relied on social media at least \\"a little,\\" and 59.2% (594/1003) of respondents indicated that they read information about COVID-19 on social media at least once per week. According to the findings, most social media users (638/1003, 63.6%) were unlikely to fact-check what they see on the internet with a health professional, despite the high levels of mistrust in the accuracy of COVID-19-related information on social media. We also found a greater likelihood of undergoing vaccination among those following more credible scientific sources on social media during the pandemic (&#967;216=50.790; &#966;=0.258; P<.001).

This paper presents an approach that combines a well-established approach from transportation modelling that uses person-centric data-driven human mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of different room sizes, air exchange rates, disease import, changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility data), masks, indoors vs. outdoors leisure activities, and of contact tracing. The model is validated against the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time. The model predicts the effects of contact reductions, school closures/vacations, masks, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to indoors in fall, and is thus able to quantitatively predict the consequences of interventions. It is shown that these effects are best given as additive changes of the reinfection rate R. The model also explains why contact reductions have decreasing marginal returns, i.e. the first 50% of contact reductions have considerably more effect than the second 50%. Our work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different lockdown measures, or consequences of wearing masks in certain situations.

Recent Findings: In this systematic review, the prevalence of ocular symptoms and signs was low (from 0 to 31.58%) and conjunctivitis was a relatively rare occurrence. The rate of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples was low as well and this ranged from 0 to 11.11%. The development of ocular symptoms and signs was not always accompanied by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples. The opposite was described as well. This may reflect issues related to the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and of the study design. Nonetheless, the nature of research in a pandemic is that conclusions can change as more information is obtained.

Children who later had acute severe bronchiolitis irrespective of viral species had a 2.5-fold increased responsiveness to methacholine (provocative dose of methacholine producing a 15% decrease in transcutaneous oxygen pressure [PD(15)]) at age 1 month compared with control subjects (median PD(15) in cases vs control subjects, 0.13 vs 0.33 mol; P = .01), whereas differences in baseline airflow were not significant for forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, ?0.18 vs ?0.01; P = .36) and forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, ?0.37 vs ?0.09; P = .13).

The relative importance of vaccination strategies and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is not well understood. Objective: To assess the association of simulated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage scenarios with and without NPIs with infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Design, Setting, and Participants: An established agent-based decision analytical model was used to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression from March 24, 2020, to September 23, 2021. The model simulated COVID-19 spread in North Carolina, a US state of 10.5 million people. A network of 1a?017a?720 agents was constructed from US Census data to represent the statewide population. Exposures: Scenarios of vaccine efficacy (50% and 90%), vaccine coverage (25%, 50%, and 75% at the end of a 6-month distribution period), and NPIs (reduced mobility, school closings, and use of face masks) maintained and removed during vaccine distribution. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risks of infection from the start of vaccine distribution and risk differences comparing scenarios. Outcome means and SDs were calculated across replications. Results: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy, 25% coverage), a mean (SD) of 2a?231a?134 (117a?867) new infections occurred after vaccination began with NPIs removed, and a mean (SD) of 799a?949 (60a?279) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained during 11 months. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy, 75% coverage), a mean (SD) of 527a?409 (40a?637) new infections occurred with NPIs removed and a mean (SD) of 450a?575 (32a?716) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained. With NPIs removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared with the worst-case scenario (mean [SD] absolute risk reduction, 13% [1%] and 8% [1%], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Simulation outcomes suggest that removing NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. These findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many prepandemic activities can be resumed.","output":"Association of Simulated COVID-19 Vaccination and Nonpharmaceutical Interventions With Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care tests (POCT) are promising tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 in specific settings. Initial reports suggest the ID NOW? COVID-19 assay (Abbott Diagnostics Inc, USA) is less sensitive than standard real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. This has raised concern over false negatives in SARS-CoV-2 POCT. OBJECTIVES: We compared the performance of the ID NOW? COVID-19 assay to our in-house rRT-PCR assay to assess whether dry swabs used in ID NOW? testing could be stored in transport media and be re-tested by rRT-PCR for redundancy and to provide material for further investigation. METHODS: Paired respiratory swabs collected from patients at three acute care hospitals were used. One swab in transport media (McMaster Molecular Media (MMM)) was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a laboratory-developed two-target rRT-PCR assay. The second was stored dry in a sterile container and tested by the ID NOW? COVID-19 assay. Following ID NOW? testing, dry swabs were stored in MMM for up to 48 hours and re-tested by rRT-PCR. Serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 particles were used to assess the impact of heat inactivation and storage time. RESULTS: Respiratory swabs (n=343) from 179 individuals were included. Using rRT-PCR results as the comparator, the ID NOW? COVID-19 assay had positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreements of 87.0% (95% CI:0.74-0.94) and 99.7% (95% CI:0.98-0.99). Re-tested swabs placed in MMM following ID NOW testing had PPA and NPA of 88.8% (95% CI:0.76-0.95) and 99.7% (95% CI:0.98-0.99), respectively.

The empirical findings for aggregate consumption reveal that only negative shocks have a significant impact on ecological footprint. Similarly, different sources of energy consumption have diverse asymmetric effects on ecological footprint. The positive (negative) shocks to oil and gas consumption increase (decrease) ecological footprint. Thus, an increase in oil consumption has a deteriorating impact on environmental quality while a decrease in gas consumption has a favorable impact on environmental quality.

Objective: To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive. Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital: No. IRBID: TJ-20200320) Setting: A database of outpatients in Tongji Hospital (University Hospital) from 15 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. Patients: 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19 Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS-CoV-2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive. Results: Of the 1,324 outpatients who diagnosed of COVID-19, 633 patients tested positive in their first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (47.8%), with a mean age of 51 years (SD=14.9); the rest, which had a mean age of 47 years (SD=15.4), tested negative in the first test. Ground glass opacity in a CT imaging report was associated with a lower chance of false negatives (aOR, 0.56), and reduced the length of time window for testing positive by 26%. Consolidation was associated with a higher chance of false negatives (aOR, 1.57), and extended the length of time window for testing positive by 44%. In blood routine tests, basophils (aOR, 1.28) and eosinophils (aOR, 1.29) were associated with a higher chance of false negatives, and were found to extend the time window for testing positive by 23% and 41%, respectively. Age and gender also affected the significantly. Limitation: Data were generated in a large single-center study. Conclusion: Testing outcome and positive window of SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 patients were associated with CT imaging results, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms. Taking into account relevant information in CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms helped reduce a false negative testing outcome. The predictive AFT model, what we believe to be one of the first statistical models for predicting time window of SARS-CoV-2 detection, could help clinicians improve the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis, and hence, optimizes the timing of nucleic acid detection and alleviates the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits around the world.

Scheduled DNA release required the proteasome and ubiquitination of the viral core protein V. Cells lacking the E3 ligase Mind bomb 1 (Mib1) were resistant to wild-type adenovirus infection. Viruses lacking protein V or bearing non-ubiquitinable protein V, however, readily infected Mib1 knockout cells, yet were less infectious than wild-type virus. Their genomes were poorly imported into the nucleus and remained uncoated in the cytosol, thereby enhancing chemokine and interferon production through the DNA sensor cGAS.

These benefits have been more consistently shown among individuals navigating stressful situations and among those who have a strong attachment to their pet. Recent research suggests that older adults who walk their dogs experience fewer symptoms of loneliness than those who do not walk their dogs. The current study was designed to evaluate whether dog walking helps older adults facing significant social consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic avoid increased feelings of loneliness. Our study shows that those who reported that COVID-19 had a significant impact on their social lives reported higher levels of loneliness, but if they walked their dog at least once a day, they did not become lonelier despite the social consequences of the pandemic. We conclude that dog walking could be a beneficial therapy in relation to loneliness for individuals who experience significant social setbacks. Further research is needed to determine why dog walking is beneficial, and whether individuals only obtain these benefits when walking their own dog, or if they can also experience benefits when walking with other peoples dogs. ABSTRACT: Pet ownership can provide important companionship and facilitate social connections, which may be particularly important to socially isolated older adults. Given the significant deleterious impact of loneliness on health and wellbeing in later life, many predicted that public safety measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic would greatly increase loneliness, particularly among vulnerable populations like older adults. We investigated whether dog walking buffers loneliness in the context of stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal survey data were obtained from a Florida community-based sample of adults (n = 466) aged 60+ years old in September 2018 and October 2020. Using OLS regression models, we tested: a) the association between the social consequences of COVID-19 and changes in loneliness, and b) the buffering effect of dog walking on this relationship. The high social consequences of COVID-19 were related to increases in loneliness. Walking a dog daily buffered the relationship. These results suggest potential therapeutic effects of dog walking for the promotion of mental health in older adults, particularly in the context of stressful situations that accentuate risks for loneliness.","output":"Dog Walking and the Social Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Loneliness in Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, aducanumab, a beta amyloid targeted immunotherapy, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Alzheimers dementia (AD).

Previous research has shown that nursing home resident mortality related to disasters is frequently underreported. There is a need to better understand the consequences of disasters on nursing home residents and to differentiate vulnerability based on patient characteristics. Objective: To evaluate mortality and morbidity associated with exposure to Hurricane Irma, a Category 4 storm that made landfall on September 10, 2017, in Cudjoe Key, Florida, among short-stay (<90-day residence) and long-stay (&#8805;90-day residence) residents of nursing homes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study of Florida nursing home residents comparing residents exposed to Hurricane Irma in September 2017 to a control group of residents residing at the same nursing homes over the same time period in calendar year 2015. Data were analyzed from August 28, 2019, to July 22, 2020. Exposure: Residents who experienced Hurricane Irma were considered exposed; those who did not were considered unexposed. Main Outcome and Measures: Outcome variables included 30-day and 90-day mortality and first hospitalizations after the storm in both the short term and the long term. Results: A total of 61a?564 residents who were present in 640 Florida nursing home facilities on September 7, 2017, were identified. A comparison cohort of 61a?813 residents was evaluated in 2015. Both cohorts were mostly female (2015, 68%; 2017, 67%), mostly White (2015, 79%; 2017, 78%), and approximately 40% of the residents in each group were over the age of 85 years. Compared with the control group in 2015, an additional 262 more nursing home deaths were identified at 30 days and 433 more deaths at 90 days. The odds of a first hospitalization for those exposed (vs nonexposed) were 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13) within the first 30 days after the storm and 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02-1.08) at 90 days; the odds of mortality were 1.12 (95% CI, 1.05-1.18) at 30 days and 1.07 (95% CI, 1.03-1.11) at 90 days. Among long-stay residents, the odds of mortality for those exposed to Hurricane Irma were 1.18 (95% CI, 1.08-1.29) times those unexposed and the odds of hospitalization were 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04-1.18) times those unexposed in the post 30-day period. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that nursing home residents are at considerable risk to the consequences of disasters. These risks may be underreported by state and federal agencies. Long-stay residents, those who have resided in a nursing home for 90 days or more, may be most vulnerable to the consequences of hurricane disasters.","output":"Association Between Exposure to Hurricane Irma and Mortality and Hospitalization in Florida Nursing Home Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stress that the coronavirus pandemic has produced on the health services and the disruption it has caused in the care of other pathologies and their follow-up in outpatient visits have led us to promote and incorporate telemedicine in our routine medical practice. Telemedicine refers to remote or non-face-to-face medical attention, a new method of administering medical care by accredited professionals, which optimises resources and increases their scope. One drawback for child teleneurology is that our diagnoses require direct observation of the child and carrying out an examination as though playing a game. Mainly in the youngest stages, a new patient evaluated by telemedicine can be more difficult to diagnose and manage, and therefore some neuropaediatricians have chosen to carry out only follow-up visits, medication management and outcome reviews. Telemedicine, however, also has many benefits, such as the possibility of giving rapid advice, coordination among professionals and reaching the patient where and when it is difficult for classical medicine to do so. The aim of this article is to review the possible indications of telemedicine in child neurology, starting out from the fact that we should never delay the diagnosis of something that can be treated, both at the present time and in an eventual situation of resurgence of the pandemic.

There is evidence that the virus affects the liver in different ways. The mechanism of liver damage has not yet been clearly established. Objectives To determine the frequency of alterations in the LFT (liver function tests) and its association with the severity of the ARDS (accute respiratory distress syndrome) in patients with COVID-19 and to determine if obesity, DM2 (diabetes mellitus) and HBP (high blood pressure) are associated with the severity of the ARDS. Material and methods Descriptive, cross-sectional and observational study of 56 patients with dx of ARDS due to COVID-19; Main variables: glucose, LFT and procalcitonin. Secondary variables: age, BMI, DM2, HBP, the severity of ARDS and days of stay. The frequency of qualitative variables was calculated in percentages, measures of central tendency and dispersion were determined for quantitative variables and the association between the increase in the parameters of the LFT and the severity of ARDS by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient and the Mann-Whitney U test, stratifying according to those who survived or died. The medians of the quantitative values of the LFT between living and deceased were compared with the Mann W. U test for independent samples; due to the small sample size and the fact that the normality requirement was not met, statistically significant values were considered with p <0.05. Results Of the 56 patients, 57% are women, all had tomographic data compatible with COVID-19. 41% presented moderate ARDS and 34% severe; 45% died. In the living, the frequency of DM2 and HBP was 22% in severe ARDS; An increase in AST (Aspartate aminotransferase) was found in 67% of admissions and in 100% there was an increase in its maximum peak. In mild ARDS, 33% of the living had increased GGT (gamma glutamyl transferase) at admission and 78% in severe ARDS. There was a statistically significant association between the increase in LDH (lactic dehydrogenase) at the maximum peak and the severity of ARDS (p = 0.047), the GGT at admission almost reached the statistically significant p value (p = 0.053), with a Spearman coefficient of 0.354 (p = 0.051). In the deceased, the frequency of DM2 in severe ARDS was 40%. 100% of those who died with severe ARDS had GGT and LDH increased values at their maximum peak. 100% with moderate ARDS and 90% of the severe ones had hypoalbuminemia upon admission, with a significant association with ARDS severity (p = 0.033). The LDH values at the maximum peak also showed a significant association with ARDS severity (p = 0.043) with a Spearman coefficient of 0.413 (p = 0.040). Discussion To date, this study is one of the few that has investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on liver function and its association with the severity of ARDS in Mexican population. Although our study has the weakness of having a small sample size, it has the strength of being carried out in a hospital that was converted into a COVID hospital, with which we will have access to data from a high number of patients, which will allow comparison alterations in liver function in living and deceased patients and relate it to the severity of ARDS. Conclusions Most of the patients had no history of DM2 or HBP; a large percentage had overweight / obesity and hyperglycemia on admission. There is a high frequency of patients who have alterations in LFT; however, with this sample, it was only possible to determine that the increase in LDH at the maximum peak during hospitalization and hypoalbuminemia on admission are associated with the severity of ARDS. The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.","output":"FREQUENCY OF HEPATIC FUNCTION ALTERATION IN MEXICAN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH THE SEVERITY OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: PRELIMINARY RESULTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) training in schools are mandated in the Ontario high school curriculum.

Although the role of VRI in childhood in the development of recurrent wheezing and long-term asthma is well known, information on the impact in later morbidity of VRI in the neonatal period is lacking. We aimed to explore the occurrence of recurrent wheezing over the first 2 years of life according to VRI status during NICU admission. METHODS During April 2016 and December 2017, infants below 32 weeks of gestation were prospectively studied in VRI surveillance during NICU admission. Families were contacted between September 2018 and May 2019 by a telephone questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 99 patients were enrolled. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 28.8 (1.9) weeks and 1118 (329) g, respectively. During the first 2 years of life, neither episodes of wheezing nor the respiratory impairment-related hospital admissions differed between positive and negative VRI infants. Episodes of wheezing and respiratory impairment-related hospital admissions, as well as specific respiratory treatment prescription, were more frequent within the first 2 years in infants who had suffered symptomatic VRI during NICU admission. CONCLUSION Symptomatic VRI in VLBW infants is associated with long-term respiratory morbidity. The early surveillance of VRI in the preterm infant during NICU admission is justified for prognostic counseling and closely monitoring after discharge.

This systematic review was aimed at describing clinical features of PRS, current interventions and to summarise some of the nosological aspects of the condition. Without language restriction, an electronic search was conducted in Embase, PsychInfo, Medline, Cochrane library, and PubMed databases yielding 29 articles with a total of 79 cases. We performed a risk of assessment bias using an adapted NewcastleCOttawa Scale and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 124 articles were identified, of which 29 were included and these yielded 79 cases. Seventy-six percent of the studies had a low rate of risk of assessment bias (good quality). Our results show that PRS overlaps with several conditions, mainly affects young females aged 7C15 years and has a recovery rate of 78% if diagnosed and treated early but the duration of inpatient treatment may last up to 9.44 months (8.82 SD). The patients had multiple inter-dependent risks. The major predisposing factors included vulnerable premorbid personality and pre-existing mental disorder. Precipitating factors were stressors such as infection and traumatic experiences. Enmeshed parentCchild relationship served as a maintaining factor. The themes of treatment approach are essentially rehabilitative: (1) working collaboratively with patient and family, (2) having access to multidisciplinary team, and (3) peer/group supervision.

CASE PRESENTATION A patient undergoing radiation therapy and hormone therapy for prostate cancer underwent emergency surgery for electrocoagulation due to hematuria and a rapid drop in hemoglobin. The surgery began under general anesthesia, and we first noticed an increase in airway pressure and a decrease in dynamic lung compliance, followed by abdominal distension. Based on readouts from the respiratory mechanics monitor, we suspected lung abnormalities and performed a pulmonary ultrasound, leading to a diagnosis of bilateral pleural effusions, which we then drained.

Many patients seek advice regarding pregnancy once they have a sustained complete remission (CR). PD1 inhibitors are effective in inducing CRs in relapsed cHL, but little is known about their effects on pregnancy, fetal outcomes, or risk of relapse. The PD1/PDL1 axis is vital in the maintenance of pregnancy, allowing for fetal tolerance. This axis is also a key pathway by which Hodgkin Reed Sternberg cells escape immune surveillance. Thus, exposure to PD1 inhibitors in the context of a pregnant cHL survivor could potentially lead to maternal and fetal complications as well as increase the risk of relapse. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes following PD1 inhibitors have been reported in women with melanoma, but not cHL. Such data may help physicians counsel their patients on this topic. CASE: This case describes a 25-year-old woman who was diagnosed with advanced stage cHL that was treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for primary refractory disease. She experienced a relapse eight months following ASCT and was treated with the PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. She completed a total of 21 cycles, achieving a CR after cycle five. After 2 years of sustained CR off pembrolizumab, she had an unassisted and uneventful pregnancy. She delivered a healthy baby boy with no significant complications. He reached his normal milestones in his first year. She remains in CR four years following her last dose of pembrolizumab, evoking the possibility of her being cured of cHL.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the clinical chemistry laboratory at the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi Pakistan. Data for test volumes was extracted from the Integrated Laboratory Management System (ILMS) for the following tumor markers: CA19 Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), Calcitonin, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), from 2017 to 2020. Data from January 1st, 2017 till December 31st, 2019 was recorded and compared with the test volume data from January 1st, 2020 till December 31st, 2020. Number of tests performed in the prior 3 years were compared with tests performed in 2020, specifically looking at changes during the lockdown period in 2020 (1st March C 9 th April) and compared with the same period in preceding years. RESULTS: During the four-year period, a total of 6,530 tests were performed for CA19-9, 893 for Calcitonin, and 54,769 for PSA. Year 2019 recorded the highest volume for all 3 tests with test volumes increasing continuously from 2017 to 2019. Number of tests performed decreased throughout the year 2020 for Calcitonin and PSA, whereas volume of tests for CA19-9 only reduced during the lockdown period while increased in the non-lockdown period as compared to previous years. Highest percent decline during the 2020 lockdown period was seen for Calcitonin (-62.5%), followed by PSA (-51.8%) and CA19-9 (-19%).

Although ethical recommendations have been published, strategies for dealing with overcapacity of critical care resources have so far not been addressed. OBJECTIVES: Assess expert opinion for allocation preferences regarding the growing imbalance between supply and demand for medical resources. DESIGN: A 10-item questionnaire was developed and sent to the most prominent members of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC). SETTING: Survey via a web-based platform. PATIENTS: Respondents were members of the National Anaesthesiologists Societies Committee and Council Members of the ESAIC; 74 of 80 (92.5%), responded to the survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Responses were analysed thematically. The majority of respondents (83.8%), indicated that resources for COVID-19 were available at the time of the survey. Of the representatives of the ESAIC governing bodies, 58.9% favoured an allocation of excess critical care capacity: 69% wished to make them available to supraregional patients, whereas 30.9% preferred to keep the resources available for the local population. Regarding the type of distribution of resources, 35.3% preferred to make critical care available, 32.4% favoured the allocation of medical equipment and 32.4% wished to support both options. The majority (59.5%) supported the implementation of a central European institution to manage such resource allocation. CONCLUSION: Experts in critical care support the allocation of resources from centres with overcapacity. The results indicate the need for centrally administered allocation mechanisms that are not based on ethically disputable triage systems.

METHODS Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were searched, with hand searching of local journals and databases. Narrative synthesis was applied to the qualitative and quantitative evidence. RESULTS Nineteen qualitative studies and 47 quantitative studies were retained. With respect to care needs, nine themes were synthesised: pain control, reduced aggressive end-of-life care, truth telling, physical, emotional and spiritual support, and achieving preferred place of care/death. Informal caregivers expressed their needs for education and burden reduction. Healthcare professionals called for training and national policy support. Twenty-four studies evaluated interventions, mostly among advanced cancer patients. Positive effects were suggested for improvements in quality of life, pain, anxiety and depression, readmission rate, and costs. Models of care evaluated were mostly specialist palliative care delivered in various settings (hospitals, residential care and home). Outcome measures used were grouped into six categories of construct: quality of life, pain, physical assessment, psycho-spiritual assessment, quality of care, and implementation assessment. Limited rigorous randomised controlled trials is available to document intervention outcomes, and some problems (such as high attrition rates) reduced the strength of the evidence.

IL is classified as primary and secondary types. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-month-old girl born at term from vaginal delivery with an APGAR score of 10/10 and birth weight of 4.310ag (>97 percentile) was admitted to our hospital because of increasing abdominal tenderness and diarrhea. At first examination, she presented an abdominal circumference of 60acm, edema of the lower extremities and vulva, and facial dysmorphisms (hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, flat mid-face). DIAGNOSIS: Once admitted, ultrasonography showed a large amount of ascites, while blood laboratory investigations revealed severe hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Lymphoscintigraphy with 99m-Tc-nanocolloid demonstrated abnormal leakage of the tracer in the abdomen as evidence of IL. To detect a possible secondary, exams were performed and demonstrated positive antibody titres for CMV-IgM and IgG in blood and CMV-DNA positivity in blood, urine, saliva, maternal milk, and gastric and duodenal biopsies. Genetic investigations identified the genomic variant c.472C>T of the CCBE1 gene, coding for a protein variant (p.Arg158Cys), in homozygosity. INTERVENTIONS: Total parenteral nutrition was started and continued for a total of 18 days, then gradually bridged by enteral nutrition with a special formula. In addition, antiviral therapy for CMV infection was added first with intravenous ganciclovir for 14 days, resulting in the disappearance of blood viral load after 7 days of therapy and then with valganciclovir per os for another 30 days. OUTCOMES: The clinical course of the child gradually improved. A few days after starting treatments, lower extremities and vulvar edema disappeared, and abdominal circumference gradually decreased to a stable value of 38acm, without any ultrasonographic signs of ascites left. Moreover, serum albumin and IgG rose to normal values after 3 months (4.3ag/dL and 501amg/dL, respectively). LESSONS: This case suggests that in presence of IL both primary and secondary causes should be evaluated. On the other hand, genetic diagnosis is crucial not only for diagnosis but also for prognosis in HS. Life expectancy and quality could deeply vary among different gene mutations and protein variants of the same gene. Further studies and case reports are needed to better understand the clinical meaning of these genetic results and the role of CMV as trigger of IL.","output":"Intestinal lymphangiectasia in a 3-month-old girl: A case report of Hennekam syndrome caused by CCBE1 mutation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteasome inhibitors have been associated with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) - a group of disorders characterised by occlusive microvascular thrombosis causing microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and end-organ damage.

However, the percutaneous approach is challenging in the minimally invasive setting. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of fluorescence liver segmentation by superselective intra-hepatic arterial injection of indocyanine green (ICG). MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight pigs (mean weight: 26.01  5.21 kg) were involved. Procedures were performed in a hybrid experimental operative suite equipped with the Artis Zeego?, multiaxis robotic angiography system. A pneumoperitoneum was established and four laparoscopic ports were introduced. The celiac trunk was catheterized, and a microcatheter was advanced into different segmental hepatic artery branches. A near-infrared laparoscope (D-Light P, Karl Storz) was used to detect the fluorescent signal. To assess the correspondence between arterial-based fluorescence demarcation and liver volume, metallic markers were placed along the fluorescent border, followed by a 3D CT-scanning, after injecting intra-arterial radiological contrast (n = 3). To assess the correspondence between arterial and portal supplies, percutaneous intra-portal angiography and intra-arterial angiography were performed simultaneously (n = 1). RESULTS Bright fluorescence signal enhancing the demarcation of target segments was obtained from 0.1 mg/mL, in matter of seconds.

The advent of coronavirus disease at the end of 2019 is clear proof that the issue of outbreaks is more topical than ever. The Machine Learning (ML) comes to the rescue of medicine by offering predictive analysis methods to predict the reappearance of outbreaks and thus help the healthcare system and decision-makers to take the necessary measures in advance. But which ML method should be used to predict an outbreak? Given the large number of ML methods, it is sometimes difficult to know which method to use. This is why we conducted this study. We looked at the above-mentioned outbreaks and identified the following ML methods as the most commonly used: LR, C4.5, NB, SVM, ANN and RF. Of these six methods, the random forest method (RF) stands out from the others because it was used in all four outbreaks considered, has the best accuracy for two outbreaks (ASF and dengue fever) and has been designated by several independent researchers as the most suitable ML method for outbreak prediction.","output":"Which Machine Learning method for outbreaks predictions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency. Here, we developed and validated a practical model based on the data from a multi-center cohort in China for early identification and prediction of which patients will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Data of 1087 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected from 49 sites between January 2 and February 28, 2020, in Sichuan and Wuhan. Patients were randomly categorized into the training and validation cohorts (7:3). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analyzes were used to develop the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated for the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Further, the nomogram was externally validated in a different cohort. RESULTS: The individualized prediction nomogram included 6 predictors: age, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, fever, and chronic kidney disease. The model demonstrated a high discriminative ability in the training cohort (C-index = 0.829), which was confirmed in the external validation cohort (C-index = 0.776). In addition, the calibration plots confirmed good concordance for predicting the risk of ICU admission. Decision curve analysis revealed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: We established an early prediction model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on hospital admission, even in community health centers. This model can be conveniently used to predict the individual risk for ICU admission of patients with COVID-19 and optimize the use of limited resources.","output":"Exploiting an early warning Nomogram for predicting the risk of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19: a multi-center study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Trainees are facing isolation, burnout, due to the fear of contracting and transmitting COVID-19 There has been a reduction in clinical activities of residents The purpose of this paper is to measure and compare the psychological well-being of dental versus medical residents during the COVID-19 outbreak Methods This is a cross-sectional study whereby trainees of a hospital in New York City were sent a questionnaire Participants were from the dental and medical departments Psychological measures of depression and PTSD were assessed utilizing the PHQ-9 and IES-R questionnaire Other variables compared were age, gender, smoking status, living situation and comorbidities Data analysis utilized chi-squared (X2) and t-tests Bivariate correlation and linear regression analyses was also utilized Results The survey was sent to 19 dental (Dental) and 171 medical (MD) residents There were 66 participants The response rate was 63 16 and 35 09% for the Dental and MD residents, respectively The mean age for the Dental and MD residents, respectively, was 29 62  2 09 and 34 82  9 32 (p=0 014) 81% of the Dental respondents were male and 33 3% of the MD respondents were male (p&lt;0 001) The mean PHQ-9 score was 18 29  2 88 vs 7 24  7 41 for Dental and MD residents, respectively (p&lt;0 001) A higher score represents increased severity of depression The Dental residents scored 61 9  3 90 on the IES-R vs 30 36  24 67 (p&lt;0 001) A higher score indicates a greater frequency of intrusive thoughts and avoidance 41 6% of Dental and 13 3% of MD residents tested positive;25% of Dental and 28 9% of MD residents self-reported symptoms for COVID-19 Being positive or symptomatic resulted in statistically significant higher IES-R and PHQ-9 scores Conclusion Dental residents and being positive or symptomatic for COVID-19 resulted in higher PHQ-9 and IES-R scores Being aware of the impact of COVID-19 is an important step in providing intervention","output":"The Psychological Well-Being of Medical versus Dental GME residents during the Covid 19 Pandemic: A Cross Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integration of transcriptional data with other layers of information, such as the post-transcriptional regulation mediated by microRNAs, can be crucial to identify the driver genes and the subtypes of complex and heterogeneous diseases such as cancer.

As COVID-19 rapidly overwhelmed the healthcare system in 2020, oncology departments found that space, staff, and funds were reallocated to address patient needs during the pandemic. Traditional outpatient services were required to operate with reduced resources, with special attention to additional measures to protect workers and patients from exposure to the virus. Little is known about how these changes affected the nature of the practice of oncology social work.Methods: We compared data on OSW interventions for three months (March-May) 2019 to the same period in 2020. Mount Sinai Downtown Cancer Center's Department of Social Work routinely collects data on services provided by social workers using a validated instrument. As NYC became the epicenter of the COVID-19 in March 2020, the comparison of these time periods creates a natural experiment to examine whether and how the presence of the virus impacted the services provided by OSWs.Findings: There was little difference in the number of encounters that took place between the two time periods (2186 encounters in 2019 and 2084 encounters in 2020); however, there were notable differences in the types of interventions. While interventions involving supportive counseling decreased in 2020, we identified a significant increase specific to bereavement counseling.Conclusion: The study shows a remarkable consistency in the volume and types of services provided by OSWs, in spite of the radical increase in stressors they experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that the OSWs did not allow these stressors to interfere with their work with patients. This study demonstrates how routine use of an instrument to measure OSW interventions can be used to examine services provided over time and to evaluate potential influences of external factors.","output":"Did COVID-19 change the interventions provided by oncology social workers in the epicenter of the pandemic?

The expansion of the ECHO model, further amplified by the pandemic, has demonstrated an increased need to evaluate implementation success to ensure that interventions are implemented as planned. This study describes how Proctor et al.s implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, costs, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability) were adapted and used to assess the implementation of ECHO Ontario Mental Health (ECHO-ONMH), a mental health-focused capacity-building programme. METHODS: Using Proctor et al.s implementation outcomes, the authors developed an implementation outcomes framework for ECHO-ONMH more generally. Using this, outcome measures and success thresholds were identified for each outcome for the ECHO-ONMH context, and then applied to evaluate the implementation of ECHO-ONMH using data from the first 4 years of the programme. RESULTS: An ECHO-ONMH implementation outcomes framework was developed using Proctors implementation outcomes. ECHO-ONMH adapted implementation outcomes suggest that ECHO-ONMH was implemented successfully in all domains except for penetration, which only had participation from 13/14 regions. Acceptability, appropriateness and adoption success thresholds were surpassed for all 4 years, showing strong signs of sustainability. The programme was deemed feasible all 4 years and was found to be more cost-effective. ECHO-ONMH also showed high rates of fidelity to the ECHO model, and high rates of penetration. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use Proctor et al.s implementation outcomes to describe implementation success for a virtual capacity-building model. The proposed ECHO implementation outcomes framework provides a base for similar interventions to evaluate implementation success, which is an important precursor to understanding learning, service or health outcomes related to the model.

Design A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15-April 1, 2021 in the Pittsburgh region. Setting and Population Participants were volunteers at assisted living, personal care, and independent living facilities, who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that obviate immune responses were exclusionary criteria. Methods Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to evaluate relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Results All participants (N=70) had received two rounds of vaccination for COVID-19 and were found to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. There was wide variation in relative levels of antibodies as determined by extinction coefficients. Antibody levels trended lower in male sex, advanced age, steroid medications, and longer length of time from vaccination.

This study provides preliminary information on level of population risk of assisted living, personal care, and independent living residents which can inform reopening strategies. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However, protective effects of such vaccination programs remain to be determined in larger studies.

We hypothesised that using lemborexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, to improve sleep quality would also improve the function of the glymphatic system. We plan to examine the effect of lemborexant on sleep quality and the glymphatic system among patients with insomnia disorder. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pilot study is designed as an open-label, single-arm, single-centre trial. Thirty patients aged 50 years and over with insomnia will be recruited. The participants will take lemborexant (5 mg) at bedtime for 12 weeks and undergo a home-based sleep study at baseline and weeks 4 and 12, as well as MRI examinations to evaluate the glymphatic system at baseline and week 12. The primary outcome will be changes in objective sleep parameters as evaluated using a sleep monitoring system. The secondary outcomes will be changes in subjective sleep parameters. The relationships between changes in sleep parameters and the glymphatic system will be evaluated using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space, which is called the ALPS-index.

No tolerability concern arises from this preliminary analysis. 16 physicians reported having performed AIT despite (early) symptoms of COVID\\\\19 and/or a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2). CONCLUSIONS: This first international retrospective survey in atopic diseases investigated practical aspects and tolerability of AIT during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and gave no concerns regarding reduced tolerability under real\\\\life circumstances. However, the data indicate an undertreatment of AIT, which may be temporary, but could have a long\\\\lasting negative impact on the clinical care of allergic patients.","output":"COVID\\\\19 pandemic and allergen immunotherapy C an EAACI survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The clinical data and corresponding dynamic CT findings were investigated in detail to describe the clinical and imaging profiles of COVID-19 pneumonia disease progression. Methods: Forty HCWs with COVID-19 were included in this study and 30 enrolled for imaging assessment. Disease was divided into four stages based on time from onset: stage 1 (1-6 days), stage 2 (7-13 days), stage 3 (14-22 days), and stage 4 (> 22 days). Clinical wand imaging data were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The cohort included 33 female and 7 male cases, with a median age of 40 years. Six had underlying comorbidities. More than half of the cases were nurses (22, 55%). Each stage included 39, 37, 34 and 32 CTs, respectively. Bilateral lesions, multifocal lesions and lesions with GGO pattern occurred in both lower lobes at all stages. The crazy-paving pattern (20, 54%), air bronchogram (13, 35%), and pleural effusion (2, 5%) were the most common CT features in stage 2. Consolidation score peaked in stage 2 whereas total lesions score peaked in stage 3. Conclusions: COVID-19 pneumonia in HCWs has a potential predilection for younger female workers. Stage 2 of COVID-19 pneumonia may be the key period for controlling progression of the disease, and consolidation scores may be an objective reflection of the severity of lung involvement.","output":"Clinical characteristics and longitudinal chest CT features of healthcare workers hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main goal of this work is to introduce a new SIS epidemic model based on a particular type of finite state machines called cellular automata on graphs.

The protean nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic conundrum. Lyme disease can affect the heart, albeit rarely, with cardiac abnormalities usually manifesting as varying degrees of heart block or arrhythmias. CASE REPORT: We present a case of complete heart block in a young man who participated in outdoor activities in a Lyme-endemic area and developed fatigue and palpitations weeks after a flu-like illness. He noticed that his heart rate was low; he had an intermediate suspicious index in Lyme carditis (SILC) score with positive Lyme serologies. His initial electrocardiogram when he presented to the emergency department showed a complete heart block. In this case, he was successfully managed with intravenous ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and a transcutaneous pacemaker, obviating the need for a permanent pacemaker. CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic changes such as heart block and arrhythmias with or without symptoms may be the initial manifestation of Lyme carditis in a patient who may or may not remember a tick bite or have a typical skin rash. The SILC score may assist in recognizing these cases and prompt initiation of antibiotics usually leads to the resolution of these electrocardiographic abnormalities and symptoms that may be present.","output":"Lyme Carditis: A Reversible Cause of Acquired Third-Degree AV Block"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is taking a huge toll on public health Along with the non-therapeutic preventive measurements, scientific efforts are currently focused, mainly, on the development of vaccines and pharmacological treatment with existing drugs Summarizing evidences from scientific literatures on the discovery of treatment plan of COVID-19 under a platform would help the scientific community to explore the opportunities in a systematic fashion OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the potential drugs and biomedical entities related to coronavirus related diseases, including COVID-19, that are mentioned on scientific literature through an automated computational approach METHODS: We mined the information from publicly available scientific literature and related public resources Six topic-specific dictionaries, including human genes, human miRNAs, diseases, Protein Databank, drugs, and drug side effects, were integrated to mine all scientific evidence related to COVID-19 We employed an automated literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and deep learning We also applied the concept of cosine similarity to confidently infer the associations between diseases and genes RESULTS: Based on the literature mining, we identified 1805 diseases, 2454 drugs, 1910 genes that are related to coronavirus related diseases including COVID-19 Integrating the extracted information, we developed the first knowledgebase platform dedicated to COVID-19, which highlights potential list of drugs and related biomedical entities For COVID-19, we highlighted multiple case studies on existing drugs along with a confidence score for their applicability in the treatment plan Based on our computational method, we found Remdesivir, Statins, Dexamethasone, and Ivermectin could be considered as potential effective drugs to improve clinical status and lower mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 We also found that Hydroxychloroquine could not be considered as an effective drug for COVID-19 The resulting knowledgebase is made available as an open source tool, named COVID-19Base, for the scientific community: http://covid-19base hbku edu qa/, http://covid-19base buet ac bd/ CONCLUSIONS: Proper investigation of the mined biomedical entities along with the identified interactions among those would help the research community to discover possible ways for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19","output":"Towards Preparing a Knowledgebase to Explore Potential Drugs and Biomedical Entities Related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dampak yang dirasakan akibat pandemi COVID-19 berpengaruh tidak hanya pada kondisi ekonomi namun juga psikologis khususnya pada anak-anak.

Although YouTube facilitates easy access to hundreds of well-produced and trustworthy videos, abhorrent, misinformative, and mistargeted content is also common. The platform is plagued by various types of problematic content: 1) disturbing videos targeting young children;2) hateful and misogynistic content;and 3) pseudoscientific misinformation. While YouTube's recommendation algorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube's monetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not entirely understood. In this thesis, we shed some light on the degree of problematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative approach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the risks of YouTube media consumption by young children;2) the role of the recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by focusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community;and 3) user exposure to pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this exposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that young children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly browse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that Incel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active role in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying pseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more pseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g., flat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these recommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's homepage or the video recommendations section.","output":"Characterizing Abhorrent, Misinformative, and Mistargeted Content on YouTube"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated public health measures have influenced all aspects of life for children and families. In this study, we examine changes in children's behavioral health and families' well-being at the start of the pandemic. METHOD: We used longitudinal data on 2880 children from 1 US state collected over 3 waves to compare family and child well-being before and after a state-wide stay-at-home advisory set in March 2020. We descriptively examined levels and changes in 4 child behavioral health outcomes (externalizing, internalizing, adaptive, and dysregulated behaviors) and 4 family well-being outcomes (parental mental health, parental stress, parent-child relationship conflict, and household chaos) across the preshutdown and postshutdown periods. Fixed effects regression models were used to predict within-child and within-family differences in preshutdown and postshutdown outcomes. RESULTS: Fixed effects analyses showed children's externalizing (0.09 points; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.13), internalizing (0.04 points; 95% CI, 0.01-0.08), and dysregulated (0.11 points; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) behaviors increased after the shutdown, whereas children's adaptive behaviors declined (-0.10 points; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.05).

We first evaluated the clinical utility of the tag-less PillCamTM Patency Capsule (PPC) for up to 72 h after ingestion prospectively. METHODS Excretion of an intact capsule or intact body within 72 h, or positive PPC image in the colon or negative PPC image by abdominal X-ray at 30 h was defined as confirmed functional patency. In patients with unconfirmed functional patency, balloon-assisted enteroscopy was performed to evaluate the reason. RESULTS Functional patency was confirmed in 44 of 57 patients. Patency was confirmed in 38 patients (66.7%) at 30 h. In 6 of 19 patients (31.6%) in whom patency was not confirmed at 30 h, patency was confirmed within 72 h and no capsule retention (CR) occurred. The rate of pan-enteroscopy did not differ between patients whose patency was confirmed at 30 h and those whose patency was confirmed within 72 h. Excretion time of the PPC significantly correlated with that of the capsule (r = 0.650). Severe adhesions (>5 cm) interfered with PPC passage in 2 patients, despite the absence of critical stricture. The rate of no CR in patients with functional patency confirmed by prior PPC was 97.7%. Misjudgment of the location of the PPC is a risk for CR.

With Human Activity Recognition (HAR), applications could track if a patient took his pills and detect the behavioral changes associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's. Current systems for HAR require diverse sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, proximity sensors, and accelerometers) placed throughout the environment to provide detailed observations needed for high-accuracy HAR. The difficulty of instrumenting an environment with these sensors makes this approach impractical. This project considers whether recent advances in indoor localization (Wi-Fi Round Trip Time) enable high-accuracy HAR using only a smartphone. My design, called Location-Enhanced HAR (LEHAR), uses machine learning to combine acceleration, audio, and location data to detect common human activities. A LEHAR prototype, designed to recognize a dozen common activities conducted in a typical household, achieved an F1-score of 0.965. In contrast, existing approaches, which use only acceleration or audio data, obtained F1-scores of 0.660 and 0.865, respectively, on the same activities. In addition, the F1-score of existing designs dropped significantly as more activities were added for recognition, while LEHAR was able to maintain high accuracy. The results show that using a combination of acceleration, audio, and Wi-Fi Round Trip Time localization can enable a highly accurate and easily deployable HAR system.","output":"Enabling High-Accuracy Human Activity Recognition with Fine-Grained Indoor Localization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine whether the previously described trend of improving mortality in people with coronavirus disease 2019 in critical care during the first wave was maintained, plateaued, or reversed during the second wave in United Kingdom, when B117 became the dominant strain. DESIGN: National retrospective cohort study. SETTING: All English hospital trusts (i.e., groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units), reporting critical care admissions (high dependency unit and ICU) to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Hospitalization in England Surveillance System. PATIENTS: A total of 49,862 (34,336 high dependency unit and 15,526 ICU) patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021 (inclusive). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was inhospital 28-day mortality by calendar month of admission, from March 2020 to January 2021. Unadjusted mortality was estimated, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted mortality, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, major comorbidities, social deprivation, geographic location, and operational strain (using bed occupancy as a proxy). Mortality fell to trough levels in June 2020 (ICU: 22.5% [95% CI, 18.2C27.4], high dependency unit: 8.0% [95% CI, 6.4C9.6]) but then subsequently increased up to January 2021: (ICU: 30.6% [95% CI, 29.0C32.2] and high dependency unit, 16.2% [95% CI, 15.3C17.1]).

This study sought to investigate whether blood glucose (BG) levels or comorbid diabetes are associated with inflammatory status and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes were compared. The relationship among severity of COVID-19, inflammatory status, and diabetes or hyperglycemia was analyzed. The severity of COVID-19 in all patients was determined according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the Chinese National Health Committee (7th edition). Results: Four hundred and sixty-one patients were enrolled in our study, and 71.58% of patients with diabetes and 13.03% of patients without diabetes had hyperglycemia. Compared with patients without diabetes (n = 366), patients with diabetes (n = 95) had a higher leucocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). There was no association between severity of COVID-19 and known diabetes adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), known hypertension, and coronary heart disease. The leucocyte count, NLR, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level increased with increasing BG level. Hyperglycemia was an independent predictor of critical (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.72-9.30) or severe (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.47-8.58) COVID-19, and of increased inflammatory levels (high leucocyte count (OR 4.26, 95% CI 1.65-10.97), NLR (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.24-6.10), and CRP level (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.19-5.23)), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, severity of illness, and known diabetes.

Hence, we aimed (i) to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, (ii) to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, and (iii) to compare it with unspecific scores. METHODS: Retrospective case-control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each person with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS) was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. Discriminant power was used to compare SIS performance with that of other comorbidity scores. RESULTS: Subjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinson's disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS = 4) 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS = 1). CONCLUSION: Conditions and diseases making people more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified by the current study. Our results support decision-makers in identifying high-risk people and adopting of preventive measures to minimize the spread of further epidemic waves.","output":"Development and validation of a clinical risk score to predict the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from administrative data: A population-based cohort study from Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, it is extremely important to identify and describe new alternative compounds with potential antimicrobial properties. Since various natural biological systems are capable of producing active compounds with such properties, many of them have been the subject of intensive study. The aim of this work was to heterologously overexpress, purify and preliminarily investigate the antimicrobial activity of a novel bacteriocin found in Salmonella species. Overexpressed protein shows an amino acid structure homologous to the well-known colicin M and was never expressed previously in the E. coli platform. Purified salmocin M showed an inhibition spectrum against Salmonella and E. coli strains. To determine its potential as an antimicrobial agent for use in medicine or the food industry, preliminary antimicrobial tests against pathogenic bacteria were carried out. Our research demonstrates that bacteriocin can be produced efficiently in bacterial expression systems, which are one of the cheapest and the most popular platforms for recombinant protein production. Moreover, preliminary results of microbiological tests showed its activity against most of the bacterial strains in a dose-dependent manner.

Study design A population-based nationwide sequential/consecutive cross-sectional study. Methods Using standardised methodology (population-based, random stratified sampling) 11 cross-sectional studies were conducted from April 2020 to February 2021. Data from nasopharyngeal testing and questionnaires were used to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA prevalence and factors associated with test positivity. Results Between April 23, 2020 and February 2, 2021, results were available from 34,915 individuals and 27,870 samples from 11 consecutive studies. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 decreased from 0.27% (95% CI 0.10% - 0.59%) in April to 0.04% (95% CI 0.00% - 0.22%) by the end of May and remained very low (0.01%, 95% CI 0.00% - 0.17%) until the end of August, followed by an increase since November (0.37%, 95% CI 0.18% - 0.68%) that escalated to 2.69% (95% CI 2.08% - 2.69%) in January 2021. In addition to substantial change in time, an increasing number of household members (for one additional OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29), reporting current symptoms of COVID-19 (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.59-3.09), and completing questionnaire in the Russian language (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.15-2.99) were associated with increased odds for SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity.

EBV early lytic protein BFRF1 is shown to be involved in viral maturation, however, whether BFRF1 participates in the host innate immune response is still not well known. In this study, we found BFRF1 could down-regulate sendai virus-induced IFN- promoter activity and mRNA expression of IFN- and ISG54 during BFRF1 plasmid transfection and EBV lytic infection, but BFRF1 could not affect the promoter activity of NF-B or IRF7. Specifically, BFRF1 could co-localize and interact with IKKi. Although BFRF1 did not interfere the interaction between IKKi and IRF3, it could block the kinase activity of IKKi, which finally inhibited the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Taken together, BFRF1 may play a critical role in disrupting the host innate immunity by suppressing IFN- activity during EBV lytic cycle.","output":"Epstein-Barr Virus Early Protein BFRF1 Suppresses IFN- Activity by Inhibiting the Activation of IRF3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of novel coronavirus is closely related to the structure of human social networks.

In this regard, FinTech applications such as mobile financial service (MFS) play an essential role in building resilience during the pandemic. Hence, the aim of the study is to investigate the role of MFS platforms in economic resilience by empirically evaluating the determinants that influence the intention of Bangladeshi users toward adopting MFS platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, through an extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Using the core structures of the UTAUT, the theoretical model was constructed based on the consumption attributes of financial services such as perceived value, as well as additional situational factors from the extended valence framework, including risk and trust. To test the model, data was obtained from 227 potential MFS users in Bangladesh with the aid of a structured questionnaire survey. Subsequently, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach was used to analyze the data. The findings showed that social influence, perceived trust, and perceived value are strongly related to the intention of users to adopt MFS platforms, whereas, perceived risk, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy were observed to influence users perceived value of the MFS platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, the study results indicated that the users perceived risk did not influence their intention to adopt MFS platforms during the pandemic. Therefore, the suggested adoption of the MFS framework during and after the pandemic could contribute to the existing research on the adoption of information technology (IT) through the expansion of the UTAUT, in which the performance and effort expectancy of users influence their intention to indirectly adopt MFS through perceived value.

However, simple testing with immediately available results are crucial to gain control over COVID-19. The aim was to evaluate such a point-of-care antigen rapid test (AG-rt) device in its performance compared to laboratory-based rt-PCR testing in COVID-19 suspected, symptomatic patients. Methods. For this prospective study, two specimen each of 541 symptomatic female (54.7%) and male (45.3%) patients aged between 18 and 95 years tested at five emergency departments (ED, n=296) and four primary healthcare centres (PHC, n=245), were compared, using AG-rt (positive/negative/invalid) and rt-PCR (positive/negative and cycle threshold, Ct) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios (LR+/-) of the AG-rt were assessed. Results. Differences between ED and PHC were detected regarding gender, age, symptoms, disease prevalence, and diagnostic performance. Overall, 174 (32.2%) were tested positive on AG-rt and 213 (39.4%) on rt-PCR. AG correctly classified 91.7% of all rt-PCR positive cases with a sensitivity of 80.3%, specificity of 99.1%, PPV of 98.3, NPV of 88.6%, LR(+) of 87.8, and LR(-) of 0.20. The highest sensitivities and specificities of AG-rt were detected in PHC (sensitivity: 84.4%, specificity: 100.0%), when using Ct of 30 as cut-off (sensitivity: 92.5%, specificity: 97.8%), and when the symptom onset was within the first three days (sensitivity: 82.9%, specificity: 99.6%). Conclusions. The highest sensitivity was detected with a high viral load.

An advanced example of such a molecular electronics chip is presented here, with the important distinction that the molecular circuit elements play the role of general-purpose single-molecule sensors. The device consists of a semiconductor chip with a scalable array architecture. Each array element contains a synthetic molecular wire assembled to span nanoelectrodes in a current monitoring circuit. A central conjugation site is used to attach a single probe molecule that defines the target of the sensor. The chip digitizes the resulting picoamp-scale current-versus-time readout from each sensor element of the array at a rate of 1,000 frames per second. This provides detailed electrical signatures of the single-molecule interactions between the probe and targets present in a solution-phase test sample. This platform is used to measure the interaction kinetics of single molecules, without the use of labels, in a massively parallel fashion. To demonstrate broad applicability, examples are shown for probe molecule binding, including DNA oligos, aptamers, antibodies, and antigens, and the activity of enzymes relevant to diagnostics and sequencing, including a CRISPR/Cas enzyme binding a target DNA, and a DNA polymerase enzyme incorporating nucleotides as it copies a DNA template. All of these applications are accomplished with high sensitivity and resolution, on a manufacturable, scalable, all-electronic semiconductor chip device, thereby bringing the power of modern chips to these diverse areas of biosensing.","output":"Molecular electronics sensors on a scalable semiconductor chip: A platform for single-molecule measurement of binding kinetics and enzyme activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed reports for 59,073 contacts of 5,706 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) index patients reported in South Korea during January 20-March 27, 2020.

Chronic post-traumatic stress disorder may result in considerable psychologic pain and suffering for the individual in addition to significant functional impairment. In addition to the heterogeneity of symptoms that occur in post-traumatic stress disorder, there may also be extensive comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and other psychiatric disorders. This complicates the treatment picture. Currently, accepted treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder include psychotherapy, in particular cognitive behavioral-based approaches and antidepressant medication. However, many patients are refractory to these initial treatments or have only a partial response. In light of this, may clinicians combine additional classes of psychotropic agents and different psychotherapeutic approaches to enhance treatment response. This article reviews the literature on the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Most of the research to date has involved combat veterans partially responsive or refractory to treatment, namely with antidepressants. Studies have shown improvement across post-traumatic stress disorder symptom clusters, as well as improvement in comorbid psychotic symptoms or disorders. More research is needed to confirm these recent findings and further delineate the role of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Currently, possible indications for their use include treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder with comorbid psychotic features.","output":"Emerging roles for atypical antipsychotics in chronic post-traumatic stress disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections in infants undergoing congenital heart surgery lead to prolonged intubation time, hospital (HLOS) and cardiac intensive care unit length of stay (CICU LOS).

Sixty-nine infants (1 month to 1 year) undergoing cardiac surgery from November to May of the years 2012 to 2014 were prospectively enrolled, surveyed and tested. We compared the outcomes of positive molecular testing and positive study questionnaire to test negative subjects. We also evaluated the predictive value of study questionnaire in identification of viruses by molecular testing. Of the 69 enrolled infants, 58 had complete information available for analysis. 17 (30%) infants tested positive by molecular testing for respiratory pathogens. 38 (65%) had a positive questionnaire. Among the 20 viruses detected, Human Rhinovirus was the most common 12 (60%). Seven (12%) of the 58 patients developed respiratory symptoms following surgery prompting molecular testing. Four of these tested positive for a respiratory virus post-surgically. Neither positive molecular testing nor a positive questionnaire prior to surgery was associated with greater post-operative HLOS, CICU LOS, intubation time, respiratory complications, or use of oxygen at discharge compared to negative testing.

It is unknown whether this has resulted in a reduction of postoperative bowel ischemia (BI). The primary objective was to determine BI prevalence after RAAA repair. Secondary objectives were to determine its major sequelae and differences between open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). METHODS This systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017055920) followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. MEDLINE and Embase were searched for studies published from 2005 until 2018. The methodologic quality of observational studies was assessed with the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool. The quality of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. BI prevalence and rates of BI as cause of death, reoperation, and bowel resection were estimated with meta-analyses with a random-effects model. Differences between OR and EVAR were estimated with pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Changes over time were assessed with Spearman rank test (). Publication bias was assessed with a funnel plot analysis. RESULTS A total of 101 studies with 52,670 patients were included; 72 studies were retrospective cohort studies, 14 studies were prospective cohort studies, 12 studies were retrospective administrative database studies, and 3 studies were RCTs. The overall methodologic quality of the RCTs was high, but that of observational studies was low. The pooled prevalence of BI ranged from of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.07-0.09) in database studies to 0.10 (95% CI, 0.08-0.12) in cohort studies. The risk of BI was higher after OR than after EVAR (risk ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.25-2.57). The pooled rate of BI as cause of death was 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.05), and that of BI as cause of reoperation and bowel resection ranged between 0.05 and 0.07. BI prevalence did not change over time (, -0.01; P = .93). The funnel plot analysis was highly suggestive of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of clinically relevant BI after RAAA repair is approximately 10%. Approximately 5% of patients undergoing RAAA repair suffer from severe consequences of BI.

Selective disruption of bundle formation by peptides has been shown to be effective; however, these drugs, exemplified by T20, are prone to rapid clearance from the patient. The incorporation of non-natural amino acids is known to improve these pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we evaluate a peptide inhibitor in which a critical Ile residue is replaced by fluorinated analogues. We characterized the influence of the fluorinated analogues on the biophysical properties of the peptide.

Declines in ridership caused by COVID-19 leads uncertainty about the emission reduction capacity of buses. This paper provides a method framework for analyzing spatio-temporal emission patterns of buses in combination with real-time ridership and potential emission changes in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on GPS trajectory and Smart Card data of 2056 buses from 278 routes covering 1.5 million ridership in Qingdao, China, spatio-temporal emissions characteristics of buses are studied. 7589 taxis with 0.2 million passengers' trips are used for acquiring private cars' emissions to evaluate the emissions difference between buses and cars. Empirical results show that the average difference between buses and cars with 2 persons can reach up to 117 g/km-person during 7:00-8:59 and 115 g/km-person during 17:00-18:59. However, buses have various emission benefits around the city at different periods. A double increase in emissions during non-rush hours can be observed compared with rush hours. 224 online survey data are used to study the potential ridership reduction trend in post-COVID-19. Results show that 56.3% of respondents would decrease the usage of buses in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on this figure, our analysis shows that per kilometer-person emissions of buses are higher than cars during non-rush hours, however, still lower than cars during rush hours. We conclude that when ridership reduces by more than 40%, buses cannot be \\"greener\\" travel modal than cars as before. Finally, several feasible policies are suggested for this potential challenge. Our study provides convincing evidence for understanding the emission patterns of buses, to support better buses investment decisions and promotion on eco-friendly public transport service in the post-COVID-19 future.","output":"Mining urban sustainable performance: Spatio-temporal emission potential changes of urban transit buses in post-COVID-19 future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, arose at the end of 2019 as a zoonotic virus, which is the causative agent of the novel coronavirus outbreak COVID-19.

Development of COVID-19 vaccine is being considered as the most efficient strategy to curtail the ongoing pandemic. Following publication of genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, globally extensive research and development work has been in progress to develop a vaccine against the disease. The use of genetic engineering, recombinant technologies, and other computational tools has led to the expansion of several promising vaccine candidates. The range of technology platforms being evaluated, including virus-like particles, peptides, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), recombinant proteins, inactivated virus, live attenuated viruses, and viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating) approaches, are striking features of the vaccine development strategies. Viral vectors, the next-generation vaccine platforms, provide a convenient method for delivering vaccine antigens into the host cell to induce antigenic proteins which can be tailored to arouse an assortment of immune responses, as evident from the success of smallpox vaccine and Ervebo vaccine against Ebola virus.

Although research suggests that videoconferencing is feasible and can be effective for some types of care, concerns about the impact of technology on provider-patient relationships exist across health disciplines. Suggestions for adapting some in-person rapport techniques, such as the use of small talk, eye contact, and body language to facilitate trust, personal connection, and communication during videoconferencing encounters, have been discussed in the popular press and clinical commentaries. Notably, evidence regarding the effects of these strategies on rapport and clinical care outcomes is lacking. Understanding how to establish rapport in videoconferencing visits is especially important in oncology nursing, where rapport with patients enables nurses to become a source of emotional support, helping patients adapt and navigate the cancer journey. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the nature of nurse-patient rapport in ambulatory cancer care videoconferencing visits. The objectives include exploring how patients with cancer and nurses describe experiences of rapport and strategies for cultivating rapport in videoconferencing visits and similarities and differences identified by patients with cancer and nurses between experiences of rapport in videoconferencing and in-person visits. METHODS: Semistructured narrative interviews of patients with cancer and nurses will be conducted to understand the experience of rapport building in videoconferencing visits. Nurses and patients will be interviewed separately to facilitate an understanding of the perspectives of both types of participants. Interviews will be conducted on a secure videoconferencing platform. This qualitative descriptive study will describe participant experiences in a manner that, although not without interpretation, is as close to the data as possible. The research team will meet regularly to discuss, define, and document codes, categories, and themes, and the team will maintain a detailed audit trail of analytical decisions. In addition, member checking will enhance the rigor of the study. Nurse and patient interviews will be analyzed separately using identical procedures and may be explored side by side in the final analysis to provide a comparative analysis. Data management and analysis will be performed using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Data collection will begin during summer 2021, with results from the data analysis anticipated by winter 2021.

With regulations for telemedicine loosened, new possibilities for the practice of otolaryngology have opened. To address the uncertain duration of this pandemic, a review was conducted of current literature on use of telemedicine services in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and in previous national emergencies to reveal the role telemedicine can play for otolaryngology practices. Data sources: Pubmed articles with an independent search query were utilized. Methods: Literature review performed by one author searched for all published English-language literature on telehealth in the SARS-CoV-2 era. Articles were considered for discussion if they provided relevant developments for telemedicine in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Results: Telemedicine can be up-scaled in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic where exposure containment is of the utmost priority. With patient interaction possible through virtual communication, telemedicine allows continued patient care while minimizing the risk of viral spread. In the realm of otolaryngology, telemedicine has been used in the past during disasters with other studies demonstrating high diagnostic concordance with inpatient visits. Many institutions have recognized the potential for such care as they begin utilize both virtual visits and in-person care during this pandemic. Conclusion: To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we support the AAO-HNS recommendation for the adoption of novel ways to employ telemedicine in this era.

Nevertheless, the incidence of both acute and persisting viral infections without evidence of autoimmune sequelae suggests that this process is well controlled. The conditions promoting or stemming self-reactive (SR) T cells following viral-induced tissue damage thus need to be better defined. Using a non-fatal viral mouse model of encephalomyelitis associated with demyelination and disability, yet ultimate clinical improvement, this study set out to monitor uptake and presentation of endogenous myelin antigens, as well as induction and fate of SR T cells. METHODS: Activation and central nervous system (CNS) recruitment of myelin-specific CD4 T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry during encephalomyelitis induced by a glia tropic murine coronavirus. Potential antigen-presenting cells (APC) ingesting myelin were characterized by flow cytometry and their ability to activate SR T cells tested by co-culture with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled myelin-specific CD4 T cells. Endogenous SR T cell kinetics was analyzed within both cervical lymph nodes and CNS by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) following viral infection. RESULTS: The data demonstrate the presence of APC capable of activating SR T cells in both draining lymph nodes and the CNS temporally correlating with overt demyelination. While both the CNS-infiltrating myeloid population and microglia ingested myelin, only CNS-infiltrating APC were capable of presenting endogenous myelin antigen to SR T cells ex vivo. Finally, SR T cell activation from the endogenous T cell repertoire was most notable when infectious virus was controlled and paralleled myelin damage. Although SR T cell accumulation peaked in the persistently infected CNS during maximal demyelination, they were not preferentially retained. Their gradual decline, despite ongoing demyelination, suggested minimal re-stimulation and pathogenic function in vivo consistent with the lack of autoimmune symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the potential for CNS tissue destruction to induce and recruit SR T cells to the injury site and support a host suppressive mechanism limiting development of autoimmunity.","output":"Self-reactive CD4(+) T cells activated during viral-induced demyelination do not prevent clinical recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the previous months, we have seen the rapid pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS Full-thickness fascial defects were created in 20 Yucatan minipigs and repaired with the retromuscular placement of biologic mesh 3 weeks later. Animals were euthanized at 1 month and the repair sites were subjected to tensile testing and histologic analysis. Samples of unimplanted (de novo) meshes and native porcine abdominal wall were also analyzed for their mechanical properties. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the biomechanical characteristics between any of the mesh-repaired sites at 1 month postimplantation or between the native porcine abdominal wall without implanted mesh and the mesh-repaired sites (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Histologically, non-crosslinked materials exhibited greater cellular infiltration, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and neovascularization compared to crosslinked meshes.

To better understand the immune alterations that determined poor vaccine response, we correlated quantities of circulating T and B cell subsets at baseline with longitudinal serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in heart and lung transplant recipients. Methods: Samples at baseline and at approximately 8 and 30 days after each vaccine dose for 22 heart and lung transplant recipients with no history of COVID-19, four heart and lung transplant recipients with prior COVID-19 infection, and 12 healthy controls undergoing vaccination were analyzed. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and pseudovirus neutralization activity were measured. Proportions of B and T cell subsets at baseline were comprehensively quantitated. Results: At 8-30 days post vaccination, healthy controls displayed robust anti-RBD IgG responses, whereas heart and lung transplant recipients showed minimally increased responses. A parallel absence of activity was observed in pseudovirus neutralization. In contrast, three of four (75%) transplant recipients with prior COVID-19 infection displayed robust responses at levels comparable to controls. Baseline levels of activated PD-1+ HLA-DR+ CXCR5- CD4+ T cells (also known as T peripheral helper [TPH] cells) and CD4+ T cells strongly predicted the ability to mount a response. Conclusions: Immunosuppressed patients have defective vaccine responses but can be induced to generate neutralizing antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The present study examines cytokines as predictors of the prognosis of influenza-associated pneumonia. METHODS: This study included 101 inpatients with influenza (64 pneumonia and 37 non-pneumonia patients). 48 cytokines were detected in the serum samples of the patients and the clinical characteristics were analyzed. The correlation between them was analyzed to identify predictive biomarkers for the prognosis of influenza-associated pneumonia. RESULTS: Seventeen patients had poor prognosis and developed pneumonia. Among patients with influenza-associated pneumonia, the levels of 8 cytokines were significantly higher in those who had a poor prognosis: interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon- (IFN-), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-3, Interleukin-2 receptor subunit alpha and Hepatocyte growth factor. Correlation analysis showed that the IL-6, G-CSF, M-CSF, IFN-, and MCP-1 levels had positive correlations with the severity of pneumonia. IL-6 and G-CSF showed a strong and positive correlation with poor prognosis in influenza-associated pneumonia patients. The combined effect of the two cytokines resulted in the largest area (0.926) under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the probability of poor prognosis in influenza patients with pneumonia is significantly increased. IL-6, G-CSF, M-CSF, IFN-, and MCP-1 levels had a positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia.

We aimed to summarize the presentations and outcomes of COVID-19-positive patients and compare with historical controls. METHODS: Patients with known chronic liver disease who presented with superimposed COVID-19 (n = 28) between 22 April 2020 and 22 June 2020 were studied. Seventy-eight cirrhotic patients without COVID-19 were included as historical controls for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 28 COVID-19 patients (two without cirrhosis, one with compensated cirrhosis, sixteen with acute decompensation [AD], and nine with acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF]) were included. The etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol (n = 9), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 2), viral (n = 5), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 4), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 6). The clinical presentations included complications of cirrhosis in 12 (46.2%), respiratory symptoms in 3 (11.5%), and combined complications of cirrhosis and respiratory symptoms in 11 (42.3%) patients. The median hospital stay was 8 (7C12) days. The mortality rate in COVID-19 patients was 42.3% (11/26), as compared with 23.1% (18/78) in the historical controls (p = 0.077). All COVID-19 patients with ACLF (9/9) died compared with 53.3% (16/30) in ACLF of historical controls (p = 0.015). Mortality rate was higher in COVID-19 patients with compensated cirrhosis and AD as compared with historical controls 2/17 (11.8%) vs. 2/48 (4.2%), though not statistically significant (p = 0.278). Requirement of mechanical ventilation independently predicted mortality (hazard ratio 13.68). Both non-cirrhotic patients presented with respiratory symptoms and recovered uneventfully.

Periodic fasting has emerged as a dietary modification promoting beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to assess whether periodic fasting reduces albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy and determine whether a reduction in albuminuria relates to activation of nephropathy-driven pathways. Methods: Forty patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.8{+/-}0.2% [62.1{+/-}2.3 mmol/mol]) and increased albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) were randomized to fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) (n=21) or Mediterranean diet (n=19) for six months with three-month follow-up. Primary endpoint was the difference of the change in ACR from baseline to after six months between study groups. Subgroup analysis for patients with micro- versus macroalbuminuria at baseline was performed. Secondary endpoints comprised HOMA-IR, circulating markers of dicarbonyl detoxification (MG-H1, glyoxalase-1 and hydroxyacetone), lipid oxidation (acylcarnitines), DNA-damage/repair, (yH2Ax) and senescence (suPAR). Comparison was done by ANCOVA adjusted for age, sex, weight loss and baseline values of the respective outcome. Results: Difference of change in ACR between FMD and control group after six months was 110.3mg/g (95% CI 99.2, 121.5mg/g; P=0.45) in all patients, -30.3mg/g (95% CI -35.7, -24.9mg/g; P[]0.05] in patients with microalbuminuria, and 434.0mg/g (95% CI 404.7, 463.4mg/g; P=0.23) in those with macroalbuminuria at baseline. FMD led to change in HOMA-IR of -3,8 (95% CI -5,6, -2.0; P[]0.05) and in suPAR of -156.6pg/ml (95% CI -172.9, -140.4pg/ml; P[]0.05) after six months, while no change was observed in markers of dicarbonyl detoxification or DNA-damage/repair. Change in AC profile was related to patient responsiveness to ACR improvement. At follow-up only HOMA-IR reduction (-1.9 [95% CI -3.7, -0.1], P[]0.05) was sustained. Conclusions: When accompanied by intensive diabetes care, FMD improves microalbuminuria, HOMA-IR and suPAR levels. Lack of changes in markers of dicarbonyl detoxification and DNA-damage/repair might explain the relapse of albuminuria at follow-up.","output":"A six-month periodic fasting reduces microalbuminuria and improves metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy: a randomized controlled study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A class of random graph models is considered, combining features of exponential-family models and latent structure models, with the goal of retaining the strengths of both of them while reducing the weaknesses of each of them. An open problem is how to estimate such models from large networks. A novel approach to large-scale estimation is proposed, taking advantage of the local structure of such models for the purpose of local computing. The main idea is that random graphs with local dependence can be decomposed into subgraphs, which enables parallel computing on subgraphs and suggests a two-step estimation approach. The first step estimates the local structure underlying random graphs. The second step estimates parameters given the estimated local structure of random graphs. Both steps can be implemented in parallel, which enables large-scale estimation. The advantages of the two-step estimation approach are demonstrated by simulation studies with up to 10,000 nodes and an application to a large Amazon product recommendation network with more than 10,000 products.","output":"Large-scale estimation of random graph models with local dependence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the nearly complete genome sequence of a human enterovirus, a strain of echovirus 30, obtained from a cerebrospinal fluid specimen from a teenaged patient with aseptic meningitis in September 2017.","output":"Nearly Complete Genome Sequence of an Echovirus 30 Strain from a Cluster of Aseptic Meningitis Cases in California, September 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The incidence of infection during SARS-CoV-2 viral waves, the factors associated with infection, and the durability of antibody responses to infection among Canadian adults remain undocumented. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 viral waves in Canada by measuring seropositivity among adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Action to Beat Coronavirus study conducted 2 rounds of an online survey about COVID-19 experience and analyzed immunoglobulin G levels based on participant-collected dried blood spots (DBS) to assess the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first and second viral waves in Canada. A sample of 19 994 Canadian adults (aged 18 years) was recruited from established members of the Angus Reid Forum, a public polling organization. The study comprised 2 phases (phase 1 from May 1 to September 30, 2020, and phase 2 from December 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021) that generally corresponded to the first (April 1 to July 31, 2020) and second (October 1, 2020, to March 1, 2021) viral waves. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G seropositivity (using a chemiluminescence assay) by major geographic and demographic variables and correlation with COVID-19 symptom reporting. RESULTS: Among 19 994 adults who completed the online questionnaire in phase 1, the mean (SD) age was 50.9 (15.4) years, and 10 522 participants (51.9%) were female; 2948 participants (14.5%) had self-identified racial and ethnic minority group status, and 1578 participants (8.2%) were self-identified Indigenous Canadians. Among participants in phase 1, 8967 had DBS testing. In phase 2, 14 621 adults completed online questionnaires, and 7102 of those had DBS testing. Of 19 994 adults who completed the online survey in phase 1, fewer had an educational level of some college or less (4747 individuals [33.1%]) compared with the general population in Canada (45.0%). Survey respondents were otherwise representative of the general population, including in prevalence of known risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among unvaccinated adults increased from 1.9% in phase 1 to 6.5% in phase 2. The seropositivity pattern was demographically and geographically heterogeneous during phase 1 but more homogeneous by phase 2 (with a cumulative incidence ranging from 6.4% to 7.0% in most regions). The exception was the Atlantic region, in which cumulative incidence reached only 3.3% (odds ratio [OR] vs Ontario, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.02). A total of 47 of 188 adults (25.3%) reporting COVID-19 symptoms during phase 2 were seropositive, and the OR of seropositivity for COVID-19 symptoms was 6.15 (95% CI, 2.02-18.69). In phase 2, 94 of 444 seropositive adults (22.2%) reported having no symptoms. Of 134 seropositive adults in phase 1 who were retested in phase 2, 111 individuals (81.8%) remained seropositive. Participants who had a history of diabetes (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90) had lower odds of having detectable antibodies in phase 2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Action to Beat Coronavirus study found that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada was modest until March 2021, and this incidence was lower than the levels of population immunity required to substantially reduce transmission of the virus. Ongoing vaccination efforts remain central to reducing viral transmission and mortality. Assessment of future infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity is practicable through the use of serial online surveys and participant-collected DBS.","output":"Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity During the First and Second Viral Waves in 2020 and 2021 Among Canadian Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication in pregnancy.

Patients with GDM were assigned to the study group (n = 99), whereas (n = 107) healthy women served as controls. Postnatal follow up of their offspring was performed at 12 months of age. All included children (n = 125) underwent a specific standardized protocol including anthropometric data, such as weight, height, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) recordings and ultrasound measurements of the abdominal aortic intima-media-thickness (IMT). Furthermore, at least 10 min 3-channel electrocardiogram recording was done to evaluate the autonomic nervous system (ANS) by phase rectified signal averaging. There were no significant differences in anthropometric data between the groups, neither in the blood pressure nor in the intima-media-thickness of the aorta abdominals. However, in the study group, significantly lower average acceleration capacity (AAC) (study group ?20.10  3.04 ms, control group ?18.87  4.00 ms, p = 0.02) was found, indicating ANS activation at one year of age.

Here we have demonstrated that proliferating B cells were predominantly found in the peritumoral region of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). These B cells were enriched in tumor nests with high expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). High densities of peritumoral proliferating B cells and concomitantly high intratumoral HMGB1 expression showed improved prognostic significance, surpassing prognostic stratification of ESCC patients based on HMGB1 positivity alone. This striking association led us to set up models to test whether cancer-derived HMGB1 could shape tumor microenvironment via modulation on B cells. Overexpression of HMGB1 in ESCC cell lines (KYSE510 and EC18) enhanced proliferation and migration of B cells. Transcriptomic analysis showed that migratory B cells exhibited high enrichment of proangiogenic genes. VEGF expression in proliferating B cells was induced upon co-culture of HMGB1-overexpressing tumor cells and B cells. Secretome array profiling of conditioned media (CM) from the co-culture revealed rich expression of proangiogenic proteins. Consequently, incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with CM promoted angiogenesis in tube formation and migration assays. HMGB1 inhibitor, glycyrrhizin, abolishes all the observed proangiogenic phenotypes. Finally, co-injection of B cells and CM with HMGB1-overexpressing tumor cells, but not with glycyrrhizin, significantly enhanced tumor growth associated with increased microvascular density in ESCC xenograft mice model. Our results indicate that cancer-derived HMGB1 elevates angiogenesis in ESCC by shifting the balance toward proangiogenic signals in proliferating B cells.

Similarly, VR has been associated with improvement of chronic pain and of acute pain during medical procedures. Despite its effectiveness as a healthcare tool, VR technology is not well-integrated into common practice. This qualitative study aims to explore the provider perception of the value of VR and identify barriers to VR implementation among healthcare providers. METHODS: A 66-item self-report survey was created to examine application of VR to clinical practice, perceived value of this treatment, ease of learning the technology, billing considerations, and other obstacles. 128 providers (MDs and PhDs) who were located in the United States and had used VR as a therapeutic tool in the past year were identified through research papers, as well as user lists and news articles from VR application websites. Of the 128 providers contacted, 17% (22) completed our online self-report measure. Of these, 13% of respondents (N = 17) completed greater than 75% of the questionnaire and were considered completers. Provider responses were collected over a one-month period and qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of providers were from an academic institution (n = 12, 70.6%), and all providers practiced in the outpatient setting. Providers most commonly reported using VR for the treatment of acute pain and/or anxiety related to medical procedures (n = 11, 64.7%), followed by specific phobia (n = 6, 35.3%) and social phobia (n = 6, 35.3%). All providers agreed VR is a valuable tool they would recommend to colleagues. The majority (n = 15, 93.8%) believed VR helped their patients progress in treatment, compared with other methods. Providers cited the ability to individualize treatment (n = 14, 87.5%) and increase patient engagement (n = 15, 93.8%) as main benefits of VR. A minority reported negative feedback from patients about content (n = 4, 25%) or about the technology in general (n = 6, 37.5%), whereas all reported some form of positive feedback. The slight majority (n = 10, 58.8%) of providers did not find transitioning to VR difficult. Of those who did, cost was the most commonly cited barrier (n = 6). Regarding reimbursement, only 17.6% (n = 3) of providers reported the ability to bill for VR sessions. Most providers (n = 15, 88.2%) received training on their VR platform which they found beneficial. Comparing the trained and untrained groups found no significant difference in VR comfort level (p = 0.5058), the value of VR in practice (p = 0.551) or whether providers would recommend VR to others (p = 0.551), though sample sizes were small. CONCLUSIONS: In corroboration with previous research, this study demonstrates that VR is well-received by patients and providers, allowing increased patient engagement and treatment individualization. However, associated costs, including an inability to bill for this service, can present a barrier to further implementation.

METHODS: Two authors (working independently) comprehensively reviewed six databases (PubMed, Cochrane Database, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) from their dates of inception until November 2020. The predictive value of patient-reported symptoms, including otolaryngologic and general symptoms, was evaluated in adults who underwent testing for COVID-19. True-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative data were extracted from each study. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool (ver. 2). RESULTS: Twenty-eight prospective and retrospective studies were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of a change in olfaction and/or taste was 10.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.43C12.34). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8. Olfactory and/or taste changes had a low sensitivity (0.57; 95% CI, 0.47C0.66) but moderate negative (0.78; 95% CI, 0.69C0.85] and positive (0.78; 95% CI, 0.66C0.87) predictive values and a high specificity (0.91; 95% CI, 0.83C0.96). Olfactory and/or taste changes had a higher diagnostic value than the other otolaryngologic symptoms, a higher DOR and specificity, and a similar or higher diagnostic value than the other general symptoms.

Supramolecular hydrogel renders hydrogel patch with superior mechanical properties, in which NAGA and VTZ also provide self-healing and antibacterial properties, respectively. Besides, as the existence of PNIPAM, the hydrogel patch was endowed with thermal-responsiveness property, which could release actives in response to temperature stimulus. Given these excellent performances, we have demonstrated that the supramolecular hydrogel patch could significantly enhance the wound healing process in diabetes rats by downregulating the expression of inflammatory factors, promoting collagen deposition and angiogenesis.

Patients infected by SARS-CoV2 can progress to respiratory failure (RF); however, in the initial phase, they can be submitted to oxygen therapy and NIV. Such resources can produce aerosol and can cause a high risk of contagion to health professionals. Safe NIV strategies are sought, and therefore, the authors adapted diving masks to be used as NIV masks (called an Owner mask). OBJECTIVE: To assess the Owner mask safety and effectiveness regarding conventional orofacial mask for patients in respiratory failure with and without confirmation or suspicion of COVID-19. METHODS: A Brazilian multicentric study to assess patients admitted to the intensive care unit regarding their clinical, sociodemographic and anthropometric data. The primary outcome will be the rate of tracheal intubation, and secondary outcomes will include in-hospital mortality, the difference in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and PaCO(2) levels, time in the intensive care unit and hospitalization time, adverse effects, degree of comfort and level of satisfaction of the mask use, success rate of NIV (not progressing to OTI), and behavior of the ventilatory variables obtained in NIV with an Owner mask and with a conventional face mask. Patients with COVID-19 and clinical signs indicative of RF will be submitted to NIV with an Owner mask [NIV Owner COVID Group (n = 63)] or with a conventional orofacial mask [NIV orofacial COVID Group (n = 63)], and those patients in RF due to causes not related to COVID-19 will be allocated into the NIV Owner Non-COVID Group (n = 97) or to the NIV Orofacial Non-COVID Group (n = 97) in a randomized way, which will total 383 patients, admitting 20% for loss to follow-up. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized and controlled trial during the COVID-19 pandemic about the safety and effectiveness of the Owner mask compared to the conventional orofacial mask.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the PROTECT clinical study is an Italian interventional superiority study, open label, with cluster randomization, aimed at evaluating whether treatment with hydroxychloroquine can reduce the percentage of symptomatic subjects compared to observation only in a population of subjects exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus consisting of cohabitants/contacts of COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects diagnosed with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the number of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients and the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Protect study from May to September 2020. RESULTS: from May to September 2020, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the PROTECT clinical trial showed a decrease consistent with the number of news on hydroxychloroquine appearing in the national and local press, starting from the time when the first criticisms of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine were made known; the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients showed a more marked and more timely decrease. CONCLUSIONS: in the context determined by the current COVID-19 pandemic, conducting a controlled clinical trial is strongly influenced by public opinion on scientific issues. Adherence to a clinical study can become highly problematic and invalidate the possibility of answering a scientific question and the validity of a project. In the current pandemic situation, randomized controlled trials may not always be the optimal tool to reach the expected scientific evidence, due to a number of problems.

Attaining the best drugs to treat COVID-19 at the shortest possible time is one of the most critical issues in this urgent situation. Molecular docking investigation of the therapeutic potential of marketed drugs is a fast and cost-effective approach to provide a solution to this problem. The recent research efforts have led to the resolving of the 3CLpro structure as a key protease in the lifecycle of coronavirus, which could facilitate in silico evaluation of drug candidates. Herein, the similarity between the SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease and the other SARS-CoV receptors was evaluated via multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. The reported structure of the 3CLpro was considered as a target to identify potential inhibitors for treating COVID-19 using molecular docking based virtual screening protocol. Accordingly, a database of 50 synthetic compounds with various pharmacological usage such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-human immunodeficiency viruses, antimalarial, antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant including approved drugs and those undergoing clinical trials, and 40 natural compounds particularly those employed in traditional Iranian medicine was constructed. The output of multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 main protease shares a similarity of 96% with SARS-CoV. Also, the docking results indicated that the licofelone acyl glucuronide as an anti-inflammatory drug and delta-bilirubin as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent as well as kappa-carrageenan conformer, beta-D-galactopyranosyl and calycosin 7-O-glucoside as natural compounds with minimal side-effects, according to in vitro studies, are good candidates to block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Moreover, the compound 1 with the highest negative binding energy is a chemical compound that due to its favorable interactions with the 3CLpro can be identified as a representative potential drug candidate for COVID-19.

OA and T2D have common epidemiologic traits, are considered heterogenic multifactorial pathologies that develop through the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, and have common risk factors. In addition, both of these diseases often manifest in a single patient. Despite differences in clinical manifestations, both diseases are characterized by disturbances in cellular metabolism and by an insulin-resistant state primarily associated with the production and utilization of energy. However, currently, the primary cause of OA development and progression is not clear. In addition, although OA is manifested as a joint disease, evidence has accumulated that it affects the whole body. As pathological insulin resistance is viewed as a driving force of T2D development, now, we present evidence that the molecular and cellular metabolic disturbances associated with OA are linked to an insulin-resistant state similar to T2D. Moreover, the alterations in cellular energy requirements associated with insulin resistance could affect many metabolic changes in the body that eventually result in pathology and could serve as a unified mechanism that also functions in many metabolic diseases. However, these issues have not been comprehensively described.

Results Under the assumption that excess deaths in Mogadishu February-September 2020 were directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection we arrived at median estimates of October-November 2019 for the date of introduction and low R0 estimates (1.3-1.5) stemming from the early and slow rise of excess deaths.

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of tai chi practice in improving weight loss, cognitive processes and molecular mechanisms underlying balance control in older adults. METHODS Subjects aged 60-79 years were randomized to either a control group (n = 15) or a tai chi group (n = 15) for a 10-week period during COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in anthropometric characteristics, sustained attention, balance, myokines levels were assessed. RESULTS Weight increased in control group (p < 0.05), whereas it remained unchanged in tai chi group. Tai chi improved (p < 0.05) accuracy during go/no-go task, center of pressure velocity in the Romberg stance position with eyes closed under single and dual-task conditions, and increased (p < 0.05) levels of brain-derived neurotrophic actor and irisin, while in control group center of pressure velocity with eyes open tended to decrease. Changes in balance within 10 weeks were moderately correlated (p < 0.05) with changes in anthropometric characteristics, sustained attention and levels of myokines.

With the increasing accessibility of technology, a \\"flipped classroom\\" allows students to learn foundational material independently. Class time is instead devoted to in-depth skill building with instructors, promoting an active learning environment. This method of content delivery is also relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate the benefit of adopting a flipped classroom approach in teaching physical exam skills (PES) to first-year osteopathic medical students. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted comparing first-year osteopathic students in the class of 2022 (n=201), who had taken the PES course traditionally, with the class of 2023 (n=203), who experienced the flipped classroom approach. Objective metrics such as cumulative grades, objective structural clinical examination performance (OSCE), and practical exam performance were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U rank sum tests. Subjective measures such as student course evaluations were used to analyze course perceptions using independent sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. A faculty survey was administered to faculty who taught both cohorts to assess instructor attitudes toward the flipped classroom approach. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Spring 2020 quarter data was not included, given the transition of all classes to an online learning environment. RESULTS: The flipped classroom approach significantly improved objective student performance for the Fall (p=0.009) and Winter (p<0.001) student cumulative grades and the History-Taking OSCE (p=0.010). Performance on Fall and Winter practical exam scores had no significant association with the flipped classroom. General student perceptions of the course remained unchanged between both cohorts. Faculty survey results from 10 faculty members showed that six (60%) faculty members preferred the traditional classroom, while four (40%) preferred the flipped classroom. CONCLUSIONS: The flipped classroom approach showed some statistically significant improvement in student PES. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of a flipped classroom approach using skills-based assessments styles to measure student performance, with a focus on standardization of in-classroom groupwork.","output":"The flipped classroom: a novel approach to physical examination skills for osteopathic medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Refletir acerca dos desafios e perspectivas relacionados  visita do Agente de Combate s Endemias frente a pandemia por Covid-19 Mtodo: Revis?o narrativa desenvolvida a partir de estudos em artigos publicados em peridicos nacionais  luz de vrios autores, como tambm de documentos elaborados por rg?os oficiais Resultados: Reflex?o acerca dos desafios enfrentados pelos Agentes de Combate s Endemias (ACE) durante as visitas nas casas dos muncipes e as perspectivas de como executar um trabalho que impacte na diminuio das arboviroses durante vigncia da pandemia Normas tcnicas sugerem trabalho diferenciado por parte dessa categoria, alterando o contexto da visita no intradomiclio, permitindo as aes pontuais de eliminao mecanica de criadouros ou tratamento dos depsitos mais restrito ao peridomiclio Cenrio impacta substancialmente na identificao e tratamento dos depsitos no imvel, que poder restar focos nas residncias Alm disso, a comunidade tem demonstrado receio de receber o ACE com medo da contaminao pelo vrus, como tambm os profissionais pela exposio ao adentrar no peridomiclio para investigar criadouros e orientar comunidade Conclus?o: Urge que sejam pensadas outras estratgias de controle do Aedes que impactem positivamente junto s demais aes que j vem sendo realizadas na regi?o To reflect on the challenges and perspectives related to the visit of the Combat Agent to Endemics in the face of the pandemic by Covid-19 Method: Narrative review developed from studies in articles published in national journals in the light of several authors, as well as documents prepared by official agencies Results: Reflection on the challenges faced by the Endemic Combat Agent(ECA) during visits to the homes of the citizens and the perspectives on how to carry out work that impacts on the reduction of arboviruses during the duration of the pandemic Technical norms suggest differentiated work by this category, changing the context of the visit inside the home, allowing specific actions for the mechanical elimination of breeding sites or treatment of deposits more restricted to the home Scenario substantially impacts the identification and treatment of deposits in the property, which may remain outbreaks in homes In addition, the community has shown a fear of receiving ECA for fear of contamination by the virus, as well as professionals due to exposure when entering the home to investigate breeding sites and guide the community Conclusion: It is urgent that other Aedes control strategies be considered that have a positive impact with the other actions that are already being carried out in the region Reflexionar sobre los desafos y las perspectivas relacionadas con la visita del Agente de combate a las endmicas frente a la pandemia de Covid-19 Mtodo: revisin narrativa desarrollada en base a estudios en artculos publicados en revistas nacionales a la luz de varios autores, as como documentos preparados por organismos oficiales Resultados: Reflexin sobre los desafos que enfrentan los Agente para Combatir Endmicas durante las visitas a los hogares de los ciudadanos y las perspectivas sobre cmo llevar a cabo el trabajo que impacta en la reduccin de los arbovirus durante la pandemia Las normas tcnicas sugieren un trabajo diferenciado por esta categora, cambiando el contexto de la visita dentro del hogar, permitiendo acciones especficas para la eliminacin mecnica de los sitios de reproduccin o el tratamiento de depsitos ms restringidos al hogar El escenario impacta sustancialmente la identificacin y el tratamiento de los depsitos en la propiedad, que pueden seguir siendo brotes en los hogares Adems, la comunidad ha mostrado temor a recibir ACE por temor a la contaminacin por el virus, as como a los profesionales debido a la exposicin al ingresar al hogar para investigar los sitios de reproduccin y guiar a la comunidad Conclusin: es urgente que se consideren otras estrategias de control de Aedes que tengan un impacto positivo con las otras acciones que ya se estn llevando a cabo en la regin","output":"Visit of the Endemics Combat Agent in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic: challenges and perspectives Visita del Agente para Combatir Endmicas ante la pandemia de Covid-19: desafos y perspectivas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Department of Respiratory Medicine of Nippon Medical School Hospital and the Working Committee of Clinical Simulation Laboratory have held training sessions for chest tube drainage since 2007.

The present systematic review aims to provide an overview of studies that have used computational methods for drug repurposing in COVID-19. Methods We undertook a systematic search in five databases and included original articles in English that applied computational methods for drug repurposing in COVID-19. Results Twenty-one original articles utilizing computational drug methods for COVID-19 drug repurposing were included in the systematic review. Regarding the quality of eligible studies, high-quality items including the use of two or more approved drug databases, analysis of molecular dynamic simulation, multi-target assessment, the use of crystal structure for the generation of the target sequence, and the use of AutoDock Vina combined with other docking tools occurred in about 52%, 38%, 24%, 48%, and 19% of included studies. Studies included repurposed drugs mainly against non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV2: the main 3C-like protease (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Indinavir, Atazanavir, Nelfinavir, and Clocortolone), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Remdesivir and Ribavirin), and the papain-like protease (Mycophenolic acid, Telaprevir, Boceprevir, Grazoprevir, Darunavir, Chloroquine, and Formoterol). The review revealed the best-documented multi-target drugs repurposed by computational methods for COVID-19 therapy as follows: antiviral drugs commonly used to treat AIDS/HIV (Atazanavir, Efavirenz, and Dolutegravir Ritonavir, Raltegravir, and Darunavir, Lopinavir, Saquinavir, Nelfinavir, and Indinavir), HCV (Grazoprevir, Lomibuvir, Asunaprevir, Ribavirin, and Simeprevir), HBV (Entecavir), HSV (Penciclovir), CMV (Ganciclovir), and Ebola (Remdesivir), anticoagulant drug (Dabigatran), and an antifungal drug (Itraconazole).

Based on clinical data, the mesh-defect area ratio (MDAR) can lead to lower recurrence rates. Using dynamic intermittent strain (DIS) in a pig tissue model, MDAR can be modified to give a measure called grip to better assess the mechanical stability of ventral hernia repair. The focus of this experimental study is to assess the different aspects of mesh overlap (OL) and fixation only in bridging repair of ventral hernias. DIS mimics coughing actions in an ex vivo model with the repetition of submaximal impacts delivered via a hydraulically driven plastic containment. Tissue derived from pig bellies simulates a ventral hernia with varying defect sizes. MDAR is calculated from the hernia orifice and the mesh OL. Commercially available meshes were strengthened with glue, tacks, and sutures to bridge the defects. The reconstructions are strained with up to 425 dynamic impacts. The grip of each repair is assessed using MDAR modified by the strength of the fixation. The DIS classification is based on bridging of a 5 cm ventral hernia orifice with an OL of 5 cm in a sublay position. The classification discriminates meshes properties upon DIS strain. MDAR is calculated to be 9 under these conditions. Decreasing the OL or increasing the hernia orifice reduces MDAR to numbers below 9. MDAR is modified to reach GRIP. Closure of the peritoneum adds about 4 to the grip given by MDAR. The multiplying factor of a transmural suture or one tack of Securestrap? or Protack? is 0.5 times the number of tacks applied. The multiplier given by a bonding spot of Glubran? is similar to that of an Absorbatack? being 0.33. Plotting the likelihood of a bridging repair to survive more than 400 DIS impacts versus the grip estimated from the factors given above, the grip to be passed for a durable repair is 10 for Parietex Progrip?, and Dynamesh Cicat? and 25 for Dynamesh IPOM?. Clinical data previously published can be reculculated to assess MDAR and permit an estimation of the grip of the reconstruction. In these recalculations, a correlation between MDAR and long-term recurrence rates is found. A dimensionless number called grip can be calculated. The grip can be modified by fixation in a reproducible way. A higher grip can improve the durability of ventral hernia repair. We believe that a higher grip leads to lower recurrence rates in the clinical setting.","output":"Assessing the GRIP of Ventral Hernia Repair: How to Securely Fasten DIS Classified Meshes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Policies to promote social distancing can minimize COVID-19 transmission but come with substantial social and economic costs. Quantifying relative preferences among the public for such practices can inform locally relevant policy prioritization and optimize uptake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate relative utilities (ie, preferences) for COVID-19 pandemic social distancing strategies against the hypothetical risk of acquiring COVID-19 and anticipated income loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study recruited individuals living in the Missouri area from May to June 2020 via randomly distributed unincentivized social media advertisements and local recruitment platforms for members of minority racial and ethnic groups. Participants answered 6 questions that asked them to choose between 2 hypothetical counties where business closures, social distancing policy duration, COVID-19 infection risk, and income loss varied. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reweighted population-level relative preferences (utilities) for social distancing policies, subgroups, and latent classes. RESULTS: The survey had a 3% response rate (3045 of 90 320). Of the 2428 respondents who completed the survey, 1669 (75%) were 35 years and older, 1536 (69%) were women, and 1973 (89%) were White. After reweighting to match Missouri population demographic characteristics, the strongest preference was for the prohibition of large gatherings (mean preference, ?1.43; 95% CI, ?1.67 to ?1.18), with relative indifference to the closure of social and lifestyle venues (mean preference, 0.05; 95% CI, ?0.08 to 0.17). There were weak preferences to keep outdoor venues (mean preference, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.61) and schools (mean preference, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.30) open. Latent class analysis revealed 4 distinct preference phenotypes in the population: risk averse (48.9%), conflicted (22.5%), prosocial (14.9%), and back to normal (13.7%), with men twice as likely as women to belong to the back to normal group than the risk averse group (relative risk ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54 to 3.12). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study using a discrete choice experiment, public health policies that prohibited large gatherings, as well as those that closed social and lifestyle venues, appeared to be acceptable to the public. During policy implementation, these activities should be prioritized for first-phase closures. These findings suggest that policy messages that address preference heterogeneity (eg, focusing on specific preference subgroups or targeting men) could improve adherence to social distancing measures for COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"Public Preferences for Social Distancing Policy Measures to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 in Missouri"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical education worldwide, leading medical students to organize response initiatives.

However, there are fewer scientific dissertations about the risk of recurrent positive. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between SARS-COV-2 RNA positive duration (SPD) and the risk of recurrent positive. METHODS: This case-control multi-center study enrolled participants from 8 Chinese hospital including 411 participants (recurrent positive 241). Using unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses, generalized additive model with a smooth curve fitting, we evaluated the associations between SPD and risk of recurrent positive. Besides, subgroup analyses were performed to explore the potential interactions. RESULTS: Among recurrent positive patients, there were 121 females (50.2%), median age was 50 years old [interquartile range (IQR): 38-63]. In non-adjusted model and adjusted model, SPD was associated with an increased risk of recurrent positive (fully-adjusted model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, P = 0.001); the curve fitting was not significant (P = 0.286). Comparing with SPD < 14 days, the risk of recurrent positive in SPD > 28 days was risen substantially (OR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.44-6.63, P = 0.004). Interaction and stratified analyses showed greater effect estimates of SPD and risk of recurrent positive in the hypertension, low monocyte count and percentage patients (P for interaction = 0.008, 0.002, 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: SPD was associated with a higher risk of recurrent positive and especially SPD > 28 day had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of re-positive as compared with SPD < 14 day.

Nonetheless, low-dose formulations of the vaccines, which produced lower magnitude antibody and T cell responses, and serve as a possible model for waning immunity, showed breakthrough lung infection and pneumonia with B.1.617.2. Thus, as levels of immunity induced by mRNA vaccines decline, breakthrough infection and disease likely will occur with some SARS-CoV-2 variants, suggesting a need for additional booster regimens.","output":"Protective activity of mRNA vaccines against ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or midturbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (n = 380) and in the emergency department (ED) (n = 69). The percentages of positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.8% to 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI, 98.7% to 100%), respectively. The percent positive agreement increased to 90.0% (95% CI, 74.4% to 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (cycle threshold [C(T)] for the NP, 34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms, bioMrieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche Cobas 6800. The average loss of signal upon pooling was 2 to 3 C(T) values across the platforms.

We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport medium for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.","output":"Pooled Saliva Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) is a natural obstacle for drug delivery into the human brain, hindering treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as acute ischemic stroke, brain tumors, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-associated neurocognitive disorders.

Numerous variants have emerged in SARS-CoV-2 that are currently posing a serious challenge to the global vaccination effort and COVID-19 management. The evolutionary dynamics of this virus are only beginning to be explored. In this work, we have analysed 1.79 million spike glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the virus is fine-tuning the spike with numerous amino acid insertions and deletions (indels). Indels seem to have a selective advantage as the proportions of sequences with indels were steadily increasing over time, currently at over 89%, with similar trends across countries/variants. There were as many as 420 unique indel positions and 447 unique combinations of indels. Despite their high frequency, indels resulted in only minimal alteration, including both gain and loss, of N-glycosylation sites. As indels and point mutations are positively correlated and sequences with indels have significantly more point mutations, they have implications in the context of evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.","output":"Evolutionary dynamics of indels in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent changes in our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of rhinovirus infection that have occurred as a result of the improved diagnostic sensitivity provided by the reverse transcriptase PCR assays. RECENT FINDINGS Rhinovirus infection is now recognized as an important cause of acute exacerbations of asthma in school-aged children. Along with other respiratory viruses, rhinovirus infection is also a cause of exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence that rhinovirus can infect the lower airways and may be associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia in immunocompetent children and with lower respiratory tract disease in the immunocompromised host. SUMMARY The use of nucleic acid hybridization-based assays has expanded our understanding of the spectrum of clinical illness that is associated with rhinovirus infection. The prevalence of rhinovirus infection in children is high and presents a risk for coincidental detection of rhinovirus in the face of other infectious syndromes. The detection of rhinovirus from patients with new or unusual clinical syndromes does not permit the assumption that rhinovirus is playing a causal role in the illness.","output":"New developments in the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of rhinovirus infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 pandemic period, many SMEs are facing a variety of technology challenges, including teleworking, digitalization, and new business practices.

Six Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min transient endovascular occlusion of the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (M2CAO). Animals were imaged with a nanoScan(?) PET/MRI system at 1, 4, 7 and 14 days after M2CAO with a bolus injection of [(11)C]PBR28. In the infarct region, we found a significantly increased uptake of [(11)C]PBR28 on day 4, 7 and 14 compared to day 1 as well as compared to the contralateral cortex. No significant increase was detected in the contralateral cortex during the 14 days of imaging. The activation in the infarct region gradually decreased between day 4 and day 14.

The second period, the health crisis, began in March 2020 with Chiles first case of COVID-19 and escalated rapidly to include stay at home orders, traffic restrictions, and the shuttering of most businesses. We wished to evaluate the impact of these crisis periods on trauma epidemiology. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the South-East Metropolitan Health Service Trauma Registry. Trauma admissions, operative volume, and in-hospital mortality were evaluated during the crisis period and the year prior. RESULTS: The social crisis saw increased levels of trauma, both blunt and penetrating, relative to the time period immediately preceding. The health crisis saw an increase in penetrating trauma with a concomitant decline in blunt trauma. Both crisis periods had decreased levels of trauma, overall, compared to the year prior. There were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital trauma mortality. CONCLUSION: Different crises may have different patterns of trauma. Crisis periods that include extended periods of lockdown and curfew may lead to increasing penetrating trauma volume.

We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the rate of NIOS failure in subjects treated in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: Patients receiving first-line treatment NIOS for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 in the ICU of a university hospital were included in this study; laboratory data were collected upon arrival, and 28-d outcome was recorded. After propensity score matching based on Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) II score, age, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at arrival, the NIOS failure rate in subjects with COVID-19 was compared to a previously published cohort who received NIOS during hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other causes. RESULTS: A total of 85 subjects received first-line treatment with NIOS. The most frequently used methods were helmet noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula; of these, 52 subjects (61%) required endotracheal intubation. Independent factors associated with NIOS failure were SAPS II score (P = .009) and serum lactate dehydrogenase at enrollment (P = .02); the combination of SAPS II score &#8805; 33 with serum lactate dehydrogenase &#8805; 405 units/L at ICU admission had 91% specificity in predicting the need for endotracheal intubation.

BK binds to bradykinin receptor 2 (B2R) causing vascular leakage. BK is inactivated by proteolysis by the plasma carboxypeptidase B2 and N (CPB2 and CPN). CPN is constitutively active but CPB2 is generated from its zymogen, proCPB2. OBJECTIVES Determine the role of CPB2 and CPN in the regulation of vascular leakage. METHODS Mice deficient in CPB2, CPN or both (Cpb2-/- , Cpn-/- and Cpb2-/- /Cpn-/- ) were compared to wild type mice (WT) in a model of vascular leakage caused by skin irritation. In some experiments mice were pretreated with antibodies that prevent activation of proCPB2. RESULTS Skin irritation increased vascular leakage most in Cpb2-/- /Cpn-/- , less in Cpb2-/- and Cpn-/- and least in WT mice. There was no difference in vascular leakage without the challenge. Antibodies inhibiting activation of proCPB2 by plasmin, but not by the thrombin/thrombomodulin (TM) complex, increased vascular leakage to the level seen in Cpb2-/- mice. There was no change in levels of markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. CONCLUSIONS BK is inactivated by both CPB2 and CPN independently. Plasmin is the activator of proCPB2 in this model. Mice lacking both plasma carboxypeptidases have more vascular leak than ones lacking either alone.

Empirical research on casual sex is still lacking outside North-American countries, despite evidence pointing to the need to contextualize sexual interactions in their own sociocultural context. In order to better understand casual sexual relationships, these should be examined in with novel samples in other countries where a hookup culture as it is described in the North-American university campus is apparently absent. Through a qualitative study, we explored what casual sexual relationships consist of according to the perceptions of Portuguese college students (N = 35).

Methods: The drug mixtures were studied in a pure form or diluted in NaCl 0.9% or G5%. Twenty-six possible combinations of the five drugs were produced in glass vials or polypropylene syringes and stored at 25 C for 14 days. The LC method was implemented to study drugs combinations in the presence of the degradation products. The clearness and pH were also monitored.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the experience of cancer clinical trial enrollment 1 year after the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study examines initial enrollments to treatment trials and cancer control and prevention (CCP) trials conducted by the SWOG Cancer Research Network between January 1, 2016, and February 28, 2021. Participants include patients enrolled in the trials. EXPOSURES: Landmark time points reflecting the onset and the apex, respectively, of the initial COVID-19 wave (March 1 to April 25, 2020) and the winter 2020 to 2021 wave (October 4, 2020, to January 23, 2021). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This study used interrupted time-series analysis to examine enrollments over time related to the COVID-19Cderived exposure variables using negative-binomial regression. Relative risk (RR) estimates representing weekly enrollment changes compared with expected rates (had the pandemic not occurred) were derived. The numbers of enrollments lost during the pandemic were estimated. RESULTS: Overall, 29 398 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.3 [13.2] years) were enrolled (24 034 before the pandemic and 5364 during the pandemic), with 9198 patients (31.3%) aged 65 years or older, 17 199 female patients (58.6%), 3039 Black patients (10.8%), and 2260 Hispanic patients (7.9%). Most enrollments (19 451 [66.2%]) were to treatment trials. During the initial COVID-19 wave, there was a 9.0% model-estimated weekly reduction in enrollments (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93; P < .001), with effects compounding each week. Enrollment recovered thereafter, but decreased again during the winter 2020 to 2021 wave, although by only 2.0% each week (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; P < .001). Overall, during the pandemic, actual enrollments were 77.3% of expected enrollments (5364 of 6913 enrollments; 95% CI, 70.5%-85.0%; P < .001). Actual enrollments were 54.0% of expected enrollments for CCP trials (1421 of 2641 enrollments; 95% CI, 43.0%-67.0%; P < .001) and 91.0% of expected enrollments for treatment trials (3922 of 4304 enrollments; 95% CI, 81.0%-102.0%; P = .12). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, clinical trial enrollments decreased during the full year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Enrollment reductions were primarily to CCP trials, whereas, remarkably, there was not strong evidence of enrollment reductions to treatment trials.

RESULTS: At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by a second wave in early June, withRt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu had yet to experience a second wave of the disease. During the first wave, mean Rt for these areas reached 3.5-4.4, and doubling time ranged from 2.8 to 4.6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the effectiveness of control measures against COVID-19 in Korea. However, the easing of restrictions that had been imposed by the government in May 2020 facilitated a second wave in the greater Seoul area.","output":"Spatial variability in reproduction number and doubling time across two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, February to July, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, a new type of acute respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) appeared to Wuhan, China.

The genomic organization of 16244B was the same as LV but with only 63.4% nucleotide identity. The 189 nucleotide 5' non-coding region (NCR) of 16244B was distinct from the LV NCR, with good conservation (83%) only over a 43 base region immediately upstream of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Major differences were found in the region encoding the non-structural part of the ORF1a polyprotein, which shared only 47% amino acid identity over 2503 residues of the six non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded. Nsp2, thought to have a species-specific function, showed the greatest divergence, sharing only 32% amino acid identity with LV and containing 120 additional amino acids in the central region. Nsps encoded by the 5'-proximal and central regions of ORF1b had from 66 to 75% amino acid identity; however, the carboxy-terminal protein CP4 was distinct (42% identity). The ORF 1a-1b frameshift region of 16244B had 98% nucleotide identity with LV. Consistent with previous reports for North American isolates, the six structural proteins encoded were 58 to 79% identical to LV proteins.

These newer sutures were preceded by several iterations of nonabsorbable counterparts, all of which were eventually removed from the market because of complications. OBJECTIVE This review will provide a history of suture lift experience, review the published evidence on the safety and efficacy of currently available absorbable suture lift materials, and detail the clinical experience of the authors using these products. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of relevant clinical terms was performed on PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. All articles were reviewed, and further studies examined from citations of selected articles. Articles that focused on suture lifting using extensive dissection were excluded. RESULTS Twelve studies detailed the results of absorbable suture lifting largely through patient satisfaction surveys or retrospective chart review of cases. No randomized controlled studies were available. CONCLUSION Data on suture lifting are limited, with largely descriptive and retrospective case reports available in the literature entailed Oxford Centre evidence-based medicine Levels 2a to 5. Based on the available data, suture lifting appears to be safe and well tolerated, with patient satisfaction similar to or above that reported for other noninvasive lifting and tightening procedures.

An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is of utmost importance, so that patients can be isolated and treated in time, eventually preventing spread of the disease, improving the prognosis and reducing the mortality. In this paper, we have highlighted our radiological experience of dealing with the pandemic crisis of 2020 through the study of HRCT thorax, lung ultrasonography, chest X-rays and artificial intelligence (AI). RESULTS: Results of CT thorax analysis have been given in detail. We had also compared CT severity score (CTSS) with clinical and laboratory parameters. Correlation of CTSS with SpO2 values and comorbidities was also studied. We also analysed manual CTSS with the CTSS scored calculated by the AI software. CONCLUSIONS: CTSS and use of COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CORADS) result in accuracy and uniform percolation of information among the clinicians. Bed-side X-rays and ultrasonography have played a role where the patients could not be shifted for CT scan. The possibility of predicting impending or progression of hypoxia was not possible when SpO2 mapping was correlated with the CTSS.

After a pandemic, there is already new emerging mutant type of COVID-19. Starting from mutant with few mutations, the new mutant types with several mutations occur. Omicron variant is the new variant of concern that starts outbreak from Africa and might be the new problem worldwide. METHOD Pathogenesis may change as a result of molecular changes. An important possible effect of mutation is a change in binding affinity with receptor. Here, the authors performed a study to assess the effect of mutations of ACE2 receptor binding affinity in important COVID-19 variants, beta, delta and omicron variants. RESULTS According to the analysis, change of binding affinity to receptor in each studied mutated variant comparing to classical wild type SARS CoV2 is observed. CONCLUSION This exploratory research on changes in ACE2 receptor binding affinity revealed that changes do occur and may contribute to the pathophysiology. The omicron variation has a greater degree of alteration than the well-known significant variants, beta and delta. Rapid spread due to simpler transmission is envisaged as a result of affinity modification. Nevertheless, the authors only examined the affinity with bioinformatics analysis.

At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant.

We examined whether social isolation and loneliness associated with increased risk of mortality in individuals with established CVD in Taiwan. METHODS The cohort was composed of 1,267 patients with confirmed CVD aged 65 years or older followed up for up to 10 years. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association between social isolation and loneliness at baseline and mortality at follow-up by adjusting for demographic variables, health-related behaviors, and health status. RESULTS There were 593 deaths over the follow-up period. Social isolation was associated with increased risk of mortality after accounting for established risk factors (hazard ratio [HR]=1.16; 95% CI=1.06, 1.26), while loneliness was not associated with increased risk of mortality (HR=0.95; 95% CI=0.82, 1.09). When both social isolation and loneliness were included in the model, social isolation maintained an association with mortality (HR=1.16; 95% CI =1.07, 1.27). CONCLUSIONS Social isolation is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with CVD, and the effects are independent of loneliness.

DATA: We tracked daily official crime reports in a sample of 21 high-crime Bedfordshire (UK) Lower-layer Super Output areas (LSOAs). We measured time spent by two-person police foot patrols in those areas with daily GPS data from handheld devices given to officers working on overtime. We also counted proactively initiated arrests. METHODS: We used a crossover randomised controlled trial on the 21 hot spot LSOAs, each of which was randomly assigned daily to be either in a treatment condition of 15-min of patrol (as one of seven each day) or a control condition of no patrol (as one of 14 each day) for each of 90 days. We used an intention-to-treat framework to analyse the impact of patrols on the outcome measures overall, on consecutive days of assignment to the same condition, and in 100-m buffer zones around each hot spot. FINDINGS: We found that on treatment days the hot spots had 44% lower Cambridge crime harm index scores from serious violence than on control days, as well as 40% fewer incidents across all public crimes against personal victims. Statistically significant differences in lower prevalence, counts and harm of both non-domestic violent crime and robbery and other non-domestic crimes against personal victims were also found. We found no evidence of either displacement of serious crime into a 100-m buffer zone, nor any evidence of residual deterrence on no-patrol days following patrol days. We did find evidence of a cumulative effect: the largest differences in crime harm on control days were found in treatment days that came after 3 days of consecutive patrol in the same LSOA. CONCLUSIONS: Even minimal amounts of foot patrol can prevent serious violent crime across a large area, and repeated patrols over several days help even more. Our findings suggest that, to reduce both violent and other forms of crime, uniformed officers need to patrol hot spots for short amounts of times on consecutive days.","output":"Fifteen Minutes per Day Keeps the Violence Away: a Crossover Randomised Controlled Trial on the Impact of Foot Patrols on Serious Violence in Large Hot Spot Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, growing migration to the United States from countries where female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is widely practiced has caused a rise in the number of women and girls in the United States who could have potentially experienced FGM/C.

To understand what has been achieved amid these efforts, a comprehensive study from the population perspective is needed. OBJECTIVES: To determine trends in rates and racial/ethnic disparities of key access to care measures among adults in the US in the last two decades. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Data from the National Health Interview Survey, 1999C2018. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals >18 years old. EXPOSURE: Race and ethnicity: non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Rates of lack of insurance coverage, lack of a usual source of care, and foregone/delayed medical care due to cost. We also estimated the gap between non-Hispanic White and the other subgroups for these outcomes. RESULTS: We included 596,355 adults, of which 69.7% identified as White, 11.8% as Black, 4.7% as Asian, and 13.8% as Hispanic. The proportion uninsured and the rates of lacking a usual source of care remained stable across all 4 race/ethnicity subgroups up to 2009, while rates of foregone/delayed medical care due to cost increased. Between 2010 and 2015, the percentage of uninsured diminished for all, with the steepest reduction among Hispanics (?2.1% per year). In the same period, rates of no usual source of care declined only among Hispanics (?1.2% per year) while rates of foregone/delayed medical care due to cost decreased for all. No substantial changes were observed from 2016C2018 in any outcome across subgroups. Compared with 1999, in 2018 the rates of foregone/delayed medical care due to cost were higher for all (+3.1% among Whites, +3.1% among Blacks, +0.5% among Asians, and +2.2% among Hispanics) without significant change in gaps; rates of no usual source of care were not significantly different among Whites or Blacks but were lower among Hispanics (?4.9%) and Asians (?6.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Insurance coverage increased for all, but millions of individuals remained uninsured or underinsured with increasing rates of unmet medical needs due to cost. Those identifying as non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic continue to experience more barriers to health care services compared with non-Hispanic White individuals.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Access to Health Care Among Adults in the United States: A 20-Year National Health Interview Survey Analysis, 1999C2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the course of the next twelve hours, from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am, Central European time, on June 20, 2020, the eve of the summer solstice, the performance would usher its viewers from light into darkness and into the light again, outlasting the years shortest night and inviting us to contemplate our mortality, our vulnerability, and our need for vitalizing communion Sharon Smith, streaming from the south of England, cooked dinner for her daughter, attempted to hex a homemade doll effigy of Boris Johnson, then ventured out into a moonless night for a surreal encounter with an indifferent horse The HAU host would then improvise a short performanceoften an absurd song or an antic danceto mark the end of the hour, and afterward receive congratulations from their typically appreciative, sometimes bemused audience member","output":"Show Me a Good Time by Sean Patten et al.

Automated lung infections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen diagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19 from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged disease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To address these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 from pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction vector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of trained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims at generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale attention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR image dataset.

However, none has explored the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students enrolled in US universities during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies the associated factors, including habits, social and psychological support, sleep quality, and remote learning. METHODS: Between June and July 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional study through Wenjuanxing, a web-based survey platform. Participants were recruited with snowball sampling through 21 Chinese international student associations in US universities. The survey consisted of demographic questions, the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and self-constructed questions on academic performance, financial concerns, use of social media, physical exercise, and psychological support. Cut-off scores of 10 were used for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to determine the binary outcomes of depression and anxiety, respectively. Bivariant analyses and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors. RESULTS: Among 1881 participants, we found a prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 score? 10) at 24.5% and that of anxiety (GAD-7 score? 10) at 20.7%. A higher risk of depression was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, agreement to pandemics negative impacts on financial status, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of depression was associated with disagreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on academic performance and future careers, strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. In addition, a higher risk of anxiety was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, a lot of workloads, often staying up for online classes, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of anxiety was associated with the willingness and strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. CONCLUSION: This study showed a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple correlatesincluding recent exposure to traumatic events, pandemic-related financial concerns, workload, social support, remote learning, willingness to seek professional help, and sleep qualitywere identified.

METHODS Data for this retrospective analysis were derived from a database of airway assessments, management plans, and outcomes that were collected prospectively from August 2008 to May 2010 at a Level 1 academic trauma center. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the difficulty of mask ventilation and the cohorts were analyzed using univariate analysis and stepwise selection method. RESULTS A total of 1399 pre-operative assessments were completed with documentation stating that mask ventilation was attempted. Of those 1399, 124 (8.9%) patients were found to be difficult to mask ventilate. A comparison of patients with and without difficult mask ventilation identified seven risk factors for DMV: age, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, history of difficult intubation, presence of facial hair, perceived short neck and obstructive sleep apnea. Although seven risk factors were identified, no individual subject had more than four risk factors.

In Eukaryotes, the RNA-cap structure is methylated by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) at the RNA-cap N7-guanine position as well as the 2-O methyl position of the first transcribed nucleotide. In Coronaviridae, two separate enzymes (nsp14 and nsp16) perform the N7-guanine and the 2-OH methylation, respectively. One salient feature of the Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14 is that it is the only example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase known so far. Conversely, all other Nidovirales nsp16-like MTases have a canonical Rossman fold.

Physicians still confuse CKD with chronic kidney insufficiency or failure. For the wider public and health authorities, CKD evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 0.13%. Thus health authorities may consider CKD a non-issue: very few persons eventually need KRT and, for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is solved by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, KRT is the tip of the iceberg in the burden of CKD. The main burden of CKD is accelerated ageing and premature death. The cut-off points for kidney function and kidney damage indexes that define CKD also mark an increased risk for all-cause premature death. CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the factor that most increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Men and women undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality that is 10- to 100-fold higher than similar-age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by ~40 years for young persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning kidney graft. CKD is expected to become the fifth greatest global cause of death by 2040 and the second greatest cause of death in Spain before the end of the century, a time when one in four Spaniards will have CKD. However, by 2022, CKD will become the only top-15 global predicted cause of death that is not supported by a dedicated well-funded Centres for Biomedical Research (CIBER) network structure in Spain. Realizing the underestimation of the CKD burden of disease by health authorities, the Decade of the Kidney initiative for 2020C2030 was launched by the American Association of Kidney Patients and the European Kidney Health Alliance. Leading Spanish kidney researchers grouped in the kidney collaborative research network Red de Investigacin Renal have now applied for the Redes de Investigacin Cooperativa Orientadas a Resultados en Salud (RICORS) call for collaborative research in Spain with the support of the Spanish Society of Nephrology, Federacin Nacional de Asociaciones para la Lucha Contra las Enfermedades del Ri?n and ONT: RICORS2040 aims to prevent the dire predictions for the global 2040 burden of CKD from becoming true.","output":"RICORS2040: the need for collaborative research in chronic kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced around the world, new student lifestyles have had an impact on their daily behavior.

Efficacy of a heterologous boosting using one dose recombinant SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein vaccine (V-01) in inactivated vaccine-primed population was studied, aimed to restore the immunity. Methods: A randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled phase  trial was conducted in healthy people aged 18 years or older in Pakistan and Malaysia. Each eligible participant received one dose of V-01 vaccine developed by Livzon Mabpharm Inc . or placebo 3-6 months after the 2-dose primary regimen, and was monitored for safety and efficacy. The primary endpoint was protection against confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: A total of 10,218 participants were randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo. Virus-neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 419 participants. A dramatical increase (11.3-fold;128.3 to 1452.8) of neutralizing titers was measured in V-01 group at 14 days after the booster. Over the two months surveillance, vaccine efficacy was 47.8% (95%CI: 22.6 to 64.7) according to the intention-to-treat principle. The most common adverse events were transient, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fever, headache, and fatigue.

Proposed model is novel since it additionally includes parameters i.e. silent carriers, sociability of newly infected person and unregistered died coronavirus infected people along with the infection rate, suspected rate and death rate. These parameters contribute a lot to figure out the more clear model, along with essential parameters. The model takes the testing rate of suspected people into consideration and this rate varies with respect to phase of the epidemic growth. Proposed 3P-SIRD model is divided into three-phases based on the awareness and sustainability of disease. Time is divided into different periods as rate of infection and recovery fluctuates region to region. The model is tested on China data and is efficient enough to propose a model very close to their actual figures of infected people, recovered people, died and active cases. The model predicts the optimal lockdown period as 73 days for China which is very close to their actual lockdown period (77 days).

We recently discovered the clinical efficacy of Maxing shigan decoction (MXSG) in M. pneumoniae infection and designed a study to explore the mechanism of action. METHODS: Serum IL-1, IL-18, and TNF-, and transcript expression of the NLR Family, Pyrin Domain Containing Protein 3 (NLRP3) were measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 30 children with M. pneumoniae infection and 30 healthy donors. An in vitro model of M. pneumoniae infection in A549 cell culture was used to explore the curative effects and mechanisms of MXSG. Pyroptosis was measured by flow cytometry with activated caspase-1 and propidium iodide staining. IL-1, IL-18, and TNF-, and NLRP3 transcript expression were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, pro-caspase-1, IL-1, pro-IL-1, and GSDMD-N was determined by Western blotting. Experimental confirmation was performed in NLRP3-overexpressing A549 cells and in the presence of an NLRP3 inhibitor, INF39. RESULTS: M. pneumoniae infection-induced IL-1, IL-18, TNF-, and mRNA expression of NLRP3 in PBMCs and promoted pyroptosis in A549 cells. It also induced IL-1, IL-18, TNF-, and up-regulated NLRP3, ro-IL-1, Caspase-1, Pro-Caspase-1, and GSDMD-N in culture. Similar to the NLRP3 inhibitor INF39, MXSG (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL) suppressed pyroptosis induced by M. pneumoniae infection and decreased IL-1 (P < 0.001), IL-18, TNF- in culture. MXSG down-regulated NLRP3, pro-IL-1, Caspase-1, pro-Caspase-1, and GSDMD-N in infected cultures and mitigated NLRP3 overexpression-induced pyroptosis.

Adhesiogenesis is the result of increased fibrin formation, impaired fibrinolysis, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. Despite the recent advancements, the ideal anti-adhesive agent remains to be determined. To this end, we performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases to identify studies investigating the antiadhesive role of anti-VEGF agents in peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial experimental adhesion models. Fifteen studies were eligible for inclusion with a total population of 602 animals (334 rats, 180 rabbits, and 88 mice). The majority of included studies (11/15) used bevacizumab, while three studies used other anti-VEGF antibodies and one study used an anti-VEGFR-antibody. A rat model was used in nine studies, while rabbit (n = 3) or mouse (n = 3) models were used less frequently. Eleven studies used peritoneal models, three studies used pleural models, and one study used a pericardial model. The scales (n = 12) and interval (Range: 1-42 days) used for the evaluation of adhesions varied between the studies. All studies demonstrated a significant decrease in adhesion scores between the anti-VEGF and control groups up to 42 days postprocedure. VEGF blockade resulted in decreased fibrosis in four out of five studies that used peritoneal models, while the effect on pleural models depended on the pleurodesis agent and was significant between 7 and 28 days. The effect of anti-VEGF agents on anastomosis integrity depends on the dose and the model that is used (inconclusive results).Current data support the anti-adhesive role of Anti-VEGF agents in all three serosal surfaces up to 6 weeks postprocedure. Further studies are needed to confirm the anti-adhesive role of anti-VEGF agents in pleural and pericardial adhesion experimental models and investigate any effect on anastomosis integrity in peritoneal models.","output":"The anti-adhesive effect of anti-VEGF agents in experimental models: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Perspective, we build on social justice and emancipatory traditions within the field of health education, and the field's long-standing commitment to building knowledge and shared power to promote health equity, to examine lessons and opportunities for health education emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) conditioning has been hypothesized as a non-pharmacological strategy aiming to improve adaptive responses during high altitude ascent. In the recent years, IH training (IHT) has become increasingly popular among recreational and professional athletes owing to its ability to mitigate high altitude related problems. This study aimed at exploring the role of IHT in altitude acclimatization. METHODS Male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to IHT for 4 h consecutively for 5 days at 12% FiO2 under normobaric conditions. To assess the effect of IHT in hypoxic acclimatization, animals were further exposed to extreme hypoxia (EH) at 8% FiO2. Oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate and heart rate were recorded during the exposure. Oxidative stress (ROS, MDA, and 4-HNE) and histopathological examinations were studied in the lung tissue sections. Hypoxia biomarkers, HIF-1, EPO, VEGF, and BPGM were evaluated through western blotting in the lung tissue. RESULTS Assessment of the IHT showed that SpO2 levels were found to be higher in the IH trained rats with a statistical difference of p < 0.01 in the first hour of hypoxia exposure as compared to the untrained rats. There was a significantly higher (p < 0.001) generation of ROS and MDA in the untrained rats as compared to the trained rats. Lipid peroxidation markers and systemic inflammatory marker were found to be expressed at much higher level in the untrained rats. There was a higher expression of HIF-1 (1.24-fold ), VEGF (1.14-fold ) and decrease in EPO (1.43-fold ) in the untrained rats as compared to trained rats.

METHODS: We collected 184 serum samples from 70 consecutively qRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients at four participating hospitals from 23 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as the presence of new pulmonary infiltration. Serum samples were grouped by the duration after symptom onset on a weekly basis for antibody testing and analysis. The four immunoassays: Beckman SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (Beckman Test), Siemens (ADVIA Centaur?) SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) (Siemens Test), SBC COVID-19 IgG ELISA (SBC Test) and EliA SARS-CoV-2-Sp1 IgG/IgM/IgA P2 Research (EliA Test) were used for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. RESULTS: The sensitivity of all tests reached 100% after 42 days of symptom onset. Siemens Test, the only test detecting total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, had the best performance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (day 0-7: 77%; day 8-14: 95%) compared to the other 3 serological tests. All tests showed 100% specificity except SBC Test (98%). COVID-19 patients with pneumonia had significantly higher testing signal values than patients without pneumonia (all p values < 0.05, except EliA IgM Test). However, Siemens Test and SBC Test had highest probability in early prediction of the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two general hospitals during the study period of December 2020 to May 2021. Mild COVID-19 patients with risk factors for disease progression admitted to the hospitals within seven days of symptom onset were enrolled and followed until discharge or referral. Multivariate analyses for disease progression were conducted in the total and propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 778 mild COVID-19 patients were included and classified as the regdanvimab (n = 234) and supportive care (n = 544) groups. Significantly fewer patients required O(2) supplementation via nasal prong in the regdanvimab group (8.1%) than in the supportive care group (18.4%, P < 0.001). The decreased risk for O(2) support by regdanvimab treatment was noticed in the multivariate analysis of the total cohort (HR 0.570, 95% CI 0.343C0.946, P = 0.030), but it was not statistically significant in the PS-matched cohort (P = 0.057). Progression to severe disease was also significantly lower in the regdanvimab group (2.1%) than in the supportive care group (9.6%, P < 0.001).

Alternative routes to earlier diagnosis of lung cancer are needed in socioeconomically deprived communities that are disproportionately affected by poor lung cancer outcomes. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a community-based pharmacy referral service to encourage earlier symptomatic referral for chest X-rays. METHODS: Seventeen community pharmacies located in a deprived area of Wales participated between March 2019 and March 2020. Stakeholder interviews were conducted with four patients, seven pharmacy professionals and one general practitioner. Four focus groups were conducted, including one with healthcare professionals (n=6) and three with members of the public who were current and former smokers (n=13). Quantitative data regarding patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected from hospital records and patient referral questionnaires completed by pharmacists and analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data sets were analysed thematically and triangulated. RESULTS: Twelve patients used the pharmacy referral service, all of whom were male. Average length of the pharmacy consultation was 13 min, with a mean 3 days to accessing chest X-rays in secondary care. Patients experienced a mean 46-day wait for results, with no lung cancer detected. Participants found the service to be acceptable and considered the pharmacy element to be broadly feasible. Perceived barriers included low awareness of the service and concerns about the role and capacity of pharmacists to deliver the service. Facilitators included perceived approachability and accessibility of pharmacists. A well-publicised, multifaceted awareness campaign was recommended. CONCLUSIONS: A community pharmacy referral service for lung symptoms was considered an acceptable alternative pathway to symptomatic diagnosis of lung cancer in deprived communities.

Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model; these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.","output":"GIS-based spatial modeling of COVID-19 incidence rate in the continental United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to strict, nationwide, comprehensive COVID-19 protective measures, including home quarantine, all Chinese medical students began taking web-based classes beginning in the spring semester of 2020. Home quarantine, web-based classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered an increased incidence of mental health problems among medical students. Although there have been increasing amounts of literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources, such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, still need to be expanded. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess depression among medical students who are taking web-based classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the role of coping styles as mediators between resilience and depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students involving stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, was completed between March 20 and April 10, 2020. The participants responded to a self-administered, smartphone-based questionnaire, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Ego Resilience 89 Scale. Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling were used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression among the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. The regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in training) (P=.013), how well students adapted to web-based classes (P<.001), their levels of resilience (P=.04), and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P<.001). Resilience and positive coping styles were negatively related to depression (resilience: P=.04; positive coping styles: P<.001), and negative coping styles were positively related to depression (P<.001). The structural equation modeling analysis showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles (P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was found that the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have significant implications for future studies. Future studies and interventions should aim to improve resilience and promote positive coping styles.","output":"Coping Styles for Mediating the Effect of Resilience on Depression Among Medical Students in Web-Based Classes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As patients recover from COVID-19, some continue to report persisting symptoms weeks to months after acute infection. These effects have been referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). We report the case of a 38-year-old woman suffering from PASC symptoms following acute COVID-19 in October 2020. During her acute infection phase, she had a home recovery and reported her predominant symptoms as fatigue, headaches, body pain, and shortness of breath. After most of her symptoms were resolved, she continued to have periodic episodes of fatigue and headaches, along with random shortness of breath while at rest and during activities for months beyond the acute phase of the illness. She also noted the presence of brain fog, as if lacking the same clarity that she had prior to her illness. These symptoms persisted for three months before the patient underwent enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy in one-hour sessions, three times per week. This therapy was chosen based on the mechanism of action of EECP benefiting patients with ischemic cardiovascular diseases. After one week, her brain fog had improved, with shortness of breath improving after 1.5 weeks. The patient reported returning to pre-COVID health and fitness after approximately five weeks of EECP treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case of using EECP for post-COVID shortness of breath, fatigue, and brain fog.","output":"Enhanced External Counterpulsation as a Novel Treatment for Post-acute COVID-19 Sequelae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of recurrent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) neoepitopes driving T cell responses against tumors poses a significant bottleneck in the development of approaches for precision cancer therapeutics. Here, we employ a bioinformatics method, Prediction of T Cell Epitopes for Cancer Therapy, to analyze sequencing data from neuroblastoma patients and identify a recurrent anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation (ALK R1275Q) that leads to two high affinity neoepitopes when expressed in complex with common HLA alleles. Analysis of the X-ray structures of the two peptides bound to HLA-B*15:01 reveals drastically different conformations with measurable changes in the stability of the protein complexes, while the self-epitope is excluded from binding due to steric hindrance in the MHC groove. To evaluate the range of HLA alleles that could display the ALK neoepitopes, we used structure-based Rosetta comparative modeling calculations, which accurately predict several additional high affinity interactions and compare our results with commonly used prediction tools. Subsequent determination of the X-ray structure of an HLA-A*01:01 bound neoepitope validates atomic features seen in our Rosetta models with respect to key residues relevant for MHC stability and T cell receptor recognition. Finally, MHC tetramer staining of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-matched donors shows that the two neoepitopes are recognized by CD8+ T cells. This work provides a rational approach toward high-throughput identification and further optimization of putative neoantigen/HLA targets with desired recognition features for cancer immunotherapy.","output":"A Recurrent Mutation in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase with Distinct Neoepitope Conformations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study examined childrens perspectives about returning to in-person school following lockdown due to the pandemic and about mask-wearing in class, as well as the mental health of children and parents during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was part of a 2-day school simulation exercise that randomized students to different masking recommendations. Parent-report of mental health and post-simulation child-report of COVID-19-related anxiety and mask-wearing were analyzed using descriptive and multiple regression analyses. Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with older students to supplement questionnaire data. RESULTS: Of 190 students in this study, 31% were in grade 4 or lower 95% looked forward to returning to in-person school. Greater child anxiety about COVID-19 was predicted by increased parent/caregiver anxiety (=0.67; P<0.001), and lower parental educational attainment (=1.86; P<0.002). Older students were more likely than younger students to report that mask-wearing interfered with their abilities to interact with peers ((2)(1)=31.16; P<0.001) and understand the teacher ((2)(1)=13.97; P<0.001). Students in the group that did not require masks were more likely than students in the masking group to report worries about contracting COVID-19 at school ((2)(1)=10.07; P<0.05), and anticipated difficulty wearing a mask ((2)(1)=18.95; P<0.001).

Currently, no drugs have been endorsed for its treatment; in this manner, a pressing need has been developed for any antiviral drugs that will treat COVID-19. Coronaviruses require the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Protease (3CL-protease) for cleavage of its polyprotein to yield a single useful protein and assume a basic role in the disease progression. In this study, we demonstrated that punicalagin, the fundamental active element of pomegranate in addition to the combination of punicalagin with zinc (Zn) II, appear to show powerful inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS The 3CL protease assay kit was used to quantify 3CL protease action. The tetrazolium dye, MTS, was used to evaluate cytotoxicity. RESULTS Punicalagin showed inhibitory action against the 3CL-protease in a dose-dependent manner, and IC50 was found to be 6.192 g/ml for punicalagin. Punicalagin (10 g/mL) demonstrated a significant inhibitory activity toward 3CL-protease activity (p < 0.001), yet when punicalagin is combined with zinc sulfate monohydrate (punicalagin/Zn-II) extremely strong 3CL-protease activity (p < 0.001) was obtained. The action of 3CL-protease with punicalagin/Zn-II was decreased by approximately 4.4-fold in contrast to only punicalagin (10 g/mL). Likewise, we did not notice any significant cytotoxicity caused by punicalagin, Zn-II, or punicalagin/Zn-II.

Stapled end-to-side (ESA), stapled side-to-side (SSA), and handsewn anastomoses (HSA) are commonly performed techniques. There is however conflicting data on the superiority of one technique over the other. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of ESA against SSA and HSA. METHODS This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary colorectal unit. All patients who underwent an ileocolic anastomosis from October 2008 to May 2020 were included. Exclusion criteria were missing data on anastomotic technique or clinicopathological variables. Primary outcomes were AL and anastomotic bleeding (AB). Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LoS) and return of gut function. RESULTS A total of 1390 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 976 (70%) ESA, 308 (22%) SSA, and 108 (8%) HSA were performed. AL occurred in 17/1390 (1.2%) patients, and 54/1390 (3.9%) had AB. On adjusted analysis, ESA experienced a lower AL when compared with SSA (OR 4.93, p = 0.005), with a trend towards a lower AL when compared to HSA (OR 2.6, p = 0.27). There was no difference in AB between all techniques: ESA vs. SSA (OR 1.07 p = 0.84), and ESA vs. HSA (OR 0.24 p = 0.76). Both stapled techniques were associated with a shorter return to gut function compared to HSA; 3.3 vs. 4.2 days (p < 0.001). There was no difference in LoS. CONCLUSION ESA has the lowest leak rate when compared to other anastomotic techniques without any increased risk of anastomotic bleeding.","output":"Ileocolic anastomosis after right hemicolectomy: stapled end-to-side, stapled side-to-side, or handsewn?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work presents the integration of a gas-phase and particulate atmospheric emission inventory (AEI) for Argentina in high spatial resolution (0.025 degrees x0.025 degrees;approx. 2.5 km x 2.5 km) considering monthly variability from 1995 to 2020. The new inventory, called GEAA-AEIv3.0M, includes the following activities: energy production, fugitive emissions from oil and gas production, industrial fuel consumption and production, transport (road, maritime, and air), agriculture, livestock production, manufacturing, residential, commercial, and biomass and agricultural waste burning. The following species, grouped by atmospheric reactivity, are considered: (i) greenhouse gases (GHGs) - CO2, CH4, and N2O;(ii) ozone precursors - CO, NOx (NO+NO2), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs);(iii) acidifying gases - NH3 and SO2;and (iv) particulate matter (PM) - PM10, PM2.5, total suspended particles (TSPs), and black carbon (BC). The main objective of the GEAA-AEIv3.0M high-resolution emission inventory is to provide temporally resolved emission maps to support air quality and climate modeling oriented to evaluate pollutant mitigation strategies by local governments. This is of major concern, especially in countries where air quality monitoring networks are scarce, and the development of regional and seasonal emissions inventories would result in remarkable improvements in the time and space chemical prediction achieved by air quality models. Despite distinguishing among different sectoral and activity databases as well as introducing a novel spatial distribution approach based on census radii, our high-resolution GEAA-AEIv3.0M shows equivalent national-wide total emissions compared to the Third National Communication of Argentina (TNCA), which compiles annual GHG emissions from 1990 through 2014 (agreement within +/- 7.5 %). However, the GEAA-AEIv3.0M includes acidifying gases and PM species not considered in TNCA. Temporal comparisons were also performed against two international databases: Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) and EDGAR HTAPv5.0 for several pollutants;for EDGAR it also includes a spatial comparison. The agreement was acceptable within less than 30 % for most of the pollutants and activities, although a >90 % discrepancy was obtained for methane from fuel production and fugitive emissions and >120 % for biomass burning. Finally, the updated seasonal series clearly showed the pollution reduction due to the COVID-19 lockdown during the first quarter of year 2020 with respect to same months in previous years. Through an open-access data repository, we present the GEAA-AEIv3.0M inventory as the largest and more detailed spatial resolution dataset for the Argentine Republic, which includes monthly gridded emissions for 12 species and 15 stors between 1995 and 2020.","output":"High-resolution seasonal and decadal inventory of anthropogenic gas-phase and particle emissions for Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: School nurses serve a critical role in academic settings, but evidence indicates that nurses may need help transitioning their generalist nursing training to the school environment (Camp).

This paper focuses on responses to the question \\"If you had concerns about your working conditions, would you raise them?\\". In total, 227 hospital doctor respondents (25%) stated that they would not raise concerns about their working conditions. Qualitative thematic analysis was carried out on free-text responses to explore why these doctors choose to opt for silence regarding their working conditions. FINDINGS Reputational risk, lack of energy and time, a perceived inability to effect change and cultural norms all discourage doctors from raising concerns about working conditions. Apathy arose as change to working conditions was perceived as highly unlikely. In turn, this had scope to lead to neglect and exit. Voice was seen as risky for some respondents, who feared that complaining could damage their career prospects and workplace relationships.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia during April/May 2020, and 3,810 participants aged 18 years or above were recruited. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between social media use and social and emotional loneliness within separate age groups. Emotional loneliness was higher among young adults and among those who used social media several times daily. Adjusting by sociodemographic variables, using more types of social media was associated with lower social loneliness among the oldest participants, and with higher emotional loneliness among the youngest participants. Among middle-aged participants, using social media more frequently was associated with lower social loneliness. We found that the associations between social media use and loneliness varied by age.

We implemented a provider and pharmacist telehealth based PrEP program as part of the HIV, Hepatitis Specialty Telehealth Access Resource (H-START) Collaborative. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and care via telehealth, we had limited ability to collect pharyngeal or rectal swabs in clinic. We created mail-out kits including swabs and instructions for self-collection to test for rectal and pharyngeal Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis. METHODS: Kits were mailed out to patients between June 2020 and May 2021. Providers first confirmed patient comfort with self-swab collection during telehealth appointments. Kits included: an instruction sheet with visual diagrams for collection, swabs with appropriate labels; and a pre-paid envelope for patients to mail swabs back to our facility for laboratory testing. Prospective data collection included the date kits were mailed out to patients, the date of kit receipt at our facility and the test result. Charts were retrospectively reviewed to determine treatment completion. RESULTS: 54 self-swab kits were mailed to patients. 53 of the patients were male and the average age was 41.3 years old. 38 (70.3%) swabs were returned. The median time for return of swabs was 21 days (Range 2-289). Of those returned, 5 (13.1%) were positive and all 5 patients were treated for their infection. CONCLUSION: Mail-out STI testing was effective in identifying STIs for a telehealth PrEP program and for maintaining standard of care practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.

SETTINGS: The initial flood of COVID-19 patients overwhelmed an unprepared healthcare system. Different measures were taken to deal with this overburden. The effect of these measures on neurosurgical patients, as well as the effect of COVID-19 itself, has not been thoroughly studied. PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicentre, nationwide, observational retrospective study of patients who underwent any neurosurgical operation from March to July 2020. INTERVENTIONS: An exploratory factorial analysis was performed to select the most relevant variables of the sample. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of mortality and postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Sixteen hospitals registered 1677 operated patients. The overall mortality was 6.4%, and 2.9% (44 patients) suffered a perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those infections, 24 were diagnosed postoperatively. Age (OR 1.05), perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 4.7), community COVID-19 incidence (cases/10(5) people/week) (OR 1.006), postoperative neurological worsening (OR 5.9), postoperative need for airway support (OR 5.38), ASA grade 3 (OR 2.5) and preoperative GCS 3C8 (OR 2.82) were independently associated with mortality.

Results: A total of 5395/8045 (67.1%) individuals with a PHQ-9<5 on initial survey completed a second PHQ-9. These respondents had mean age 55.82 years (SD 15.17); 3546 (65.7%) reported female gender, the remainder male; 329 (6.1%) were Asian, 570 (10.6%) Black, 256 (4.7%) Hispanic, 4118 (76.3%) White, and 122 (2.3%) Native American or Alaska Native, Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, or Other. Among them, 482 (8.9%) reported 5 point or greater worsening at second survey. In fully-adjusted models for increase in symptoms, largest odds ratio associated with social media use was observed for Snapchat (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.96), Facebook (aOR 1.42, 1.10-1.81), and TikTok (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.87). Conclusions and Relevance: Among survey respondents who did not report depressive symptoms initially, social media use was associated with greater likelihood of subsequent increase in depressive symptoms after adjustment for sociodemographic features and news sources. These data cannot elucidate the nature of this relationship, but suggest the need for further study to understand the impact of social media use.","output":"Association between social media use and self-reported symptoms of depression in US adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed many things in the way we teach. We are used to learning through video conferencing, e-learning, and virtual experiments such as PhET interactive simulation. However, the experience gained from an experiment in a real condition is still interesting to do and cannot be replaced by a virtual experiment. Therefore, we investigated several remote instrumentation models and technologies that were more effective and more efficient to develop. The results of our research show that the Node.js runtime environment is the most appropriate, effective choice because Node.js is based on open source, so that various microprocessors and various OS support it. We run Node.js on a low-cost device, Raspberry PI 4, with Ubuntu 20.10, a very familiar open-source OS. In addition, Node.js has a feature to communicate with the hardware, making it very easy to connect to experimental physics instrumentation. Because Node.js is based on javascript, it is indeed very suitable for developing web-based applications. We succeeded to carry out initial development through measurements on the magnetic field generated by a coil. Students can interactively control the movement of the sensor and see it in real-time during experiments of measuring the strength of the magnetic field generated by a coil.

While initial reporting focused mainly on lung involvement, the ongoing pandemic showed that multiple organs can be involved, and prognosis is largely influenced by multi-organ involvement. Our aim was to obtain nationwide retrospective population-based data on hospitalizations with COVID-19 and AKI. Materials & Methods We performed a query of G-DRG data for the year 2020 via the Institute for the hospital remuneration system (Institut fuer das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus GmbH, InEK) data portal and therefore included hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of RT-PCR proven COVID-19 infection, aged over 15 years. We included hospitalizations with acute kidney injury (AKI) stages 1 to 3. Age-specific and age-standardized hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates (ASR) per 100.000 person years were calculated, with the German population of 2011 as the standard. Results In 2020, there were 16.776.845 hospitalizations in German hospitals. We detected 154.170 hospitalizations with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 diagnosis. The age-standardized hospitalization rate for COVID-19 in Germany was 232,8 per 100.000 person years (95% CI 213,6-233,9). The highest proportion of hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 were in the age group over 80 years. AKI was diagnosed in 16.773 (10,9%) of the hospitalizations with COVID-19. The relative risk of AKI for males was 1,49 (95%CI 1,44-1,53) compared to females. 43 Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was performed in 3.443 hospitalizations, 20,5% of the hospitalizations with AKI. For all hospitalizations with COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality amounted to 19,7% (n= 30.300). The relative risk for in-hospital mortality was 3,87 (95%CI 3,80-3,94) when AKI occurred. The age-standardized hospitalization rates for COVID-19 took a bimodal course during the observation period. The first peak occurred in April (ASR 23,95 per 100.000 person years (95%CI 23,58-24,33)), hospitalizations peaked again in November 2020 (72,82 per 100.000 person years (95%CI 72,17-73,48)). The standardized rate ratios (SRR) for AKI and AKI-related mortality with the overall ASR for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the denominator, actually decreased throughout the observation period and remained lower in autumn than they were in spring. In contrast to all COVID-19 hospitalizations, the SRR for overall mortality in COVID-19 hospitalizations diverged from hospitalizations with AKI in autumn 2020. Discussion Our study for the first time provides nationwide data on COVID-19 related hospitalizations and acute kidney injury in Germany in 2020. AKI was a frequent complication and associated with high mortality. We observed a less pronounced increase in the ASR for AKI-related mortality during autumn 2020.

Methods: Research on National decrees specific for the pandemic was carried out. The stroke pathways of four Italian regions from North to South, such as Lombardy, Veneto, Lazio and Campania, were analysed before and after the pandemic outbreak. Findings: On 29 February 2020, the Italian Minister of Health issued national guidelines on how to address the COVID-19 emergency. Stroke management was affected and required changes, basically resulting in the need to prioritise the ongoing COVID-19 emergency. In the most affected regions, the closure of departments and hospitals led to a complete reorganisation of previously functioning stroke networks. With the closure of several Stroke Units and Stroke Centres, the transportation time to hospital lengthened significantly, especially for the outlying populations. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has been spreading rapidly in Italy and placing an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems. In response to this, political and healthcare decision-makers worked together to develop and implement efforts to sustain the national healthcare system while fighting the pandemic. Stroke care pathways changed during the pandemic and different organisational models were applied in the most affected regions.

Methods All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition.

Microbiology findings are typically similar to other nosocomial infections, with differences dependent on microbiology selection due to antibiotic pressure or the resident flora. However, this is poorly understood in the critical care setting. We therefore aimed to assess the incidence, epidemiology and microbiology of SSI and its association with outcomes in patients with severe peritonitis in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We prospectively studied 305 consecutive patients admitted to our surgical ICU from 2010 to 2014 with a diagnosis of secondary or tertiary peritonitis. We collected the following data: SSI diagnosis, demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score, type of surgery, microbiology, antibiotic treatment and outcomes. Microbiological sampling was done by means of swabs. RESULTS: We identified 269 episodes of SSI in 162 patients (53.1 %) aged 64.4  14.3 years, of which 200 episodes occurred in men (64.6 %). The mean APACHE II and SAPS II scores were 19.7  7.8 and 36.5  16.1 respectively. The mean ICU and hospital stays were 19.8  24.8 and 21.7  30 days respectively. Pseudomonas spp. (n = 52, 19.3 %), Escherichia coli (n = 55, 20.4 %) and Candida spp. (n = 46, 17.1 %) were the most frequently isolated microorganisms, but gram-positive cocci (n = 80, 29.7 %) were also frequent. Microorganisms isolated from SSIs were associated with a higher incidence of antibiotic resistance (64.9 %) in ICU patients, but not with higher in-hospital mortality. However, patients who suffered from SSI had longer ICU admissions (odds ratio = 1.024, 95 % confidence interval 1.010C1.039, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SSI in secondary or tertiary peritonitis requiring ICU admission is very high. Physicians may consider antibiotic-resistant pathogens, gram-positive cocci and fungi when choosing empiric antibiotic treatment for SSI, although more studies are needed to confirm our results due to the inherent limitations of the microbiological sampling with swabs performed in our research.

Conclusions : Although the number of articles included is limited, the overall synthesis suggests that COVID-19-related lifestyle changes, such as increased screen time, may negatively affect sleep health. However, other unidentified factors may have contributed to these results and warrant further research. Nonetheless, community leaders must consider the long-term consequences of the pandemic and implement initiatives to address sleep challenges due to the intricate connection between sleep and well-being.","output":"Has increased screen time affected sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Patients undergoing surgery are a group at risk of exposure. Also, patients with ongoing infection undergoing surgery may be more susceptible to developing complications. There is no significant data on surgical safety in the pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS Observational study based in a prospective database of urological oncological surgery. Data were obtained during the 2020 mandatory confinement period compared to the same period in 2019. The records were reviewed 45 days post-surgery. The objective was to compare surgical morbidity and mortality during the pandemic versus an average year in urological cancer surgery. RESULTS During confinement period (2020), 85 patients underwent uro-oncology surgery, while in 2019, during the same period, 165. The Clavien-Dindo morbidity 3 in 2020 was 2.3% (n=2), and in 2019, it reached 6% (n=10). In 2020, 9 patients were readmitted (10.5%). One patient (1.1%) was re-interfered, with a perioperative mortality of 1.1%. In 2019, 21 patients (12.7%) were readmitted. Seventeen patients (10.3%) were re-interfered, with a perioperative mortality of 1.8%. The median number of days hospitalized was 2 (IQR=2) in 2020 and 3 (IQR=3) in 2019. No significant differences were found in population or morbimortality, except for reoperation in a normal year. CONCLUSION Postoperative morbidity and mortality reported are lower than those shown in the literature concerning COVID-19 and similar to that historically reported by our centers. This study suggests that it is safe to operate patients with urological cancer following the appropriate protocols during a pandemic.","output":"Is Uro-oncological Surgery Safe During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases and requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID- 19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels). Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the pandemic.

Use of activity modification in treatment studies has varied widely and the impact of those recommendations has not been directly investigated or compared. The purpose of this study was to assess (1) the feasibility of using pain-guided activity modification during treatment for patellar tendinopathy and (2) if our outcome measures are responsive to changes in tendon health over the course of treatment. METHODS: This was an unblinded, randomized two-arm pilot and feasibility study randomized clinical trial with parallel assignment, conducted in Newark, DE. Individuals between the ages of 16 and 40 years old with patellar tendinopathy were included. Participants were randomly assigned to a pain-guided activity (PGA) or pain-free activity (PFA) group using a spreadsheet-based randomization scheme. All participants received standardized treatment using a modified version of the heavy-slow resistance protocol 3/week for 12 weeks. For the first 6 weeks, the PGA group used the Pain-Monitoring Model to guide activity outside of treatment and the PFA group was restricted from running, jumping, or activities that provoked their patellar tendon pain. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, enrollment, randomization, compliance, and retention percentages. Clinical evaluations were conducted at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks to assess symptom severity, psychological factors, tendon morphology and mechanical properties, lower extremity function, and quadriceps muscle performance. RESULTS: In a ~ 13-month period, 108 individuals were screened, 47/108 (43.5%) were eligible for participation, and 15/47 (32.0%) of those were enrolled (9 PGA, 6 PFA). The recruitment rate was 1.15 participants/month. The mean  SD compliance with treatment was PGA: 86.1  13.0% and PFA: 67.1  30.7%. There was one missed evaluation session and two adverse events, which were not due to study interventions. Changes exceeding the smallest detectable change were observed for at least one outcome in each domain of tendon health. CONCLUSIONS: Use of pain-guided activity modification during exercise therapy for patellar tendinopathy was found to be feasible, and the proposed outcome measures appropriate. Computer-based allocation concealment, blinding of evaluators, and greater recruitment of high-level athletes should be implemented in future trials.

Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trials have demonstrated safety/efficacy against COVID-19 and prevented hospitalizations and deaths;however, most excluded ptcpts with cancer. We present phase 3 tozinameran mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trial results from ptcpts with a cancer history at baseline, either ongoing or not, per the Charlson Comorbidity Index and up to 6 months of follow-up. Methods: Between Jul 2020-Jan 2021, 46429 ptcpts 12 y at 152 sites in 6 countries were randomized in a placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial of 2-dose tozinameran, showing 95% protection against COVID-19 and favorable safety (Polack et al NEJM, Dec 2020). After emergency use authorization, ptcpts were allowed to unblind and placebo recipients received vaccine. Data prior to unblinding for crossover up to 13 Mar 2021 are presented for ptcpts 16 y for safety and 12 y for efficacy. Adverse event (AE) data are controlled for follow-up time before unblinding and reported as incidence rate (IR) per 100-person-y of follow-up. Results: Of ptcpts 16 y, 1647 had a prior diagnosis of cancer and were not on active immunosuppressive treatment (755 M;892 F;median age 66 y [range 22-91]). Most common solid cancers included breast (n=458), prostate (n=360), and melanoma (n=210). AEs were reported at IRs of 94.0 (vaccine) and 49.3 (placebo) per 100-person-y;most common AEs were reactogenicity events (injection-site pain [IR: 40.2 vaccine;4.2 placebo];fatigue [IR: 21.4 vaccine;7.6 placebo];pyrexia [IR: 19.8 vaccine;0.7 placebo]). 1 vaccine ptcpt withdrew due to a vaccine-related AE. No vaccine-related deaths were reported. Among ptcpts 12 y with cancer, 3 vaccine and 27 placebo recipients developed COVID-19 from 7 days post-Dose 2;vaccine efficacy (VE) was 89.7% (95% CI 66.5-98.0%). This compares favorably with overall VE of 91.1%. Updated results will be presented. Conclusions: Tozinameran has similar efficacy/safety in ptcpts with cancer as in the overall population.

However, whether they are suitable for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to compare the agreement and acceptance of virtual home visits and in-person home visits in PD patients. METHODS: This was a paired, single center, noninferiority trial. Participants received a virtual home visit and an in-person home visit simultaneously. A home visit checklist was built for standardization visits. The content was divided into three parts: domestic habits (57 items), bag exchange procedures (56 items), and exit site care (53 items). Satisfaction questionnaires for both patients and nurses were designed to assess attitudes toward home visits and socioeconomic effects. RESULTS: A total of 30 PD patients were enrolled in a single center. The information collected from virtual home visits and in-person home visits was found to be highly consistent. The perfect agreement was found in 52/57, 49/56, and 44/53 items (Cohen's kappa 0.81C1.00), substantial agreement in 4/57, 7/56, and 8/53 items (Cohen's kappa 0.61C0.80).

In recent years however, several examples of box C/D snoRNAs regulating different levels of gene expression including transcript stability and splicing have been reported. These regulatory interactions typically require direct binding of the target but do not always involve the guide region. Supporting these new box C/D snoRNA functions, high- throughput RNA-RNA interaction datasets detect many interactions between box C/D snoRNAs and messenger RNAs. To facilitate the study of box C/D snoRNA functionality, we created snoGloBe, a box C/D snoRNA machine learning target predictor based on a gradient boosting classifier and considering snoRNA and target sequence and position as well as target type. SnoGloBe convincingly outperforms general RNA duplex predictors and PLEXY, the only box C/D snoRNA-specific target predictor available. The study of snoGloBe human transcriptome-wide predictions identifies enrichment in snoRNA interactions in exons and on exon-intron junctions. Some specific snoRNAs are predicted to target groups of functionally-related transcripts on common regulatory elements and the exact position of the predicted targets strongly overlaps binding sites of RNA-binding proteins involved in relevant molecular functions. SnoGloBe was also applied to predicting interactions between human box C/D snoRNAs and the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, identifying known and novel interactions. Overall, snoGloBe is a timely new tool that will accelerate our understanding of C/D snoRNA targets and function.","output":"The snoGloBe interaction predictor enables a broader study of box C/D snoRNA functions and mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many non-coding RNAs with known functions are structurally conserved: their intramolecular secondary and tertiary interactions are maintained across evolutionary time.

The study objective was to systematically review evidence on the relationship between health insurance literacy and health care utilization. METHODS: Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Cochrane Library, and reference lists of published literature were searched in August 2019. Quantitative, qualitative, and intervention studies that assessed the association of health insurance literacy as the exposure and health care utilization as the outcome were identified, without language or date restrictions. Outcomes were independently assessed by 2C3 reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies including a total of 62,416 subjects met inclusion criteria: three interventional trials, two mixed-methods studies, and sixteen cross-sectional studies. Ten of thirteen preventive care studies suggested that higher health insurance literacy was associated with greater utilization of primary care and other preventive services. Eight of nine studies of care avoidance demonstrated that individuals with lower health insurance literacy were more likely to delay or avoid care. A few studies had mixed results regarding the utilization of emergency department, inpatient, and surgical care. DISCUSSION: The emerging literature in this area suggests that health insurance literacy is an important factor that can enable effective utilization of health care, including primary care and preventive services. However, the literature is limited by a paucity of studies using validated tools that broadly measure health insurance literacy (rather than testing knowledge of specific covered services). Improving health insurance literacy of the general public and increasing plain language communication of health insurance plan features at the point of health care navigation may encourage more effective and cost-conscious utilization.

We included 354 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April and June 2020, of which 146 were ACEI/ARB users and 208 were non-ACEI/ARB users. Controlling for confounders, we conducted multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching (PSM) and Inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW) for high-risk patient subsets. RESULTS: Compared to non-ACEI/ARB users, ACEI/ARB users had an eight-fold higher risk of developing critical or severe COVID-19 (OR = 8.25, 95%CI = 3.32-20.53); a nearly 7-fold higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 6.76, 95%CI = 2.88-15.89) and a nearly 5-fold higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (OR = 4.77,95%CI = 2.15-10.55). Patients with diabetes, hypertension, and/or renal disease had a five-fold higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 5.40,95%CI = 2.0-14.54]. These results were confirmed in the PSM and IPSW analyses. CONCLUSION: In general, but especially among patients with hypertension, diabetes, and/or renal disease, ACEI/ARB use is associated with a significantly higher risk of severe or critical COVID-19 disease, and ICU care.","output":"Severity of COVID-19 infection in ACEI/ARB users in specialty hospitals: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing cyber security is very necessary and has attracted considerable attention from academy and industry organizations worldwide.

To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications.

Of 679 patients seen in May 2020, 512 (75.4%) were virtual (267 [52.1%] by telephone and 245 [47.9%] by video), and 359 (70%) responded to the survey. The majority of patients (74%) were satisfied with their virtual visit, but they were more likely to be satisfied if their visit was over video rather than phone. They preferred an in-person visit if they were meeting a doctor for the first time, and patients who required a language interpreter were significantly less satisfied with virtual care.

METHODS: A total of 50 non-smoking, healthy and physically inactive students were recruited from campus in Beijing, China, and randomly assigned to 4 groups: low-intensity continuous training with blood flow restriction (LICT-BFR, n = 13), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT, n = 13), high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n = 12), and no exercise control (n = 12), the intervention continued for 8 weeks. Body composition and aerobic capacity were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Exercise groups reached significant improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max, p < 0.01) and a decrease in body fat percentage (p < 0.05) comparing to the control group. The fat mass and visceral fat area reduced significantly (p < 0.05) with a muscle mass growth (p < 0.05) in the LICT-BFR and MICT groups comparing to the control group. Changes of fat and muscle mass were trivial in the HIIT group (p = 0.842, p = 0.247). CONCLUSION: All three exercise programs can improve the CRF of college students, with LICT-BFR has the most profound effects, and MICT is more beneficial for body composition improvement than other programs.

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 210 consecutive SOTRs hospitalized with COVID-19 in 12 Spanish centers from 21 February to 6 May 2020. Data pertaining to demographics, chronic underlying diseases, transplantation features, clinical, therapeutics, and complications were collected. The primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with these unfavorable outcomes. Males accounted for 148 (70.5%) patients, the median age was 63 years, and 189 (90.0%) patients had pneumonia. Common symptoms were fever, cough, gastrointestinal disturbances, and dyspnea. The most used antiviral or host-targeted therapies included hydroxychloroquine 193/200 (96.5%), lopinavir/ritonavir 91/200 (45.5%), and tocilizumab 49/200 (24.5%). Thirty-seven (17.6%) patients required ICU admission, 12 (5.7%) suffered graft dysfunction, and 45 (21.4%) died. A shorter interval between transplantation and COVID-19 diagnosis had a negative impact on clinical prognosis. Four baseline features were identified as independent predictors of intensive care need or death: advanced age, high respiratory rate, lymphopenia, and elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase.

International institutions are now exploring ways to help their member states recover from the health crisis, and foster the resilience of their economies to future crises. As far as trade is concerned, institutions that deal primarily with trade matters are making effort to help their member states foster the resilience of their trade performance to future shocks. In this context, the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is the only international organization that deals with the global rules of trade between nations, has organized a series of events since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has now planned to hold in September 2021 the 2021 WTO Public Forum whose theme is \\"Trade Beyond COVID-19: Building Resilience\\". The present paper aims to contribute to this debate by examining the effect of development aid, i.e., the so-called official development aid, in particular its Aid for Trade (AfT) component, on export resilience. The resilience of exports refers to the capacity of countries' aggregate exports to resist to shocks, whether environmental or external shocks. The core argument of the analysis is that development aid would affect export resilience through its effect on productive capacities. The analysis covers 93 developing countries over the period 2002-2018. The findings indicate that total development aid flows, including both AfT flows and NonAfT flows exert a positive effect on export resilience. Among AfT components, AfT for productive capacities appears to exert a higher positive effect on export resilience than AfT for economic infrastructure and AfT for trade policy and regulation. In addition, development aid (whatever the aid variable considered) exerts the highest positive effect on export resilience in countries (such as Least developed countries - LDCs) that have the lowest level of productive capacities. These findings highlight the need for donor-countries to supply higher development aid flows, in particular AfT flows to countries such as LDCs that have low levels of productive capacities.","output":"Development Aid and Export Resilience in Developing Countries: A Reference to Aid for Trade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes the current views of the pathogenesis of virus infections of the nervous system, with particular attention to certain aspects of virus-host interactions.

There is a corresponding diversity in the pathological lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) produced by acute virus infection. Infection can be pictured as a race between virus and host defenses, where many factors, acting through different mechanisms, can influence the outcome. Outcome is always determined by multiple virus and host variables, although single variables can be independently studied under experimentally controlled conditions in the laboratory.

As severe forms of COVID-19 in adults included an aberrant systemic immune response, children with chronic systemic inflammatory diseases were cautiously followed. No evidence for a specific susceptibility was identified in this pediatric population. European and US Pediatricians started to notice cases of myocarditis, sharing some features with toxic shock syndrome, Kawasaki disease, and macrophage activation syndrome in otherwise healthy patients. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS) have designated this new entity in the US and Europe, respectively. The spectrum of severity ranged from standard hospitalization to pediatric intensive care unit management. Most patients had a clinical history of exposure to COVID-19 patients and/or SARS-COV2 biological diagnosis. Clinical presentations include fever, cardiac involvement, gastro-intestinal symptoms, mucocutaneous manifestations, hematological features, or other organ dysfunctions. The temporal association between the pandemic peaks and outbreaks of PIMS seems to be in favor of a post-infectious, immune-mediated mechanism.

We previously showed that transgenic, unanchored poly-ubiquitin is not problematic in Drosophila melanogaster. In the fruit fly, free chains exist in various lengths and topologies and are degraded by the proteasome; they are also conjugated onto other proteins as one unit, eliminating them from the free ubiquitin chain pool. Here, to further explore the notion of unanchored chain toxicity, we examined when free poly-ubiquitin might become problematic. We found that unanchored chains can be highly toxic if they resemble linear poly-ubiquitin that cannot be modified into other topologies. These species upregulate NF-&#954;B signaling, and modulation of the levels of NF-&#954;B components reduces toxicity. In additional studies, we show that toxicity from untethered, linear chains is regulated by isoleucine 44, which anchors a key interaction site for ubiquitin. We conclude that free ubiquitin chains can be toxic, but only in uncommon circumstances, such as when the ability of cells to modify and regulate them is markedly restricted.","output":"Isoleucine 44 Hydrophobic Patch Controls Toxicity of Unanchored, Linear Ubiquitin Chains through NF-B Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Older persons have been identified as a vulnerable population with respect to the novel coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19. Aiming to flatten the curve a strict Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia. Older adults with cognitive frailty are prone to physical, cognitive and psychosocial decline. This study aims to compare physical activity patterns, psychological wellbeing and coping strategies of older persons with cognitive frailty in the WE-RISE trial (intervention versus control) throughout this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a sub-analysis of the ongoing WE-RISE randomized controlled trial. This study included 42 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above, with cognitive frailty, stratified into intervention (n=21) and control (n=21) groups who are receiving a multi-domain intervention and usual care, respectively, within the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Phone call interviews were conducted during the MCO period. Physical activity patterns were assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Psychological wellbeing was assessed using Flourishing Scale (FS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) assessed coping strategies. Data were analysed descriptively and with independent samples t-test. RESULTS: The WE-RISE intervention group had significantly higher levels of estimated resting energy expenditure (MET) for walking activity (I:=1723.1780.7;C:=537.4581.9)(p<0.001), moderate activity (I:=1422.81215.1;C:=405.7746.9)(p=0.002) and total physical activity (I: =3625.93399.3;C:=994.61193.9)(p=0.002). The intervention group was also significantly more independent in functional activities (=1.761.73) as compared to the control group (=5.578.31) (p<0.05). Moreover, significant higher self-perception of living a meaningful life and feeling respected (p<0.05) was demonstrated in regard to psychological well-being in the intervention group. Regarding coping strategies, the intervention group relied significantly on the domains of religion (I:=6.430.99;C:=6.091.09)(p<0.05) and planning (I:=4.810.75; C:=4.041.28)(p<0.05) whilst the control group relied on humour (C:=3.141.19; I:=2.380.74)(p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Participants of the WE-RISE intervention group were more physically active, functionally independent and had higher self-perceived social-psychological prosperity regarding living a meaningful life and feeling respected; whilst both groups relied on positive coping strategies during the MCO. These results indicate that it is vital to ensure older persons with cognitive frailty remain physically active and preserve their psychosocial wellbeing to be more resilient in preventing further decline during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Physical Activity Patterns, Psychosocial Well-Being and Coping Strategies Among Older Persons with Cognitive Frailty of the WE-RISE Trial Throughout the COVID-19 Movement Control Order"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of solid organ transplant (SOT) patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic remains unclear.

While evolution is central to all biological processes, the key stage for competition and selection is reproduction, which encompasses various events from courtship and mating to fertilization and pregnancy. In humans, IVF is used to aid the intrinsically inefficient reproduction by coitus, and in several countries, the proportion of children born after IVF is increasing. While IVF is an enabling technology for infertile patients, it also circumvents reproductive barriers and changes selection pressures. This grand theme review describes the systematic differences between IVF and coitus in selection pressures on reproducing cells, individuals and populations. At the cellular unit of selection, for example, IVF favours different traits in spermatozoa (fast swimmers over short distances) than coitus does (forward mobility over longer distances). Similarly, a male with low sperm quality and a female who decides to delay her first birth to an advanced age, can both increase their reproductive fitness by IVF compared to if reproduction by coitus is their only option. In as much as delayed reproduction is a cultural trait, IVF thus enables cultural practices that may in their turn affect human evolution. A main point in this review is to discuss the interactive effects of biological and cultural traits in the context of IVF, and how they act in concert as drivers towards increased demand for IVF. It is not the aim of this review to argue against IVF, which no doubt is a major medical advancement, but rather to examine IVF and human evolution from a broad perspective, including potential longer-term impacts. Since IVF is a young technology, the empirical data indicative of evolutionary effects of IVF in humans are sparse. In general, we argue that IVF facilitates the redirection of resources away from reproduction in humans, since reproduction by IVF bypasses some of the resource-demanding processes that reproduction by coitus entails. Hence, IVF sets the evolutionary stage for a human species increasingly reliant on, and adapted to, technological means of reproduction.","output":"IVF and human evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Patients with 2019-nCoV infection have a high risk to develop venous thrombotic events. Several guidelines recommend the use of either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins in preventing thrombotic events in these patients. However, results from clinical studies, so far published, reached controversial conclusions on heparin efficacy in this kind of patients since the incidence of venous thromboembolism remains high despite prophylaxis. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of heparins and their efficacy and safety in SARS-CoV-2 medical ward-patients. Moreover, anatomical findings and ongoing trials are also reported. Finally, this narrative review tries to explain why heparins fail to prevent venous thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for the most relevant published studies on heparins and 2019-nCoV infected patients using the MEDLINE electronic database in the period between January and December 2020. Articles were preliminarily defined as eligible if they: a) were in English language, b) enrolled 250 or more medical ward-patients and 100 or more ICU-patients, c) reported results on patients treated with heparins in a percentage of at least 70% and d) performed an objectively confirmed diagnosis of VTE. RESULTS: Data from medium to large scientific studies show that the incidence of venous thrombotic events in medical ward-patients with SARS-CoV-2 vary between 0% and 8.3%, while this rate is higher, from 6.2% to 49%, in Intensive Care Unit-patients. However, heparins reduce the mortality rate in these patients of about 50%. Histological findings show that thrombosis could affect capillaries, main and small-mid-sized vessels, and it is associated with diffuse alveolar damage. CONCLUSIONS: Heparins have anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, which may be of help in reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Failure of heparins at prophylactic dosages in preventing VTE, especially in ICU-patients, could be due to the severity of the disease.

Geographical clustering of counties with high COVID-19 mortality, high chronic disease prevalence and high social vulnerability was found, especially in southern USA. CONCLUSION: Some counties are experiencing a confluence of epidemics from COVID-19 and chronic diseases in the context of social disadvantage. Such counties are likely to require enhanced public health and social support.","output":"Social inequality and the syndemic of chronic disease and COVID-19: county-level analysis in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The filtering facepiece operates through filtration without the ability to kill the viruses. If the filtration might be combined with antiviral agents simultaneously in the masks, this would be much more efficient not only during the use of these masks but also against cross-infection after being discarded. For centuries it is well known that sodium chloride (NaCl) contributes to inhibit pathogens on various occasions. If aerosol with infectious agents reaches the surface of the filtering facepiece, coated with hypertonic saline, they become attracted by hygroscopic salt crystals. Proteins and nucleic acids lose their structural integrity and become inactivated concerning their infectious properties. We provide further evidence for cell growth inhibition with hypertonic saline in yeast cells comprising a defending cell wall. Proliferation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, i.e. above 50g/L, yeast cell proliferation was completely blocked. At a NaCl concentration of 100g/L, even decomposition of the original inoculated organisms was observed. Therefore, we conclude that hypertonic saline coated filtering facepiece might strongly reduce the numbers of infectious particles on their surfaces and thus protect mask carriers efficiently from infections.","output":"Improved protection of filtering-facepiece through inactivation of pathogens by hypertonic salt solutions C a possible COVID-19 prevention device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The consequences of SARS-CoV2 reinfections for patients, healthcare workers and society are unclear. We reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological characteristics of patients re-infected with genetically distinct strains of SARS-CoV2 identified by Whole Virus Genome Sequencing (WvGS). METHODS: Cases were selected based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, clinical resolution, a negative interim test and a subsequent positive nasopharyngeal swab. Positive samples were prepared for sequencing by cDNA synthesis, tiled-PCR following the ARTIC protocol and amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq platform. Raw reads were mapped to the reference sequence using bowtie and Samtools was used for variants calling and to generate the consensus sequences. Comparative sequence analysis was conducted by phylogenetic inference maximum likelihood method with RAxML using the multiple sequence aligned by MAFFT. Clades and variants were assigned respectively using Nextstrain and Pangolin COVID-19 lineage assigner (Figure 1). The clinical, radiological and laboratory data were collected from patient medical notes and laboratory information system. RESULTS: Two cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were detected by RT-PCR (patient 1 and 2). C(T) values and strain variants are presented in Table 1. The time between detection of the first and second infection was 67 and 270 days respectively. WvGS confirmed that the second episodes were due to a genetically distinct strain of SARS CoV2. These reflected the dominant contemporaneous variants in circulation. Both patients were immunocompromised from co-morbidities and medications. First and subsequent infections were minimally symptomatic. Both cases were associated with known hospital outbreaks. They passed away within 2 weeks of the second infection of unrelated causes. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Two patients in this study were diagnosed with a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection confirmed by WvGS. A common factor in these cases was immunocompromise. Where a previously infected patient test shows a new positive or an unexpected reduction in C(T) value is observed, we recommend individual risk assessment to determine the timing of discontinuation of isolation and infection control precautions.

Although underappreciated, many gut \\"anaerobes\\" are able to respire using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. The oxygen continually released from gut epithelial cells creates an oxygen gradient from the mucus layer to the anaerobic lumen [L. Albenberg et al., Gastroenterology 147, 1055-1063.e8 (2014)], with oxygen available to bacteria growing at the mucus layer. Here, we show that Bacteroides species are metabolically and energetically robust and do not mount stress responses in the presence of 0.10 to 0.14% oxygen, defined as nanaerobic conditions [A. D. Baughn, M. H. Malamy, Nature 427, 441-444 (2004)]. Taking advantage of this metabolic capability, we show that nanaerobic growth provides sufficient oxygen for the maturation of oxygen-requiring fluorescent proteins in Bacteroides species. Type strains of four different Bacteroides species show bright GFP fluorescence when grown nanaerobically versus anaerobically. We compared four different red fluorescent proteins and found that mKate2 yields the highest red fluorescence intensity in our assay. We show that GFP-tagged proteins can be localized in nanaerobically growing bacteria. In addition, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to image dynamic type VI secretion system processes in metabolically active Bacteroides fragilis The ability to visualize fluorescently labeled Bacteroides and fluorescently linked proteins in actively growing nanaerobic gut symbionts ushers in an age of imaging analyses not previously possible in these bacteria.","output":"Nanaerobic growth enables direct visualization of dynamic cellular processes in human gut symbionts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este estudio analiza el impacto que la COVID-19 ha supuesto para la libre circulacin de personas y el control de las fronteras tanto interiores como exteriores en la UE, en un momento especialmente delicado, ya que ha coincidido con la apertura de la Conferencia sobre el futuro de la UE.

We took advantage of the sequential introduction of two government policies in Canada to evaluate the real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness among 30,361 international travellers arriving by air in Alberta, Canada. The proportion of COVID-19-positive results for travellers who were either fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated was 0.02% (95% CI: 0.00-0.10) (i.e. one positive case among 5,817 travellers). In contrast, 1.42% (95% CI: 1.27-1.58) of unvaccinated travellers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (341 cases among 24,034 travellers).

Data Sources: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS or COVID-19 and pregnancy. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion criteria were hospitalized pregnant women with a confirmed coronavirus related-illness, defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or COVID-19. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions, so that a pooled proportion may not coincide with the actual raw proportion in the results. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, preeclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results: Nineteen studies including 79 hospitalized women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8%, and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%), and dyspnea (27.0%). For all coronavirus infections, the pooled proportion of miscarriage was 64.7% (8/12; 95% confidence interval, 37.9-87.3), although reported only for women affected by SARS in two studies with no control group; the pooled proportion of preterm birth <37 weeks was 24.3% (14/56; 95% confidence interval, 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (6/34; 95% confidence interval, 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (2/19; 95% confidence interval, 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (2/29; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-24.4), although reported only for women affected by SARS; 84% (50/58) were delivered by cesarean; the pooled proportion of perinatal death was 11.1% (5/60; 95% confidence interval, 84.8-19.6), and 57.2% of newborns (3/12; 95% confidence interval, 3.6-99.8) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth <37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% of cases (14/32; 95% confidence interval, 25.6-57.6), while the pooled proportion of perinatal death was 7.0% (2/41; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. Conclusion: In hospitalized mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, preterm birth is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. COVID-19 infection was associated with higher rate (and pooled proportions) of preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon.

Using video data at three measurement time points, this paper examines whether and how 3rd grade students cooperatively apply the strategies of clarifying, questioning and predicting to nonfiction texts. Therefore, an intervention group that participated in peer-supported strategy-based reading instruction was compared to a control group that received regular German lessons without explicit strategy support. Both the quantity and quality of strategy use in the reading groups was coded using a deductively developed scheme. Results show that at all three measurement time points (pre-test, post-test, and follow-up), less than 50% of the students used reading strategies. Overall, the strategy most frequently used was questioning. A moderate positive training effect was particularly evident for predicting. What needs to be discussed is why students did not use more strategies at a higher level of elaboration and whether additional skills are needed for effective strategy use in small groups.

Although an increased likelihood of significant brain lesions with age has been identified in neurologically normal dogs with epileptic seizures, the underlying aetiology of epileptic seizures in cats that present with normal physical and neurological examinations remains unknown.

They hypothesised that age would have an impact on the prevalence of detectable lesions. First, following the guidelines for dogs and in accordance with previous studies, the authors divided the cats into three age groups (aged one year or younger, between one and six, and older than six) and calculated the proportion of cats with a detectable lesion on MRI in these groups. In the first group, 3/32 cats (9.4 per cent) had significant MRI abnormalities that were all consistent with congenital malformation; in the second group, only 5/92 (5.4 per cent) MRI scans were abnormal and in the third group, 15/ 65 (23.1 per cent) cats showed abnormal findings that were predominantly lesions of neoplastic origin. Second, to investigate the impact of age further, data were investigated as a continuous variable using receiver operating characteristic analysis. This indicated an optimal cut-off age of five years, above which MRI abnormalities were more likely, with an increase in the odds of a significant structural lesion increasing by 14 per cent per year.","output":"Magnetic resonance imaging findings in epileptic cats with a normal interictal neurological examination: 188 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the COVID 19 pandemic struck our nation and started to cripple our health care infrastructure around the world, a considerable number of research was directed toward the development of the COVID Vaccine.

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded in Ghana on March 12, 2020. Since then, the country has been combatting countrywide community spread. This report describes how the Virology Department, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) is supporting the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to diagnose infections with this virus in Ghana. METHODS: The National Influenza Centre (NIC) in the Virology Department of the NMIMR, adopted real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020. Samples from suspected cases and contact tracing across Ghana were received and processed for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were pooled to enable simultaneous batch testing of samples without reduced sensitivity. OUTCOMES: From February 3 to August 21, the NMIMR processed 283 946 (10%) samples. Highest number of cases were reported in June when the GHS embarked on targeted contact tracing which led to an increase in number of samples processed daily, peaking at over 7,000 samples daily. There were several issues to overcome including rapid consumption of reagents and consumables. Testing however continued successfully due to revised procedures, additional equipment and improved pipeline of laboratory supplies. Test results are now provided within 24 to 48 hours of sample submission enabling more effective response and containment. CONCLUSION: Following the identification of the first cases of SARS-CoV-2infection by the NMIMR, the Institute has trained other centres and supported the ramping up of molecular testing capacity in Ghana. This provides a blueprint to enable Ghana to mitigate further epidemics and pandemics.

In clinical medicine, mild thrombocytopenia, combined with lymphopenia in a patient with signs and symptoms of an infectious disease, raises the suspicion of a viral infection. This phenomenon is classically attributed to platelet consumption due to inflammation-induced coagulation, sequestration from the circulation by phagocytosis and hypersplenism, and impaired platelet production due to defective megakaryopoiesis or cytokine-induced myelosuppression. All these mechanisms, while plausible and supported by substantial evidence, regard platelets as passive bystanders during viral infection.

In addition to personal hygiene, this technology facilitates public hygiene as antimicrobial tiles can be installed at hospitals, schools, banks, offices, lobbies, railway stations, etc. This review is primarily focused on preparing antimicrobial tiles using an antimicrobial layer or coatings that fight against germs. The salient features and working mechanisms of antimicrobial tiles are highlighted. This challenge is a component of the exploratory nature of nanoarchitectonics, that also extends farther than the realm of nanotechnology. This nanoarchitectonics has been successful at the laboratory scale as antimicrobial metal nanoparticles are mainly used as additives in preparing tiles. A detailed description of various materials for developing unique antimicrobial tiles is reported here. Pure metal (Ag, Zn) nanoparticles and a mixture of nanoparticles with other inorganic materials (SiO(2,), TiO(2), anatase, nepheline) have been predominantly used to combat microbes. The developed antimicrobial tiles have shown excellent activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Flow cytometry analysis showed that VALD-3 triggered cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Western blot analysis revealed that VALD-3 upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad and Bax), downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, survivin and XIAP) and increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8, Cyto-c and cleaved PARP. VALD-3 also regulated the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway in breast cancer cells, inhibiting the activation of downstream molecules. By xenografting human breast cancer cells into nude mice, we found that VALD-3 significantly suppressed tumor cell growth while showing low toxicity against major organs. In addition, survival analysis showed that VALD-3 can significantly prolong the survival time of mice (P = 0.036). This study is the first to show that VALD-3 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells by suppressing Wnt/-catenin signaling, indicating that it could be a potential drug for the treatment of breast cancer.","output":"VALD-3, a Schiff base ligand synthesized from o-vanillin derivatives, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells by inhibiting the Wnt/-catenin pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Flexner Report damaged and marginalized historically Black medical schools, which today produce more than their fair share of Black medical graduates.

There remains a critical need to identify host immune biomarkers predictive of clinical and immunologic outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Leveraging longitudinal samples and data from a clinical trial in SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients, we used host proteomics and transcriptomics to characterize the trajectory of the immune response in COVID-19 patients within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset. We identify early immune signatures, including plasma RIG-I levels, early interferon signaling, and related cytokines (CXCL10, MCP1, MCP-2 and MCP-3) associated with subsequent disease progression, control of viral shedding, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell and antibody response measured up to 7 months after enrollment.

In such a context, ride-sourcing drivers are free to decide whether to accept or decline ride requests assigned by the ride-hailing platform. Drivers' ride acceptance behaviour can significantly influence system performance in terms of riders' waiting time (associated with the level of service), drivers' occupation rate and idle time (related to drivers' income), and platform revenue and reputation. Hence, it is of great importance to identify the underlying determinants of the ride acceptance behaviour of drivers. To this end, we collected a unique dataset from ride-sourcing drivers working in the United States and the Netherlands through a cross-sectional stated preference experiment designed based upon disparate information conveyed to the respondents. Using a choice modelling approach, we estimated the effects of various existing and hypothetical attributes influencing the ride acceptance choice. Employment status, experience level with the platform, and working shift are found to be the key individual-specific determinants. Part-time and beginning drivers who work on midweek days (Monday-Thursday) have a higher tendency to accept ride offers. Results also reveal that pickup time, which is the travel time between the driver's location and the rider's waiting spot, has a negative impact on ride acceptance. Moreover, the findings suggest that a guaranteed tip (i.e., the minimum amount of tip that is indicated upfront by the prospective rider, a feature that is currently not available) and an additional income due to surge pricing are valued noticeably higher than trip fare.

Yet, little is known about those who participate in this care model, and how virtual walk-in clinics contribute to care continuity and patient healthcare utilization. Objectives: To describe the characteristics and healthcare use of patients using virtual walk-in clinics compared to the general population, and a subset that received any virtual family physician visit. Design: This was a retrospective, population-based, cross-sectional study. Setting: Ontario, Canada's most populous province. Participants: Patients who had received at least one family physician visit at one of 13 virtual walk-in clinics from April 1st to December 31st, 2020. They were compared to Ontario residents who had any virtual family physician visit in the same time period. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Patient characteristics and 30-day post-visit healthcare utilization. Results: Virtual walk-in patients (N=132,168) had fewer comorbidities and lower previous healthcare utilization than Ontarians with any virtual visit. Less than 0.1% of virtual walk-in visits were with a patient's own family physician. Compared to Ontarians having any virtual family physician visit, virtual walk-in patients were significantly less likely to have a subsequent in-person visit with the same physician (0.2% vs. 11.0%, SMD = 0.48), more likely to have a subsequent virtual visit (30.3% vs. 21.9%, SMD = 0.19), and twice as likely to have an emergency department visit within 30 days (8.3% vs. 4.1%, SMD = 0.18), an effect that persisted after adjustment and across rurality groups: large urban (aOR 2.26; 95% CI 2.08-2.45), small urban (aOR 2.08; 95% CI 1.99-2.18), and rural (aOR 1.87; 95% CI 1.69-2.07). Conclusions and Relevance: Compared to Ontarians attending any family physician virtual visit, virtual walk-in patients were less likely to have a subsequent in-person physician visit, but were more likely to visit the emergency department.

Participants reported varying levels of distress due to the delay in surgery, such as the fear of developmental delay or disease progression for their child. They also indicated their own physical and mental health had been impacted by emotional distress related to both COVID-19 and delays in treatment. Most participants experienced the COVID-19-related hospital restrictions as distressing. This related predominantly to limiting in-hospital caregivers to only one caregiver.

However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease, as long as both are within predictable limits.

The data of the current study represents that treatment of rats with either APAP-overdose, or gamma-irradiation (R) induces hepatotoxicity, results in significant increases of the hepatic-enzymes activities (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, LDH, and MDH), as well as enhancement of triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, combined with declines in albumin and total protein contents. An enhancement of the lipid peroxides (malondialdehyde; MDA), and nitric oxide levels along with a decline of reduced glutathione contents and suppression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities are also observed within the liver tissues of intoxicated animals.

Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be considered. Results: : Here we show that the genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from SARS-CoV-1 are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for host cell invasion, virus replication, and host immune response. For SARS-CoV-1, we identify two sites: one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike proteins receptor binding domain;for SARS-CoV-2, one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other toward the end of the spike gene past its domain junction. At this junction, we detect a highly specific stretch of yeast DNA origin covering the critical furin cleavage site insert PRRA, which has not been seen in other lineage b betacoronaviruses. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a passage model for viral constructs in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Conclusions: : These results provide evidence that among SARS-like coronaviruses only the genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain information that points to a synthetic passage in genetically modified yeast cells.

Hypercoagulability may be related to the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, which is mainly driven by interleukin (IL)-6. Plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels increase following IL-6 upregulation and Lp(a) has anti-fibrinolytic properties. This study investigated whether Lp(a) elevation may contribute to the pro-thrombotic state hallmarking COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Lp(a), IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured in 219 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed with linear mixed effects model. The baseline biomarkers and increases during admission were related to venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence and clinical outcomes in a Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Lp(a) levels increased significantly by a mean of 16.9 mg/dl in patients with COVID-19 during the first 21 days after admission. Serial Lp(a) measurements were available in 146 patients. In the top tertile of Lp(a) increase, 56.2% of COVID-19 patients experienced a VTE event compared to 18.4% in the lowest tertile (RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.61C5.81; p < 0.001).

Moreover, the vaccine was not significantly associated with increased risk of neonatal adverse outcomes including respiratory complications and NICU hospitalization. In conclusion, BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with an increased rate of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Therefore, in view of its safety on one hand, and the risk associated with COVID-19 disease in pregnancy on the other hand, BNT 162b2 COVID-19 vaccine should be recommended for pregnant women.","output":"Obstetric and Neonatal Outcomes following COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) became an epidemic disease and lead to a pneumonia outbreak first in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The symptoms related to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) were different ranging from mild to severe lung injury and multi-organ failure symptoms, eventually leading to death, especially in older patients with other co-morbidities. The receptor of this virus in the human cell is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). METHODS: In this paper, we aimed to perform an in silico analysis of the frequently studied variants of the ACE2 gene and determine the effects of the variants in mRNA secondary structure and binding affinity of cellular factors. Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms were selected based on previous studies and investigated. RESULTS: All of the variants were analyzed in the RNAsnp database and three revealed a significant p-value. The spliceAid2 database prediction showed that 7 out of 14 SNPs caused an alteration in a way that only the wild or mutated form was able to bind to proteins. The latter database also reported that three SNPs produces a dual form in which different specific proteins can bind to the sequence in a specific form (either wild or mutated form). CONCLUSION: Altogether, these estimations revealed the potential of variants in manipulation of the final stable form of ACE2 that can lead to different COVID-19 susceptibility.","output":"Investigating the ACE2 polymorphisms in COVID-19 susceptibility: An in silico analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent advances in our understanding of RNA biology have uncovered crucial roles for RNA in multiple disease states, ranging from viral and bacterial infections to cancer and neurological disorders. As a result, multiple laboratories have become interested in developing drug-like small molecules to target RNA. However, this development comes with multiple unique challenges. For example, RNA is inherently dynamic and has limited chemical diversity. In addition, promiscuous RNA-binding ligands are often identified during screening campaigns. This Tutorial Review overviews important considerations and advancements for generating RNA-targeted small molecules, ranging from fundamental chemistry to promising small molecule examples with demonstrated clinical efficacy. Specifically, we begin by exploring RNA functional classes, structural hierarchy, and dynamics. We then discuss fundamental RNA recognition principles along with methods for small molecule screening and RNA structure determination. Finally, we review unique challenges and emerging solutions from both the RNA and small molecule perspectives for generating RNA-targeted ligands before highlighting a selection of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" to date. These molecules target RNA in a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and viral infection, in cellular and animal model systems. Additionally, we explore the recently FDA-approved small molecule regulator of RNA splicing, risdiplam, for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. Together, this Tutorial Review showcases the fundamental role of chemical and molecular recognition principles in enhancing our understanding of RNA biology and contributing to the rapidly growing number of RNA-targeted probes and therapeutics.

In Mpro, there is a Cys-His catalytic dyad, and ligands that interact with the Cys145 assumed to be an effective approach to inhibit the Mpro. In this study, approximately 1400 cysteine-focused ligands were screened to identify the best candidates that can act as potent inhibitors against Mpro. Our results show that the selected ligands strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. Covalent docking was performed for the selected candidates containing the acrylonitrile group, which can form a covalent bond with Cys145. All atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the selected four inhibitors including L1, L2, L3 and L4 to validate the docking interactions. Our results were also compared with a control ligand, &#945;-ketoamide (11r). Principal component analysis on structural and energy data obtained from the MD trajectories shows that L1, L3, L4 and &#945;-ketoamide (11r) have structural similarity with the apo-form of the Mpro. Quantitative structure-activity relationship method was employed for pattern recognition of the best ligands, which discloses that ligands containing acrylonitrile and amide warheads can show better performance.

Stringent physical distancing recommendations and shelter-in-place were first introduced in the hardest-hit provinces, and by March, these recommendations were uniform throughout the country. In the presence of an evolving and deadly pandemic, we sought to investigate the impact of this pandemic on individual well-being and prevention practices among Chinese urban residents. From March 2-11, 2020, 4,607 individuals were recruited from 11 provinces with varying numbers of COVID-19 casers using the social networking app WeChat to complete a brief, anonymous, online survey. The analytical sample was restricted to 2,551 urban residents. Standardized scales measured generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the primary outcome. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify correlates of GAD alongside assessment of community practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, recommended public health practices significantly (p <0.001) increased, including wearing facial mask, practicing physical distancing, handwashing, decreased public spitting, and going outside in urban communities. Overall, 40.3% of participants met screening criteria for GAD and 49.3%, 62.6%, and 55.4% reported that their work, social life, and family life were interrupted by anxious feelings, respectively. Independent correlates of having anxiety symptoms included being a healthcare provider (aOR=1.58, p <0.01), living in regions with a higher density of COVID-19 cases (aOR=2.13, p <0.01), having completed college (aOR=1.38, p =0.03), meeting screening criteria for depression (aOR=6.03, p <0.01) and poorer perceived health status (aOR=1.54, p <0.01). COVID-19 had a profound impact on the health of urban dwellers throughout China. Not only did they markedly increase their self- and community-protective behaviors, but they also experienced high levels of anxiety associated with a heightened vulnerability like depression, having poor perceived health, and the potential of increased exposure to COVID-19 such as living closer to the epicenter of the pandemic.","output":"Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak in Urban Settings in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. The risk is related to the cytokine storm, a major contributor to multiorgan failure and a pathological character of COVID-19 patients with obesity. While the exact cause of the cytokine storm remains elusive, disorders in energy metabolism has provided insights into the mechanism. Emerging data suggest that adipose tissue in obesity contributes to the disorders in several ways. First, adipose tissue restricts the pulmonary function by generation of mechanical pressures to promote systemic hypoxia. Second, adipose tissue supplies a base for SARS-CoV-2 entry by overexpression of viral receptors (ACE2 and DPP4). Third, impaired antiviral responses of adipocytes and immune cells result in dysfunction of immunologic surveillance as well as the viral clearance systems. Fourth, chronic inflammation in obesity contributes to the cytokine storm by secreting more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fifth, abnormal levels of adipokines increase the risk of a hyper-immune response to the virus in the lungs and other organs to enhance the cytokine storm. Mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes, immune cells and other cell types (endothelial cells and platelets, etc.) is a common cellular mechanism for the development of cytokine storm, which leads to the progression of mild COVID-19 to severe cases with multiorgan failure and high mortality.

The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO3), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO3 (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities.","output":"Imprints of pandemic lockdown on subsurface water quality in the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin, South India: A revival perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Education is regarded as an avenue for success while the under-educated are disproportionately more likely to be incarcerated and remain within the correctional system.

METHODS: To assess TNF-antagonist therapy, 18 hospitalized adults with hypoxic respiratory failure and COVID-19 pneumonia received single-dose infliximab-abda therapy 5 mg/kg intravenously between April and December 2020. The primary endpoint was time to increase in oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) by 50 compared to baseline and sustained for 48 h. Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality, dynamic cytokine profiles, secondary infections, duration of supplemental oxygen support, and hospitalization. FINDINGS: Patients were predominantly in critical respiratory failure (15/18, 83%), male (14/18, 78%), above 60 years (median 63 years, range 31C80), race-ethnic minorities (13/18, 72%), lymphopenic (13/18, 72%), steroid-treated (17/18, 94%), with a median ferritin of 1953 ng/ml. Sixteen patients (89%) met the primary endpoint within a median of 4 days; 14/18 (78%) were discharged in a median of 8 days and were alive at 28-day follow-up.

In this regard, one of the very first strategy to minimize the number of affected patients and reduce casualties is to diagnose COVID-19 at an early stage. Currently, PCR test is primarily utilized for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, PCR test requires a huge number of expensive test kits as well as trained experts. Therefore, chest X-Ray imaging technique (including Machine Learning) has been considered as an alternative for COVID-19 diagnosis among the researchers. This particular method is faster, less expensive and will allow the authorities to manage the COVID19 diagnosis system in a cost-effective way. Machine learning techniques have been proven to be significantly efficient and accurate for image classification problems. On the other hand, One of the most utilized techniques in machine learning is supervised learning which is highly convenient and helping the experts to diagnose and make informed decisions about COVID-19.

To better understand the tradeoffs between economic and epidemic costs of lockdown interventions, we here focus on a simple SIR epidemic model and study lockdowns as solutions to an optimal control problem. We first show numerically that the optimal lockdown policy exhibits a phase transition from suppression to mitigation as the time horizon grows, i.e., if the horizon is short the optimal strategy is to impose severe lockdown to avoid diffusion of the infection, whereas if the horizon is long the optimal control steers the system to herd immunity to reduce economic loss. We then consider two alternative policies, motivated by government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, where lockdown levels are selected to either stabilize the reproduction number (i.e.,\\"flatten the curve\\") or the fraction of infected (i.e., containing the number of hospitalizations). We compute analytically the performance of these two feedback policies and compare them to the optimal control.

How animals use their environment can be mediated by their personality (e.g. risk-taking), but does personality mediate how overwintering species select refugia? Snow cover is a dynamic winter characteristic that can influence crypsis or provide below-the-snow refugia. We explored how wintering ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) selected snow roosting sites, a behaviour that reduces stress and cold exposure. We linked selection for approximately 700 roosts with survival of 42 grouse, and showed that grouse generally selected deeper snow and warmer areas. Grouse found in shallow snow were less likely to survive winter. However, individuals that selected deep snow improved their survival, suggesting that demographic consequences of selecting winter refugia are mediated by differences in personality. Our study provides a crucial, and seldom addressed, link between personality in resource selection and resulting demographic consequences.","output":"Personality differences in the selection of dynamic refugia have demographic consequences for a winter-adapted bird"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategies for eradicating cancer stem cells (CSCs) are urgently required because CSCs are resistant to anticancer drugs and cause treatment failure, relapse and metastasis.

Moreover, the relationship between trust and social distancing intention cannot be well understood without an account of the information environment. As previous studies have reached a consensus about the limited effects of information exposure on individual outcomes, this research focuses on possible moderating effects. Results show that information exposure, no matter via interpersonal or media sources, has no direct effects on behavioral intention.

Methods: All DME patients treated with Ranibizumab, Aflibercept, Dexamethasone implant, and Fluocinolone Acetonide implant at the Sassari University Hospital, Italy, between January 2017 and June 2020 were included. Central macular thickness (CMT) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured. ADRs and drug expenses were analyzed. Results: Two-hundred thirty-one DME patients (mean age: 65 years) received intravitreal agents. Mean CMT and BCVA were 380 m and 0.5 LogMAR at baseline, 298 m and 0.44 logMAR after one year (p = 0.04), and 295 m and 0.4 logMAR at the end of the follow-up period.

The identification of synergistic drug combinations, however, is challenging. Detailed understanding of antibiotic mechanisms can address this issue by facilitating the rational design of improved combination therapies. Here, using diverse biochemical and genetic assays, we examine the molecular mechanisms of niclosamide, a clinically approved salicylanilide compound, and demonstrate its potential for Gram-negative combination therapies. We discovered that Gram-negative bacteria possess two innate resistance mechanisms that reduce their niclosamide susceptibility: a primary mechanism mediated by multidrug efflux pumps and a secondary mechanism of nitroreduction. When efflux was compromised, niclosamide became a potent antibiotic, dissipating the proton motive force (PMF), increasing oxidative stress, and reducing ATP production to cause cell death. These insights guided the identification of diverse compounds that synergized with salicylanilides when coadministered (efflux inhibitors, membrane permeabilizers, and antibiotics that are expelled by PMF-dependent efflux), thus suggesting that salicylanilide compounds may have broad utility in combination therapies. We validate these findings in vivo using a murine abscess model, where we show that niclosamide synergizes with the membrane permeabilizing antibiotic colistin against high-density infections of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates. We further demonstrate that enhanced nitroreductase activity is a potential route to adaptive niclosamide resistance but show that this causes collateral susceptibility to clinical nitro-prodrug antibiotics. Thus, we highlight how mechanistic understanding of mode of action, innate/adaptive resistance, and synergy can rationally guide the discovery, development, and stewardship of novel combination therapies.","output":"Mechanistic Understanding Enables the Rational Design of Salicylanilide Combination Therapies for Gram-Negative Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A significant proportion of women exceeds or does not meet the Institute of Medicine's gestational weight gain (GWG) guidelines.

Some cultural beliefs may erroneously promote overeating as \\"eating for two\\" and discourage physical activity during pregnancy, but there is lack of empirical evidence on how culture affects GWG. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the effects of culture on GWG. METHODS/DESIGN Ten electronic databases will be searched to identify studies reporting on the effects of culture on GWG.

We found evidence of visual laterality at the individual level, but not at the group level for each stimulus. For the preferred stimulus, 9 individuals showed significant right-eye preference while 4 individuals showed significant left-eye preference. For the other 3 stimuli, 7 individuals displayed significant right-eye preference while 6 individuals displayed significant left-eye preference. Totally, 11 of 13 individuals showed consistency in the visual laterality direction (7 right-eye preference and 4 left-eye preference) across the 4 stimuli. The remaining 2 individuals displayed right-eye preference for the preferred stimulus while they showed left-eye preference for the other 3 stimuli. There was no significant difference among various stimuli regarding the direction of visual laterality. However, there was a significant difference in the strength of visual laterality among various stimulus categories. The strength of visual laterality for the preferred stimulus was significantly lower than that for the other 3 stimuli. The strength of visual laterality for the fearful stimulus was significantly higher than that for the novel stimulus and the neutral stimulus.

Survival prediction is a major concern for NPC patients, as it provides early prognostic information that is needed to guide treatments. Recently, deep learning, which leverages Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn deep representations of image patterns, has been introduced to the survival prediction in various cancers including NPC. It has been reported that image-derived end-to-end deep survival models have the potential to outperform clinical prognostic indicators and traditional radiomics-based survival models in prognostic performance. However, deep survival models, especially 3D models, require large image training data to avoid overfitting. Unfortunately, medical image data is usually scarce, especially for Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) due to the high cost of PET/CT scanning. Compared to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) providing only anatomical information of tumors, PET/CT that provides both anatomical (from CT) and metabolic (from PET) information is promising to achieve more accurate survival prediction. However, we have not identified any 3D end-to-end deep survival model that applies to small PET/CT data of NPC patients. In this study, we introduced the concept of multi-task leaning into deep survival models to address the overfitting problem resulted from small data.

For bioaerosol production, water containing 10(7) colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL of Lactobacillus acidophilus was used as a water coolant system of the scaler. RESULTS: The total surface contamination found on the body of the operator was significantly decreased when using both MFPW and PSC barriers (P < 0.05). A significant reduction on the assistants body and the dental chair was only observed when PSC was used (P < 0.05). For bacterial aerosols, both barriers significantly reduced the number of bacterial colonies when compared with no barrier used (P < 0.05). The percentages of total colonies reduction for MFPW and PSC were 78.13 (1.69) and 69.24 (2.49), respectively. However, no difference in the total number of bacterial colonies was observed between the two types of barriers. CONCLUSION: A dental barrier system was effective in aerosols and splatters reduction during an ultrasonic scaling.","output":"Efficacy of Dental Barriers in Aerosols and Splatters Reduction During an Ultrasonic Scaling: An In-vitro Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the role of Fibonacci retracements levels, a popular technical analysis indicator, in predicting stock prices of leading U.S. energy companies and energy cryptocurrencies. The study methodology focuses on applying Fibonacci retracements as a system compared with the buy-and-hold strategy. Daily crypto and stock prices were obtained from the Standard & Poor's composite 1500 energy index and CoinMarketCap between November 2017 and January 2020. This study also examined if the combined Fibonacci retracements and the price crossover strategy result in a higher return per unit of risk. Our findings revealed that Fibonacci retracement captures energy stock price changes better than cryptos. Furthermore, most price violations were frequent during price falls compared to price increases, supporting that the Fibonacci instrument does not capture price movements during up and downtrends, respectively. Also, fewer consecutive retracement breaks were observed when the price violations were examined 3 days before the current break. Furthermore, the Fibonacci-based strategy resulted in higher returns relative to the na?ve buy-and-hold model. Finally, complementing Fibonacci with the price cross strategy did not improve the results and led to fewer or no trades for some constituents. This studys overall findings elucidate that, despite significant drops in oil prices, speculators (traders) can implement profitable strategies when using technical analysis indicators, like the Fibonacci retracement tool, with or without price crossover rules.","output":"Energy crypto currencies and leading U.S. energy stock prices: are Fibonacci retracements profitable?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and abiding restrictions have affected every life domain. Sleep disturbances are a major health issue that is linked with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and psychological burdens. Research of sleeping disorders among vegetarian and non-vegetarian subpopulations is limited. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of sleeping disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with different dietary patterns. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, data were collected from 1987 people. A total of 1956 respondents met all study conditions. The questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic information, assessment of dietary habits, and assessment of the prevalence of insomnia and sleepiness, based on the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). A total of 36.04% (n = 705) respondents declared that they noticed a change in the quality of their sleep during the last year. According to AIS and ESS, non-vegetarians suffered from insomnia or sleepiness more often than vegetarians. Insomnia and sleepiness were also more prevalent among those respondents who declared consumption of fruit and vegetables less often than once a day compared with those who consumed fruit and vegetables daily. Respondents with BMI within the recommended limit (18.5C24.99) suffered from insomnia less often when compared with underweight (BMI < 18.5) or obese (BMI  25) respondents.

However, it can carry over contaminants, namely mycotoxins, with biological effects to which this population is particularly vulnerable. Human biomonitoring and surveillance programs are particularly scarce in low-income countries, where food security is a more urgent priority in comparison with food safety. This pilot survey aims to assess exposure of breastfed infants to aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), zearalenone (ZEN), and ochratoxin A (OTA) in Angola, and to evaluate the main socio-demographical and food consumption determinants of lactating mothers. All 37 breast milk samples analyzed are found to be contaminated with ZEN and OTA, although none are found contaminated with AFM1. Contamination levels are lower than previously reported for ZEN but higher in the case of OTA. A significant association between ZEN levels in breast milk and the consumption of cookies by the lactating mothers is found. As for OTA, higher levels are observed in the milk from mothers with younger infants, for which high estimated daily intake (EDI) is determined. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first survey of the occurrence of mycotoxins in breast milk in Angola, so further human biomonitoring works should follow, given that mycotoxins are a global health issue that directly impact the health of populations.","output":"Mycotoxins Exposure in Cabinda, Angola-A Pilot Biomonitoring Survey of Breastmilk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Culture and traditions influence people's health beliefs and these influence their actions and behaviors to prevent ill health and promote health and well-being.

Despite the high burden of these combined risks, there is a paucity of evidence to support tailored perioperative strategies to manage this population. A comprehensive evidence synthesis would inform the management of these patients in the perioperative period and identify knowledge gaps. We describe a protocol for a scoping review of the literature to identify existing perioperative strategies, protocols, pathways and interventions for people with CKD G5D undergoing major surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a scoping review in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and report per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. In February 2020, we will complete our search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry for published literature from inception to present. All study types are eligible for inclusion, without language restriction. Studies reporting a perioperative intervention in adult patients with CKD G5D are eligible for inclusion. Studies in prevalent kidney transplant patients or patients with acute kidney injury, and studies that report on surgical approaches without consideration of perioperative management strategies, will be excluded. Reviewers will independently assess abstracts for all identified studies in duplicate, and again at the full-text stage. Following published literature searches, a search of the grey literature will be developed. We will extract and narratively report study, participant and intervention details. This will include a summary table outlining the strategies employed, organised into post hoc developed perioperative domains.

The critical node, which leads to the emergence of the giant connected component as the degree threshold increases, is determined when the maximal second-largest connected component disappears. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct the experiments on several artificial networks and real-world networks. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the degree centrality strategy, the betweenness centrality strategy and the adaptive degree centrality strategy with 18% to 50% fewer immunized nodes for same amount of immunization.","output":"Immunization strategy based on the critical node in percolation transition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Nurses are pivotal in caring for patients infected with COVID-19.

One factor to control the breadth of T cell responses is the surface morphology of a peptide-MHC complex. Here, we present an in silico protocol for predicting peptide-MHC structure. A robust signature of a conformational transition was identified during all-atom molecular dynamics, which results in a model with high accuracy. A large test set was used in constructing our protocol and we went another step further using a blind test with a wild-type peptide and two highly immunogenic mutants, which predicted substantial conformational changes in both mutants. The center residues at position five of the analogs were configured to be accessible to solvent, forming a prominent surface, while the residue of the wild-type peptide was to point laterally toward the side of the binding cleft. We then experimentally determined the structures of the blind test set, using high resolution of X-ray crystallography, which verified predicted conformational changes. Our observation strongly supports a positive association of the surface morphology of a peptide-MHC complex to its immunogenicity.

However, medication adherence represents a major issue for prolonged OTAD treatment. In this study, the factors associated with treatment adherence to OTAD were explored through the Adherence Influencing Factor Framework suggested by WHO. Based on these results, we further examined the potential factors related to social psychological cognition in OTAD adherence in patients with lung cancer. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in public hospitals in Henan, China. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with selected lung cancer patients. Face-to-face interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis. Results: Of the 21 patients interviewed, 17 were males and 4 were females. The analysis of the data led to four themes, ie, patient-related factors (medication-taking introspection, family structure, weigh the pros and cons of OTAD treatment), medication-related factors (medication experience, adverse reactions, information access), physician/nurse-related factors (shared decision making, doctor's reaction, nurse's inquiry) and society-related factors (fear, stigma). Conclusion: Family structure, weigh the pros and cons of OTAD treatment, information access, shared decision making, nurse's inquiry are potential factors affecting OTAD adherence in lung cancer patients. Providing drug information support to patients, inviting patients to join in shared decision-making and strengthening doctor-patient-nurse cooperation are important for improving medication adherence.

In addition, it explored the factors associated with the increased levels of mental health burden among the study population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using two online-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), which were distributed in parallel to HCPs and HSCUs in Kuwait. These instruments are validated assessment scales to assess mental health status: depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS- version 25. RESULTS: A total of 857 individuals (559 HCPs and 298 HSCUs) participated in this study. The prevalence of moderately severe depression or severe depression (PHQ-9 total score of &#8805;15) among respondents was 66.6%. The median (interquartile range, IQR) PHQ-9 score was significantly higher among HSCUs (20 {11.5}) compared to HCPs (17 {8}). The prevalence of severe anxiety (GAD-7 total score of &#8805;15) among respondents was 36.7%. There were no significant differences between the median (IQR) GAD-7 scores among the HCPs (14 {7}) and HSCUs (13 {8}). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that three variables were significantly and independently associated with severe depression among HCPs. The prevalence of severe depression was found to be greater among females compared to males. In addition, it was significantly lower among those who were aged &#8805;50 years, and those who reported that they were not in direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Among HSCUs, females showed greater depression than males. In contrast, those aged >29 years and who had no history of chronic disease showed lower depression compared to their counterparts in the 18-29 years age group and who had a chronic disease history.

Mounting evidence suggests that autophagy plays different roles in the infection process of different pathogens. Until now, there has been no conclusive evidence regarding whether host autophagy is involved in Neospora caninum infection. In the current study, we first monitored the activation of autophagy by N. caninum, which occurred mainly in the early stages of infection, and examined the role of host autophagy in N. caninum infection. Here, we presented evidence that N. caninum induced an increase in autophagic vesicles with double-membrane structures in macrophages at the early stage of infection. LC3-II expression peaked and decreased as infection continued. However, the expression of P62/SQSTM1 showed significant accumulation within 12 h of infection, indicating that autophagic flux was blocked. A tandem fluorescence protein mCherry-GFP-LC3 construct was used to corroborate the impaired autophagic flux. Subsequently, we found that N. caninum infection induced the activation of the TLR2CAKTCmTOR pathways. Further investigation revealed that TLR2CmTOR, accompanied by the blockade of autophagic flux, was responsible for impaired autophagy but was not associated with AKT. In vitro and in vivo, N. caninum replication was strongly blocked by the kinase inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA, autophagy inhibitor). In contrast, rapamycin (Rapa, an autophagy inducer) was able to promote intracellular proliferation and reduce the survival rate of N. caninum-infected mice. On the other hand, the accumulation of autophagosomes facilitated the proliferation of N. caninum. Collectively, our findings suggest that activation of host autophagy facilitates N. caninum replication and may counteract the innate immune response of the host. In short, inhibition of the early stages of autophagy could potentially be a strategy for neosporosis control.","output":"The Protective Role of TLR2 Mediates Impaired Autophagic Flux by Activating the mTOR Pathway During Neospora caninum Infection in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the impact of confinement due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and resilience in periand postmenopausal women Material and Methods: We used an online questionnaire which was sent between April 30th and May 13th, 2020 to women aged 40-70 years who were perior postmenopausal according to STRAW criteria We used the 16 item Cervantes short-form scale (Cervantes-SF) to measure HRQoL, and the 14-item Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale (RS-14) to measure resilience High scores on the Cervantes-SF indicate low HRQoL and high scores on the RS-14 indicate high levels of resilience Covid-19 status, sociodemographic descriptors, and lifestyle variables were also evaluated Results: We included 2430 periand postmenopausal women with valid questionnaires All items of the Cervantes-SF were completed in 2151 cases, whilst the RS-14 was completed in 2413 cases There was a negative correlation between scores on the Cervantes-SF and RS-14 scales (Rho -0 350;p &lt; 0 0001) Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between Cervantes-SF scores and living with others (beta-coefficient -10 2;p &lt; 0 001), use of antidepressants (beta 9 3;p &lt; 0 001), physical activity (beta-8 6;p &lt; 0 001) and sexual activity (beta-2 7;p &lt; 0 001) Resilience was associated with the use of antidepressants (beta-5 9;p &lt; 0 001), physical activity (beta 3 2;p &lt; 0 001) and sexual activity (beta 1 7;p = 0 005) According to the multivariate analysis, there were no associations between either Covid-19 or menopausal status and HRQoL or resilience scores Conclusions: During the period of mandatory Covid-19 confinement, periand postmenopausal women who engaged in physical and sexual activity had higher HRQoL and higher levels of resilience, whilst women who were using antidepressants had lower HRQoL and lower levels of resilience HRQoL was greater in women who lived with others","output":"Health-related quality of life and resilience in peri- and postmenopausal women during Covid-19 confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Data on SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) in adult coeliac disease (CD) are lacking.

However, the relationship between childhood traumas types and MDD symptoms is unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that childhood traumas affect specific types of anhedonia in depression and the mediating role of dysfunctional attitude. METHODS: Within this cross-sectional study, 310 young adult patients with MDD completed the PHQ-9, CTQ-SF, DAS, and SHAPS. The statistical analyses used the Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rank correlation, and multiple regression analysis. Mediation analyses were tested by the structural equation model (SEM). RESULTS: Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed positive correlations between the SHAPS, CTQ-SF, and DAS total score (p < 0.05). The EA, EN, PN, and SHAPS scores were positively correlated (p < 0.05). Among the four factors of anhedonia, social interaction and interest/pastimes were positively correlated with EA, EN, and PN (p < 0.05), the sensory experience was positively correlated with EN (p < 0.01), and diet did not correlate with childhood traumas. Stepwise regression analysis showed that dysfunctional attitude and emotional neglect were the main influencing factors of sensory experience (p < 0.001) and social interaction (p < 0.001). Dysfunctional attitude and physical neglect were the main factors influencing interest/pastimes (p < 0.001). SEM analysis found that dysfunctional mediated between childhood traumas and anhedonia. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of anhedonia was related to dysfunctional attitudes and childhood traumas. The childhood emotional neglect experience was the most important and was related to sensory and social anhedonia.

The largest protests in US history occurred in late May and early June 2020, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. This incident reignited widespread support for the BLM movement. The protests were notable not only for their size but also that they occurred at a time the US was still struggling to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 20,000 new cases per day. With protest conditions and police crowd control tactics exacerbating disease spread and with COVID disproportionately affecting minority populations, it was hypothesised that participation in and support for the protests would involve a balancing act between the risks of systemic racism and of disease spread. However, social media data suggest that this was not the case, with discussion of the BLM movement replacing discussion of COVID on US social media. Neither supporters or opposers of the BLM movement or protest action mentioned COVID as a factor.

As part of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, gastrointestinal symptoms might be associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, which has the potential to become a target for intervention. In this study, a patient with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome with long-lasting severe gastrointestinal symptoms was provided 2-month expanded access to a high-fiber formula with investigational new drug (IND) status developed to alleviate COVID-19-related symptoms by modulating the gut microbiota. Symptoms including severe loss of appetite, palpitation, and anxiety were significantly alleviated by the end of the intervention. The medication dosage for controlling nausea decreased during the intervention. The serum lipid profile, insulin level, and leptin level were improved compared to the baseline values. Significant structural changes of the patients gut microbiota and reduced microbial fermentation activity in the small intestine were found during the intervention. Eighteen amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene significantly responded to this nutritional intervention. Six out of the 18 ASVs were also found to be negatively correlated with symptom severity/medication dosage. Five of the six ASVs (ASV0AKS_Oscillibacter, ASV009F_Anaerofustis, ASV02YT_Blautia, ASV07LA_Blautia, and ASV0AM6_Eubacterium hallii) were potential short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, which might be associated with the alleviation of symptoms.

To date, studies on the long-term course of symptoms, factors associated with persistent symptoms, and quality of life after 12 months since recovery from acute COVID-19 have been limited. METHODS: A prospective online survey (First: September 8, 2020CSeptember 10, 2020; Second: May 26, 2021CJune 1, 2021) was conducted on recovered patients who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 13, 2020 and March 13, 2020 at Kyungpook National University Hospital. Responders aged between 17 and 70 years were included in the study. Overall, 900 and 241 responders were followed up at 6 and 12 months after recovery from COVID-19 in the first and second surveys, respectively. Clinical characteristics, self-reported persistent symptoms, and EuroQol-5-dimension (EQ5D) index score were investigated for evaluating quality of life. RESULTS: The median period from the date of the first symptom onset or COVID-19 diagnosis to the time of the survey was 454 (interquartile range [IQR] 451C458) days. The median age of the responders was 37 (IQR 26.0C51.0) years, and 164 (68.0%) responders were women. Altogether, 11 (4.6%) responders were asymptomatic, and 194 (80.5%), 30 (12.4%), and 6 (2.5%) responders had mild, moderate, and severe illness, respectively. Overall, 127 (52.7%) responders still experienced COVID-19-related persistent symptoms and 12 (5.0%) were receiving outpatient treatment for such symptoms. The main symptoms were difficulty in concentration, cognitive dysfunction, amnesia, depression, fatigue, and anxiety. Considering the EQ5D index scores, only 59.3% of the responders did not have anxiety or depression. Older age, female sex, and disease severity were identified as risk factors for persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related persistent symptoms improved over time; however, neurological symptoms can last longer than other symptoms. Continuous careful observation of symptom improvement and multidisciplinary integrated research on recovered COVID-19 patients are required.

This study investigates empirically the lockdown impact of current pandemic on the Saudi economy. Design/methodology/approach The study employs inoperability input-output model (IIOM) on the input-output table (IOT) of Saudi Arabia for the analysis. Findings Findings show that with the closure of few sectors for the period of two months, the GDP declined to 6.49%. Findings also show a negative impact on consumption, investments and exports. Research limitations/implications One limitation of current study is that it uses IOTs which lack primary and secondary income distribution that is vital for presenting complete interindustry connections in the analysis. The interindustry structures relate to the consumption structures which ultimately lead to the income distribution and affect the consumption behaviors of economic agents. Hence, the complete income circular flow is not incorporated in IIOM using IOT. The findings of current study would be well grounded if it endogenized the primary and secondary income distribution. Practical implications The practical implication of this study is the use of IIOM for anticipating the potential loss against the backdrop of catastrophes and pandemics. The IIOM has the capability to predict the economic effects of disruptive events and hence the policy-makers can better predict and devise prudent policies to avoid the likely threats to the economy. Originality/value The current situation is unprecedented, and it is challenging for governments to forecast the economic repercussions. Several economic sectors have been inoperative due to lockdown implemented by the governments. This study empirically estimated the inoperability produced by the current pandemic. The findings are consistent with other estimated statistics, thereby proving the efficacy of IIOM to anticipate the economic repercussions of natural hazards.","output":"Socioeconomic spillovers of COVID-19: case of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic affects more than 81 million people worldwide with over 1.7 million deaths.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is released as a response to the infection, stimulating inflammatory pathways in the acute phase response. Thus, previous studies have shown that high serum concentrations IL-10 can be identify patients with severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding the capacity of IL-10 to identify severe COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the capacity of IL-10 as a prediction factor for mortality in hospital admitted patients with COVID-19 compared with CAP patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study was carried out at the Clinica Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia. Patients older than 18 years and old, hospitalized due to COVID 19 or CAP, were included. Patients were stratified into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. IL-10 levels were quantified in serum samples using the LUMINEX technology. Serum samples were collected within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. Afterward, concentrations of interleukinwere statistically compared among groups. ROC curves were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients with CAP and 152 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. The median [with IQR] serum concentration of IL-10 were higher in those patients who died (81.1 [30.7-148.9] vs 18.8 [8.3-48.4] p-value < 0.0001). Then, comparing the study group, the median concentration of IL-10 levels among patients deceased by COVID-19 were higher than patients those who survived (85.1 [40-149.8] vs 32.4 [13.9-56.7] p-value < 0.001). In addition, IL-10 levels were higher in patients who survived COVID-19 compared with those who survived CAP (32.4 [13.9-56.7] vs 10.6 [4.9-18] p-value < 0.0001). The area under curve (AUC) ROC of IL-10 to predict mortality risk was 0.754 for all cohort. DeLongs test comparing ROC curves in COVID-19 and CAP patients had a p= 0.744.

The transfer of immune or non immune spleen cells from resistant mice did not confer resistance to newborn mice.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between June 2000 and June 2012, 31 children (13 girls and 18 boys, with a median age of 8.4 years) affected by esophageal achalasia were treated in three different institutions with an esophagomyotomy according to Heller's procedure via laparoscopy associated with a Dor antireflux procedure. Between 2000 and 2005 (for 14 patients) we used mono- or bipolar coagulation to perform myotomy; after 2005 (for 17 patients) we used the new hemostatic devices to perform it. RESULTS Median length of surgery was 120 minutes. Median hospital stay was 4 days. We recorded eight complications in our series: 3 patients (9.6%) had a mucosal perforation, and 5 children (16.1%) presented dysphagia after surgery. When comparing the data before and after 2005, it seems that the new hemostatic devices statistically shortened the length of surgery (P<.01, Student's t test). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our experience, laparoscopic Heller's myotomy associated with an antireflux procedure is a safe and effective method for the treatment of achalasia in the pediatric population. Intraoperative complications were <10%, and they occurred mostly at the beginning of our experience. Residual dysphagia occurred in about 16% of cases. The use of the new hemostatic devices seems to reduce the length of surgery and intraoperative bleeding.

Risk stratification to prescribe safe and effective medications in the prevention of postoperative VTE has shown benefit in this regard. The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Syosset Hospital/Northwell Health, which performs over 1200 arthroplasties annually, has validated and is using the 2013 version of the Caprini Risk Assessment Model (RAM) to stratify each patient for risk of postoperative VTE. This tool results in a culling of information, past and present, personal and familial, that provides a truly thorough evaluation of the patient's risk for postoperative VTE. The Caprini score then guides the medication choices for thromboprophylaxis. The Caprini score is only valuable if the data is properly collected, and we have learned numerous lessons after applying it for 18 months. Risk stratification requires practice and experience to achieve expertise in perioperative patient evaluation.

However, adoption of telestroke has been relatively low. Several barriers to telestroke implementation have been previously identified in the literature. These barriers, and the strategies needed to overcome them, may vary across hospitals. Our study aimed to examine telestroke programs to identify opportunities for future research and efforts to promote effective implementation and sustainment of telestroke services. Methods: We surveyed hospitals in five states to capture information about the current status of the hospital's telestroke program; the model(s) of delivery being used (e.g., hub-and-spoke and third-party vendor); and telestroke infrastructure, processes, and implementation strategies. The survey included both closed-ended and open-ended response options. Descriptive results are presented, complemented with illustrative examples of open-ended responses. Results: We received 89 responses, each representing a different hospital. Approximately one-third of telestroke programs in our sample began between 2018 and 2020. More than two-thirds reported participating in a collaboration with other organizations to improve telestroke services. The most commonly reported, high-priority topics for additional guidance involved monitoring process measures, using performance indicators for improvement, and sharing data from measures with physicians. Discussion: Results complement prior studies, specifically about impacts of COVID-19 on telestroke programs and capabilities that hospitals most need assistance with. Challenges faced and guidance needed differ across hospitals, suggesting a need for a tailored support.

SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) and has rapidly spread worldwide, leaving no country untouched. COVID-19 is a respiratory infection characterized by a pneumonia of unknown etiology. It is transmitted through respiratory droplets; for example: through breathing, talking, and coughing. Transmission of the virus is high. Health care workers play important roles in helping those affected by COVID-19; this could not be done without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE involves the use of goggles, masks, gloves, and gowns and is known to reduce COVID-19 transmission; however, multiple reports of skin disease and damage associated with occupational mask-wearing have emerged. Objective: The objective of this study is to review the literature for newly emerging dermatological conditions as a result of occupational mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A narrative review of new reports of dermatological conditions associated with occupational mask-wearing was carried out in May 2020 by referencing keywords including: \\"covid mask dermatology,\\" \\"covid dermatological damage,\\" \\"covid mask skin,\\" \\"covid N95 mask damage,\\" and \\"covid mask skin damage\\" from PubMed, supplemented by searches on both Google Scholar and ResearchGate. A total of 287 articles were found, of which 40 were successfully included in this study, and an additional 7 were selected from the reference lists of these 40 articles. The findings were tabulated and analyzed under the following headings: dermatological diagnosis, causes, and management. Results: Qualitative analysis of the reviewed data was carried out. A number of dermatological conditions were found to increasingly occur owing to prolonged and frequent use of face masks. Pressure-related injuries were often the most serious complaint; recommendations to reduce this type of injury include the use of hydrocolloid dressings, plastic handles, education, and regular moisturization. Innovation in PPE as well as services, such as virtual clinics, need to be advanced to protect the welfare of health care staff. Conclusions: In these unprecedented times, PPE has been an effective barrier to the transmission of COVID-19 among health care workers. This has allowed health care workers to provide care to patients, with minimal risk. However, our findings suggest that despite the obvious benefits of using face masks to protect the respiratory system, there are also considerable health consequences to the skin. Future research studies are required to focus on improving face masks to ensure both the protection of the respiratory system as well as skin care, which, according to our study, has been overlooked.","output":"Does Wearing a Face Mask During the COVID-19 Pandemic Increase the Incidence of Dermatological Conditions in Health Care Workers?

Here we tested the effects of 15 GL derivatives against EBV infection by scoring the numbers of cell expressing viral antigens and quantifying EBV DNA copy numbers in superinfected Raji cells. The derivatives were made either by transformation of GL on carboxyl and hydroxyl groups or by conjugation of amino acid residues into the carbohydrate part. We identified seven compounds active against EBV and all showed dose-dependent inhibition as determined by both assays. Among these active compounds, the introduction of amino acid residues into the GL carbohydrate part enhanced the antiviral activity in three of the seven active compounds. However, when Glu(OH)-OMe was substituted by Glu(OMe)-OMe, its antiviral activity was completely abolished. Introduction of potassium or ammonium salt to GL reduced the antiviral activity with no significant effect on cytotoxicity. The -isomer (18-GL) of 18-GL was as potent as the -form, but its sodium salt lost antiviral activity.

RDV seems to have no nephrotoxic effect on TxR patients, as there was no difference in the incidence of AKI between RDV and SOC groups (50% vs 43%, p<0.05), and the discharge eGFR values significantly improved in the RDV group compared with the admission values (5723 vs 4422, p<0.05). Conclusion : Five-day RDV treatment appears safe in KTx recipients and may decrease ICU mortality attributed to COVID-19 and has no nephrotoxic effect.","output":"COVID-19 AND KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION: THE IMPACT OF REMDESIVIR ON RENAL FUNCTION AND OUTCOME- A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to evergrowing importance of understanding flow of bio-fluids in Lab-on-CD based systems, we investigate the flow behaviour of power-law fluids in the rotating electroosmotic flow through a polyelectrolyte grafted (soft) narrow channel. We use a in-house numerical code to solve the governing transport equations for the velocities and flow rates in a rotating channel subjected to an applied external electric field. We show the strong effect of polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. We also show that rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities. We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning fluids. We believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very important for designing soft channel based Lab-on-CD systems driven by electroosmotic forcing and dealing with rheologically complex bio-fluids such as blood, saliva or mucus.","output":"Rotating electroosmotic flow of power-law fluid through polyelectrolyte grafted microchannel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has posed significant threats to international health.

METHODS: Seven focus groups with 28 undergraduate physical therapist students were conducted following the transitioning to full eLearning as a result of strict physical distancing measures. Focus group questions explored the students experiences of the transition from face-to-face to full eLearning approach and the students recommendations for improving future eLearning experiences. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 3 themes identified were: (1) students presenting heightened negative feelings such as anxiety, stress, and reduced motivation to study; (2) students continuing to value the face-to-face learning, as it provided social support and facilitated feedback from peers and tutors; (3) student recommendations for eLearning included having online lectures and supplementary videos but face-to-face practical classes and developing healthy learning habits such as scheduled times for studying, exercise, and other activities that regulate stress. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to a full eLearning approach in an undergraduate physical therapist education program during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that students had heightened negative emotions due to the pandemic. Students valued face-to-face practical classes to learn and receive social support from peers and tutors. Student recommendations to future eLearning suggested changes to curriculum development geared toward a greater blended approach to learning. Blended learning may include using online lectures instead of face-to-face lectures and online resources to supplement student learning of practical skills. IMPACT: As higher education moves toward a more blended approach, lessons learned from this study can help educators design future physical therapist education programs.

Early identification of severe disease is essential in order to control COVID-19 and improve prognosis. Oxidative stress (OS) appears to play an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis; we therefore conceived a study of the potential discriminative ability of serum biomarkers in patients with ARDS and those with mild to moderate disease (non-ARDS). 60 subjects were enrolled in a single-centre, prospective cohort study of consecutively admitted patients: 29 ARDS/31 non-ARDS. Blood samples were drawn and marker levels analysed by spectrophotometry and immunoassay techniques. C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin were significantly higher in ARDS versus non-ARDS cases at hospital admission. Leukocytes, LDH, ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) were also significantly elevated in ARDS compared to non-ARDS patients during the hospital stay. Total thiol (TT) was found to be significantly lower in ARDS. Conversely, D-dimer, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and advanced glycosylated end products (AGE) were elevated. Leukocytes, LDH, CRP, ferritin and IL-6 were found to be significantly higher in non-survivors. However, lymphocyte, tumour necrosis factor beta (TGF-), and TT were lower. In summary, our results support the potential value of TT, ferritin and LDH as prognostic biomarkers for ARDS development in COVID-19 patients, distinguishing non-ARDS from ARDS (AUCs = 0.92; 0.91; 0.89) in a fast and cost-effective manner.

Consecutive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory tract specimens is essential for determining duration of virus shedding and providing evidence to optimize the clinical management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the shedding durations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens? What are their associated risk factors? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 68 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital from February 10, 2020, to March 20, 2020, were recruited. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from paired specimens of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and sputum were carried out. The clinical characteristics of patients were recorded for further analysis. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from NPSs in 48 patients (70.6%), and from sputum specimens in 30 patients (44.1%). The median duration of viral shedding from sputum specimens (34 days; interquartile range [IQR], 24-40) was significantly longer than from NPSs (19 days; IQR, 14-25; P < .001). Elderly age was an independent factor associated with prolonged virus shedding time of SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.01-2.93). It was noteworthy that in 9 patients, the viral RNA was detected in sputum after NPS turned negative. Chronic lung disease and steroids were associated with virus detection in sputum, and diabetes mellitus was associated with virus detection in both NPS and sputum. INTERPRETATION: These findings may impact a test based clearance discharge criteria given patients with COVID-19 may shed virus longer in their lower respiratory tracts, with potential implication for prolonged transmission risk. In addition, more attention should be given to elderly patients who might have prolonged viral shedding duration.","output":"Differences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Shedding Duration in Sputum and Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens Among Adult Inpatients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Associations between community-level risk factors and COVID-19 incidence are used to identify vulnerable subpopulations and target interventions, but the variability of these associations over time remains largely unknown We evaluated variability in the associations between community-level predictors and COVID-19 case incidence in 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts from March to October 2020 METHODS: Using publicly available sociodemographic, occupational, environmental, and mobility datasets, we developed mixed-effect, adjusted Poisson regression models to depict associations between these variables and town-level COVID-19 case incidence data across five distinct time periods We examined town-level demographic variables, including z-scores of percent Black, Latinx, over 80 years and undergraduate students, as well as factors related to occupation, housing density, economic vulnerability, air pollution (PM 2 5 ), and institutional facilities RESULTS: Associations between key predictor variables and town-level incidence varied across the five time periods We observed reductions over time in the association with percentage Black residents (IRR=1 12 CI=(1 12-1 13) in spring, IRR=1 01 CI=(1 00-1 01) in fall) The association with number of long-term care facility beds per capita also decreased over time (IRR=1 28 CI=(1 26-1 31) in spring, IRR=1 07 CI=(1 05-1 09)in fall) Controlling for other factors, towns with higher percentages of essential workers experienced elevated incidence of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic (e g , IRR=1 30 CI=(1 27-1 33) in spring, IRR=1 20, CI=(1 17-1 22) in fall) Towns with higher percentages of Latinx residents also had sustained elevated incidence over time (e g , IRR=1 19 CI=(1 18-1 21) in spring, IRR=1 14 CI=(1 13-1 15) in fall) CONCLUSIONS: Town-level COVID-19 risk factors vary with time In Massachusetts, racial (but not ethnic) disparities in COVID-19 incidence have decreased over time, perhaps indicating greater success in risk mitigation in selected communities Our approach can be used to evaluate effectiveness of public health interventions and target specific mitigation efforts on the community level","output":"Time-varying associations between COVID-19 case incidence and community-level sociodemographic, occupational, environmental, and mobility risk factors in Massachusetts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reliability of power distribution networks can be threatened due to the health of repair crews.

The prognostic value of GDF-15 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. METHODS: Consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and symptoms of COVID-19 were enrolled in the prospective, observational COVID Mechanisms Study. Biobank samples were collected at baseline, day 3 and day 9. The primary end point was admission to the intensive care unit or death during hospitalization, and the prognostic performance of baseline and serial GDF-15 concentrations were compared with that of established infectious disease and cardiovascular biomarkers. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients enrolled, 35 (28%) reached the primary end point; these patients were older, more often had diabetes, and had lower oxygen saturations and higher National Early Warning Scores on baseline. Baseline GDF-15 concentrations were elevated (>95th percentile in age-stratified healthy individuals) in 97 (79%), and higher concentrations were associated with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viremia and hypoxemia (both P<0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had higher concentrations of GDF-15 (median, 4225 [IQR, 3197C5972] pg/mL versus median, 2187 [IQR, 1344C3620] pg/mL, P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70C0.86). The association between GDF-15 and the primary end point persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (P<0.001) and was superior and incremental to interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.

Compartmental models of epidemic transmission in marine sessile organisms, available only recently, are based on non-spatial descriptions in which space is homogenised and parasite mobility is not explicitly accounted for. However, in realistic scenarios epidemic transmission is conditioned by the spatial distribution of hosts and the parasites mobility patterns, calling for a explicit description of space. In this work we develop a spatially-explicit individual-based model to study disease transmission by waterborne parasites in sessile marine populations. We investigate the impact of spatial disease transmission through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the effects of parasite mobility into the epidemic threshold and the temporal progression of the epidemic are assessed. We show that larger values of pathogen mobility imply more severe epidemics, as the number of infections increases, and shorter time-scales to extinction. An analytical expression for the basic reproduction number of the spatial model is derived as function of the non-spatial counterpart, which characterises a transition between a disease-free and a propagation phase, in which the disease propagates over a large fraction of the system.","output":"Spatial effects in parasite induced marine diseases of immobile hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims The prevalence of catatonia is considered to be approximately 10% in psychiatric inpatients. Clinical experience suggests a lower documented prevalence. This could cause longer admissions and complications, such as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). We carried out a service evaluation to investigate the recognition and management of catatonia on inpatient units in Southern Health Foundation Trust (SHFT). We reviewed the local documented prevalence of catatonia, treatment offered and prevalence of complications. Method We retrospectively reviewed the electronic records of 95 consecutive admissions to four adult inpatient units in SHFT, starting on 1st August 2020. We reviewed notes for the admission to establish whether catatonia was suspected and identified. We applied the screening questions from the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) to the documented mental state examinations (MSE) prior to, and shortly after, admission. We also recorded the prescriptions issued during the first 72 hours of admission, and whether patients developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome or required admission to a general hospital during admission. Result Catatonia was documented as a possibility for 2 patients (2.1%). One showed possible posturing and stupor, while there were no documented symptoms for the other. In both cases the possibility was discounted by the clinical team. Twelve patients (12.6%) showed one or more possible or confirmed signs of catatonia. Eleven of these were prescribed regular antipsychotic medication on admission, but only 3 were prescribed regular benzodiazepines. NMS was more likely to be suspected in patients with a BFCRS of 1 or more compared with those with a score of 0, with an odds ratio of 8.1 (95% CI [1.03-64.0], Fisher's exact test = 7.79, p = .076). Conclusion Catatonia is likely under-recognised and under-treated locally among psychiatric inpatients. Although only approaching statistical significance, the higher rate of suspected NMS in patients showing possible catatonia is noteworthy and needs further investigation. Regular benzodiazepines were not frequently prescribed in this group, while antipsychotics, prescribed in all of these patients, can precipitate NMS. Alternatively, this finding could reflect the overlap in clinical presentation between NMS and catatonia. Data collection was limited by the frequent use of remote clerking, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the quality of mental state examinations was often not sufficient to draw any conclusions on the possible presence or absence of catatonic symptoms.

We report the design and implementation of a hospital-onset COVID-19 infection (HOCI) surveillance system for an acute healthcare setting to target prevention interventions. METHODS: The study took place in a large teaching hospital group in London, UK. All patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 4th March and 14th April 2020 were included. Utilising data routinely collected through electronic healthcare systems we developed a novel surveillance system for determining and reporting HOCI incidence and providing real-time network analysis. We provided daily reports on incidence and trends over time to support HOCI investigation, and generated geo-temporal reports using network analysis to interrogate admission pathways for common epidemiological links to infer transmission chains. By working with stakeholders the reports were co-designed for end users. RESULTS: Real-time surveillance reports revealed: changing rates of HOCI throughout the course of the COVID-19 epidemic; key wards fuelling probable transmission events; HOCIs over-represented in particular specialities managing high-risk patients; the importance of integrating analysis of individual prior pathways; and the value of co-design in producing data visualisation. Our surveillance system can effectively support national surveillance.

Many of these mutations are located in the Spike protein and some of them confer to the virus higher transmissibility or partial resistance to antibody mediated neutralization. Viral variants with such confirmed abilities are designated by WHO as Variants of Concern (VOCs). The aim of this study was to monitor the introduction of variants and VOCs in Venezuela. A small fragment of the viral genome was sequenced for the detection of the most relevant mutations found in VOCs. This approach allowed the detection of Gamma VOC. Its presence was confirmed by complete genome sequencing. The Gamma VOC was detected in Venezuela since January 2021, and in March 2021 was predominant in the East and Central side of the country, representing more than 95% of cases sequenced in all the country in AprilCMay 2021. In addition to the Gamma VOC, other isolates carrying the mutation E484K were also detected. The frequency of this mutation has been increasing worldwide, as shown in a survey of sequences carrying E484K mutation in GISAID, and was detected in Venezuela in many probable cases of reinfection. Complete genome sequencing of these cases allowed us to identify E484K mutation in association with Gamma VOC and other lineages.

The performance of tracheal aspirate (TA) cultures to diagnose CAPA were described, as well as the radiological findings, risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (14/87, 16%) had probable CAPA (0.9 cases per 100 ICU admissions). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of TA for the diagnosis of CAPA were 85.7%, 73.1%, 46.2% and 95% respectively. Most of the radiological findings of CAPA were classified as typical of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (64.3%). The overall mortality rate of probable CAPA was 71.4%.

STUDY DESIGN We analyzed the clinical impact of preemptive thoracic drainage in 177 patients undergoing adult-to-adult LDLT for chronic liver diseases at a single center. Recipients were divided into 2 time periods. The earlier cohort (n = 120) was analyzed for risk factors for postoperative atelectasis retrospectively; the later cohort (n = 57), with a risk factor for postoperative atelectasis, underwent preemptive thoracic drainage prospectively. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was compared between these 2 cohorts. RESULTS Independent risk factors for atelectasis in earlier cohort were body mass index 27 kg/m(2) (p < 0.001), performance status 3 (p = 0.003) and model for end-stage liver disease score 23 (p = 0.005). The rates of atelectasis (21.1% vs 42.5%, p = 0.005) and pneumonia (1.8% vs 10.0%, p = 0.049) were significantly lower in later than in earlier cohort.

The corresponding mortality rate among different countries and times varies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the mortality rate and prevalence of COVID-19 within a country. METHODS: We collected data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. These data included the daily cumulative death count, recovered count, and confirmed count for each country. This study focused on a total of 36 countries with over 10,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Mortality was the main outcome and dependent variable, and it was computed by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths by the number of confirmed cases. RESULTS: The results of our global panel regression analysis showed that there was a highly significant correlation between prevalence and mortality (&#961;=0.8304; P<.001). We found that every increment of 1 confirmed COVID-19 case per 1000 individuals led to a 1.29268% increase in mortality, after controlling for country-specific baseline mortality and time-fixed effects. Over 70% of excess mortality could be attributed to prevalence, and the heterogeneity among countries' mortality-prevalence ratio was significant (P<.001). Further, our results showed that China had an abnormally high and significant mortality-prevalence ratio compared to other countries (P<.001). This unusual deviation in the mortality-prevalence ratio disappeared with the removal of the data that was collected from China after February 17, 2020. It is worth noting that the prevalence of a disease relies on accurate diagnoses and comprehensive surveillance, which can be difficult to achieve due to practical or political concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The association between COVID-19 mortality and prevalence was observed and quantified as the mortality-prevalence ratio. Our results highlight the importance of constraining disease transmission to decrease mortality rates.

A viral nucleic acid test has been used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and some hematological indicators have been used in the auxiliary diagnosis and identification of the severity of COVID-19. There are very few studies available in routine urine biochemical parameters and their relation with Covid-19 patients. Aim: This study is aimed to study the changes in urine parameter values in COVID-19 disease and to predict the severity of the disease with the changes in urine parameters. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients with COVID-19 were admitted at Saveetha Medical College and Hospital during the study period. All cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test done on nasopharyngeal swabs during the study period were included. Patients who tested negative by RT-PCR test were considered as controls. The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 were analysed by Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared test. Results: The positive rates of proteinuria (PRO) and leucocytes were more significant in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The urine specific gravity (SG) value was highly significant (p<0.001) while the blood, nitrites in urine, and potential of hydrogen (pH) value was insignificant.

Alpha-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, declines in blood and reaches the lowest levels (hypovitaminosis E) around calving. Hypovitaminosis E is associated with the incidence of peripartum diseases. Therefore, many studies which have been published for more than 30 years have investigated the effects of -tocopherol supplementation. This -tocopherol deficiency was thought to be caused by complex factors. However, until recently, the physiological factors or pathways underlying hypovitaminosis E in the transition period have been poorly understood. In the last 10 years, the -tocopherol-related genes expression, which regulate the metabolism, transportation, and tissue distribution of -tocopherol in humans and rodents, has been reported in ruminant tissues. In this paper, we discuss at least six physiological phenomena that occur during the transition period and may be candidate factors predisposing to a decreased blood -tocopherol level and hypovitaminosis E with changes in -tocopherol-related genes expression. ABSTRACT: Levels of alpha-tocopherol (-Toc) decline gradually in blood throughout prepartum, reaching lowest levels (hypovitaminosis E) around calving. Despite numerous reports about the disease risk in hypovitaminosis E and the effect of -Toc supplementation on the health of transition dairy cows, its risk and supplemental effects are controversial. Here, we present some novel data about the disease risk of hypovitaminosis E and the effects of -Toc supplementation in transition dairy cows. These data strongly demonstrate that hypovitaminosis E is a risk factor for the occurrence of peripartum disease. Furthermore, a study on the effectiveness of using serum vitamin levels as biomarkers to predict disease in dairy cows was reported, and a rapid field test for measuring vitamin levels was developed. By contrast, evidence for how hypovitaminosis E occurred during the transition period was scarce until the 2010s. Pioneering studies conducted with humans and rodents have identified and characterised some -Toc-related proteins, molecular players involved in -Toc regulation followed by a study in ruminants from the 2010s. Based on recent literature, the six physiological factors: (1) the decline in -Toc intake from the close-up period; (2) changes in the digestive and absorptive functions of -Toc; (3) the decline in plasma high-density lipoprotein as an -Toc carrier; (4) increasing oxidative stress and consumption of -Toc; (5) decreasing hepatic -Toc transfer to circulation; and (6) increasing mammary -Toc transfer from blood to colostrum, may be involved in -Toc deficiency during the transition period. However, the mechanisms and pathways are poorly understood, and further studies are needed to understand the physiological role of -Toc-related molecules in cattle. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hypovitaminosis E will contribute to the prevention of peripartum disease and high performance in dairy cows.","output":"The Physiological Roles of Vitamin E and Hypovitaminosis E in the Transition Period of High-Yielding Dairy Cows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: to describe the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on undetected cases and to evaluate different post-lockdown scenarios. DESIGN: the study introduces a SEIR compartmental model, taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the model is experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European countries, and the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the accuracy of the model results is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature. RESULTS: the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent the main source of infections in the near future. The model is applied to the Hubei case study, which is the first place to relax mobility restrictions. Results show different possible scenarios. Mobility and the adoption of personal protective measures greatly influence the dynamics of the infection, determining either a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one.

Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension.

The primary objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of PDQ screening in palliative care consultation and to characterize responses. The secondary objective was to determine patient and disease factors associated with PDQ response among patients diagnosed with cancer.

A codebook was developed to categorize responses using literature review and template analysis; coding was performed until thematic saturation was achieved. We descriptively analyzed thematic distribution among responders and performed multivariable multinomial regression to determine the association between patient characteristics and PDQ response. RESULTS: Response to the PDQ was documented in 2053/5002 consultations (41.1%); 1877 patient responses were included in final analysis.

CONCLUSION: The PDQ can be used as a means of eliciting values among patients with cancer. Variations in response pattern suggest that approaches to distress may be tailored to age and proximity to death.

In some viral infections, in addition to the pathogenic role of the virus, impaired immune function leads to inflammation and further damage in internal tissues. For example, coronavirus in some patients prevents the stimulation of the acquired immune system. Therefore, innate immunity is over-stimulated to compensate, followed by the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and cytokine storm. Various underlying factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity affect cytokine storm. It seems that cytokine storm is one of the leading causes of death among COVID-19 patients, and providing that this storm is detected and controlled in time, it can reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients. This article aims to investigate the immune system response to COVID-19, various factors associated with cytokine storm, and its treatment. In the current situation, in parallel with the progress made in the field of vaccination, it is necessary to carefully examine the various dimensions of the immune system in response to the COVID-19 virus to seek a suitable treatment strategy to save the lives of patients in intensive care units [ FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of European Journal of Inflammation is the property of Sage Publications Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

As well as synthetic anti-viral drugs, there is also a need to explore natural herbal remedies. The Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) system has been used for thousands of years for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of several chronic diseases. In this paper, we performed an in silico molecular docking and interaction analysis of TCMs against SARS-CoV-2 receptor RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We obtained the 5 most effective plant compounds which had a better binding affinity towards the target receptor protein. These compounds areforsythoside A, rutin, ginkgolide C, icariside II, and nolinospiroside E. The top-ranked compound, based on docking score, was nolinospiroside, a glycoside found in Ophiopogon japonicas that has antioxidant properties. Protein-ligand interaction analysis discerned that nolinospiroside formed a strong bond between ARG 349 of the protein receptor and the carboxylate group of the ligand, forming a stable complex. Hence, nolinospiroside could be deployed as a lead compound against SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be further investigated for its potential benefits in curbing the viral infection.","output":"In Silico Molecular Docking and Interaction Analysis of Traditional Chinese Medicines Against SARS-CoV-2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel phlebovirus, is associated with high fatality.

However, it remains unclear how genetic variations in ACE2 may affect its function and structure, and consequently alter the recognition by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: : We have systemically characterized missense variants in the gene ACE2 using data from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD;N = 141,456). To investigate the putative deleterious role of missense variants, six existing functional prediction tools were applied to evaluate their impact. We further analyzed the structural flexibility of ACE2 and its protein-protein interface with the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 using our developed Legion Interfaces Analysis (LiAn) program. Results: : Here, we characterized a total of 12 ACE2 putative deleterious missense variants. Of those 12 variants, we further showed that p.His378Arg could directly weaken the binding of catalytic metal atom to decrease ACE2 activity and p.Ser19Pro could distort the most important helix to the S-protein. Another seven missense variants may affect secondary structures (i.e. p.Gly211Arg;p.Asp206Gly;p.Arg219Cys;p.Arg219His, p.Lys341Arg, p.Ile468Val, and p.Ser547Cys), whereas p.Ile468Val with AF = 0.01 is only present in Asian. Conclusions: : We provide strong evidence of putative deleterious missense variants in ACE2 that are present in specific populations, which could disrupt the function and structure of ACE2.

Cathepsins are divided into three groups, i.e., cysteine protease, serine protease, and aspartic protease. Cathepsin D and cathepsin L, which are aspartic protease and cysteine protease respectively, have been identified in a number of teleosts; however, the immunological relevance of fish cathepsins is largely unknown. In this study, we cloned and analyzed the expression profiles of a cathepsin D (CsCatD) and a cathepsin L (CsCatL) homologs from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). CsCatD is composed of 396 amino acid residues and shares 67.6C88.4% overall sequence identities with fish and human cathepsin D. Structurally CsCatD possesses an aspartic endopeptidase domain, which contains two conserved aspartic acid residues that form the catalytic site. CsCatL is 336 residues in length and shares 64.7C90.2% overall sequence identities with fish and human cathepsin L. CsCatL has an N-terminal cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain followed by a Papain family cysteine protease domain, the latter containing four conserved catalytic residues: Gln-133, Cys-139, His-279, and Asn-303. Recombinant CsCatL purified from Escherichia coli exhibited apparent protease activity. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis detected constitutive expression of CsCatD and CsCatL in multiple tissues, with the lowest level found in heart and the highest level found in liver. Experimental challenge of tongue sole with the bacterial pathogen Vibrio anguillarum and megalocytivirus caused significant inductions of both CsCatD and CsCatL expression in kidney and spleen in time-dependent manners. Immunization of the fish with a subunit vaccine also enhanced CsCatD and CsCatL expression in the first week post-vaccination.

OBJECTIVE To determine the role of the metalloprotease/shreddase ADAM-17 (A disinterring and metalloproteinase 17) in COVID-19- mediated cytokine release from lung epithelial cells. We hypothesized pharmacological inhibition of ADAM-17 attenuated COVID-19-induced release of TNF- in lung epithelial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Human primary bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (ATCC? , PS-300-010) were cultured to sub-confluence and challenged with COVID-19 Spike Coronavirus pseudovirus (SARS-COV-2 pseudo-virus, MyBioSource), and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, Sigma), which was used as a positive control in the presence or absence of the ADAM-17 inhibitor TNF- Protease Inhibitor-0 (TAPI-0, Sigma). TNF- levels were determined in the cell media at different time points (2-12h) following the challenge using an ELISA assay. Data are represented as mean  SEM, and statistical significance was determined by using the Student's t-test. RESULTS Treatment with both PMA (0.1 M) and SARS-COV-2 pseudovirus (1x108 pseudoviral particles), resulted in a robust increase of TNF- in the culture media 8 h post-stimulation (3243.75 55.3 and 1278.6  357 pg/mL respectively, p <0.05, n = 4). Furthermore, treatment with TAPI-0 resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of the pseudovirus-induced TNF- release by cultured bronchial epithelial cells, with a complete inhibition observed at 100 M of TAPI-0.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used whole genome sequencing to examine genetic variation in 75 Leptospira strains isolated from patients in the Lao PDR (Laos) between 2006 and 2017. Eleven serogroups from 4 Leptospira species and 43 cgMLST-defined clonal groups (CGs) were identified. The most prevalent CG was CG272 (n = 18, 26.8%), composed of L. interrogans serogroup Autumnalis isolates. This genotype was recovered throughout the 12-year period and was associated with deaths, and with a large outbreak in neighbouring Thailand. Genome analysis reveals that the CG272 strains form a highly clonal group of strains that have, for yet unknown reasons, recently spread in Laos and Thailand. Additionally, accessory genes clearly discriminate CG272 strains from the other Leptospira strains. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present study reveals a high diversity of Leptospira genotypes in Laos, thus extending our current knowledge of the pan- and core-genomes of these life-threatening pathogens. Our results demonstrate that the CG272 strains belong to a unique clonal group, which probably evolved through clonal expansion following niche adaptation. Additional epidemiological studies are required to better evaluate the spread of this genotype in Southeast Asia.

Successful attachment of pathogenic microbes to host cells via adhesin molecules is also the first step in many devastating infections. Despite the primacy of epithelial adherence in establishing host-microbe associations, the evolutionary processes that shape this crucial interface remain enigmatic. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) encompass a multifunctional family of vertebrate cell surface proteins which are recurrent targets of bacterial adhesins at epithelial barriers. Here, we show that multiple members of the primate CEACAM family exhibit evidence of repeated natural selection at protein surfaces targeted by bacteria, consistent with pathogen-driven evolution. Divergence of CEACAM proteins between even closely related great apes is sufficient to control molecular interactions with a range of bacterial adhesins. Phylogenetic analyses further reveal that repeated gene conversion of CEACAM extracellular domains during primate divergence plays a key role in limiting bacterial adhesin host tropism. Moreover, we demonstrate that gene conversion has continued to shape CEACAM diversity within human populations, with abundant human CEACAM1 variants mediating evasion of adhesins from pathogenic Neisseria.

We review Fc effector function in passive immunization and vaccination, and primarily focus on strategies to elicit and modulate these functions as part of a robust vaccine strategy. EXPERT OPINION Despite their known correlation with vaccine efficacy for several diseases, only recently have seminal studies addressed how these Fc effector functions can be elicited and modulated in vaccination. However, gaps remain in assay standardization and the precise mechanisms of diverse functional assays. Furthermore, there are inherent difficulties in the translation of findings from animal models to humans, given the difference in sequence, expression and function of Fc receptors and Fc portions of antibodies. Overall, however, it is clear that vaccine development to elicit Fc effector function is an important goal for optimal prevention against infectious disease.","output":"Targeting Fc effector function in vaccine design."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Many patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have symptoms requiring acute and follow-up care. The aims of this study were to assess (1) provider-reported use of medications and their perceived effectiveness and (2) degree of difficulty managing specific symptoms at episodic COVID-19 care sites and in a longitudinal monitoring program. METHODS: We sent an online survey to physicians, advanced practice providers, and registered nurses redeployed to COVID-19 care sites at an academic medical center from March to May 2020. We asked about the use of medications and perceived effectiveness of medications to treat symptoms of COVID-19 and the perceived challenge of symptom management. Comparison was made by provider type (episodic or longitudinal site of care). RESULTS: Responses from 64 providers were included. The most frequently used medications were acetaminophen (87.1% of respondents), benzonatate (83.9%), and albuterol metered dose inhalers (MDI) (80.6%). Therapies for lower respiratory tract symptoms were reported as more commonly used by longitudinal follow-up providers compared to episodic providers including guaifenesin (90.6% vs 60.0%, p = 0.007), benzonatate (93.8% vs 73.3%, p = 0.04), nebulized albuterol for patients with asthma (75.0% vs 43.3%, p = 0.019), and albuterol MDIs for patients without asthma (90.6% vs 66.7%, p = 0.029). Medications found to have the highest perceived efficacy by respondents using the therapy (> 80% reporting \\"very efficacious\\") included albuterol, acetaminophen for fever, non-sedating antihistamines, nasal steroid spray, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for myalgia, arthralgia, or headache. Lower respiratory symptoms and anxiety were rated as the most challenging symptoms to manage. CONCLUSIONS: Providers reported that clinical care of mild COVID-19 with medications in common use for other respiratory infections is effective, both at episodic care and longitudinal sites of care, but that specific symptoms are still challenging to manage.","output":"A Survey of Provider-Reported Use and Perceived Effectiveness of Medications for Symptom Management in Telemedicine and Outpatient Visits for Mild COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With increasing incidence and prevalence of Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the UK, the aim of this study was to explore emerging themes in Idiopathic intracranial hypertension using the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset and to quantify recent change in hospital admissions and surgeries performed within England. Methods: Hospital Episode Statistics national data was extracted between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2019, and followed up until 31 March 2020. All those within England with a diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension were included. Those with secondary causes of raised intracranial pressure such as tumors, hydrocephalus and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were excluded. Results: 28,794 new IIH cases were diagnosed between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2019. Incidence rose between 2002 to 2019 from 1.8 to 5.2 per 100,000 in the general population. Peak incidence occurred in females aged 25C29 years. Neurosurgical shunt was the commonest procedure performed (6.4%), followed by neovascular venous sinus stenting (1%), bariatric surgery (0.8%) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (0.5%). The portion of the total IIH population requiring a shunt fell from 10.8% in 2002/2003 to 2.46% in 2018/2019. The portion of the total IIH population requiring shunt revision also reduced over time from 4.84% in 2002/2003 to 0.44% in 2018/2019. The mean 30 days emergency readmissions for primary shunt, revision of shunt, bariatric surgery, neurovascular stent, and optic nerve sheath fenestration was 23.1%, 23.7%, 10.6%, 10.0% and 9.74%, respectively. There was a peak 30 days readmission rate following primary shunt in 2018/2019 of 41%. Recording of severe visual impairment fell to an all-time low of 1.38% in 2018/19. Conclusions: Increased awareness of the condition, specialist surgery and expert guidance may be changing admissions and surgical trends in IIH.

The objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness of a modified ventilation procedure designed to reduce aerosol-generating bag-mask ventilation (BMV) and isolate possible droplets while maintaining adequate respiratory gas values in ECT sessions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study analyzed the results of the modified protocol applied over a month. Adaptations entailed preoxygenation and extension of the voluntary hyperventilation (VHV) time for two minutes before anesthesia induction, asking patients to hyperventilate with oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and while wearing a face mask. Thereafter, vigorous hyperventilation was avoided, and patients were only assisted with tightly sealed BMV until emergence from anesthesia, isolating the ventilation by using a single-use plastic device. Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (TcPCO(2)) were recorded throughout the session. RESULTS: The study included 74 sessions of bilateral ECT with the modified ventilation protocol in 15 subjects. After VHV, the mean SpO(2) increase was 2.122.14%, and the mean TcPCO(2) decrease was 4.052.98 mmHg. TcPCO(2) values at the moment of stimulus administration were 2.223.07 mmHg below pre-ECT values. The mean EEG seizure was 38.7017.03 s, and postictal suppression was 68.31 34.58% and 2.130.75 on a 0C3 scale. Brief desaturation (SpO(2) <90) of 4C5 seconds duration was observed in 4 sessions. CONCLUSION: This modified ventilation protocol was effective during COVID-19, and it did not elicit significant side effects. In addition to avoiding vigorous BMV, it induced moderate hypocapnia, which has been tied to seizure optimization and less hypercapnia during the apnea period.","output":"Ventilation Adjustment in ECT During COVID-19: Voluntary Hyperventilation is an Effective Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is the main global health crisis of our time and the greatest threat we have faced in this century.

We aimed to systematically review the current evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among PwMS. METHODS: We searched four major databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Scopus). We included peer-reviewed primary research studies using validated quality of life (QoL) and psychometric screening tools reporting data on the prevalence of mental health disorders, the severity of psychological symptoms and contributing demographic and clinical factors for PwMS during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our initial search yielded 121 records; 12 articles were included. Most were conducted during the peak of the pandemic-related lockdown in the host country via an online platform. The included studies used a variety of outcome assessment tools and study designs. The main mental health outcomes were depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality and QoL. As a result, although the prevalence of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety appear to be high among PwMS during the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on mental health among PwMS remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health issues such as anxiety and depression appear fairly common among PwMS during the pandemic, the relationship between the pandemic and mental health among PwMS remains unclear.

In this phase 4, single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial, patients received GZR 100mg/EBR 50mg daily for 12 weeks. Patients with any HCV infection other than genotype-1b (GT-1b), liver decompensation, human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B virus co-infection, a history of NS5A inhibitor exposure, or any severe drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were excluded. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment (SVR12). Of the 14 patients (10 kidney and 4 liver transplant subjects) enrolled in this study, 9 (64%) were females; the median age was 64.0 (range: 43-73) years. The regularly used immunosuppressants were tacrolimus (93%), everolimus (29%), and sirolimus (7%), with patient blood levels easily managed and generally stable (all p> 0.05 in quantile regression analysis). The rate of SVR12 was 100% in intent-to-treat analysis. Only one patient discontinued GZR/EBR therapy at 6 weeks posttreatment due to a treatment-unrelated adverse event (AE); however, this patient remained achieving SVR12. Most AEs were mild in severity and deemed to be not treatment-related. No organ rejection episodes or deaths occurred during the study period.

Using retrospective population-based data, we sought to examine the role and timing that PET scans play in influencing treatment choice, as well as survival in patients treated with chemoradiation (CRT) for stage III NSCLC. MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC from 2009-2017 in Ontario, Canada were identified from the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Overall survival (OS), using a landmark analysis of 6 months, was explored in the entire cohort (PET versus no PET) as well as in patients who received CRT for stage III disease. Survival time was calculated using Kaplan Meier methods, logistic regression was used to evaluate type of treatment received, and Cox regression was used to evaluate factors prognostic of OS amongst patients who received CRT. RESULTS: A total of 13 796 cases were included in our analysis: 6536 pts underwent PET scanning prior to treatment and 7260 did not. Over time, there was a significantly increased utilization of PET from 12.4% in 2009 to 74.1% in 2017 (P < 0.001). In regards to treatment modality, significantly more pts received curative intent therapy in the PET group including: CRT (1472 vs 939 pts; P < 0.001), and surgery (1483 vs 734 pts; P < 0.001). There was significantly improved OS in the whole cohort with upfront PET vs not with median OS of 17.1 (95% CIa?=a?16.3-17.8) vs 11.2 (10.6-11.9) mos (P < 0.001). In pts specifically receiving CRT, OS was similarly improved in the PET vs no PET subgroups with median OS of 21.7 (19.7-24.2) vs 18.5 (16.8-20.7) mos (Pa?=a?0.004). Examining the timing of PET scan and commencement of therapy, no significant difference was found among pts who had their scan 28 days prior to treatment (median OSa?=a?16 mos), 29-56 days prior to treatment (17.8 mos), and > 56 days prior to treatment (18.6 mos), (Pa?=a?0.38); these results were similar in the CRT only subgroup. On multivariate analysis, the only factors predicting survival in the CRT group were male gender (HR 1.20; 1.08-1.33), increasing age (HR 1.07; 1.04-1.10), surgery as part of trimodality therapy (HR 0.60; 0.52-0.70), and receipt of PET prior to treatment (HR 0.83; 0.72-0.95). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in treatment received and OS due to receipt of PET may be due to stage migration or unmeasured confounders. However, in a CRT subgroup, receipt of PET was associated with improved OS. Advocating for increased access to PET scans in this patient population is of utmost importance especially now with an additional survival benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy following CRT. The timing of the PET scan relative to initiating treatment did not have an obvious impact on survival, which may be reassuring for centers that may lack the capability to perform timely scans or are experiencing delays due to the COVID pandemic.","output":"The Role of FDG-PET in Staging and Treatment for Stage III NSCLC in Ontario, Canada Between 2009-2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant hematopoietic disease that is usually incurable. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in the development of many tumors, but their prognostic significance has not been systematically described in MM. Here, we developed a prognostic signature based on eight RBP-related genes to distinguish MM cohorts with different prognoses. METHOD: After screening the differentially expressed RBPs, univariate Cox regression was performed to evaluate the prognostic relevance of each gene using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) dataset. Lasso and stepwise Cox regressions were used to establish a risk prediction model through the training set, and they were validated in three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. We developed a signature based on eight RBP-related genes, which could classify MM patients into high- and low-score groups. The predictive ability was evaluated using bioinformatics methods. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and gene set enrichment analyses were performed to identify potentially significant biological processes (BPs) in MM. RESULT: The prognostic signature performed well in the TCGA-MMRF dataset. The signature includes eight hub genes: HNRNPC, RPLP2, SNRPB, EXOSC8, RARS2, MRPS31, ZC3H6, and DROSHA. KaplanCMeier survival curves showed that the prognosis of the risk status showed significant differences. A nomogram was constructed with age; B2M, LDH, and ALB levels; and risk status as prognostic parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, C-index, calibration analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the risk module and nomogram performed well in 1, 3, 5, and 7-year overall survival (OS). Functional analysis suggested that the spliceosome pathway may be a major pathway by which RBPs are involved in myeloma development. Moreover, our signature can improve on the R-International Staging System (ISS)/ISS scoring system (especially for stage II), which may have guiding significance for the future. CONCLUSION: We constructed and verified the 8-RBP signature, which can effectively predict the prognosis of myeloma patients, and suggested that RBPs are promising biomarkers for MM.","output":"Identification and Validation of a Novel RNA-Binding Protein-Related Gene-Based Prognostic Model for Multiple Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human protein-coding gene ILRUN (inflammation and lipid regulator with UBA-like and NBR1-like domains; previously C6orf106) was identified as a proviral factor for Hendra virus infection and was recently characterized to function as an inhibitor of type I interferon expression. Here, we have utilized transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to define cellular pathways regulated by ILRUN in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of Caco-2 cells. We find that inhibition of ILRUN expression by RNA interference alters transcription profiles of numerous cellular pathways, including upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and several other members of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. In addition, transcripts of the SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors TMPRSS2 and CTSL were also upregulated. Inhibition of ILRUN also resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, while overexpression of ILRUN had the opposite effect, identifying ILRUN as a novel antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication. This represents, to our knowledge, the first report of ILRUN as a regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

Preventive measures are taken at all workplaces to stop the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing, regular hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds, use of alcohol- based hand sanitizer and cough etiquette must be practiced at all times.

Since its discovery in November 2011, SBV has spread very rapidly to many European countries. Here, we developed molecular and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions. Using a synthetic biology approach, we developed a reverse genetics system for the rapid rescue and genetic manipulation of SBV. We showed that SBV has a wide tropism in cell culture and synthetic SBV replicates in vitro as efficiently as wild type virus. We developed an experimental mouse model to study SBV infection and showed that this virus replicates abundantly in neurons where it causes cerebral malacia and vacuolation of the cerebral cortex. These virus-induced acute lesions are useful in understanding the progression from vacuolation to porencephaly and extensive tissue destruction, often observed in aborted lambs and calves in naturally occurring Schmallenberg cases. Indeed, we detected high levels of SBV antigens in the neurons of the gray matter of brain and spinal cord of naturally affected lambs and calves, suggesting that muscular hypoplasia observed in SBV-infected lambs is mostly secondary to central nervous system damage. Finally, we investigated the molecular determinants of SBV virulence. Interestingly, we found a biological SBV clone that after passage in cell culture displays increased virulence in mice. We also found that a SBV deletion mutant of the non-structural NSs protein (SBVNSs) is less virulent in mice than wild type SBV. Attenuation of SBV virulence depends on the inability of SBVNSs to block IFN synthesis in virus infected cells.

These studies identify as main metabolic consequences increases in insulin resistance, total body fat, abdominal fat and inflammatory cytokines. All these factors have been strongly associated with the development of metabolic syndrome, which in turn increases the risk of multiple chronic diseases. A plausible mechanism involved in these impacts could be a positive energy balance promoted by maintaining usual dietary intake while reducing energy expenditure. This means that just as calorie intake restriction could help mitigate the deleterious impacts of a bout of physical inactivity, overeating under conditions of home confinement is very likely to exacerbate these consequences. Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been identified as potential risk factors for more severely ill patients with COVID-19.

One important pollutant in this context is NO2. Sudden change in NO2 emissions related to reduction of urban traffic due to infection protection measures can be detected in Dsseldorf, Germany with continuous measurements of down-welling light with a RoX automated field-spectrometer. In comparison to a nearby reference instrument, a waveband around 590 nm was identified as significant for the retrieval in the VIS-NIR spectral range. A decision tree based on principal components which were decomposed from down-welling radiance spectra has been the most robust approach to retrieved NO2 values. Better differentiation of the NO2 value-range is achieved with a partial least square regression model. The results suggest that traffic-related changes of NOx pollution in urban air can be detected through continuous down-welling radiance measurements with inexpensive automated field-spectrometer systems.","output":"Changes of NOx in urban air detected with monitoring VIS-NIR field spectrometer during the coronavirus pandemic: A case study in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] A series of thiazol-4-one/thiophene-bearing pyrazole derivatives as pharmacologically attractive cores were initially synthesized using a hybridization approach. All structures were confirmed using spectra analysis techniques (IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR). In vitro antimicrobial activities, including the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), and time-kill assay, were evaluated for the most active derivatives 4a, 5a, 7b, 10, and 13. These derivatives were significantly active against the tested pathogens, with compound 7b as the most active derivative (MIC values range from 0.22 to 0.25 g/mL). In the MBC and MFC, the active target pyrazole derivatives showed -cidal activities toward the pathogenic isolates. Further, the inhibition of biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was also carried out. Additionally, these derivatives displayed significant antibiofilm potential with a superior % reduction in the biofilm formation compared with Ciprofloxacin. The target derivatives behaved synergistically with Ciprofloxacin and Ketoconazole, reducing their MICs. Hemolytic results revealed that these derivatives were nontoxic with a significantly low hemolytic activity (%lysis range from 3.23 to 15.22%) compared with Triton X-100 and showed noncytotoxicity activity with IC(50) values > 60 M. In addition, these derivatives proved to be active DNA gyrase and DHFR inhibitors with IC(50) ranging between 12.27C31.64 and 0.52C2.67 M, respectively. Furthermore, compound 7b showed bactericidal activity at different concentrations in the time-kill assay. Moreover, a gamma radiation dose of 10.0 kGy was efficient for sterilizing compound 7b and enhancing its antimicrobial activity.

Our study shows Canada still stands below the top-performing countries in skills development, and has no comprehensive approach toward lifelong learning. As well, the participation gap in training between high- and low-skilled and educated people is large. In 2019, the federal government announced the Canada Training Benefit, a universal skills development program intended only for employed Canadians who meet eligibility criteria;several temporary skills training programs have also been introduced in 2021, after more than a year into the pandemic. Some features of these programs need improvement, however, particularly in regards to eligibility criteria and addressing barriers. Despite the growing importance of training the workforce and the availability of various programs, individuals, businesses and governments face several challenges in taking the necessary steps to ensure sustainable upskilling and reskilling. Evidence shows that businesses play a central role in providing training to their employees, but they invest less in low-skilled employees because of lower returns. However, the wider social returns from lifelong learning for adults with low qualifications can be high because it improves their employability, reduces their dependency on unemployment benefits and other targeted transfer spending and boosts inclusive growth. Although subsidies to businesses promote participation in lifelong learning, employers normally fail to address the needs of low-skilled employees. Another acute problem is long-term unemployment post-COVID. In September 2021, it stood 124 percent above the pre-pandemic level in February 2020. This unprecedented growth in long-term joblessness resulted in an increase in the proportion of long-term unemployment by about twelve percentage points to more than 27 percent in September 2021. A sizeable share of the long-term unemployed in September 2021 were unemployed for 52 weeks or more (63 percent) and prime-working-age adults (59 percent). As the Canadian labour market recovers from the pandemic, adult education will be pivotal in ensuring that individuals have the right tools to adapt to the new skills the market demands. Skills acquisition is a moving target that needs a dynamic response. Therefore, governments need to pursue a comprehensive adult education and training strategy centred around public and private sector collaboration to identify skills needs and barriers, and to support the development and implementation of strategies to ensure the strategys effectiveness. The goal should be to prepare the workforce to thrive in an environment of rapidly changing demand for skills and more frequent disruption. Governments also need to recognize the limitations of training by businesses, and be prepared themselves to provide high-quality training support to disadvantaged individuals and the long-term unemployed.","output":"The Skills Imperative: Workforce Development Strategies Post-COVID (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To assess changes in the mobility of staff between long-term care homes in Ontario, Canada before and after enactment of public policy restricting staff from working at multiple homes. Design: Pre-post observational study. Setting and Participants: 623 long-term cares homes in Ontario, Canada between March 2020 and June 2020. Methods: We used anonymized mobile device location data to approximate connectivity between all 623 long-term care homes in Ontario during the 7 weeks before (March 1 - April 21) and after (April 22 - June 13) the policy restricting staff movement was implemented. We visualized connectivity between long-term care homes in Ontario using an undirected network and calculated the number of homes that had a connection with another long-term care home and the average number of connections per home in each period. We calculated the relative difference in these mobility metrics between the two time periods and compared within-home changes using McNemar's test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: In the period preceding restrictions, 266 (42.7%) long-term care homes had a connection with at least one other home, compared to 79 (12.7%) homes during the period after restrictions, a drop of 70.3% (p <0.001). The average number of connections in the before period was 3.90 compared to 0.77 in after period, a drop of 80.3% (p < 0.001). In both periods, mobility between long-term care homes was higher in homes located in larger communities, those with higher bed counts, and those part of a large chain. Conclusions and Implications: Mobility between long-term care homes in Ontario fell sharply after an emergency order by the Ontario government limiting long-term care staff to a single home, though some mobility persisted. Reducing this residual mobility should be a focus of efforts to reduce risk within the long-term care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of a public policy restricting staff mobility between long-term care homes in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Affection of the central nervous system and the eyes is increasingly recognized as manifestations of a SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19).

A single cell therapy laboratory was selected to function as the central cryopreservation hub for all European registry donor transplants intended for the Australian-Pacific region. We examined properties of these transplants to ascertain how quality is maintained. METHODS: We analyzed 100 pandemic-related allogeneic mobilized blood-derived stem cell apheresis products generated at 30 collection sites throughout Europe, shipped to and cryopreserved at our center between April and November of 2020. Products were shipped in the cool, subsequently frozen with DMSO as cryoprotectant. Irrespective of origin, all products were frozen within the prescribed shelf-life of 72 h. RESULTS: Prior to cryopreservation, viable stem cell and leukocyte count according to the collection site and our reference laboratory were highly concordant (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.93, respectively) and viability was > 90% in all instances. Median nominal post-thaw recovery of viable CD34+ cells was 42%. Weakly associated with poorer CD34+ cell recovery was higher leukocyte concentration, but not time lag between apheresis or addition of cryopreservant, respectively, and start of freezing. The correlation between pre- and post-thaw CD34+ cell dose was high (r(2) = 0.85), hence predictable. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were prompt with no evidence of dose dependency within the range of administered cell doses (1.31C15.56  10(6) CD34+ cells/kg). CONCLUSIONS: General cryopreservation of allogeneic stem cell transplants is feasible. While more than half of the CD34+ cell content is lost, the remaining stem cells ensure timely engraftment.

HCRG21 in doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg inhibited edema formation compared to the control, demonstrated complete edema disappearance in 24 h in a dose of 1 mg/kg, and effectively reduced the productionof TNF- in both doses examined. ELISA analysis of blood taken 24 h after carrageenan administration showed a dramatic cytokine value decrease to 25 pg/mL by HCRG21 versus 100 pg/mL in the negative control group, which was less than the TNF- level in the intact group (40 pg/mL). The HCRG21 demonstrated potent analgesic effects on the models of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in carrageenan-induced paw edema. The HCRG21 relief effect was comparable to that of indomethacin taken orally in a dose of 5 mg/kg, but was superior to this nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in duration (which lasted 24 h) in the mechanical sensitivity experiment. The results confirm the existence of a close relationship between TRPV1 activity and TNF- production once again, and prove the superior pharmacological potential of TRPV1 blockers and the HCRG21 peptide in particular.","output":"TRPV1 Blocker HCRG21 Suppresses TNF- Production and Prevents the Development of Edema and Hypersensitivity in Carrageenan-Induced Acute Local Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) constitute an important group of metabolic diseases, consisting of approximately 60 disorders. In some types of lysosomal diseases, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is administered intravenously in weekly or biweekly doses. Unfortunately, scheduled ERT during COVID-19 was disrupted. We considered the possibility of adverse outcomes caused by the disruption in the treatment of patients with lysosomal storage disorders. METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a questionnaire that was delivered via Internet to assess how this vulnerable patient group was affected by the pandemic in terms of their access to treatment and their disease-related symptoms. RESULTS: The questionnaire was filled out by 75 patients. There were 35 patients whose treatment dose was missed because of COVID-19. The most common reason for skipping treatment was not wanting to go to the hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19. These 35 patients missed a median of four doses of ERT (range: 1-16 dosages). Twenty-one patients (60%) claimed that they were affected physically by not taking ERT (20 mucopolysaccaridoses, 1 Fabry disease), whereas 14 (40%) did not. CONCLUSIONS: Interruption of ERT during the COVID-19 pandemic may have significant consequences. It may be beneficial to switch to home treatment or reserve dedicated facilities. With proper planning and management, the treatment disruptions of this particular group can be avoided.","output":"Invisible burden of COVID-19: enzyme replacement therapy disruptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest global outbreak of 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is triggered by the inception of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2. If recent events are of any indicators of the epidemics of past, it is undeniable to state a fact that the SARS-CoV2 viral infection is highly transmissible with respect to its previously related SARS-CoV's. Papain-like protease (PLpro) is an enzyme that is required by the virus itself for replicating into the host system; and it does so by processing its polyproteins into a functional replicase complex. PLpro is also known for downregulating the genes responsible for producing interferons, an essential family of molecules produced in response to viral infection, thus making this protein an indispensable drug target. In this study, PLpro inhibitors were identified through high throughput structure-based virtual screening approach from NPASS natural product library possessing ~ 35,000 compounds. Top five hits were scrutinised based on structural aromaticity and ability to interact with a key active site residue of PLpro, Tyr268. For second level of screening, the MM-GBSA End-Point Binding Free Energy Calculation of the docked complexes was performed, which identified Caesalpiniaphenol A as the best hit. Caesalpiniaphenol A not only possess a double ring aromatic moiety but also has lowest minimum binding energy, which is at par with the control GRL0617, the only known inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro. Details of the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and ADMET analysis helped to conclusively determine Caesalpiniaphenol A as potentially an inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro.","output":"Meticulous assessment of natural compounds from NPASS database for identifying analogue of GRL0617, the only known inhibitor for SARS-CoV2 papain-like protease (PLpro) using rigorous computational workflow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE ?) molecule that directs cytotoxic T-cells to lyse CD19-expressing B lineage cells, has been investigated in NHL (Goebeler JCO 2016, Viardot Blood 2016, Katz ASH 2019). Here, we evaluated subcutaneous (SC) blinatumomab, which may simplify administration, improve convenience, and potentially reduce adverse events (AEs). Methods: Patients (pts;18 y) had indolent NHL (follicular, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic, mantle cell, or small lymphocytic) that was primary refractory (1+ prior line), relapsed (within 1 y of first response), or that had responded to initial therapy for 1 y and relapsed after 2+ lines, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Disease must not have been irradiated and was measurable (1.5 cm) on PET-CT or CT. Pts had a 3-wk continuous intravenous (cIV) run-in period followed by SC dosing in 5 cohorts, a further 2 wks of cIV dosing, and the option for a second cycle of cIV dosing (Figure). The primary objective was safety and tolerability of SC blinatumomab;secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK), estimating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), ie, the highest dose at which 1/6 pts had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and efficacy (NCT 02961881). Results: Pts (n=29) had a median (range) age of 64 (42-75) y, 55% were male, 90% Caucasian, with follicular I-IIIA (76%), marginal zone (10%), mantle cell (10%) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (3%) subtypes;no pts had prior allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), 38% had prior auto-HSCT. Of the 29 pts, 5 discontinued (D/C) blinatumomab due to AEs (n=3;2 cIV, 1 SC), pt request (1), and disease progression (1);no pts D/C due to COVID-19 control measures;26 pts completed the study;pts received a median (range) of 5 (3-10) doses. AEs leading to D/C in SC treatment included neurologic events of aphasia and seizure. During SC dosing, 2 DLTs occurred (aphasia, n=1;seizure, n=1 ). MTD was not reached. Five pts had grade 3 (G3) AEs (thrombocytopenia, erosive esophagitis, asthenia, device-related infection, hyperglycemia, aphasia, seizure;pts may have had >1 G3 AE);there were no G4 AEs or fatal AEs. AEs of interest included neurologic events (all, n=15;G3, n=2), infection (2;1), and cytokine release syndrome (4;0). One pt had grade 1 injection site erythema. Anti-blinatumomab antibodies have not been detected to date. Preliminary PK results were consistent across the 5 SC cohorts and 3 different dosing regimens. Following the first dose, maximum concentrations (C max) were reached after ~5-12 hours and exposures (C max and area under concentration-time curve [AUC] from 0-12 hours) increased in a dose-related manner. At steady state, exposures (AUC over the dosing interval) increased in a dose-related manner for dosing intervals of once every 12, 24, and 48 hours across cohorts. Blinatumomab bioavailability and apparent terminal elimination half-life were favorable for extending the dosing interval to once every other day and potentially longer intervals. The steady-state concentrations during both cIV infusion periods were consistent with those previously reported in NHL pts. In all pts, the overall response rate (ORR, representative of cIV, 5 wks and SC, 1wk) per Cheson criteria was 69% (evaluable, n=23: complete response [CR], 21%;partial response [PR], 48%;cycle 1 [C1], n=22: ORR, 62%;CR, 14%;PR,48%;cycle 2 [C2], n=17: 45%;17%;28%;respectively);per Lugano criteria, the ORR was 52% (n=21: CR, 24%;PR, 28%;C1, n=18: 45%;17%;28%;C2, n=12: 31%;21%;10%);for follicular lymphoma, ORR was 77% per Cheson (n=19: CR, 23%;PR, 55%) and 55% per Lugano (n=15: CR, 23%;PR, 32%). Conclusions: In pts with R/R indolent NHL, SC blinatumomab had a favorable safety profile, with the caveat that pts who could not tolerate cIV blinatumomab did not advance to SC dosing. Efficacy was comparable with that seen for cIV dosing in prior blinatumomab NHL studies. In contrast to prior blinatumomab trials, no dose dependency in efficacy or toxicity was observed because SC dosi g was administered for only 1 wk, after 3 wks of cIV;pts not tolerating cIV did not receive SC dosing. Safety/tolerability of blinatumomab SC administration over the whole cycle is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 trial of pts with R/R acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NCT 04521231). SC blinatumomab PK, including bioavailability and half-life, showed promising features, warranting further investigation.

As an important protein material in the food industry, soybean protein isolate (SPI) experiences interesting changes through polyphenols binding. (2) Methods: In this study, a molecular docking and virtual screening method was established to evaluate the SPICpolyphenol interaction. A compound library composed of 33 commonly found food source polyphenols was used in virtual screening. The binding capacity of top-ranking polyphenols (rutin, procyanidin, cyanidin chloride, quercetin) was validated and compared by fluorescence assays. (3) Results: Four out of five top-ranking polyphenols in virtual screening were flavonoids, while phenolic acids exhibit low binding capacity. Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were found to be dominant interactions involved in soybean proteinCpolyphenol binding. Cyanidin chloride exhibited the highest apparent binding constant (Ka), which was followed by quercetin, procyanidin, and rutin. Unlike others, procyanidin addition perturbed a red shift of SPI fluorescence, indicating a slight conformational change of SPI.

We aimed to assess the clinical severity of infections with the omicron variant using S gene target failure (SGTF) on the Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 PCR test as a proxy. METHODS: We did data linkages for national, South African COVID-19 case data, SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data, SARS-CoV-2 genome data, and COVID-19 hospital admissions data. For individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 via TaqPath PCR tests, infections were designated as either SGTF or non-SGTF. The delta variant was identified by genome sequencing. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we assessed disease severity and hospitalisations by comparing individuals with SGTF versus non-SGTF infections diagnosed between Oct 1 and Nov 30, 2021, and we further assessed disease severity by comparing SGTF-infected individuals diagnosed between Oct 1 and Nov 30, 2021, with delta variant-infected individuals diagnosed between April 1 and Nov 9, 2021. FINDINGS: From Oct 1 (week 39), 2021, to Dec 6 (week 49), 2021, 161 328 cases of COVID-19 were reported in South Africa. 38 282 people were diagnosed via TaqPath PCR tests and 29 721 SGTF infections and 1412 non-SGTF infections were identified. The proportion of SGTF infections increased from two (32%) of 63 in week 39 to 21 978 (979%) of 22 455 in week 48. After controlling for factors associated with hospitalisation, individuals with SGTF infections had significantly lower odds of admission than did those with non-SGTF infections (256 [24%] of 10 547 vs 121 [128%] of 948; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 02, 95% CI 01C03). After controlling for factors associated with disease severity, the odds of severe disease were similar between hospitalised individuals with SGTF versus non-SGTF infections (42 [21%] of 204 vs 45 [40%] of 113; aOR 07, 95% CI 03C14). Compared with individuals with earlier delta variant infections, SGTF-infected individuals had a significantly lower odds of severe disease (496 [625%] of 793 vs 57 [234%] of 244; aOR 03, 95% CI 02C05), after controlling for factors associated with disease severity. INTERPRETATION: Our early analyses suggest a significantly reduced odds of hospitalisation among individuals with SGTF versus non-SGTF infections diagnosed during the same time period. SGTF-infected individuals had a significantly reduced odds of severe disease compared with individuals infected earlier with the delta variant. Some of this reduced severity is probably a result of previous immunity.

ChimLeish reacted with sera from all VL and VL/HIV coinfected patients [Se = 100%; Sp = 100%; area under the curve (AUC) = 1.0]. Peptides showed lower reactivities (Se = 76.8 to 99.2%; Sp = 67.1 to 95.7%; AUC between 0.87 and 0.98) as did a L. infantum antigenic preparation used as an antigen control (Se = 56.8%; Sp = 69.5%: AUC = 0.45). Notably, ChimLeish demonstrated a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of anti-ChimLeish antibodies after treatment and cure of a small number of patients. Although only a limited serological panel was tested, preliminary data suggest that ChimLeish should be evaluated in larger sample studies for the diagnosis of VL and VL/HIV coinfection.","output":"ChimLeish, a new recombinant chimeric protein evaluated as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for visceral leishmaniasis and human immunodeficiency virus coinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo.

This model derived environment-aware infection rate, the basic reproduction number and its upper bound. The upper bound of EA-SIR' s basic reproduction number wasn't greater than the classic SIR indicating that virus was difficult to spread in EA-SIR. People' s sense of self-protection helped block the spread of virus, therefore, EA-SIR was suitable for describing the virus spread theoretically. This paper conducted experiments using COVID-19 data of Diamond Princess and four cities in China to evaluate the performance of EA-SIR,and used mean absolute error as evaluation standard.

These conversations have spread various conspiracies about vaccines against COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to develop communication strategies, led by official accounts, that offer accessible information on vaccination as a preventive public health strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of public institutions on Twitter campaign #yomevacuno to deal with misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19. METHODS: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8th to 23rd, 2020. Tweets included content #yomevacuno hashtag. RESULTS: A total of 6,080 interactions were collected, 82% were tweets. Data shows that public institutions generate 53.36% of traffic information, the most important was the Ministerio de Sanidad from Spain. Content analysis revealed that 48% of a sample of 50 Tweets the message was focused on vaccination as a social responsibility to defeat COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The communication strategy of #yomevacuno hashtag, has been led by the Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, by comparison to other campaigns in which there was no large presence of public institutions. This case represents the importance of social media as a way to spread information and prevention, even in public health and the need for them to be led by public organizations rather than by individual users.","output":"[COVID-19 and vaccination: analysis of public institution's role in information spread through Twitter.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Before public health emergencies became a major challenge worldwide, the scope of laboratory management was only related to developing, maintaining, improving, and sustaining the quality of accurate laboratory results for improved clinical outcomes. Indeed, quality management is an especially important aspect and has achieved great milestones during the development of clinical laboratories. CURRENT STATUS: However, since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a threat worldwide, previous management mode inside the separate laboratory could not cater to the demand of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Among emerging new issues, the prominent challenges during the period of COVID-19 pandemic are rapid-launched laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) for urgent clinical application, rapid expansion of testing capabilities, laboratory medicine resources, and personnel shortages. These related issues are now impacting on clinical laboratory and need to be effectively addressed. CONCLUSION: Different from traditional views of laboratory medicine management that focus on separate laboratories, present clinical laboratory management must be multidimensional mode which should consider consolidation of the efficient network of regional clinical laboratories and reasonable planning of laboratories resources from the view of overall strategy. Based on relevant research and our experience, in this review, we retrospect the history trajectory of laboratory medicine management, and also, we provide existing and other feasible recommended management strategies for laboratory medicine in future.","output":"COVID-19-another influential event impacts on laboratory medicine management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: To highlight the challenges associated with providing sedation and analgesia to critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and also understand the pathophysiological alterations induced by the disease process as well as the logistical difficulties encountered by providers caring for these patients. We also discuss the rationale and risks associated with the use of common sedative agents specifically within the context of COVID-19 and provide evidence-based management strategies to help manage sedation and analgesia in such patients. Recent Findings: A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care and mechanical ventilation, thus requiring sedation and analgesia. These patients tend to require higher doses of sedative medications and often for long periods of time. Most of the commonly used sedative and analgesic agents carry unique risks that should be considered within the context of the unique pathophysiology of COVID-19, the logistical issues the disease poses, and the ongoing drug shortages. Summary: With little attention being paid to sedation practices specific to patients with COVID-19 in critical care literature and minimal mention in national guidelines, there is a significant gap in knowledge. We review the existing literature to discuss the unique challenges that providers face while providing sedation and analgesia to critically ill patients with COVID-19 and propose evidence-based management strategies.","output":"Challenges in Sedation Management in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: a Brief Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is most commonly associated with respiratory syndromes, although patients are presenting more frequently with neurological symptoms. When they occur, neurological conditions most commonly involve the central nervous system, and peripheral nervous system effects, particularly in the extremities, have been less commonly described. The mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are likely to be multifactorial, and extremity peripheral nerve imaging in these cases has not been well described. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case series, we describe the magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) findings in 3 critically ill patients who presented with new onset of peripheral neuropathies in the extremities, and we discuss possible common mechanisms of nerve injury, including the role of position-related nerve injury. CONCLUSIONS: MRN can be useful in identifying and localizing peripheral nerve abnormalities in the extremities of COVID-19 patients, and patients who are placed in the prone position during ventilation may be more susceptible to these injuries.","output":"Magnetic resonance neurography findings in three critically ill COVID-19 patients with new onset of extremity peripheral neuropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face shield is a personal protective equipment required for healthcare professionals to decrease the risk of contamination during the COVID-19. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is the most applied process of additive manufacturing due to its usability and low-cost. The injection molding (IM) is the fastest process for mass industrial production. The comparison between the FDM and IM process to produce plastic parts is well known, but this study is the first to perform a qualitative comparison of these processes for mass-production and distribution of face shields in a pandemic. The design of the face shield was developed in three prototyping cycles based on requirements of medical, Brazilian regulatory standards, manufacturing, and production. The FDM manufacturing of 35,000 face shields was carried out by a volunteer network using low-cost 3D printer and the IM manufacturing of 80,000 was carried out by partner companies. With the production of face shields through the FDM process, it was possible to make daily deliveries of small batches to local hospitals. A total of 80,000 face shields was produced in larger batches by the IM process and delivered to remote regions in Brazil. Considering the manufacturing resilience of the processes (quality, costs, and production time), in a situation such as the current COVID-19 pandemic with disturbances and uncertainties, both FDM and IM processes are suitable for mass production of face shields. The FDM process promotes a fast-daily production once a committed network of volunteers is formed in strategic regions. The IM process was the best option for large scale production of face shields and delivery to remote regions without the availability of 3D printers.","output":"Additive manufacturing and injection molding process for mass-production of face shields during COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a cross-sectional study investigating the factors affecting brazilians' self-rated health during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on data from the web-based behavior survey.

Statistical analysis was based on a hierarchical model of determination. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, lifestyle indicators and intensity of social restraint measures, and biological and psychological issues during the pandemic. From the total sample of 45,161 participants, 29.4% reported worsening of health state during this period. After adjusting for hierarchical distal factors, the health problems mostly associated with worsening health state were: bad self-rated health (adjusted OR = 4.35, p < 0.001), health care seeking for mental health problem (adjusted OR = 3.95, p < 0.001), and for COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 3.60, p < 0.001).

Conceptualizing cybersecurity industry clusters as ecosystems, we focus on three distinct mega-clusters: the San Francisco Bay Area, metropolitan Washington, D.C., and Israel. Benefits of clustering include: access to a pool of specialized labor, knowledge spillover, access to capital, and inter-organizational linkages. Research suggests that clusters economics should be linked to their social dimensions and the configuration of the built environment. In addition, based on the empirical analysis, we suggest using a nuanced taxonomy of cybersecurity clusters using a spectrum of intensities: mega-, mesa- and micro-clusters, sub-clusters, and hot zones. The Big3 clusters were catalyzed during the 1990s cybersecurity genesis C even before cybersecurity was recognizable as a distinct sub-industry within high-tech C and certainly well before the term cybersecurity was coined. All three cybersecurity clusters emerged as specialized clusters embedded within a larger high-tech ecosystem. At the same time, government was a key actor in facilitating the high-tech and defense ecosystems in each of these three regions. Cluster concentration remains high: the Big3 mega-clusters, hegemonic since their founding, together serve as headquarters for 53% of the largest and most influential global cybersecurity firms. Cybersecurity industry dynamics. The industry can be viewed as a manifestation of two far-reaching relationship interplays: industry clustering processes and place (meaning, the industrys socio-spatial context). Regarding the first: there is some evidence of rapid industry consolidation  especially within the Big3 clusters (393 firms merged or acquired through 2018). However, the industry still remains quite fragmented because of the continued entry of new players and the breakup of some giant firms (e.g., Symantec). The second interplay is between place and social context, human capital, and institutions. Via comprehensive mapping, we show that cybersecurity clusters are situated in large, diverse urban regions, within complex, multi-modal transportation networks, with proximate universities, and layered on household income sectors.Lessons for smaller clusters globally. Cybersecurity clusters (and sub-clusters) grow where one of two conditions exists: an anchor organization (such as the National Security Agency outside Washington) and/or where there is already a strong high-tech culture (as in Silicon Valley). Nurturing a new cybersecurity cluster is a long-term strategy, one that requires many years of patience (as in the Beer Sheva sub-cluster in Israel). Local governments have been nurturing cybersecurity clusters specifically for about a decade with tax benefits, partnerships, and advocacy programs. However, these policies do not take place in a vacuum;rather, they are part of the ongoing competition between regions and cities. Thus, purposeful cluster growth requires more than a bundle of policies;it needs a cohesive strategic plan that structures a set of policies for nurturing the industrial ecosystem. Only with a holistic vision, which considers the social, economic and spatial context, can a cybersecurity cluster evolve and grow. Finally, we identify three cybersecurity industry/cluster challenges for the future. First is the persistent cybersecurity workforce shortageapparent in both countries covered in this report. The second challenge is the resiliency of these high-tech clusters as the hegemony of global cities is expected to diminish post-COVID-19, with the workforce migrating out of expensive and unhealthy urban areas. The third challenge is the durability of the cybersecurity industry itself. Are there too many cybersecurity firms? Will a new generation of technologies reconfigure these firms? In sum, cyber industry cannot be understood in isolation, but only as part of a larger context. Although this industry has some unique features, cybersecurity cluster are not autonomous, and their emergence is connected to a wider technological infrastructure, and to a particular political urban and regional context.","output":"The Dynamics of the Largest Cybersecurity Industrial Clusters: San Francisco Bay Area, Washington D.C.

As such, the identification of inhibitory drugs against its etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is of utmost importance, and in particular, repurposing may provide the fastest route to curb the disease. As the first step in this route, we sought to identify an attractive and viable target in the virus for pharmaceutical inhibition. Using three bacteria-based assays that were tested on known viroporins, we demonstrate that one of its essential components, the E protein, is a potential ion channel and, therefore, is an excellent drug target. Channel activity was demonstrated for E proteins in other coronaviruses, providing further emphasis on the importance of this functionally to the virus' pathogenicity. The results of a screening effort involving a repurposing drug library of ion channel blockers yielded two compounds that inhibit the E protein: Gliclazide and Memantine. In conclusion, as a route to curb viral virulence and abate COVID-19, we point to the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 as an attractive drug target and identify off-label compounds that inhibit it.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 E protein is a potential ion channel that can be inhibited by Gliclazide and Memantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ACE2 has long been known as an injury protective protein, it can protect a variety of organ damage such as heart, liver, kidney and lung.

Nevertheless, with the recent outbreak of COVID-19, it was exposed that another identity of ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which previously served as the entry receptor for SARS. With the in-depth clinical research, it was found that the severity and susceptibility of COVID-19 are related to cardiovascular disease, and SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 receptor is also potentially associated with heart injury symptoms.

Asthma inflammatory phenotypes based on blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts have never been identified and characterized in population-based studies. METHODS: Adults with current asthma and available blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts from the French population-based CONSTANCES cohort were included. Current asthma was defined by reports of asthma attacks, symptoms or treatments in the last 12 months. Inflammatory phenotypes were based on low (L) and high (H) blood (B) eosinophil (E) (LBE/HBE: </?025  10(9)/L, respectively) and neutrophil (N) (LBN/HBN: </?5  10(9)/L, respectively) cut-offs. Associations between inflammatory phenotypes and the clinical expressions of asthma were studied using logistic models adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, education level, French deprivation index and treatment. Other cut-offs were applied. Stratified analyses according to age or sex were performed. FINDINGS: Among 15,019 adults with asthma (56% women, 59%40 years), the LBE/LBN (reference), LBE/HBN, HBE/LBN and HBE/HBN phenotypes accounted for 57%, 6%, 33% and 4% respectively. The LBE/HBN phenotype was associated with being awaken by an attack of coughing, chronic bronchitis, and dyspnoea (adjusted(a)OR ranging from 121 to 142). The HBE/LBN and HBE/HBN phenotypes were associated with asthma attacks (aOR=131[120-142], 125[102-153]) and asthma symptom score (p for trend<00001, p for trend=0001, respectively). The HBE/LBN phenotype was also associated with being awaken with chest tightness (aOR=130[120-140]). Results were unchanged whatever the cut-offs used. No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed according to age or sex. INTERPRETATION: Differences in the clinical expressions of asthma were found between the phenotypes, reproducible whatever the cut-offs used, and similar to those observed in case-control and clinical studies. Such phenotypes are of interest to improve asthma management and study its environmental risk factors.

Therefore, this study aimed: (i) to reiterate the importance of the autoptic examination, the only method able to precisely define the cause of death; (ii) to provide a complete post-mortem histological and immunohistochemical investigation pattern capable of diagnosing death from COVID-19 infection. (2) Methods: In this paper, the lung examination of two subjects who died from COVID-19 are discussed, comparing the obtained data with those of the control, a newborn who died from pneumonia in the same pandemic period. (3) Results: The results of the present study suggest that COVID-19 infection can cause different forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to diffuse alveolar damage and diffuse endothelial damage. Nevertheless, different patterns of cellular and cytokine expression are associated with anti-COVID-19 antibody positivity, compared to the control case. Moreover, in both case studies, it is interesting to note that COVID-19, ACE2 and FVIII positivity was detected in the same fields. (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 infection has been initially classified as exclusively interstitial pneumonia with varying degrees of severity. Subsequently, vascular biomarkers showed that it can also be considered a vascular disease. The data on Factor VIII discussed in this paper, although preliminary and limited in number, seem to suggest that the thrombogenicity of Sars-CoV2 infection might be linked to widespread endothelial damage. In this way, it would be very important to investigate the pro-coagulative substrate both in all subjects who died and in COVID-19 survivors. This is because it may be hypothesized that the different patterns with which the pathology is expressed could depend on different individual susceptibility to infection or a different personal genetic-clinical background. In light of these findings, it would be important to perform more post-mortem investigations in order to clarify all aspects of the vascular hypothesis in the COVID-19 infection.","output":"Preliminary Post-Mortem COVID-19 Evidence of Endothelial Injury and Factor VIII Hyperexpression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become a global pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. Identifying the molecular basis of how SARS-CoV-2 drives coagulation is essential to mitigating short and long term thrombotic risks of sick and recovered COVID-19 patients. We aimed to perform coagulation focused transcriptome analysis of in vitro infected primary respiratory epithelial cells, patient derived bronchial alveolar lavage (BALF) cells, and circulating immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to identify transcription mediated signaling networks driving coagulopathies associated with COVID-19. We analyzed recently published experimentally and clinically derived bulk or single cell RNA sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify changes in transcriptional regulation of blood coagulation. We also confirmed that the transcriptional expression of a key coagulation regulator was recapitulated at the protein level. We specifically focused our analysis on lung tissue expressed genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade and the plasminogen activation system. Analyzing transcriptomic data of in vitro infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and patient derived BALF samples revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and suppresses the plasminogen activation system. We also performed in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on primary human lung epithelial cells to confirm that transcriptional upregulation of Tissue Factor, the extrinsic coagulation cascade master regulator, manifested at the protein level. Further, infection of NHBEs with influenza A virus (IAV) did not drive key regulators of blood coagulation in a similar manner as SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) did not differentially express genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade or plasminogen activation system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that they are not directly inducing coagulopathy through these pathways. The hyper-activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and the suppression of the plasminogen activation system in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells may drive diverse coagulopathies in the lung and distal organ systems. Understanding how hosts drive such transcriptional changes with SARS-CoV-2 infection may enable the design of host-directed therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 and other coronaviruses inducing hyper-coagulation.

Casualties, economic downturn, extreme poverty, and major changes in education are still happening today. The presence of the Covid19 vaccine is new hope for mankind to end this pandemic situation. The emergence of two types of vaccines in Indonesia, Sinovac, and Pfizer, lead to different Indonesian society reactions. This study aims to do a sentiment analysis of the two types of vaccines on the Twitter platform. Data from October until November 2020 has been crawled and processed to see the citizen opinion. The dataset was split into two types: Sinovac and Pfizer dataset. Both datasets were labeled manually into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. The results show that 77% of Tweets indicate the positive segments, while 19% represent negative, and 4% seem to be neutral for Sinovac. From the standpoint of Pfizer, the results were 81%, 17%, and 3% for positive, negative, and neutral, respectively. In terms of model performance evaluation, with 10-fold cross-validation, the highest average accuracy in the Sinovac dataset is Support Vector Machine with 85% accuracy.

METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to a cohort of persons from the general population of eight countries: Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) from April 22 to May 5 and May 26 to June 1, 2020. Country-level stringency indices were adopted from the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Primary outcomes were HRQoL, measured using the EQ-5D-5L, and mental well-being, measured using the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being (WHO-5). FINDINGS: 21,354 respondents were included in the study. Diseased respondents had lower EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 scores compared to healthy respondents. Younger respondents had lower WHO-5 scores than older respondents. The stringency index had a stronger association with the EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 among diseased respondents compared to healthy respondents. Increasing stringency was associated with an increase in EQ-5D-5L scores but a decrease in the WHO-5 index. CONCLUSION: The stringency of government response is inversely related to HRQoL and mental well-being with a small positive relation with HRQoL and strong negative relation with mental well-being.

We aimed to describe ancillary findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT, to define their prevalence, and investigate their association with clinical data. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our CT chest cases with coupled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Patients with negative rt-PCR or without admission chest CT were excluded. Ancillary findings included: vessel enlargement, subpleural curvilinear lines, dependent subpleural atelectasis, centrilobular solid nodules, pleural and/or pericardial effusions, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Continuous data were expressed as median and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and tested by MannCWhitney U test. RESULTS: Ancillary findings were represented by 106/252 (42.1%, 36.1 to 48.2) vessel enlargement, 50/252 (19.8%, 15.4 to 25.2) subpleural curvilinear lines, 26/252 (10.1%, 7.1 to 14.7) dependent subpleural atelectasis, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) pleural effusion, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement, 13/252 (5.2%, 3 to 8.6) centrilobular solid nodules, and 6/252 (2.4%, 1.1 to 5.1) pericardial effusion. Air space disease was more extensive in patients with vessel enlargement or centrilobular solid nodules (p < 0.001). Vessel enlargement was associated with longer history of fever (p = 0.035) and lower admission oxygen saturation (p = 0.014); dependent subpleural atelectasis with lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001) and higher respiratory rate (p < 0.001); mediastinal lymph nodes with shorter history of cough (p = 0.046); centrilobular solid nodules with lower prevalence of cough (p = 0.023), lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001), and higher respiratory rate (p = 0.032), and pericardial effusion with shorter history of cough (p = 0.015). Ancillary findings associated with longer hospital stay were subpleural curvilinear lines (p = 0.02), whereas centrilobular solid nodules were associated with higher rate of intensive care unit admission (p = 0.01).

Unfortunately, it is seen in this work that, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, full opening of schools in the Fall of 2020 seems to be impractical unless the spread of the virus is completely under control in the surrounding region (e.g. with fewer than 5 active cases every million people). In order to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we model the diffusion of the epidemic within each single school by a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable loss function, and then evaluate sustainable opening plans. It turns out that blended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remote teaching days or weeks, are generally (close to) optimal. In a prototypical example, the optimal strategy prescribes a school opening of 90 days out of 200 with the number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing by about 71%, instead of the about 390% increase that would have been a consequence of full opening. As clinical fraction is low in children, these solutions could lead to very few or no symptomatic cases within the school during the whole school year.

We confirmed that the presence of both MBP and antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for this in vitro cytotoxic effect. This reaction (measured by (51)Cr release from labeled oligos) is dose-dependent on the effector/target ratio with marked (51)Cr release at a 20/1 ratio.

To the authors knowledge, no studies to date have quantitatively analyzed both national and regional trends in telemedicine utilization during the pandemic, both of which have key implications for informing health policy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how trends in telemedicine utilization changed across the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using data from doxy.me, the largest free telemedicine platform, and the NIH (National Institutes of Health) Clinical Center, the largest clinical research hospital in the United States, we assessed changes in total telemedicine minutes, new provider registrations, monthly sessions, and average session length from March to November 2020. We also conducted a state-level analysis of how telemedicine expansion differed by region. RESULTS: National telemedicine utilization peaked in April 2020 at 291 million minutes and stabilized at 200 to 220 million monthly minutes from May to November 2020. Surges were strongest in New England and weakest in the South and West. Greater telemedicine expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic was geographically associated with fewer COVID-19 cases per capita. The nature of telemedicine visits also changed, as the average monthly visits per provider doubled and the average visit length decreased by 60%.

Some recent guidelines have favored general anesthesia (GA) in patients perceived as high risk for intraprocedural conversion from sedation to GA, including those with dominant hemispheric occlusions/aphasia or baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >15. We aim to identify the rate and predictors of conversion to GA during MT in a high-volume center where monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is the default modality. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained MT database from January 2013 to July 2020 was undertaken. Analyses were conducted to identify the predictors of intraprocedural conversion to GA. In addition, we analyzed the GA conversion rates in subgroups of interest. RESULTS: Among 1919 MT patients, 1681 (87.6%) started treatment under MAC (median age 65 years (IQR 55C76); baseline NIHSS 16 (IQR 11C21); 48.4% women). Of the 1677 eligible patients, 26 (1.6%) converted to GA including 1.4% (22/1615) with anterior and 6.5% (4/62) with posterior circulation strokes. The only predictor of GA conversion was posterior circulation stroke (OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.67 to 14.96, P=0.004). The conversion rates were numerically higher in right than in left hemispheric occlusions (1.6% vs 1.2%; OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.19, P=0.47) and in milder than in more severe strokes (NIHSS 15 vs >15: 2% vs 1.2%; OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.36, P=0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the overall rate of conversion from MAC to GA during MT was low (1.6%) and, while higher in posterior circulation strokes, it was not predicted by either hemispheric dominance or stroke severity.

There is a need for interventions that could address both quality and quantity of walking for people with knee OA. The goal of this randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov # NCT03064139) was to determine the feasibility of a mindful walking intervention to improve quality and quantity of walking in people with knee OA. Methods: Individuals with symptomatic knee OA were recruited from the community using advertisements. Study criteria are shown in Table 1. [Formula presented] During enrollment, the more symptomatic knee, or a knee selected at random in case of equal symptoms, was designated as the study knee. After the baseline visit, participants were randomized to either a mindful walking group (MWG) or an attention-matched self-management group (SMG). Participants in both groups received 11 intervention sessions delivered over a 6-month period (4 in 1 st month, 2 each in 2nd and 3rd months, 1 each in 4th, 5th, and 6th months). Interventions were delivered via in-person groups (4-10 in each group) and each session was 1.5-3 hours in duration. For MWG, a certified instructor provided training in mindful walking that includes whole-body movement retraining and mindful body-awareness skill building. Biomechanical elements include: shorter stride length, higher cadence, greater toe-in, and more aligned posture. Participants were coached to progressively increase their mindful walking activity each week. Mindfulness elements include mindful body-awareness skills to increase sensitivity and awareness of deviations from the taught techniques. The approach is based on ChiWalking? so called because the movement approaches are drawn in part from Tai Chi. For SMG, a researcher delivered a curriculum consisting of education and self-management techniques (e.g., importance of physical activity and exercise, nutrition, weight-management, etc.). This information was also provided to MWG in a condensed form. Gait analyses and physical performance tests were completed at baseline and 6-months. Physical activity was assessed using a commercial wrist-worn activity monitor (Charge 3, Fitbit Inc, San Francisco, CA). Participant-reported outcomes (PROs) were completed at baseline and every 3-months. Participants were remotely followed for an additional 6-months after the end of the intervention. Given the feasibility nature of the study, primary outcomes included recruitment, adherence, retention and number of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included peak external knee adduction moment [KAM], daily step count, Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) Pain, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES), 30-second chair stand test (30STS), 40-meter fast paced walk test (40FPW), and Stair Climbing Test (SCT). Analyses were conducted on intention-to-treat basis with all randomized participants included and missing values were not imputed. Results: Participants were recruited between March 2019 and January 2020. During this period, 450 individuals completed pre-screening questionnaires (41 per month), 66 completed in-person screening visits, 47 were enrolled, and 44 were randomized (Table 2). Interventions for 19 participants were interrupted, delayed for 3-months, and then transitioned to virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the original recruitment goal was 62, the trial was halted earlier due to COVID-19. [Formula presented] Attendance is shown in Table 3. On average, MWG group attended 63% of the sessions vs. 70% in the SMG group. Among those who attended at least 1 session, MWG group attended 69% vs. 77% for SMG. Among those who attended at least 3 sessions, MWG group attended 75% vs. 84% for SMG. Post-intervention, 65% (n=15) and 87% (n=20) of MWG completed the in-person visits and PROs, respectively. In SMG, 81% (n=17) completed in-person visits and PROs. At 12-months, 91% (n=21) and 71% (n 15) completed the PROs for MWG and SMG, respectively. [Formula presented] Participant feedback at 6- and 12-months showed that the intervention was acceptable (Table 4). There were no serious adverse events related to the intervention in either group. Within group and between group differences for secondary outcomes are shown in Table 5. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Our benchmarks were recruitment over 1.5 years, attendance of 75% in MWG group, and retention of 80% of participants at 6-months. While all of these benchmarks were negatively impacted by COVID-19, the recruitment rates over the period studied, adherence in those who attended at least 3 sessions, and retention for some secondary outcomes were acceptable. Participants in both groups found the interventions helpful, enjoyable, and rated it highly. At 12-month follow-up, MWG participants continued to practice mindful walking 1-2 days a week. Between group differences for secondary outcomes were small. Given the feasibility nature of the study, conclusions regarding efficacy cannot be made and larger trial would be needed.

Herein we report a Japanese patient with iMCD with a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene. METHODS We performed genetic analysis via targeted next-generation sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing and conducted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the hydrophobic interactions around the 729th amino acid in human pyrin. RESULTS In February 2011, a 59-year-old man was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease at our department based on the findings of cervical and hilar lymphadenopathies, typical lung lesions and cervical lymph node biopsy. The patient was followed up without treatment, as he was asymptomatic. However, he had been experiencing prolonged fatigue and fever with high levels of CRP since June 2017. Axillary lymph node biopsy findings led to the diagnosis of iMCD. He was successfully treated with an IL-6 inhibitor and has been in remission for 12 months. Genetic analyses for hereditary autoinflammatory disease-related genes were performed, revealing a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the MEFV gene. We identified that this novel mutation significantly altered the local interaction of the human pyrin B30.2 domain by molecular dynamics simulation analysis and experimentally had the potential for inflammasome activation with increased inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION The abnormal function of pyrin due to a mutation in the MEFV gene in this patient may have contributed to the development of MCD by inducing IL-6 production via inflammasome signalling.","output":"Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease with novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of familial Mediterranean fever gene."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current literature and clinical guidelines do not include pregnant women as an a priori risk group for COVID-19. However, a gender vision of health begs the question: Why are pregnant women not considered a risk group for COVID-19? The answer is clear: historically, most community scientific studies have not considered female gender, or pregnancy as a state, to be a focus of special interest or effort. Unfortunately, this bias seems to be maintained in the COVID-19 epidemic: most current guidelines for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy apply the same standard criteria as for the general population. This pandemic is an opportunity to begin redressing this historic gender bias against pregnant women, and to achieve this, we recommend two actions that are easy to implement, and would have a large impact. First, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women with clinical or epidemiological suspicion, regardless of gestational age or the clinical severity. Second, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women at admission for delivery. These actions are essential to understand the true impact of COVID-19 throughout pregnancy, and will improve how we manage many aspects of pre- and postnatal care. It is the scientific community's responsibility to guide, even to anticipate, the recommendations of our respective governments' health policies.

This review examines the literature about the delivery of medical imaging education to non-radiologist clinicians, spanning junior doctors, advanced trainees and specialists. Knowledge of medical imaging among non-radiologist clinicians is paramount to the quality of patient care, with calls for formal implementation of radiology education into non-imaging specialty training programmes. Overall, there is a demand across non-imaging disciplines for greater formalised medical imaging education. Concerns are raised that too great a reliance on informal methods of teaching radiology, for example in ward settings, results in greater variation in the quality and volume of educational opportunities and risks the perpetuation of erroneous attitudes and practices. The evolution of the medical imaging workplace and increasing utilisation of remote reporting has distanced the collaborative relationship between radiologists and their non-imaging colleagues, diminishing opportunities for ad hoc learning and engagement in larger formalised educational collaborations. Ideally, radiologists should be directly involved in the development and delivery of medical imaging education to post-graduate doctors to not only benefit patient care but also foster inter-specialty relationships and respect. Evidence supports the value of structured radiological teaching opportunities, including tutorials, lectures and electronic resources, in improving medical imaging skills among non-radiologist clinicians.

METHODS: In this prospective self-control study, 60 subjects (120 eyes) were recruited and asked to read on smartphones provided by the same manufacturer for two consecutive hours. This study was conducted during 8:00 C 10:00 AM to eliminate the influence of digital equipment used the previous day. Ophthalmological examinations [non-invasive tear breakup time (NIBUT), fluorescein breakup time (FBUT), Schirmer I test, corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), bulbar conjunctival redness and meibomian gland (MG) assessment] and a questionnaire survey were conducted before and after the reading test. Based on the collected data, the changes in ocular surface damage and subjective symptoms of the subjects were evaluated, and the differences in the diagnostic rate of dry eye before and after high-intensity use of smartphones were compared. RESULTS: The diagnostic rate of dry eye was sharply increased (61.7% vs. 74.2%). The severity of dry eye also changed significantly, and the moderate and severe degree increased after reading (10% vs. 15%; 5% vs. 10.8%). The aggravated severity subjects had lower MG expressibility and more evident bulbar conjunctival redness compared to the non-aggravated severity subjects. After 2 h of continuous reading, NIBUT-First, NIBUT-Average and FBUT-Average were significantly decreased, while the proportion of BUT  5 s increased significantly.

Subject-specific computer modeling studies of gait mechanics, including the effect of changes in running speed, stride length, and landing patterns on tibial stress injury formation can provide essential insights into BSI prevention. This study aimed to computationally examine the effect of different exercise protocols on tibial fatigue life in male and female runners during prolonged walking and running at three different speeds. To achieve these aims, we combined subject-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gait data, finite element analysis, and a fatigue life prediction algorithm, including repair and adaptation's influence. The algorithm predicted a steep increase in the likelihood of developing a BSI within the first 40 days of activity. In five of the six subjects simulated, faster running speeds corresponded with higher tibial strains and higher probability of failure. Our simulations also showed that female subjects had a higher mean peak probability of failure in all four gait conditions than the male subjects studied.

MAIN TEXT: The current study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. 2959 papers were found in all national and international databases. The study has been reported based on the PRISMA checklist. All analyses were done by CMA Ver. 2 software. The statistical analysis results show that the GGO observation level in the available shape was 46% in CT scan results, and the consolidation observation level in the general form was 33% in CT scan results. Pleural effusion was 7%, and linear opacity observation level was 24% in CT scan results in the general form. The CT scan test sensitivity level was gained 94.7%, and PCR test sensitivity level was achieved as 94.8%. This level was 89% in the early stage. CONCLUSION: The chest CT has about 24% higher diagnostic sensitivity than the PCR test, in the early stage.

Adult patients are eligible to enroll within 14 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test;pediatric patients may also enroll retrospectively. Clinical data, patient-reported outcomes, blood specimens, and imaging are collected for up to 2 years. This abstract provides initial baseline and 2-month follow-up data. Results: As of Jan 22, 2021, 585 pts (552 adults and 33 pediatric pts) had complete baseline data and of these pts, 215 adults had 2 months of complete follow-up data. 23.4% of adults and 42.4% of pediatric pts were of nonWhite race and/or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. The most common cancer diagnoses were breast (19.6%), lung (9.9%) and multiple myeloma (8.9%) in adults and acute leukemia (AML/ALL;63.6%) in children. The most recent treatment was chemotherapy in 38.2%, immunotherapy in 9.6%, and radiation in 5.4%. Median time from positive SARS-CoV-2 test to study enrollment was 10.5 days in adults and 18 days in pediatric pts. Preliminary analysis of plasma cytokines will be presented.

While struggling with the unknown nature of this novel coronavirus, many researchers and groups attempted to project the progress of the pandemic using empirical or mechanistic models, each one having its drawbacks. The first confirmed cases were announced early in March, and since then, serious containment measures have taken place in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present a different approach, a Bayesian negative binomial multilevel model with mixed effects, for the projection of the COVID-19 pandemic and apply this model to the Turkish case. The model source code is available at https://github.com/kansil/covid-19. We predicted confirmed daily cases and cumulative numbers for June 6th to June 26th with 80%, 95% and 99% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: Our projections showed that if we continued to comply with measures and no drastic changes are seen in diagnosis or management protocols, the epidemic curve would tend to decrease in this time interval. Also, the predictive validity analysis suggests that proposed model projections should be in the 95% PI band for the first 12 days of the projections. CONCLUSION: We expect that drastic changes in the course of the COVID-19 in Turkey will cause the model to suffer in predictive validity, and this can be used to monitor the epidemic.

Epidemiological studies conducted in different populations have demonstrated that the presence of increased albuminuria is associated with a higher relative risk of MCI or dementia both in cross-sectional analyses and in studies with long-term follow-up. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of albuminuria's effect are as yet insufficiently studied, with several important knowledge gaps still present in a complex relationship with other MCI and dementia risk factors. Both the kidney and the brain have microvascular similarities that make them sensitive to endothelial dysfunction involving different mechanisms, including oxidative stress and inflammation. The exact substrate of MCI and dementia is still under investigation, however available experimental data indicate that elevated albuminuria and low glomerular filtration rate are associated with significant neuroanatomical declines in hippocampal function and grey matter volume. Thus, albuminuria may be critical in the development of cognitive impairment and its progression to dementia. In this review, we summarize the available evidence on albuminuria's link to MCI and dementia, point to existing gaps in our knowledge and suggest actions to overcome them. The major question of whether interventions that target increased albuminuria could prevent cognitive decline remains unanswered. Our recommendations for future research are aimed at helping to plan clinical trials and to solve the complex conundrum outlined in this review, with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of patients with chronic kidney disease.","output":"Albuminuria as a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment and dementia-what is the evidence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented rise in COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka since July 2021 led to a situation where the health system was getting overwhelmed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined whether oral plant vaccine-encoding full-length Per a 2 clone-996 or its hypoallergenic clone-372 could exert a prophylactic role in Per a 2-sensitized mice. The cDNAs coding Per a 2C996 and Per a 2C372 were inserted into TuMV vector and expressed in Chinese cabbage. Adult female BALB/c mice were fed with the cabbage extracts for 21 days and subsequently underwent two-step sensitization with recombinant Per a 2. RESULTS: Per a 2-specific IgE measured by in-house ELISA in the sera of Per a 2-372-treated groups were significantly lower than in the control groups after allergen challenge but not the Per a 2-996-treated group. Moreover, Per a 2C372 vaccine markedly decreased airway hyper-responsiveness and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, as well as reduced mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in comparison with the control mice.

METHODS: Using data from 96 out of 167 health facilities offering ART services, we compared four ART program indicators: (1) count of HIV visits; (2) proportion of ART dispenses in community-based settings (DAC); (3) proportion of multi-month dispensing of ART medications > 6 months (> 6 m MMD); and (4) proportion of timely ART refills. We used uncontrolled interrupted time series (ITS) models to estimate slope and level changes in each indicator with the arrival of COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From week 1 to week 16, the average number of HIV visits fell from 121.5 to 92.5 visits, the proportion of DAC rose from 22.7% to 36.7%, the proportion of > 6 m MMD rose from 29.4% to 48.4%, and the proportion of timely ART refills fell from 51.9% to 43.8%.

By contrast, the nano-VO2 did not exhibit significant toxicity towards Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa.

Based on the experimental results, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the antimicrobial selectivity, which might originate from the different sensitivity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Elevated intracellular ROS levels exceed the threshold that bacteria can self-regulate to maintain cellular redox homeostasis and thus cause oxidative stress, which can be alleviated by the intervention of glutathione (GSH) antioxidant.

We found that oral GABA administration before, or after the appearance of symptoms, very effectively limited MHV-1-induced pneumonitis, severe illness, and death. GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit coronavirus replication. Treatment with the GABAA-R-specific agonist homotaurine, but not the GABAB-R-specific agonist baclofen, significantly reduced the severity of pneumonitis and death rates in MHV-1-infected mice, indicating that the therapeutic effects were mediated primarily through GABAA-Rs. Since GABA and homotaurine are safe for human consumption, they are promising candidates to help treat coronavirus infections.","output":"GABAA-Receptor Agonists Limit Pneumonitis and Death in Murine Coronavirus-Infected Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Spring 2020 semester, classes at a medium-sized regional rural university transitioned from face-to-face (FTF) to fully online instruction following Spring Break due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As traditional clinical rotations were suspended, medical students quickly began alternative, novel educational experiences. Third-year medical students at an academic medical center were given the opportunity to join inpatient eConsult teams within the department of medicine. This study describes the development and implementation of this program as well as the experiences of student and faculty participants. METHODS: Student eConsult participation was rapidly developed and implemented within medical subspecialty teams in either infectious diseases (ID) or nephrology. Twelve third-year medical students and 15 subspecialty attendings participated in this program during an eight-week period from April 6 through May 29, 2020. Breadth of student clinical experience was assessed via review of clinical documentation and surveys. Participating students and attending physicians completed surveys to reflect upon their impressions of the program. Surveys were returned by nine students and eight faculty members. Survey responses were summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Over an eight-week period, student consultants wrote 126 notes on 100 patients; 74 of these patients (74%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. Student experiences were largely positive with most strongly agreeing that attendings promoted interactive and engaged learning (N = 8 of 8, 100%), that the experience helped to expand their knowledge about consultant roles (N = 6, 75%), and that they would participate in a remote eConsult program again if given the opportunity (N = 6, 75%). Faculty also were largely positive about the experience with most agreeing or strongly agreeing with the importance of teaching medical students about telehealth (N = 7 of 8, 88%) and eConsults (N = 6, 75%). In narrative responses, students and faculty agreed that teaching was a strength of the program whereas lack of in-person contact was a challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid development of an inpatient eConsult-based educational experience for third-year medical students was feasible and successful. Student-consultants saw a range of pathology including COVID-19 and related complications. Students were satisfied with the program. They were able to develop a strong relationship with attendings while learning about the role of a consultant. Faculty agreed with the importance of teaching students about telehealth and eConsults specifically.

In the following months, the burden of this infection decreased significantly, possibly due to the impact of a package of interventions. We modeled the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in Iran to quantify the impacts of these interventions. METHODS: We used a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran, from January 21, 2020 to September 21, 2020. We estimated the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Under different scenarios, we assessed the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including physical distancing measures and self-isolation. We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt ), using our mathematical model and epidemiologic data. RESULTS: If no NPIs were applied, there could have been a cumulative number of 51 800 000 (95% UI: 1 910 000- 77 600 000) COVID-19 infections and 266 000 (95% UI: 119 000-476 000) deaths by September 21, 2020. If physical distancing interventions, such as school/border closures and self-isolation interventions had been introduced a week earlier than they were actually launched, 30.8% and 35.2% reduction in the number of deaths and infections respectively could have been achieved by September 21, 2020. The observed daily number of deaths showed that the Rt was one or more than one almost every day during the analysis period. CONCLUSION: Our models suggest that the NPIs implemented in Iran between January 21, 2020 and September 21, 2020 had significant effects on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Our study also showed that the timely implementation of NPIs showed a profound effect on further reductions in the numbers of infections and deaths. This highlights the importance of forecasting and early detection of future waves of infection and of the need for effective preparedness and response capabilities.","output":"Impact of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions on the Control of COVID-19 in Iran: A Mathematical Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 forced a sudden closure of schools, prompting a hasty and unplanned reaction of educators to deliver educational content Inspired by Ivan Illich's book Deschooling Society, where he argues for the delivery of educational content by utilizing technology and forging intentional partnerships with parents and communities to assist in the delivery of educational content, we reflect on how these ideas impact school leadership and preparation of school leaders This forced deschooling has offered educators an opportunity to rethink the true purpose of education, and redesign flexible, creative and innovative instructional strategies for delivering educational materials and knowledge, as well as rethinking the role of and preparation of educational leaders While we do not offer quick solutions, our intent is to revisit Illich's Deschooling Society as a means to examine and question our school system introspectively and collectively ?

This study aimed to explore the association between early treatment with Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and favorable clinical outcomes. In this retrospective multicenter study, we included 782 patients (males, 56 %; median age 46) with confirmed COVID-19 from 54 hospitals in nine provinces of China, who were divided into four groups according to the treatment initiation time from the first date of onset of symptoms to the date of starting treatment with QFPDD. The primary outcome was time to recovery; days of viral shedding, duration of hospital stay, and course of the disease were also analyzed. Compared with treatment initiated after 3 weeks, early treatment with QFPDD after less than 1 week, 1-2 weeks, or 2-3 weeks had a higher likelihood of recovery, with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95 % confidence interval [CI]) of 3.81 (2.65-5.48), 2.63 (1.86-3.73), and 1.92 (1.34-2.75), respectively. The median course of the disease decreased from 34 days to 24 days, 21 days, and 18 days when treatment was administered early by a week (P < 0.0001). Treatment within a week was related to a decrease by 1-4 days in the median duration of hospital stay compared with late treatment (P<0.0001). In conclusion, early treatment with QFPDD may serve as an effective strategy in controlling the epidemic, as early treatment with QFPDD was associated with favorable outcomes, including faster recovery, shorter time to viral shedding, and a shorter duration of hospital stay. However, further multicenter, prospective studies with a larger sample size should be conducted to confirm the benefits of early treatment with QFPDD.","output":"Association between early treatment with Qingfei Paidu decoction and favorable clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19: A retrospective multicenter cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral immune evasion by sequence variation is a significant barrier to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine design and coronavirus disease-2019 diffusion under lockdown are unpredictable with subsequent waves Our group has developed a computational model rooted in physics to address this challenge, aiming to predict the fitness landscape of SARS-CoV-2 diffusion using a variant of the bidimensional Ising model (2DIMV) connected seasonally The 2DIMV works in a closed system composed of limited interaction subjects and conditioned by only temperature changes Markov chain Monte Carlo method shows that an increase in temperature implicates reduced virus diffusion and increased mobility, leading to increased virus diffusion ? 2021 Author(s)","output":"Diffusion modeling of COVID-19 under lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression is critical in the face of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus infections. Many viruses, including coronavirus and influenza virus, wreak havoc on the control of cytokine expression, leading to the formation of detrimental cytokine storms. Understanding the regulation and interplay between inflammatory cytokines is critical to the identification of targets involved in controlling the induction of cytokine expression. In this study, we focused on how the antiviral cytokine interleukin-27 (IL-27) regulates signal transduction downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 ligation, which recognize endosomal single-stranded RNA. Given that IL-27 alters bacterial-sensing TLR expression on myeloid cells and can inhibit replication of single-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated whether IL-27 affects expression and function of TLR7 and TLR8. Analysis of IL-27-treated THP-1 monocytic cells and THP-1-derived macrophages revealed changes in mRNA and protein expression of TLR7 and TLR8. Although treatment with IL-27 enhanced TLR7 expression, only TLR8-mediated cytokine secretion was amplified. Furthermore, we demonstrated that imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, inhibited cytokine and chemokine production induced by a TLR8 agonist, TL8-506. Delineating the immunomodulatory role of IL-27 on TLR7 and TLR8 responses provides insight into how myeloid cell TLR-mediated responses are regulated during virus infection.","output":"TLR7 Ligation Inhibits TLR8 Responsiveness in IL-27-Primed Human THP-1 Monocytes and Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how telemedicine can be beneficial in many areas of orthopedic clinical practice through a literature narrative review. In addition, we discuss advantages, barriers, and enablers of such technology. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine in orthopedics was initially described to discuss simple cases among non-specialist doctors through videoconferencing. Recently, it evolved to postoperative follow-up on selected cases, physical examination, and even teleconsultations direct to patients. Studies have reported that consultation can be offered safely to selected patients. Although this topic is already being addressed for a long time, recent studies have reported that there is still resistance among many orthopedic surgeons. SUMMARY: Telemedicine for orthopedics has safely expanded its operations. It can be used in postoperative follow-up of selected cases, fracture follow-up, and even in pediatric cases. Remote diagnosis of fractures is done successfully on an outpatient basis in many countries. Protocols and methods to standardize the virtual orthopedic examination for common musculoskeletal conditions have been developed. Satisfaction with teleconsultations as well as cost-effectiveness of remote care orthopedics were already well reported by some studies. We believe that remote care will be expanded in several hospitals around the world due to its huge potential. This fact is explained by natural technological development and by change and obliteration of habits accelerated exponentially after COVID-19 crisis.","output":"Telemedicine: Is It a Tool for Orthopedics?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike (S) glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the binding to the permissive cells. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. In this study, we used computational saturation mutagenesis approaches, including structure-based energy calculations and sequence-based pathogenicity predictions, to quantify the systemic effects of missense mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure and function. A total of 18 354 mutations in S protein were analyzed, and we discovered that most of these mutations could destabilize the entire S protein and its RBD. Specifically, residues G431 and S514 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are important for S protein stability. We analyzed 384 experimentally verified S missense variations and revealed that the dominant pandemic form, D614G, can stabilize the entire S protein. Moreover, many mutations in N-linked glycosylation sites can increase the stability of the S protein. In addition, we investigated 3705 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 11 324 mutations in human ACE2 and found that SARS-CoV-2 neighbor residues G496 and F497 and ACE2 residues D355 and Y41 are critical for the RBDCACE2 interaction.

The current COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed millions of people. Unfortunately, effective treatments for CoVs infection are still lacking, suggesting the importance of coronavirus vaccines. Our previous work showed that CoV nonstuctural protein 14 (nsp14) functions as (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), which is involved in RNA cap formation. Moreover, we found that N7-MTase is well conserved among different CoVs and is a universal target for developing antivirals against CoVs. Here, we show that N7-MTase of CoVs can be an ideal target for designing live attenuated vaccines. Using murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), a representative and well-studied model of coronaviruses, we constructed N7-MTase-deficient recombinant MHV D330A and Y414A. These two mutants are highly attenuated in mice and exhibit similar replication efficiency to the wild-type (WT) virus in the cell culture. Furthermore, a single dose immunization of D330A or Y414A can induce long-term humoral immune responses and robust CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses, which can provide full protection against the challenge of a lethal-dose of MHV-A59. Collectively, this study provides an ideal strategy to design live attenuated vaccines for coronavirus by abolishing viral RNA N7-MTase activity.

Atherosclerosis leads to similar changes. We investigated possible differences in cardiovascular remodeling between these diseases and whether the differences are correlated with immune cell expression. METHODS: Patients with active TAK arteritis were compared with age- and sex-matched atherosclerotic patients (Controls). In a subpopulation of TAK patients, Treg/Th17 cells were measured before (T0) and after 18 months (T18) of infliximab treatment. Echocardiogram, supraaortic Doppler ultrasound, and lymphocytogram were performed in all patients. Histological and immunohistochemical changes of the vessel wall were evaluated as well. RESULTS: TAK patients have increased aortic valve dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction. The degree of dysfunction appears associated with uric acid levels. A significant increase in aortic stiffness was also observed and associated with levels of peripheral T lymphocytes. CD3(+) CD4(+) cell infiltrates were detected in the vessel wall samples of TAK patients, whose mean percentage of Tregs was lower than Controls at T0, but increased significantly at T18. Opposite behavior was observed for Th17 cells. Finally, TAK patients were found to have an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that different pathogenic mechanisms underlie vessel damage, including atherosclerosis, in TAK patients compared with Controls. The increased risk of ASCVD in TAK patients correlates directly with the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in the vessel wall.

The field-mapping course for 2nd year Geology BSc students from the Cardiff University was replaced with a virtual mapping course set in the same area as previous years, the Esla Nappe (Cantabrian Zone, NW Spain). The course was designed with the aim of providing the students with the same methodology employed in physical mapping, gathering discrete data in stops located along five daily itineraries. Data included bedding attitude, outcrop descriptions with a certain degree of ambiguity, photographs and/or sketches, panoramic photos and fossil images. Data was provided to the students through georeferenced KMZ files in Google Earth. Students were asked to keep a field notebook, define lithological units of mappable scale, identify large structures such as thrust faults and folds with the aid of age estimations from fossils, construct a geological map on a hard-copy topographic map, draw a stratigraphic column and cross sections, and plot the data in a stereonet to perform structural analysis. The exercise allowed a successful training of diverse geological field skills. In the light of the assessment of reports and student surveys, a series of improvements for the future is considered.

Mortality and case-fatality rates vary widely depending on incidence of COVID-19 and the testing policy in affected countries. To date, data comparing hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and influenza is scarce. METHODS: Data from patients with COVID-19 were compared to patients infected with influenza A (InfA) and B (InfB) virus during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons. All patients were  18 years old, had PCR-confirmed infection and needed hospital treatment. Demographic data, medical history, length-of-stay (LOS), complications including in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 142 patients with COVID-19 were compared to 266 patients with InfA and 300 with InfB. Differences in median age (COVID-19 70.5 years vs InfA 70 years and InfB 77 years, p < 0.001) and laboratory results were observed. COVID-19 patients had fewer comorbidities, but complications (respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure and death) occurred more frequently. Median length-of-stay (LOS) was longer in COVID-19 patients (12 days vs InfA 7 days vs. InfB 7 days, p < 0.001). There was a fourfold higher in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (23.2%) when compared with InfA (5.6%) or InfB (4.7%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients, COVID-19 is associated with longer LOS, a higher number of complications and higher in-hospital mortality compared to influenza, even in a population with fewer co-morbidities. This data, a high reproduction number and limited treatment options, alongside excess mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, support the containment strategies implemented by most authorities.","output":"COVID-19 is not just another flu: a real-life comparison of severe COVID-19 and influenza in hospitalized patients in Vienna, Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the international crises and researchers are working collaboratively to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.

Herein, we adopted a newly developed high-throughput epitope mapping technology (AbMap), analyzed 55 COVID-19 convalescent sera and 226 antibody samples enriched by specific proteins or peptides from these sera. We revealed three areas that are rich of IgG epitopes, two are on Spike protein but outside of RBD, and one is on Nucleocapsid protein. We identified 29 significant epitopes on Spike protein, from two of these significant epitopes, two critical epitope residues were found, i. e., D936 and P1263, which are highly related to the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, we provided the first global map of IgG binding epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 at single amino acid resolution.

However, in heterogeneous disorders like AD/ADRDs, this design requires large sample sizes to detect meaningful effects in an average patient. They are very costly and, despite many attempts, have not yielded new treatments for many years. An alternative, the multi-crossover, randomized control trial (MCRCT) is a design in which each patient serves as their own control across successive, randomized blocks of active treatment and placebo. This design overcomes many limitations of parallel-group trials, yielding an unbiased assessment of treatment effect at the individual level (N-of-1) regardless of unique patient characteristics. The goal of the present study is to pilot a MCRCT of a potential symptomatic treatment, methylphenidate, for mild-stage AD/ADRDs, testing feasibility and compliance of participants in this design and efficacy of the drug using both standard and novel outcome measures suited for this design. METHODS: Ten participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild-stage dementia due to AD/ADRDs will undergo a 4-week lead-in period followed by three, month-long treatment blocks (2 weeks of treatment with methylphenidate, 2 weeks placebo in random order). This trial will be conducted entirely virtually with an optional in-person screening visit. The primary outcome of interest is feasibility as measured by compliance and retention, with secondary and exploratory outcomes including cognition as measured by neuropsychological assessment at the end of each treatment period and daily brain games played throughout the study, actigraphy, and neuropsychiatric and functional assessments. DISCUSSION: This pilot study will gauge the feasibility of conducting a virtual MCRCT for symptomatic treatment in early AD/ADRD. It will also compare home-based daily brain games with standard neuropsychological measures within a clinical trial for AD/ADRD. Particular attention will be paid to compliance, tolerability of drug and participation, learning effects, trends and stability of daily measures across blocks, medication carryover effects, and correlations between standard and brief daily assessments. These data will provide guidance for more efficient trial design and the use of potentially more robust, ecological outcome measures in AD/ADRD research.

The objective of this study was to test the ivermectin drug in a murine model of coronavirus infection using a type 2 family RNA coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV2, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). BALB/cJ female mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (Group Infected; n=20) and immediately treated with one single dose of 500 g/kg of ivermectin (Group Infected + IVM; n=20), or were not infected and treated with PBS (Control group; n=16). Five days after infection/treatment, mice were euthanized to obtain different tissues to check general health status and infection levels. Overall results demonstrated that viral infection induces the typical MHV disease in infected animals, with livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while ivermectin administration showed a better health status with lower viral load (23,192 AU; p<0.05) and few livers with histopathological damage (p<0.05), not showing statistical differences with control mice (P=NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in treated mice compared to infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin seems to be effective to diminish MHV viral load and disease in mice, being a useful model for further understanding new therapies against coronavirus diseases.","output":"Ivermectin reduces coronavirus infection in vivo: a mouse experimental model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Dyspnoea often occurs in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with ticagrelor compared to other anti-platelet agents, and is a cause of drug discontinuation. We aimed to explore the contribution of central apnoeas and chemoreflex sensitization to ticagrelor-related dyspnoea in patients with ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty consecutive patients with ACS, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and no history of obstructive sleep apnoea, treated either with ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. (n = 30) or prasugrel 10 mg o.d. (n = 30) were consecutively enrolled. One week after ACS, all patients underwent 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, pulmonary static/dynamic testing, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity assessment, 24-hour cardiorespiratory monitoring for hypopnoea-apnoea detection, and evaluation of the chemosensitivity to hypercapnia by rebreathing technique.No differences were found in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, echocardiographic and pulmonary data between the 2 groups. Patients on ticagrelor, as compared to those on prasugrel, reported more frequently dyspnoea (43.3% versus 6.7%, p = 0.001; severe dyspnoea 23.3% versus 0%, p = 0.005), and showed higher apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) and central apnoea index (CAI) during the day, the night and the entire 24-hour period (all p < 0.001). Likewise, they showed a higher chemosensitivity to hypercapnia (p = 0.001). Among patients treated with ticagrelor, those referring dyspnoea had the highest AHI, CAI and chemosensitivity to hypercapnia (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Central apnoeas are a likely mechanism of dyspnoea and should be screened for in patients treated with ticagrelor. A drug related sensitization of the chemoreflex may be the cause of ventilatory instability and breathlessness in this setting.","output":"Central Apnoeas and Ticagrelor Related Dyspnoea in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are some data showing that repurposed drugs used for the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have potential to increase the risk of QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes (TdP), and these arrhythmic side effects have not been adequately addressed in COVID-19 patients treated with these repurposed medications. METHODS: This is the prospective study of 2403 patients hospitalised at 13 hospitals within the COVID-19 epicentres of the Iran. These patients were treated with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, favipiravir and remdesivir alone or in combination with azithromycin. The primary outcome of the study was incidence of critical QTc prolongation, and secondary outcomes were incidences of TdP and death. RESULTS: Of the 2403 patients, 2365 met inclusion criteria. The primary outcome of QTc &#8805; 500 ms and &#8710;QTc &#8805; 60 ms was observed in 11.2% and 17.6% of the patients, respectively. The secondary outcomes of TdP and death were reported in 0.38% and 9.8% of the patients, respectively. The risk of critical QT prolongation increased in the presence of female gender, history of heart failure, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin combination therapy, simultaneous furosemide or beta-blocker therapy and acute renal or hepatic dysfunction. However, the risk of TdP was predicted by treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir, simultaneous amiodarone or furosemide administration and hypokalaemia during treatment. CONCLUSION: This cohort showed significant QTc prolongation with all COVID-19 medications studied, however, life-threatening arrhythmia of TdP occurred rarely.

Women and children are disproportionately vulnerable to such crises, which are intensified under inequitable social conditions and driven by structural barriers to female equality. No research has yet looked at the complex relationship between climate crisis, structural gender inequality, human insecurity, and vulnerability to modern slavery. Our research examined the relationship between environmental stressors associated with climate change, selected structural inequalities, and the estimated prevalence of modern slavery cases across 180 countries. Regression analysis revealed significant results. These findings suggest that indicators of poor environmental health may exacerbate structural social inequalities and increase womens risk of falling victim to modern slavery. Results showed that womens share of seats in parliament, education for women, tree cover loss, agricultural management, and air quality assumed more substantial roles in this prediction. Awareness of the unique relationship between environmental indicators of climate change, gender inequality, and modern slavery provides a meaningful contribution to our understanding of factors driving human exploitation.

At the same time, due to the great interest in flow and its potential importance for effectiveness, cooperation, and learning, it is worth ensuring that reliable validated measurement questionnaires are available for people studying the Polish population. Study participants completed 856 questionnaires, of which 496 individuals (with an average age of 36.31 years) participated in the DFS-2 study and 360 individuals (with an average age of 33.46 years) participated in the FSS-2 study. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) was selected for the CFA analysis. Model fit was assessed using: 2, comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and standardized root mean square of residuals (SRMR), and root mean square of approximation error (RMSEA). For both questionnaires, formative first-level models with nine factors and second-level models with nine factors loaded on a higher-order flow factor were compared using the Satorra-Bentler Scaled difference 2 test. The  coefficient was used to estimate the reliability of the FFS-2 and DFS-2 models tested in the CFA method. Confirmatory factor analysis of both DFS-2 structural models showed satisfactory model fit. Most of the fit indices for the hierarchical 2nd order FSS-2 model presented satisfactory values, except for SRMR. Both DFS-2 and FSS-2 factors tested in the analysis showed good reliability (  0.7).

A population that deserves particular attention is that of health care workers, whose occupations entail high levels of stress, especially given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A neuroscience-based web-based well-being program for health care workersthe Thrive programhas been newly developed to promote habits and activities that contribute to brain health and overall mental well-being. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial whose objective is to evaluate the Thrive program in comparison with an active control condition to measure whether the program is effective at increasing well-being and decreasing symptoms of psychological distress in health care workers at a designated Australian hospital. METHODS: The trial will comprise two groups (intervention vs active control) and 4 measurement occasions over a 12-week period. A survey will be administered in each of weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, and the well-being program will be delivered in weeks 1-7 (via web-based video presentations or digital pamphlets). Each of the 4 surveys will comprise a range of questionnaires to measure well-being, psychological distress, and other key variables. The planned analyses will estimate group-by-time interaction effects to test the hypothesis that mental health will increase over time in the intervention condition relative to the active control condition. RESULTS: The Thrive program was delivered to a small number of wards at the hospital between February 2021 and July 2021, and it will be delivered to the remaining wards from October 2021 to December 2021. A power calculation has recommended a sample size of at least 200 participants in total. A linear mixed model will be used to estimate the interaction effects. CONCLUSIONS: This trial seeks to evaluate a new web-based well-being program for health care workers at a major public hospital. It will contribute to the growing body of research on mental well-being and ways to promote it.

Unfortunately, kidney transplant recipients are a high-risk group during the disease course, and scientific data are still limited in this patient group. Beyond the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs, pharmacological immunosuppression may also alter the infection response in the COVID-19 course. The effects of immunosuppressive agents on the development and process of infection should not be decided only by determining how potent they are and how much they suppress the immune system; it is also thought that the direct effect of the virus, increased oxidative stress, and cytokine storm play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. There are data about immunosuppressive drugs like calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) therapy related to their beneficial effects during any infection course. Limited data suggest that the use of CNI or mTORi may have beneficial effects on the process.

Between admissions of new people into the shelter system and multiple re-admissions of current clients, there were an average of 43,613 movements between the community and between shelters each month. The size of these flows provide a measure of the extent to which people reliant on homeless shelters are exposed to the risk of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

To extend these findings, a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of repetitive HBO exposure on pulmonary fibrosis. Building on our previous findings, we provide evidence that HBO exposure attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In vitro, HBO exposure could reverse, at least partially, transforming growth factor (TGF)-¨Cinduced fibroblast activation, and this effect may be mediated by downregulating TGF-¨Cinduced expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1.

DESIGN: Pretest/posttest design. SETTINGS: Subjects were recruited from registered members of a government subsidized social service center in Hong Kong and living in low-cost housing estates. PARTICIPANTS: The eligibility criteria were: (1) aged 55 or above; (2) able to speak Cantonese; (3) no hearing impairment, and (4) reachable by telephone. Of the 295 eligible subjects, 122 older adults completed the whole study. METHODS: The interviewers approached all eligible subjects by telephone during the period of 15C25 May 2003. After obtaining the participants verbal consent, the interviewer collected baseline data by use of a questionnaire and implemented a health education programme. A follow-up telephone call was made a week later using the same questionnaire. RESULTS: The level of anxiety was lowered (t=3.28, p<0.001), and knowledge regarding the transmission routes of droplets (p<0.001) and urine and feaces (p<0.01) were improved after the intervention. Although statistical significant difference was found in the practice of identified preventive measures before and after intervention, influence on behavioral changes needed further exploration. CONCLUSION: The telephone health education seemed to be effective in relieving anxiety and improving knowledge of the main transmission routes of SARS in this group, but not the practice of preventing SARS. Telephone contact appears to be a practical way of providing health education to vulnerable groups when face-to-face measure is not feasible and may be useful in raising health awareness during future outbreaks of emerging infections.","output":"Improving older adults knowledge and practice of preventive measures through a telephone health education during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The optimal vaccination is an essential public health strategy to control the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study aims to simulate the optimal vaccination strategy to control the virus epidemic by developing an age-specific model based on the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China.Methods: An age-specific mathematical model based on the data of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan City from December 2, 2019 to March 16, 2020 was developed, with two scenarios for controlling transmission and reducing severity to estimate the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy.Findings: Before the lockdown of the Wuhan City, the highest transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was among 14-44 years old (effective reproduction number, Reff = 428), followed by 14-44 to 45-64 years old (Reff = 261), and 14-44 to  65 years old (Reff = 169). We found that the first priority for controlling transmission should be to vaccinate nearly 90% individuals of 14-44 years old, followed by 90% individuals of 45-64 years old. However, the optimal vaccination strategy for reducing severity defined individuals  65 years old in vaccination priority groups, followed by 14-44 years old groups.Interpretation: The scenario analyses suggested that the optimal vaccination strategy aimed at controlling the transmission of COVID-19 might be to vaccinate about 90% of 15-44 years old individuals;while for reducing severity, the vaccination priority should focus on the older population. Furthermore, we also presented evidence about the heterogeneity of age-specific transmission and vaccination in different areas.Funding Statement: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Science and Technology Program of Fujian Province.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests.","output":"The Optimal Vaccination Strategy to Control COVID-19: A Modeling Study Based on the Transmission Scenario in Wuhan City, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a public health emergency.

However, for homemade cloth masks and surgical masks, the fit is often poor, allowing viruses to escape through the gap. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to identify the correlation between the mask leakage, mask configurations, and individuals facial features. METHODS: A novel locally morphing 3D face model, and a minimum-energy-based mask deployment model are used to systematically examine the mask fit for a large cohort of exemplars. RESULTS: The results show that the mask size and tuck-in ratio, along with selective facial features, especially nose height and chin length, are key factors determining the leakage location and extent. A polynomial regression model is presented for mask fitness based on localized facial features. SIGNIFICANCE: This study is a complete pipeline to test various masks on a wide range of faces with controlled modification of distinct regions of the face, which is difficult to achieve with human subjects, and provide knowledge on how the masks should be designed in the future. IMPACT STATEMENT: The face mask fit affects the masks efficacy in preventing airborne transmission. To date, research on the face mask fit has been conducted mainly using experiments on limited subjects. The limited sample size in experimental studies makes it hard to reach a statistical correlation between mask fit and facial features in a population. Here, we employ a novel framework that utilizes a morphable face model and masks deployment simulation to test mask fit for many facial characteristics and mask designs. The proposed technique is an important step toward enabling personalized mask selection with maximum efficacy for society members.","output":"Bridge the gap: correlate face mask leakage and facial features with 3D morphable face models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy is low, particularly in disease that affects the myocardium in a non-uniform distribution. We hypothesized that real-time MRI guidance could improve the yield through targeted biopsy of focal myocardial pathology. METHODS An animal model of focal myocardial pathology was created by infusing 3mL of fluorescent microspheres (NuFlow Hydrocoat, 15m diameter, 5 million spheres/mL) followed by 2mL of 100% ethanol to a branch coronary artery. Animals were survived for minimum 14days, before undergoing MRI guided endomyocardial biopsy using a custom 6.5Fr active visualization MRI-conditional bioptome and X-ray guided biopsy using a commercial bioptome. Specimens were analyzed using a dissecting microscope under ultraviolet light to determine the proportion of 'on-target' specimens containing fluorescent microspheres. RESULTS A total of 77 specimens were obtained using real-time MRI guidance and 87 using X-ray guidance, in five animals. Specimens obtained with the MRI-conditional bioptome were smaller compared with the commercial X-ray bioptome. Real-time MRI guidance significantly increased the diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy (82% vs. 56% on-target biopsy specimens with real-time MRI vs. X-ray guidance, p<0.01).

We have identified IFN-1a as the most promising drug to be repurposed for COVID-19. The rationale relies on the evidence of IFN anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and animal models resembling SARS-CoV-2 infection and on a recent clinical trial where IFN was indicated as the key component of a successful therapeutic combination. Methods: : This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, monocentric, phase II trial (INTERCOP trial). 126 patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFN-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone. No other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms. IFN-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48 hours apart, for a total of two weeks. The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Secondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction. Exploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFN-1a. INTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFN-1a in COVID-19 patients. Discussion: Potential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFN-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease. In case IFN-1a reduced the duration of hospital stay and/or ameliorated the clinical status, it may become a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. Trial registration: EudraCT 2020-002458-25.

Active transportation, which is any form of human-powered transportation, can mitigate the health effects of the climate crisis while simultaneously improving the health of people. Physical activity improves overall well-being, as well as physical and mental health. Active transportation, particularly cycling, is a convenient way to meet physical activity targets, reduce risk of disease and all-cause mortality, and derive mental health and social benefits. Family physician advocacy for active transportation has been shown to increase cycling levels in patients compared with no physician advocacy. CONCLUSION Family physicians can help to increase the level of active transportation at the individual patient level through patient education and behaviour change counseling; at the community level through community education and political advocacy; and at the policy level through partnerships with larger organizations.","output":"Cycling for health: Improving health and mitigating the climate crisis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung failure is the main reason for mortality in COVID-19 patients, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, no drug has been clinically approved for treatment of COVID-19. Nanotechnology has a great potential in contributing significantly to the fight against COVID-19 by developing effective therapies that can selectively eradicate the respiratory virus load. We propose a novel COVID-19 management approach that is efficient in eliminating the virus load from the airways and protecting the lungs from the fatal effects of the virus. This approach relies on targeting the virus using ACE-2-functionalized gold nanorods (AuNRs) followed by irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light for the selective eradication of SARS-CoV-2 without off-target effects, i.e., targeted plasmonic photothermal therapy. Using discrete dipole approximation (DDA), we quantitatively determined the efficiency of AuNRs (31 nm  8 nm) in absorbing NIR when present at different orientations relative to one another on the surface of the virus. The safety and the local administration of AuNRs using a well-tolerated flexible bronchoscopy technique, commonly used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ensure feasibility and clinical translation. While requiring further research, we anticipate this approach to result in a first-line treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are experiencing severe respiratory conditions or belong to a high-risk population, e.g., seniors and diabetic patients.","output":"Localized Plasmonic Photothermal Therapy as a Life-saving Treatment Paradigm for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Where sulfer had sunk to ship hulls, allowing rats to flee to higher ground, hydrocyanic acid (HCN) was devastating at all levels. \\"With the disjuncture of disinfection and disinfestation in the practice of fumigation, efficiency in terms of the rapid destruction of pests and vermin became more important than the capacity to kill pathogens\\" (p. 191).

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) have been suggested to be common after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but other components of ANS function may be also impaired. The Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale 31 (COMPASS-31) questionnaire is a simple and validated tool to assess dysautonomic symptoms. The aim of the present study was to administer the COMPASS-31 questionnaire to a sample of post-COVID patients with and without neurological complaints. Participants were recruited among the post-COVID ambulatory services for follow-up evaluation between 4 weeks and 9 months from COVID-19 symptoms onset. Participants were asked to complete the COMPASS-31 questionnaire referring to the period after COVID-19 disease. Heart rate and blood pressure were manually taken during an active stand test for OH and POTS diagnosis. One-hundred and eighty participants were included in the analysis (70.6% females, 51  13 years), and OH was found in 13.8% of the subjects.

METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to the present, reporting thromboembolic events in chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine users compared to non-users. Four authors independently screened all the records obtained through our search strategy and later revised the selected full-text articles for eligibility, according to our inclusion criteria. The same four authors independently extracted relevant data through a customized data collection form while two other authors assessed the quality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (Version 2.0). All the disagreements were resolved through discussions among the authors. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its respective standard error of developing thromboembolic events in hydroxychloroquine users and non-users for each individual study and pooled the results using a random effects model meta-analysis. We assessed Heterogeneity using the Tau2 and I2, and publication bias using funnel plotting and Egger's regression. The protocol for this systematic review is registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42021247902). RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs met our eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis (2663 patients). We found that hydroxychloroquine-no study on chloroquine was found-reduced the risk of thromboembolic events by 49% (RR 0.51[IC 95% 0.31-0.84]) with a medium heterogeneity (I2 = 67% and T2 = 0.4948).

There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity.

However, their inherent characteristics, such as the informal, and noisy linguistic style, remain challenging to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis. Sentiment classification is tackled mainly by machine learning-based classifiers. The literature has adopted word representations from distinct natures to transform tweets to vector-based inputs to feed sentiment classifiers.

Since then, numerous new obligations for notifications have been added.The aim of this work is to describe and discuss the mandatory notification of infectious diseases in Germany on the basis of their development - compared to previous regulations in Germany (Federal Communicable Diseases Act) as well as international and Europe-wide recommendations (IHR; decisions of the EU Commission 1999, 2018) - and to submit suggestions for improvement.Regarding the considerable increase in reporting requirements and reports in recent years, and the fact that the IfSG provides other surveillance systems in addition to mandatory reporting, the mandatory reporting system should be focused on the necessary reporting requirements. In a first step, the proposed abolition of the mandatory reporting of noroviruses and rotaviruses could relieve both the notifiers and the health authorities, thus enabling more efficient reporting and more intensive and better investigation by the health authorities.","output":"Meldepflichten fr Infektionskrankheiten und Infektionserreger in Deutschland: Entwicklung und Verbesserungsvorschl?ge./ [Mandatory notification of infectious diseases and agents in Germany: development and suggestions for improvement]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an enormous challenge for the health systems and the entire societies of the countries involved. Since at present the outbreak continues to evolve (April 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency of international concern, specifying that public health interventions aimed at the prevention of the further spread of this disease include quarantine. Quarantine, that may be defined as a restraint on the activities of people or on the traffic of goods, targeted to the prevention of the diffusion of communicable pathologies, is a health concept profoundly rooted in the history of mankind. The lessons of the past are always pertinent for the present and for the future, in particular from a public health standpoint. One of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread. With specific reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, health authorities still adopt \\"classical\\" preventive interventions, namely workplace social distancing measures and quarantine, to reduce the transmission of the disease. Only the future will testify the precise overall effectiveness of preventive public health measures in containing the impact of the present coronavirus pandemic. However, what in this epidemiological scenario is already known, is that the multi-century international health value of quarantine remains essential and unavoidable.","output":"Historical and methodological highlights of quarantine measures: from ancient plague epidemics to current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Group B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS) is an important cause of life-threatening disease in newborns. Pregnant women colonized with GBS can transmit the bacteria to the developing fetus, as well as to their neonates during or after delivery where infection can lead to sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, or/and death. While intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is the standard of care for prevention of invasive GBS disease in some countries, even in such settings a substantial residual burden of disease remains. A GBS vaccine administered during pregnancy could potentially address this important unmet medical need and provide an adjunct or alternative to IAP for the prevention of invasive GBS disease in neonates. A hurdle for vaccine development has been relatively low disease rates making efficacy studies difficult. Given the well-accepted inverse relationship between anti-GBS capsular polysaccharide antibody titers at birth and risk of disease, licensure using serological criteria as a surrogate biomarker represents a promising approach to accelerate the availability of a GBS vaccine.","output":"Advances towards licensure of a maternal vaccine for the prevention of invasive group B streptococcus disease in infants: a discussion of different approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is considered as a major public health problem caused by the SARS CoV-2. This Viral infection is known to induce worldwide pandemic in short period of time. Emerging evidence suggested that the transmission control and drug therapy may influence the preventive measures extensively as the host surrounding environment and pathogenic mechanism may contribute to the pandemic condition earlier in COVID-19 disease. Although, several animals identified as reservoir to date, however human-to-human transmission is well documented. Human beings are sustaining the virus in the communities and act as an amplifier of the virus. Human activities i.e., living with the patient, touching patient waste etc. in the surrounding of active patients or asymptomatic persons cause significant risk factors for transmission. On the other hand, drug target and mechanism to destroy the virus or virus inhibition is depends on diversified approaches of drugs and different target for virus life cycle. This article describes the sustainable chemical preventive models understanding, requirements, technology adaptation and the implementation strategies in these pandemic-like situations. As the outbreak progresses, healthcare models focused on transmission control through disinfections and sanitization based on risk calculations. Identification of the most suitable target of drugs and regional control model of transmission are of high priority. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of epidemiological information is important to encourage preventive measures efforts by public health authorities and provide robust evidence to guide interventions. Here, we have discussed the level of adaptations in technology that research professionals display toward their public health preventive models. We should compile a representative data set of adaptations that humans can consider for transmission control and adopt for viruses and their hosts. Overall, there are many aspects of the chemical science and technology in virus preventive measures. Herein, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the sustainable preventive model are presented. This kind of sustainable preventive model having adaptation and implementation with green chemistry system will reduce the shedding of the virus into the community by eco-friendly methods, and thus the risk of transmission and infection progression can be mitigated.","output":"Sustainable Chemical Preventive Models in COVID-19: Understanding, Innovation, Adaptations, and Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: There are limited studies comparing the effects of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing natural estrogens and synthetic ethinylestradiol (EE) on reproductive hormones. OBJECTIVE: To compare estradiol valerate (EV)+dienogest (DNG), EE+DNG, and DNG alone (an active control) on levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone, Anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH), ovarian steroids, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and the Free Androgen Index (FAI). DESIGN: Spin-off study from a randomized trial. SETTING: Outpatient setting at Helsinki and Oulu University Hospitals, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: 59 healthy, 18-35-year-old ovulatory women were enrolled. Three women discontinued. The groups were comparable as regards age and body mass index. INTERVENTIONS: EV 2mg+DNG 2-3mg (n=20), EE 0.03mg+DNG 2mg (n=20) and DNG 2mg (n=19) were used continuously for nine weeks. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, and at 5 and 9 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: EV+DNG suppressed FSH by -27% (-51:-3) (median [95%CI]) vs. EE+DNG, -64% (-78: -51), P=0.04, but AMH levels decreased similarly by -9% (-18: -0.1) vs. -13% (-28:0.2), P=0.38, respectively. EV+DNG increased SHBG levels by 56% (30:82) and EE+DNG by 385% (313:423), P<0.001. Total testosterone (T) decreased by 16% (-27: -5) in the EV+DNG group but it did not decrease in the EE+DNG group, whereas the FAI decreased by -39% (-54: -25) vs. -72% (-78: -67), P<0.001. DNG alone did not induce changes in any of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with EE+DNG, treatment with EV+DNG resulted in milder pituitary downregulation and reduced induction of hepatic SHBG synthesis-potentially carrying more beneficial health effects.","output":"Estradiol Valerate Vs.

An answer can help determine the susceptibility of an individual on exposure to a COVID-2019 carrier and can also provide a preliminary projection of the still-unknown infectious dose for the disease. Computational fluid mechanics enabled tracking of respiratory transport in medical imaging-based anatomic domains shows that the regional deposition of virus-laden inhaled droplets at the initial nasopharyngeal infection site peaks for the droplet size range of approximately 2.5-19 [Formula: see text]. Through integrating the numerical findings on inhaled transmission with sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and earlier measurements of ejecta size distribution generated during regular speech, this study further reveals that the number of virions that may go on to establish the SARS-CoV-2 infection in a subject could merely be in the order of hundreds.","output":"Computational characterization of inhaled droplet transport to the nasopharynx"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Arenaviridae is a diverse and growing family of viruses that already includes more than 25 distinct species. While some of these viruses have a significant impact on public health, others appear to be non-pathogenic. At present little is known about the host cell responses to infection with different arenaviruses, particularly those found in the New World; however, apoptosis is known to play an important role in controlling infection of many viruses. Here we show that infection with Tacaribe virus (TCRV), which is widely considered the prototype for non-pathogenic arenaviruses, leads to stronger induction of apoptosis than does infection with its human-pathogenic relative Junn virus. TCRV-induced apoptosis occurred in several cell types during late stages of infection and was shown to be caspase-dependent, involving the activation of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9. Further, UV-inactivated TCRV did not induce apoptosis, indicating that the activation of this process is dependent on active viral replication/transcription. Interestingly, when apoptosis was inhibited, growth of TCRV was not enhanced, indicating that apoptosis does not have a direct negative effect on TCRV infection in vitro. Taken together, our data identify and characterize an important virus-host cell interaction of the prototypic, non-pathogenic arenavirus TCRV, which provides important insight into the growing field of arenavirus research aimed at better understanding the diversity in responses to different arenavirus infections and their functional consequences.","output":"The New World arenavirus Tacaribe virus induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The formation of micelles on surfaces by spin-coating dilute solutions of diblock, triblock, and tetrablock copoly(2-oxazoline)s in a non-selective solvent is demonstrated.

Nevertheless, there is variation in the burden of opioid overdose and foster care rates across the U.S., suggesting community supports and systems to support families affected by substance use also vary. This qualitative study sampled communities experiencing high and low rates of overdose mortality and foster care entries (i.e., a qualitative comparison group) to better understand what might protect some counties from high overdose mortality and foster care entries. The sample included six counties from three states that were selected based on their rates of opioid overdose mortality and foster care entries. Using purposive sampling within counties, interview and discussion group participants included multi-sector community partners, parents whose children had been removed due to parental substance use, and caregivers caring for children who had been removed from their homes. Across all counties, prevention was not front-of-mind. Yet, participants from communities experiencing high rates of overdose mortality and foster care entries identified several factors that might help lessen exposure to substance use and ACEs including more community-based prevention services for children and youth. Both parents and caregivers across all communities also described the need for additional supports and services.

Here we investigated the IFN- response to human adenoviruses (Ads) in mice. By comparing the responses of normal, myeloid (m)DC- and plasmacytoid (p)DC-depleted mice and by measuring IFN- mRNA expression in different organs and cells types, we show that in vivo, Ads elicit strong and rapid IFN- production, almost exclusively in splenic mDCs. Using knockout mice, various strains of Ads (wild type, mutant and UV-inactivated) and MAP kinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Ad-induced IFN- response does not require Toll-like receptors (TLR), known cytosolic sensors of RNA (RIG-I/MDA-5) and DNA (DAI) recognition and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, but is dependent on viral endosomal escape, signaling via the MAP kinase SAPK/JNK and IRF-7. Furthermore, we show that Ads induce IFN- and IL-6 in vivo by distinct pathways and confirm that IFN- positively regulates the IL-6 response. Finally, by measuring TNF- responses to LPS in Ad-infected wild type and IFN-R(?/?) mice, we show that IFN- is the key mediator of Ad-induced hypersensitivity to LPS. These findings indicate that, like endosomal TLR signaling in pDCs, TLR-independent virus recognition in splenic mDCs can also produce a robust early IFN- response, which is responsible for the bulk of IFN- production induced by adenovirus in vivo. The signaling requirements are different from known TLR-dependent or cytosolic IFN- induction mechanisms and suggest a novel cytosolic viral induction pathway.

The first genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were available in early 2020. Subsequent whole-genome sequencing revealed that the virus had accumulated several mutations in genes associated with viral replication and pathogenesis. These variants showed enhanced transmissibility and infectivity. Soon after the first outbreak due to the wild-type strain in December 2019, a genetic variant D614G emerged in late January to early February 2020 and became the dominant genotype worldwide. Thereafter, several variants emerged, which were found to harbor mutations in essential viral genes encoding proteins that could act as drug and vaccine targets. Numerous vaccines have been successfully developed to assuage the burden of COVID-19. These have different rates of efficacy, including, although rarely, a number of vaccinated individuals exhibiting side effects like thrombosis. However, the recent emergence of the Britain strain with 70% more transmissibility and South African variants with higher resistance to vaccines at a time when several countries have approved these for mass immunization has raised tremendous concern regarding the long-lasting impact of currently available prophylaxis. Apart from studies addressing the pathophysiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2, analysis of the gut, oral, nasopharyngeal, and lung microbiome dysbiosis has also been undertaken to find a link between the microbiome and the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Therefore, in the current scenario of skepticism regarding vaccine efficacy and challenges over the direct effects of currently available drugs looming large, investigation of alternative therapeutic avenues based on the microbiome can be a rewarding finding. This review presents the currently available understanding of microbiome dysbiosis and its association with cause and consequence of COVID-19. Taking cues from other inflammatory diseases, we propose a hypothesis of how the microbiome may be influencing homeostasis, pro-inflammatory condition, and the onset of inflammation.

METHODS: We used electronic medical record data for Arab American adults aged 18 years from March 1, 2020, through January 31, 2021, at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa, California. The primary outcomes were receiving a positive COVID-19 test result and being admitted to the hospital for COVID-19.

With millions of individuals infected and over two hundred thousand deaths, the necessity to develop fast and efficient diagnostic methods is of high importance. Diagnostic modalities rely on a combination of epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory examination, and appropriate imaging to diagnose and distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other pulmonary infections. The purpose of this paper is to report on currently available diagnostic screening methods for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to guide frontline healthcare workers involved with COVID-19 patient care. METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1, 2020, until April 26, 2020. Articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topic. RESULTS: The preferred diagnostic approach is reverse transcription of the virus RNA followed by PCR amplification (RT-PCR). This method recognizes the gene-specific primers to target various viral protein genes, such as the envelope protein gene or the nucleocapsid protein gene, which enables this test to be both sensitive and specific toward SARS-CoV-2. However, this method has been proven to be time-consuming taking hours-to-days for the results. In order to improve the speed and efficiency of diagnostics, newer rapid diagnostic serological tests are being developed for testing SARS-CoV-2, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages. They could potentially be used as triage tests to rapidly identify patients who are very likely to have COVID-19 in combination with other accurate diagnostic methods. CONCLUSION: Therefore, a combination of diagnostic testing used in a timely manner may be beneficial for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. This was evident in cases where despite initial negative RT-PCR tests for various patients, who later demonstrate chest CT scans with various degrees of consolidation and ground-glass opacity.

This would establish what those experiences meant to nurses during the initial outbreak to enable their coping mechanisms to face subsequent waves in the United Kingdom. BACKGROUND The worst infectious disease outbreak of a generation rapidly made its impact known to the medical profession and its support infrastructure across the globe. It imparted unprecedented challenges, not only for managing the care of the most critically ill but for minimising its spread and protecting the workforce. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE Reflections of working on the covid-19 frontline during the initial stages of the pandemic, the challenges faced, and lessons learned enabled the development of a strategy to better support nurses in the ongoing pandemic. DISCUSSION Visible, invested and consistent leadership was key in forming a strong foundation to support clear communication, peer support and increasing confidence. Consequently, strong bonds were forged to enable the team to face further challenges as they felt 'in it together'. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY The experiences described in this paper are those of a senior nurse leader within a particular care context. However, the lessons learned are likely to resonate with many nurses who are facing the same challenges in very similar care contexts and who are urged to reflect upon their own experiences. Furthermore, the associated lessons may help support others and inform their strategy for coping throughout potential future admission surges of this pandemic.","output":"From front line to battle planning: a nursing perspective of covid-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric ocular neoplasm. Multimodality treatment approaches are commonplace, and selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery has emerged as a safe and effective treatment in selected patients. Minimizing radiation dose in this highly radiosensitive patient cohort is critical. We explore which procedural factors affect the radiation dose in a single-center cohort of children managed in the UK National Retinoblastoma Service. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed of 177 selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery procedures in 48 patients with retinoblastoma (2013-2017). Medical records, angiographic imaging, and radiation dosimetry data (including total fluoroscopic screening time, skin dose, and dose-area product) were reviewed. RESULTS The mean fluoroscopic time was 13.5  13 minutes, the mean dose-area product was 11.7  9.7 Gy.cm2, and the mean total skin dose was 260.9  211.6 mGy. One hundred sixty-three of 177 procedures (92.1%) were technically successful. In 14 (7.9%), the initial attempt was unsuccessful (successful in 13/14 re-attempts). Screening time and radiation dose were associated with drug-delivery microcatheter location and patient age; screening time was associated with treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS In selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery, a microcatheter tip position in the proximal or ostial ophthalmic artery and patient age 2 years or younger were associated with reduced fluoroscopic screening time and radiation dose; treatment beyond the first cycle was associated with reduced fluoroscopic screening time.","output":"Determinants of Radiation Dose in Selective Ophthalmic Artery Chemosurgery for Retinoblastoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Festivals have become a part of the cultural fabric of global society and a tourism and leisure pursuit that is participated in by many.

There is no doubt that the pandemic had an impact on the situation of households, which is mainly visible in the labor market (rising unemployment), and thus the question arises to what extent have the households approaches to financial decisions changed because of this situation? The propensity to save was taken into account as a main aspect of this problem, because it has, among others, a big impact on the financial well-being (in a broader sense). Using the multiple linear regression method, the factors that influence the level of household savings were determined. The results of the research show that these factors are different in the analyzed countries and have a different impact on the level of the explained variable, which is the gross saving rate.

Their most general design offers great flexibility and direct feedback, but has been described to be inefficient and demands good coordination of the upper extremities while critically influencing users actions. Multiple research groups have used Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to quantify physical activities in wheelchairs arguing that knowledge over behavioural patterns in manual wheelchair usage can guide technological development and improved designs. The present study investigates turning behaviour among fulltime wheelchair users, laying the foundation of the development of novel steering systems that allow directing kinetic energy by means other than braking. Three wearable sensors were installed on the wheelchairs of 14 individuals for tracking movement over an entire week. During detected moving windows, phases where the velocities of the two rear wheels differed by more than 0.05 m/s were considered as turns. Kinematic characteristics for both turns-on-the-spot as well as for moving turns were then derived from the previously reconstructed wheeled path. For the grand total of 334 km of recorded wheelchair movement, a turn was detected every 3.6 m, which equates to about 900 turns per day on average and shows that changing and adjusting direction is fundamental in wheelchair practice. For moving turns, a median turning radius of 1.09 m and a median turning angle of 39 were found. With a median of 89, typical turning angles were considerably larger for turns-on-the-spot, which accounted for roughly a quarter of the recognised turns and often started from a standstill. These results suggest that a frequent pattern in daily wheelchair usage is to initiate movement with an orienting turn-on-the-spot, and cover distances with short, straightforward sections while adjusting direction in small and tight moving turns. As large bends often require simultaneous pushing and breaking, this is, perhaps, the result of users intuitively optimising energy efficiency, but more research is needed to understand how the design of the assistive devices implicitly directs users movement.","output":"Turning in Circles: Understanding Manual Wheelchair Use Towards Developing User-Friendly Steering Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, one needs to search billions of mass spectra against the human proteome with billions of amino acids, where many of the amino acids go through post-translational modifications.

We evaluated stent-retriever characteristics and their relation to reperfusion in the ESCAPE-NA1 trial. METHODS Independent re-scoring of reperfusion grade for each attempt was conducted. The following characteristics were evaluated: stent-retriever length and diameter, thrombus position within stent-retriever, bypass effect, deployment in the superior or inferior MCA trunk, use of balloon guide catheter and distal access catheter. Primary outcome was successful reperfusion defined as expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) 2b-3 per attempt. The secondary outcome was successful reperfusion eTICI 2b-3 after the first attempt. Separate regression models for each stent-retriever characteristic and an exploratory multivariable modeling to test the impact of all characteristics on successful reperfusion were built. RESULTS Of 1105 patients in the trial, 809 with the stent-retriever use (1241 attempts) were included in the primary analysis. The stent-retriever was used as the first-line approach in 751 attempts. A successful attempt was associated with thrombus position within the proximal or middle third of the stent (OR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.24-3.40 and OR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.16-3.15 compared to the distal third respectively) and with bypass effect (OR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.07-2.72). Thrombus position within the proximal or middle third (OR 2.80; 95% CI: 1.47-5.35 and OR 2.05; 95% CI: 1.09-3.84, respectively) was associated with first-pass eTICI 2b-3 reperfusion. In the exploratory analysis accounting for all characteristics, bypass effect was the only independent predictor of eTICI 2b-3 reperfusion (OR 1.95; 95% CI: 1.10-3.46).

Since the lockdown, screening examinations and routine checkups have been restricted to prevent the spread of the virus and to increase the hospitals bed capacity across the country. This resulted in a severe decline of patient referrals to the hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers in Austria. METHODS: Data of 2077 patients from 18 centers in Austria with newly diagnosed gynecological or breast cancer between January and May 2019 and January and May 2020 were collected. Clinical parameters, including symptoms, performance status, co-morbidities, and referral status, were compared between the time before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Our results showed a slight increase of newly diagnosed cancers in January and February 2020 as compared with 2019 (+2 and +35%, respectively) and a strong decline in newly diagnosed tumors since the lockdown: ?24% in March 2020 versus March 2019, ?49% in April 2020 versus April 2019, ?49% in May 2020 versus May 2019. Two-thirds of patients diagnosed during the pandemic presented with tumor-specific symptoms compared with less than 50% before the pandemic (p<0.001). Moreover, almost 50% of patients in 2020 had no co-morbidities compared with 35% in 2019 (p<0.001). Patients, who already had a malignant disease, were rarely diagnosed with a new cancer in 2020 as compared with 2019 (11% vs 6%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown led to a decreased number of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers. The decreased accessibility of the medical services and postponed diagnosis of potentially curable cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic may be a step backwards in our healthcare system and might impair cancer treatment outcomes.

However, viral concentrations or loads in wastewater often correlate poorly with clinical case numbers. To date, there is no reliable method to back-estimate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. This greatly limits WBE in achieving its full potential in monitoring the unfolding pandemic. The exponentially growing SARS-CoV-2 WBE dataset, on the other hand, offers an opportunity to develop data-driven models for the estimation of COVID-19 case numbers (both incidence and prevalence) and transmission dynamics (effective reproduction rate).

The ANN models were trained and evaluated with a comprehensive state-wide wastewater monitoring dataset from Utah, USA during May 2020 to December 2021. In diverse sewer catchments, ANN models were found to accurately estimate the COVID-19 prevalence and incidence rates, with excellent precision for prevalence rates.

The study investigated the properties of CDF compared to PAM, which showed that the prepared CDF exhibited a highly effective flocculation on sludge dewatering, a higher transmittance and chemical oxygen demand removal rate, and a lower value of effluent ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus. The fermentation process was also analyzed by testing the performance of dewatered sludge (temperature, pH, ammonia nitrogen, E4/E6 (humic acid absorbance at 465 nm (E4) and 665 nm (E6))). The dehydrated sludge with CDF could be easily compressed into cakes by belt-filter for easy transportation and storage.

Here, we use Twitter as a distributed news and opinion aggregation source to identify and track the dynamics of the dominant day-scale stories around Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. Working with a data set comprising around 20 billion 1-grams, we first compare each day's 1-gram and 2-gram usage frequencies to those of a year before, to create day- and week-scale timelines for Trump stories for 2016 through 2020. We measure Trump's narrative control, the extent to which stories have been about Trump or put forward by Trump. We then quantify story turbulence and collective chronopathy -- the rate at which a population's stories for a subject seem to change over time. We show that 2017 was the most turbulent overall year for Trump. In 2020, story generation slowed dramatically during the first two major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, with rapid turnover returning first with the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd's murder and then later by events leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, including the storming of the US Capitol six days into 2021. Trump story turnover for 2 months during the COVID-19 pandemic was on par with that of 3 days in September 2017.

The evidence for integrating support group into pulmonary hypertension care and its effect on quality of life, physical and psychological well-being is limited. We sought to assess the effect of support group participation on quality of life in patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and their caregivers. The emPHasis-10 questionnaire (a tool validated for quality of life assessment in pulmonary hypertension) was used to evaluate the effect of support group participation. Additional demographic and health-related quality measures were examined. Results showed that 165 subjects were enrolled in the study; 122 (74.4%) were patients with pulmonary hypertension, 41 (25.0%) were their caregivers, and 2 (0.02%) did not respond. The cohort was predominantly female (n = 128, 78%), Caucasian (n = 10, 61%), and the principal self-reported classification of pulmonary hypertension was World Health Organization Group 1 (n = 85, 51.8%) and the self-reported New York Heart Association Functional Class was II and III (n = 43, 57.3%). Most participants (n = 118, 71.5%) attended support groups and of them, a majority (n = 107, 90.6%) stated it helped them. There was no difference in quality of life as assessed by emPHasis-10 scores with support group participation (median score 30 vs 32, p = 0.387). There was self-reported improvement in understanding condition better including procedures such as right heart catheterization, medication compliance, and confidence in self-care (p < 0.05). Using multivariate logistic regression, baseline variables that were independently associated with emPHasis-10 scores for the entire cohort included knowledge of New York Heart Association Functional Class (odds ratio: 1.919, 95% CI: 1.004C3.67, p = 0.04) and greater distance traveled to visit pulmonary hypertension physician (odds ratio: 1.391, 95% CI: 0.998--1.94, p = 0.05).

In this county, 27% of mammogram eligible women, ages 40-64 are uninsured, compared to about 11% the national average. Harris Health (HH) is a state funded network of SafetyNet hospitals and clinics that provide comprehensive care, including breast cancer screening to the uninsured and underinsured residents of the Harris county. The population who receives care at the HH sites is majority of racial and ethnic minorities and generally lower socioeconomic status than the county average. The number of screening mammograms abruptly dropped by 94% across the United States following the declaration of the COVID-19 national emergency. Currently there is no data on how breast cancer screening rates have been affected during the pandemic across Houston, and specifically in Harris County where health disparities gap already existed. We hypothesized that the population across HH sites have lower rates of screening mammograms following the COVID-19 pandemic declaration compared to the rest of the population across Houston who visit Baylor St. Luke's Health- Texas (SLH) catchment area. Methods: We retrieved the monthly gross number of screening mammograms performed at all HH sites and SLH sites from February to October for both 2019 and 2020 on the PENRAD database. We then used the Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U Test to assess differences in the distribution of percent change in mammogram between HH sites and SLH sites. First, we compared the total mammogram numbers for February to October (2020 vs. 2019). We then compared only the numbers for each month (e.g., May 2020 vs. May 2019). Beyond basic descriptive counts, statistical analysis was limited to mammogram among women ages 40 - 69. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: Overall, across both health care systems, HH and SLH, and for all ages, there was a drastic drop (53.96%) in screening mammogram between 2019 (N=32,968) and 2020 (N=17,788). For women ages 40 - 69, the drop in screening mammogram at SLH sites during 2020 (February to October) was significantly less than the drop at HH sites during the same period. When screening mammogram was compared between 2019 and 2020 for each month separately, it was only in May and September that the % change in mammogram were similar for SLH and HH. For the remaining months, SLH site had significantly less drop in screening mammograms. Conclusion: The population that normally receives care at HH site had significantly lower rates of screening mammograms following the pandemic compared to the population who receives care at SLH sites. This will likely widen the already present disparity gap in breast cancer outcomes for the city of Houston.","output":"Disparities in breast cancer screening and the impact of COVID-19 in Houston, Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: While pathogenesis in COVID-19 is not fully known and the effects between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system are complicated, it is known that lymphopenia, hyper-inflammatory responses, and cytokines play an important role in the pathology of COVID-19. While some hematological abnormalities have been described among the laboratory features of COVID-19, there have not been studies reported on lymphocyte subset analyses in children. The aim of this study was to describe lymphocyte subsets in pediatric patients with mild/moderate or severe COVID-19. Methods: The subjects in the study were children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia confirmed with the real-time RT-PCR. The subjects were admitted to the Children's Medical Center, affiliated with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, between March 7(th) and June 10(th) of 2020. The complete blood counts and lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed for each patient. Results: The study included 55 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (34 patients (62%) with an observed mild/moderate case of the disease and 21 patients (38%) with severedisease). Lymphocyte counts were found to be lower in patients with a severe case (mean  SD 1.6  0.9 in the severe group vs. 2.3  2.2 in the mild group). Compared to the group with mild/moderate pneumonia, children with severe pneumonia had an increased count of CD8(+) T cell and a lower percentage of CD4(+) T cell. However, the differences between the groups were negligible. Interestingly, the severe group had a lower CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio compared to the mild group (1.1  0.47 vs. 1.4  0.8, p-value: 0.063). CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio &lt;2, 1.5, and 1 was found in 48 (87%), 40 (73%), and 19 cases (35%).

Licensed vaccines are available only for influenza virus, with vaccines against the other pathogens either in clinical trials or in preclinical stages of development. The majority of studies evaluating respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses, because, although both cellular and humoral responses contribute to the clearance of a primary infection, neutralizing antibodies are known to protect against secondary infection. Humoral responses can be readily detected after vaccination with inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, fewer individuals seroconvert after vaccination with live vaccines.

In this investigation, we aimed to evaluate ADAMTS13 activity, von Willebrand factor level (VWF:Ag), and the corresponding ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio, in patients with COVID-19 and for associations with disease progression and acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with COVID-19 were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. ADAMTS13 activity and VWF:Ag were measured at index ED visit. The primary endpoint was severe AKI defined by KDIGO stage 2 + 3 criteria, while the secondary endpoint was peak 30-day COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: A total of 52 adult COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Overall, we observed that 23.1% of the cohort had a relative deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity, while 80.8% had elevated VWF:Ag. The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in patients with severe AKI (P = .002) and those who developed the severe form of COVID-19 (P = .020). The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was negatively correlated with age (P < .001) and LDH (P < .001), while positively correlated with hemoglobin (P = .041). After controlling for confounders, a one-unit increase in ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was associated with 20% decreased odds of severe AKI. CONCLUSION: A low ADAMTS13 activity:VWF:Ag ratio at ED presentation is associated with progression to severe COVID-19 disease and severe AKI, with a pattern suggestive of a secondary microangiopathy.

We experimentally infected domestic cats with B. koehlerae to establish the microbiological and immunological characteristics of this infection in cats and to compare it to infections with those caused by B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. Four cats were inoculated intradermally with B. koehlerae (8.6 x 10(7) to 3.84 x 10(8) CFU/ml). None of the cats presented any obvious clinical signs, but all cats developed bacteremia, which peaked at 3.36 x 10(4) to 1.44 x 10(6) CFU/ml of blood between day 14 and day 36 postinoculation. B. koehlerae-inoculated cats had a bacteremia duration (mean, 74 days) shorter than did cats inoculated with B. clarridgeiae (mean, 324 days) (P = 0.03). None of the four cats inoculated with B. koehlerae had bacteremia relapse. As shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using B. koehlerae outer membrane protein (OMP) antigens, the four cats developed a species-specific antibody response, and ELISA testing using other feline Bartonella OMP antigens showed statistically lower optical density values. All four cats developed similar antibody reactivity patterns to B. koehlerae OMP antigens as seen by Western blotting, each with at least 20 seroreactive protein bands. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein profile differences were observed for both whole-cell lysate and OMPs from B. koehlerae, compared with B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. B. koehlerae was more closely related to B. henselae than to B. clarridgeiae by protein profile, and this relatedness was also confirmed by analysis of the genomic DNA profiles by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.","output":"Experimental infection of domestic cats with Bartonella koehlerae and comparison of protein and DNA profiles with those of other Bartonella species infecting felines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study?

ABSTRACT: The short\\\\term cardiopulmonary manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) are well defined. However, the implications of cardiopulmonary sequelae, persisting beyond acute illness, on physical function are largely unknown. Herein, we characterized heart rate responses to and recovery from a 6\\\\minute walk test (6MWT) in women 3 months after mild\\\\to\\\\moderate SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection compared with non\\\\infected control subjects. Forty\\\\five women (n = 29 SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2; n = 16 controls; age = 56  11 years; body mass index = 25.8  6.0 kg/m(2)) completed pulmonary function testing and a 6MWT.

In this study, we present an experiment aimed at analyzing human behavior in simple teleoperated pick-and-place tasks in a simulated scenario and at devising a suitable model for early estimation of the current proximal intention. We show that scan paths are, as expected, heavily shaped by the current intention and that two types of Gaussian Hidden Markov Models, one more scene-specific and one more action-specific, achieve a very good prediction performance, while also generalizing to new users and spatial arrangements.

Results: : Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Jan 2020, 88.9% of patients washed their hands before meals and 55.6% after they ate. All of the patients who are >3 years old and 91% of the patients <3 years olds wore face masks regularly as a strategy for protection in the outdoors. When in the hospital, 95.5% of the patients who are >3 years old and 78% of the patients <3 years olds wore face masks regularly as a strategy for protection. Since the outbreak of coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China in Jan, 2020, the percentage of compliance to hand-washing before and after meals rose to 100% for all patients, as well as the compliance of regular mask use was 100%. Similar trend is also seen in the caretakers, prior to the outbreak 75% of whom washed their hands before and 66.7% after they ate or handed food. ALL of them wore masks regularly in the hospital or outdoors. Since the outbreak, 100% of caretakers wore masks during outside and in the wards. Regardless of the children with ALL are immunocompromised patients, key message of infection prevention provided to the families were using alcohol to disinfect surfaces, avoid going to public transport and without visitor or travelling. Prior to the outbreak, internet consults consisted of 20% out of all patient consults. As of date, which is 160 days since the outbreak, 80% of patient consults are done via internet.

The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life. Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis. The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health. PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished. Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P < 0.01). Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P < 0.01). Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease. In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

During the first wave, 43.6% of patients contacted their IBD nurse; usually questions regarding medication (20.6%), appointments (18.4%) or SARS-CoV2 infection risk (6%). For the majority of patients (96.5%) these contacts were sufficient. In person follow-up consultation was scheduled for 178 patients. From those, 31 considered cancelling their consultation due to the pandemic and 18 effectively cancelled (Fig 1). [Image: see text] Half of the population (51.6%) received intravenous therapy at the day clinic. Telephonic pre-admission screening the day before was done for all patients and well received in most of them (98.5%). During the first wave, endoscopy was planned in 31.5% of the responding patients. A minority (11.1%) postponed or cancelled endoscopic appointments. From those, 55.6% reported that the main reason was fear of the coronavirus. Ninety-four (39.2%) of responders had a telephonic consultation during the first wave. Different aspects regarding satisfaction and acceptance of telemedicine were also assessed (Fig 2C3). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] For further follow-up, 60.2% preferred balanced combination of telephonic and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSION: Remote ways of care delivery were generally well received during the first wave of the pandemic. Only a minority of patients cancelled appointments without discussion with the medical team. The most frequent patient concerns were about medications and appointments. The challenges in continuity of care during the pandemic created a window for new ways of care delivery in the future.","output":"N06 Patient perspectives on the role of the IBD nurse and telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic: results from a Belgian tertiary IBD unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine use for treatment of COVID-19 patients has been under discussion and recommendations have been shifting from positive to caution or non-conclusive. Variability of clinical outputs requires understanding of mechanisms of the differences. Implementation of a companion diagnostic would allow selecting patients who may benefit from the drug. The first line would be markers already used in clinics. Systems biology opens for an opportunity to identify targets common for chloroquine and SARS-CoV-2. These common targets would be candidates for the companion diagnostic.METHODS: Systemic analysis of molecular mechanisms and markers engaged by chloroquine and SARS-CoV-2 virus was performed. The networks of regulatory mechanisms were explored for an intersection and relevance to clinical markers.RESULTS: Reported here systemic analysis describes the intersection of molecular mechanisms of chloroquine and processes engaged by COVID-19. 266 nodes provide insight into the mechanisms of chloroquine impact on the infection and represent a pool of companion diagnostic markers. As an example, an intersection with the markers of heart arrhythmia retrieved 19 nodes. Thirteen of them were reported in human plasma: levels of albumin, amyloid precursor protein, and endoglin correlate with adverse cardiac effects. CONCLUSIONS: Reported intersection nodes of SARS-CoV-2 and chloroquine are the candidate markers for companion diagnostic of the chloroquine application. Some of these markers are already used in the clinic and their interpretation may contribute to monitoring for adverse effects of chloroquine.","output":"Chloroquine use in the Treatment of COVID-19: Systems Biology Report of Common Targets of SARS-CoV-2 and Chloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2014 Ebola outbreak in three African states transformed the virus into a social reality in which media representations contributed to globalised hysteria and had rhetorical effects.

Overall symptom duration was significantly less in the zinc group than in the placebo group (mean, 3.8 day vs 5.1 days). The mean severity rating for all symptoms was lower in the zinc group than in the placebo group; this difference, however, was not statistically significant. Allergy-positive subjects who used zinc had a statistically significant shorter duration of nasal symptoms than allergy-negative subjects (3.5 days vs 7.6 days).

Only drugs that are already registered or close to registration, and therefore have passed lengthy safety assessments, have a chance to be tested in clinical trials and reach patients quickly enough to help in the current disease outbreak. Here, we have reviewed available evidence and possible ways forward to identify already existing pharmaceuticals displaying modest broad-spectrum antiviral activity which is likely linked to their high accumulation in cells. Several well studied examples indicate that these drugs accumulate in lysosomes, endosomes and biological membranes in general, and thereby interfere with endosomal pathway and intracellular membrane trafficking crucial for viral infection. With the aim to identify other lysosomotropic drugs with possible inherent antiviral activity, we have applied a set of clear physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and molecular criteria on 530 existing drugs. In addition to publicly available data, we have also used our in silico model for the prediction of accumulation in lysosomes and endosomes. By this approach we have identified 36 compounds with possible antiviral effects, also against coronaviruses. For 14 of them evidence of broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported, adding support to the value of this approach. Presented pros and cons, knowledge gaps and methods to identify lysosomotropic antivirals, can help in the evaluation of many drugs currently in clinical trials considered for repurposing to target COVID-19, as well as open doors to finding more potent and safer alternatives.","output":"Existing highly accumulating lysosomotropic drugs with potential for repurposing to target COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXTE: Le prsent document ainsi que les constats et prises de position qu&#039;il nonce ont t rdigs en rponse  une interpellation du ministre de la Sant et des Services sociaux dans le contexte de l&#039;urgence sanitaire lie  la maladie  coronavirus (COVID-19) au Qubec Cette position est base sur une recension sommaire de la documentation scientifique (Pubmed, littrature grise) identifie par des professionnels en valuation et pharmaciens de l&#039;INESSS Par ailleurs, son contenu ne repose pas sur une recherche exhaustive de la littrature et une valuation de la qualit des tudes avec des outils standardiss Dans les circonstances d&#039;une telle urgence de sant publique, l&#039;INESSS reste  l&#039;aff?t de toutes nouvelles donnes susceptibles de faire voluer sa position Ainsi, des mises  jour sont prvues POSITION DE L&#039;INESSS: Compte tenu de l&#039;tat des connaissances actuelles, il n&#039;est pas indiqu d&#039;administrer de l&#039;oseltamivir pour le traitement des patients ayant un diagnostic confirm ou suspect de COVID-19 L&#039;OSELTAMIVIR: L&#039;oseltamivir est un promdicament dont le mtabolite actif est un inhibiteur slectif de l&#039;enzyme neuraminidase des virus influenza de type A et de type B Il s&#039;administre par voie orale Selon certains spcialistes, l&#039;oseltamivir pourrait supprimer la rplication virale dans certains cas (Pappas 2020) -Les rsultats d&#039;une srie de cas portant sur 138 patients hospitaliss  Wuhan parmi lesquels 89,9% ont re?u l&#039;oseltamivir ont t publis (Wang 2020) Les patients ont galement re?u des antibiotiques et de la mthylprednisolone Les doses d&#039;oseltamivir et de mthylprednisolone taient adaptes  la gravit de l&#039;infection Selon les auteurs, ces cas n&#039;ont pas rvl de signal d&#039;efficacit de l&#039;oseltamivir D&#039;autres sries de cas de patients traits avec l&#039;oseltamivir ont t rapports sans qu&#039;elles permettent de conclure quant  l&#039;efficacit de cette molcule (Huang 2020) Aucun des guides consults (Chine, Italie, Belgique, France, Universit de Washington, Universit du Michigan) n&#039;a inclus l&#039;oseltamivir parmi les choix de traitement","output":"COVID-19 et oseltamivir (TamifluMC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in South-East Asia and East Asia shows distinct clinical, environmental, physiological and likely genetic differences compared with the West.

Building on previous research documenting the pernicious effects of stress on youth mental health, we aimed to test the effects of exposure to COVID-19-related stress on youth symptomatology. Further, in light of evidence suggesting that parents play an important role in buffering children from environmental stress, we assessed how specific parental behaviors (i.e., parental emotion socialization, maintenance of home routines, and availability to discuss the pandemic with child) contributed to effective parental buffering of the impact of pandemic-related stress on childrens symptomatology. Conversely, we tested whether parental anxiety-related symptomatology and parenting stress exacerbated the effect of childrens exposure to pandemic-related stress on childrens symptomatology. Results suggest that parents who engaged in relatively higher levels of emotion coaching of childrens negative emotions and who maintained more stable home routines during the pandemic were more effectively able to buffer the effects of pandemic-related stress on childrens symptomatology. Parents who reported higher levels of parenting stress and anxiety-related symptomatology were less likely to effectively buffer stress. Though interpretation of the findings is limited due to sole reliance on parental report and the cross-sectional study design due to the constraints of collecting data during a global pandemic, findings underscore the importance of assessing family-level factors when considering the impact of stressors on childrens symptomatology and highlight the need to support parents during global events that place families under significant stress.","output":"Parental Buffering of Stress in the Time of COVID-19: Family-Level Factors May Moderate the Association Between Pandemic-Related Stress and Youth Symptomatology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a high burden of gestational diabetes (GDM) and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Postpartum diabetes programs have the potential to prevent recurrent GDM and improve management of type 2 diabetes. However, data on such programs are limited, particularly in the Indigenous context. We aimed to explore Aboriginal Australian womens and health providers preferences for a program to prevent and improve diabetes after pregnancy. METHODS: A phenomenological methodology underpinned semi-structured in-depth interviews with eleven Aboriginal women and seven health professionals across the Northern Territory from October 2019- February 2020. Interviews were analysed using an inductive analysis framework to address the barriers and enablers of proposed diabetes prevention programs identified by participants. RESULTS: Identified structural barriers to lifestyle change included: food insecurity, persuasive marketing of unhealthy food options, lack of facilities and cultural inappropriateness of previous programs. Enablers to lifestyle change included: a strong link between a healthy lifestyle and connection with Country, family and community. Suggested strategies to improve lifestyle included: co-designed cooking classes or a community kitchen, team sports and structural change (targeting the social determinants of health). Lifestyle change was preferred over metformin to prevent and manage diabetes after pregnancy by participants and health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend individual level programs be designed alongside policies that address systemic inequalities. A postpartum lifestyle program should be co-designed with community members and grounded in Aboriginal conceptions of health to adequality address the health disparities experienced by Aboriginal people in remote communities.

Given a recognition that WFH activity during the pandemic has reduced the amount of commuting activity compared to pre-COVID-19, the inevitable question is raised as to what this might mean for some of the crucial inputs in the appraisal of transport initiatives. One critical value used in benefit-cost analysis is the value of time which converts time into monetary units in the calculation of user benefits. We are interested in whether reduced commuting activity is associated with higher or lower willing to pay to save time. We investigate this possibility with data from the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area in late 2020 when working from home was at a high level.

Here, we present, describe and make freely available an annotated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image dataset. It constitutes an interesting challenge for many practical applications in virology and epidemiology; e.g., virus detection, segmentation, classification, and novelty detection. We also present benchmarking results for virus detection and recognition using some of the top-performing (large and small) networks as well as a handcrafted very small network. We compare and evaluate transfer learning and training from scratch hypothesizing that with a limited dataset, transfer learning is crucial for good performance of a large network whereas our handcrafted small network performs relatively well when training from scratch. This is one step towards understanding how much training data is needed for a given task. METHODS: The benchmark dataset contains 1245 images of 22 virus classes. We propose a representative data split into training, validation, and test sets for this dataset. Moreover, we compare different established DL networks and present a baseline DL solution for classifying a subset of the 14 most-represented virus classes in the dataset. RESULTS: Our best model, DenseNet201 pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the training set, achieved a 0.921 F1-score and 93.1% accuracy on the proposed representative test set. CONCLUSIONS: Public and real biomedical datasets are an important contribution and a necessity to increase the understanding of shortcomings, requirements, and potential improvements for deep learning solutions on biomedical problems or deploying solutions in clinical settings.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of domestic violence and its relationship with quality of life in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed with the participation of 250 pregnant women in the obstetrics clinic of 29-Bahman Hospital, Tabriz city. Using a three-part questionnaire consisting of the socio-demographic and obstetrics information, the domestic violence questionnaire developed by WHO, and the SF-12 quality of life questionnaire, the required information was collected. A general linear model was then used to determine the relationship between domestic violence and quality of life, while adjusting the socio-demographic and obstetrics information. RESULTS: According to the data, more than one-third of pregnant women (35.2 %) had experienced domestic violence. The most common type of violence experienced was emotional violence (32.8 %), followed by sexual violence (12.4 %), and physical violence (4.8 %). The mean score of the physical health department of quality of life in the group of women exposed to violence (50.21) was lower compared to the unexposed group (53.45), though there was no significant difference between them (P = 0.25). However, the mean score of the mental health department of quality of life in women exposed to violence (46.27) was significantly lower compared to unexposed women (61.17) (P < 0.001). Based on the general linear model, the mean score for quality of life in the mental health dimension was significantly higher among unexposed women compared to those exposed to violence (? = 9.3, 95 %CI: 3.5 to 15.0, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate a high prevalence of domestic violence and its relationship with a low quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the findings signify the importance of screening pregnant women in terms of domestic violence in respective centers as well as the necessity of conducting proper interventions to address domestic violence to improve the quality of life in women.","output":"Domestic violence and its relationship with quality of life in pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lockdown on worldwide travel, the 14 thAnnual BIO-Europe Spring Partnering meeting was restaged in just 16 days from an in-person meeting in Paris, France, to the largest virtual partnering event in life sciences.

The students' feedback at the end of the learning period revealed that, although frustrated in being away from the clinics, the overall level of satisfaction from the course was good (rated 5 or 4/5 by 65% of responders) and the time was used efficiently. In conclusion, the students received a positive proactive learning experience of both theoretical aspects and clinical reasoning skills in internal medicine. There is no doubt that bedside teaching in medicine is invaluable and can't be replaced by any other means, however, given the circumstances, our format provided a reasonable temporary alternative.","output":"Teaching Internal Medicine in the Shadow of the Covid-19 Outbreak - the Experience of the Technion Faculty of Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Portuguese schools have been closed twice. This fact causes teachers to quickly adapt the content of learning to the characteristics of distance learning. In some courses, this adaption is straightforward, although all activities on lab were limited to videos of experiments without any interaction by the students. These aspects could be very prejudicial to the learning process since the success of students in lab is proportional to the experimentation and training. To address this problem, a design science research-based project was launched to develop a prototype of a virtual lab that could allow the students the training that is as much as possible a replication of the real experiences protocols. The preliminary results of the use of this virtual lab prototype were conducted by chemical teachers (as expert judgment). At the same time, we have implemented in the prototype checking points to give feedback to the student that are spread from the solid quantity calculation for the solution through the techniques of prevention of contamination of the solution in the process. Next step in this research will be the evaluation of vLab in large scale, addressing the evaluation of virtual lab versus real lab context, user friendly and early adoption of technology (students and teachers).

METHODS Children [N = 167, 10.1(0.9) years old, 54.5% female, 59.3% Hispanic, 35.9% overweight/obese at baseline] participated in a 3-year longitudinal study that consisted of assessments of sedentary time, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. At each assessment, participants wore accelerometers and completed the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. Separate random intercept cross-lagged panel models estimated the within-person longitudinal and bidirectional associations between alpha, sedentary breaks, and symptoms of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder across chronological age intervals. RESULTS Having greater than one's own usual depressive symptoms at age 11 was associated with fewer sedentary breaks 1 year later. Having greater than one's own usual generalized anxiety symptoms at age 11 was associated with longer sedentary bouts and fewer sedentary breaks 1 year later. In contrast, having greater than one's own usual sedentary breaks at age 10 was associated with fewer generalized anxiety symptoms 1 year later. All other associations, including at younger ages, were null. CONCLUSION Deviations from one's usual levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms may be important for how sedentary time is subsequently accumulated. Intraindividual processes appear to be at play, therefore more within-person research is needed. Intervention strategies for promoting a healthier accumulation of sedentary time may consider targeting occasions when depressive and anxiety symptoms are greater than usual.","output":"Patterns of Objectively Measured Sedentary Time and Emotional Disorder Symptoms Among Youth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social networks impact the health and well-being of older adults. Advancements in technology (e.g., digital devices and mHealth) enrich our ability to collect social networks and health data. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and map the use of technology in measuring older adults' social networks for health and social care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Joanna Briggs Institute methodology was followed. PubMed (MEDLINE), Sociological Abstracts, SocINDEX, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. Conference abstracts and proceedings were searched via Conference Papers Index, the American Sociological Society, and The Gerontological Society of America. Studies published in English from January 2004 to March 2020 that aimed to improve health or social care for older adults and used technology to measure social networks were included. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using an a priori extraction tool. RESULTS: The majority of the 18 reviewed studies were pilot or simulation research conducted in Europe that focused on older adults living in the community. The various types of technologies used can be categorized as environment-based, person-based, and data-based. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Technology facilitates objective and longitudinal data collection on the social interactions and activities of older adults. The use of technology to measure older adults' social networks, however, is primarily in an exploratory phase. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to overcome operational, analytical, and implementation challenges.

The objective was to develop a mathematical model designed to predict the hospitalization and ICU admission demands due to COVID-19 to forecast the availability of hospital resources for the scheduling of oncological surgery and medical treatment that require hospitalitation or possible use of ICU services. Methods: We have implemented a SEIR model designed to predict the number of patients requiring hospitalization and ICU admissions for COVID-19. We evaluated the model using the number of cases registered in the hospitals of the province of Granada (Spain), that altogether cover 914,678 inhabitants. Calibration was performed using data recorded between March 15 and September 22, 2020. After that, the model was validated by comparing the predictions with data registered between September 23 and November 7, 2020. Besides, we performed a predictive analysis of scenarios regarding different possible sanitary measures. Results: Using patient registered data we developed a mathematical model that reflects the flow among the different sub-groups related to COVID-19 pandemics (Table). The best algorithm that fitted the disease dynamics was Particle Swarm Optimization, that minimized the difference between model output and real data used to calibrate the model. The validation phase showed the accuracy of the predictions, especially concerning trends in hospitalizations and ICU admissions. The different scenarios modelled on November 10, 2020 allowed us to predict the evolution of the pandemic until July 1, 2021, and to detect the peaks and valleys of disease prevalence. Conclusions: The mathematical model presented provides predictions on the evolution of COVID-19, the prevalence and hospital or ICU care demands. The predictions can be used to detect periods of greater availability of hospital resources that make it possible to schedule the oncologic surgery and intensify the care for oncologic patients. Furthermore, our model can be adapted to other population by recalibrating the model according to demographic data, the local evolution of the pandemic and the health policies.

India has also achieved a significant reduction in malaria burden in 2018 and has committed to eliminate malaria by 2030. The Mandla Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) was started in 2017 in 1233 villages of District Mandla to demonstrate malaria elimination in a tribal district with hard-to-reach areas was possible using active and passive surveillance, case management, vector control, and targeted information, education and communication campaigns. An operational plan was developed to strengthen the existing surveillance and malaria elimination systems, through fortnightly active case detection to ensure that all cases including those that are introduced into the communities are rapidly identified and treated promptly. The plan also focused on the reduction of human-mosquito contact through the use of Long-Lasting Insecticial Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spray (IRS). The operational plan was modified in view of the present COVID-19 pandemic by creating systems of assistance for the local administration for COVID-related work while ensuring the operational integrity of malaria elimination efforts. RESULTS: The use of MEDP study design and operational plan, with its built-in management control systems, has yielded significant (91%) reduction of indigenous cases of malaria during the period from June 2017 to May 2020. The malaria positivity rate was 0.33% in 2017-18, 0.13% in 2018-19, and 0.06% in 2019-20. Mass screening revealed 0.18% malaria positivity in September-October 2018, followed by 0.06% in June 2019, and 0.03% in December 2019, and these were mostly asymptomatic cases in the community. The project has been able to sustain the gains of the past three years during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: This paper provides the study design and the operational plan for malaria elimination in a high-burden district of Central India, which presented difficulties of hard to reach areas, forest malaria, and complex epidemiology of urban and rural malaria. The lessons learned could be used for malaria elimination efforts in rest of the country and other parts of South Asia with comparable demography and epidemiology.","output":"Study design and operational framework for a community-based Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) in 1233 villages of district Mandla, Madhya Pradesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To tackle complex societal challenges such as the high prevalence of physical inactivity, research funding is increasingly channeled toward cross-disciplinary research consortia. This study focused on exchange and cooperation (E&C) among the scientists of a 5-year transdisciplinary research initiative in Germany. Researchers' perceptions of E&C were combined with numbers of collaborative products during the project's life to make the developments of E&C and the quality of collaborative products visible. Methods: We applied a mixed-methods design including a qualitative content analysis of pre-interviews, focus-group interviews, and documents as well as a quantitative analysis of research (scientific publications, books, conference participations) and training outcomes (supervised bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. theses). Inductive and deductive approaches were combined to analyze factors of collaborative readiness and to identify perceptions of E&C among project teams. Based on Hall et al.'s Conceptual Model for Evaluation of Collaborative Initiatives, the project period was separated into phases of collaborative readiness, collaborative capacity, and collaborative products. Results: Our findings revealed a discrepancy between the objectively assessed concepts of collaborative readiness and researchers' reported perceptions of E&C during the early project stage. A set of E&C hindering factors identified during the initial project phase remained present until the final project stage. Further, E&C among scientists increased over time, as reflected by researchers' perceptions. Reports of scientists also showed that outcomes were co-produced at the final project stage for the first time, while knowledge integration had not yet been achieved. Generally, the number of collaborative products (particularly scientific publications) also substantially increased over time. E&C was supported and promoted by the efforts of the coordinating sub-project. Conclusion: Scientific E&C is a learning process and needs time to develop. A participatory research approach taking into account the perspectives on and requirements for E&C during the project's design might lay the ground for suitable, supportive, and transparent conditions for effective and successful E&C. Despite their time- and resource-consuming nature, cross-disciplinary research initiatives provide a fertile context in which to generate new solutions for pressing societal issues given that long-term funding and the establishment of an overarching coordination organ is assured.","output":"Scientific Cooperation and the Co-production of Scientific Outcomes for Physical Activity Promotion: Results From a Transdisciplinary Research Consortium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The respiratory disease caused by the Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID19) has spread rapidly since December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

Reports on cognitive assessment of patients with COVID-19 are often limited to orientation alone. Further assessment may seem to create an inappropriate burden for patients with acute COVID-19, which is characterized by fatigue and confusion, and may also compromise examiner safety. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess cognition in patients with COVID-19 as comprehensively as possible in a brief format, while observing safety precautions, and to establish a clear face value of the external validity of the assessment. METHODS: We adapted a brief cognitive assessment, previously applied to liver transplant candidates and medical/surgical inpatients, for remote use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment. Collecting quality assurance data from telephone-administered assessments, this report presents a series of 6 COVID-19 case vignettes to illustrate the use of this 5-minute assessment in the diagnosis and treatment of brain effects. Primary medical teams referred the cases for neuropsychiatric consultation. RESULTS: The age of the patients varied over four decades, and none of them were able to engage meaningfully with their surroundings on admission. On follow-up examination 6 to 10 days later, 4 of the 6 patients had recovered working memory, and only 1 had recovered calculation ability. Of the 6 patients, 2 were capable of complex judgment responses, while none of the cases completed frontal executive function testing in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive assessment in patients with COVID-19 using this remote examination reveals patterns of cognitive recovery that vary among cases and are far more complex than loss of orientation. In this series, testing of specific temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe functions suggests that calculation ability, judgment, and especially frontal executive functions may characterize the effects of COVID-19 on the brain. Used widely and serially, this examination method can potentially inform our understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on the brain and of healing from the virus.","output":"A 5-Minute Cognitive Assessment for Safe Remote Use in Patients With COVID-19: Clinical Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work proposes the first model to examine the moderating effect of the COVID-19 syndemic on the acceptance and use of smartphones during the tourist shopping journey.

The main aim of this study was to examine the influence of the intolerance of uncertainty to the experienced level of distress during the pandemic. Additionally, influence of media exposure and fear were examined. Total of 740 participants took part in an online study during the coronavirus outbreak in Serbia. Moderately high level of distress was recorded in our sample. About 1/3 of participants were in each group: no distress, moderately high and highly elevated. Results of serial mediation analysis showed that the intolerance of uncertainty had a significant direct effect on distress, but also indirect via fear of COVID-19 and media exposure. Higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty lead to more time spent on media looking for information, and consequently to higher fear and distress levels. Furthermore, it was shown that media exposure also increased the level of fear. Such results emphasized the importance of unambiguous, clear informing during the time of crisis which can decrease uncertainty, and provided some practical implication for media and authorities. ? 2020 Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi Sad, Serbia.

These challenges include the need for large, diverse, yet still representative study samples. This often means a protracted, costly, and inefficient recruitment process. Multisite clinical trials can overcome some of these hurdles but incur their own unique challenges. With recent advances in mobile health and digital technologies, there is now a promising alternative: Remote Trials. These trials are led and coordinated by a local investigative team, but are based remotely, within a given community, state, or even nation. The remote approach affords many of the benefits of multisite trials (more efficient recruitment of larger study samples) without the same barriers (cost, multisite management, and regulatory hurdles). The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global health pandemic has resulted in rapid requirements to shift ongoing clinical trials to remote delivery and assessment platforms, making methods for the conduct of remote trials even more timely. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of available methods for the conduct of remote tobacco-focused clinical trials as well as illustrative examples of how these methods have been implemented across recently completed and ongoing tobacco studies.

Latin America is the hardest-hit region of the world, accumulating almost 20% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In Costa Rica, from the first detected case on March 6th to December 31st almost 170,000 cases have been reported. We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 185 sequences, 52 from the first months of the pandemic, and 133 from the current wave. Three GISAID clades (G, GH, and GR) and three PANGOLIN lineages (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.291) were predominant, suggesting multiple re-introductions from other regions. The whole-genome variant calling analysis identified a total of 283 distinct nucleotide variants, following a power-law distribution with 190 single nucleotide mutations in a single sequence, and only 16 mutations were found in >5% sequences. These mutations were distributed through the whole genome. The prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike (98.9% in Costa Rica), ORF8 L84S (1.1%) is similar to what is found elsewhere. Interestingly, the frequency of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica, reaching 29.2% detection in the full genome analyses in November 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences worldwide in 2020. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggests a potential effect on the viral oligomerization needed for cell infection, but no differences with other genomes on transmissibility, severity nor vaccine effectiveness are predicted. In conclusion, genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggest the introduction of lineages from other countries and the detection of mutations in line with other studies, but pointing out the local increase in the detection of Spike-T1117I variant.

The study investigates whether the dye adsorption capacity can be tuned/enhanced by the ATA ligand substitution into the framework. We found that, at room temperature, UiO-66-0.75ATA shows the highest adsorption capacity toward various dye solutions, including methylene blue (MB), indigo carmine (IC), and congo red (CR). The optimum adsorption conditions in all four materials were in a common trend where their adsorption capacities can be increased with decreasing pH and adsorbent dose, increasing IC concentration, contact time, and temperature. Pseudo-second order kinetics model fits best with their adsorption data, where UiO-66-ATA has the fastest adsorption rate. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were found best to describe adsorption behavior in ATA-containing UiO-66 and UiO-66, respectively, where adsorption processes were found to be physisorption. Confirming by thermodynamic studies, the adsorption in all four materials occurred spontaneously, driven by entropy. Computational studies showed ligand to metal charge transfer where the distribution of electron densities was varied with the amount of functionalized ligand.

The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of pulmonary 18FFDG uptake and identify a potential role for the use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging in the management of these patients. Methods Clinical data and CT imaging of all patients that underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging at UCLH, London over the 3-month peak of the UK pandemic were reviewed to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were divided in to acute (early and late) COVID-19 pneumonia and PCLD. 18F-FDG uptake in the lungs was measured as a target-to-background ratio (SUVmax/SUVmin) TBRlung which was compared to temporal-stage and plasma CRP. Results There were 20 patients in total (median 61.5y, range 18-84y, 12-male): 11 incidental acute COVID-19 pneumonia cases identified retrospectively (5 Early, 6 Late), and 9 cases performed for PCLD. TBRlung was correlated with time since disease onset (rs=0.83, p=0.002). In the PCLD patients TBRlung correlated with CRP (rs=0.985, p&lt;0.001) and was lower if steroid treatment had been administered (p=0.050). Conclusion Pulmonary 18F-FDG-uptake in COVID-19 pneumonia increases with time after infection. In patients with PCLD the pulmonary 18F-FDG-uptake rises further in the absence of infection, and correlates with CRP levels in serum, suggesting a role for inflammation.

Additionally, authorship of 40 articles published on pandemic-related topics (COVID-19, teleneuropsychology) across nine CN journals were coded for binary gender. RESULTS: Initial submissions to these four CN journals increased during the pandemic (+27.2%), with comparable increases in total number of authors coded as either women (+23.0%) or men (+25.4%). Neither the average percentage of women on manuscript bylines nor the proportion of women who were lead and/or corresponding authors differed significantly across time. Moreover, the representation of women as authors of pandemic-related articles did not differ from expected frequencies in the field.

Methods: Data were collected via a telephone survey using a standardized script. Between March 1, 2020 and June 17, 2020, 28,903 people were tested at 4 Connecticut drive-through testing centers. Individuals who tested positive between March 16 and April 21, 2020 were randomly contacted. Of those individuals, 100 people agreed to complete the survey.

However, studies on risk factors for predicting regional lymph node metastasis in osteosarcoma are scarce. This study aimed to develop and validate a model based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. METHODS: A total of 1201 patients, with 1094 cases from the surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) (the training set) and 107 cases (the external validation set) admitted from four medical centers in China, was included in this study. Independent risk factors for the risk of lymph node metastasis were screened by the multifactorial logistic regression models. Six ML algorithms, including the logistic regression (LR), the gradient boosting machine (GBM), the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), the random forest (RF), the decision tree (DT), and the multilayer perceptron (MLP), were used to evaluate the risk of lymph node metastasis. The prediction model was developed based on the bestpredictive performance of ML algorithm and the performance of the model was evaluatedby the area under curve (AUC), prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. A homemade online calculator was capable of estimating the probability of lymph node metastasis in individuals. RESULTS: Of all included patients, 9.41% (113/1201) patients developed regional lymph node metastasis. ML prediction models were developed based on nine variables: age, tumor (T) stage, metastasis (M) stage, laterality, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, bone metastases, and lung metastases. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, T and M stage, surgery, and chemotherapy were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. In the six ML algorithms, XGB had the highest AUC (0.882) and was utilized to develop as prediction model.

Psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 pandemic caused multifaceted challenges in clinical and therapeutic practices. Particularly, several published reports described growth in alcohol and food addiction diseases. According to this, during the last months, we noticed an increase of cases of Acute Pancreatitis due to severe Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG-AP) requiring urgent Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE), compared to the previous 10 years. Case report. Between January 2020 and February 2021, at the Therapeutic Apheresis Unit of the Padua University Hospital, we treated 6 patients with HTG-AP, of which 4 patients during the last 2 months. The total amount of HTG-AP patients treated with TPE from 2011 to 2021 is 10 (7 male and 3 female, 1 patient was treated twice). All were treated with a single session of TPE, by exchanging one total plasma volume with 2/3 4% albumin solution and 1/3 fresh frozen plasma (in one patient only albumin solution has been used). Triglycerides (TG) values before TPE were higher than 22,6 mmol/L (2.000 mg/dL) in all cases. Following a single apheresis session, within 48 hours, there were a statistically significant reduction in TG values (Figure 1, p <.0001), with an observed median value reduction of 90% (range 56-94%). Common comorbidities were alcohol abuse, hyperlipemia, obesity and diabetes mellitus. All patients recovered from HTGAP and were discharged from hospital after a mean of 12 days (range 7-21). Conclusions. The recent increase of patients with HTGAP treated with TPE seems meaningful, considering that from 2011 to 2019 we treated only 4 patients for HTG-AP, although the total number of TPE sessions has been comparable throughout this period (about 1.100 procedures per year) and however higher than overall TPE sessions performed in 2020, i.e., 822 procedures.

Damage to SCN structure alters circadian behavioral and hormonal rhythms and interferes with a regular sleep-wake pattern. Several studies have shown that, in aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), circadian rhythms change their synchronization with the environment and behavior loses sync with light. OBJECTIVE The current overview aims to examine research studies showing the effect of bright light therapy (BLT) on sleep disorders and sleep-wake patterns in AD. METHODS A literature search was conducted, taking into consideration the relevant studies over the last 20 years. Fifteen studies have been thorough: seven followed an environmental-architectural approach and eight followed a treatment devices approach. RESULTS Studies agree in considering BLT as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to compensate for circadian rhythm alterations and they support the need for standardized protocols that allow a comparison between multicenter studies. CONCLUSION Interestingly, in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities have forced the population to stay home. Therefore, AD people are not currently able to enjoy exposure to sunlight. It is predictable that they may experience an exacerbation of circadian disturbances and that the BLT can be an effective response to prevent such exacerbation.","output":"Fiat Lux: The Light Became Therapy.

However, Differential diagnosis remains difficult for suspected cases of COVID-19 and need to be improved to reduce misdiagnosis. METHODS: Sixty-eight cases of suspected COVID-19 treated in Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 21 to February 20, 2020 were divided into confirmed and COVID-19-negative groups based on the results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid testing of the novel coronavirus in throat swab specimens to compare the clinical symptoms and laboratory and imaging results between the groups. RESULTS: Among suspected patients, 17 were confirmed to COVID-19-positive group and 51 were distinguished to COVID-19-negative group. Patients with reduced white blood cell (WBC) count were more common in the COVID-19-positive group than in the COVID-19-negative group (29.4% vs 3.9%, P = 0.003). Subsequently, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between WBC count and temperature in the COVID-19-positive patients (r = - 0.587, P = 0.003), instead of the COVID-19-negative group. But reduced lymphocyte count was no different between the two groups (47.1% vs 25.5%, P = 0.096). More common chest imaging characteristics of the confirmed COVID-19 cases by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) included ground-glass opacities (GGOs), multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation with bilateral involvement than COVID-19-negative group (82.4% vs 31.4%, P = 0.0002; 41.2% vs 17.6% vs P = 0.048; 76.5% vs 43.1%, P = 0.017; respectively). The rate of clustered infection was higher in COVID-19-positive group than COVID-19-negative group (64.7% vs 7.8%, P = 0.001). Through multiplex PCR nucleic acid testing, 2 cases of influenza A, 3 cases of influenza B, 2 cases of adenovirus, 2 cases of Chlamydia pneumonia, and 7 cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were diagnosed in the COVID-19-negative group. CONCLUSIONS: WBC count inversely correlated with the severity of fever, GGOs, multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation in chest HRCT and clustered infection are common but not specific features in the confirmed COVID-19 group.

The aim of this study was to examine the development and rollout of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine and knowledge challenges for the effective implementation of vaccination programs for COVID-19 and future influenza pandemics. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted searching EMBASE (inception to current date) and PUBMED (from January 2009 to current date) databases for relevant published studies about influenza A(H1N1) pandemic vaccines. A Google search was conducted to identify relevant documents from grey literature. Selected Studies were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: A total of 22, comprising of 12 original studies and 10 relevant documents met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen papers reported an initial high demand that outweighed production capacity and caused vaccine shortages. Vaccine procurement and supply were skewed towards high-income countries. Low vaccination rates of about 5% to 50% were reported in all studies mainly due to a low-risk perception of getting infected, safety concerns and the fear of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Safety concerns about the approved H1N1 vaccines resulted in many unsuccessful vaccination campaigns worldwide. Understanding the factors that influence people's decision to accept or refuse vaccination, effective risk communication strategies, adequate resources for vaccine deployment initiatives and building local capacities through shared knowledge and technology transfer may help to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake and accelerate pandemic control.","output":"THE LONG ROAD OF PANDEMIC VACCINE DEVELOPMENT

Here, we developed a 3D model of the human bronchial epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and demonstrated its viability and functionality for 21 days without subculturing.

The long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome was fully characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry in two preclinical models using Calu-3 or primary NHBE cells. 408 common secreted proteins were identified while significant differences in protein abundance were observed with time, suggesting that 7-10 days are necessary to establish a mature secretome in the Calu-3 model. The associated Reactome pathways highlight the role of the secreted proteins in the immune response of the bronchial epithelium.

Understanding this process is key to understanding pathogenesis, genetic risk factors, and both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. SARS-CoV-2 antagonises the innate interferon response, but whether it manipulates innate cellular immunity is unclear. An unbiased proteomic analysis determined how cell surface protein expression is altered on SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells, showing downregulation of activating NK ligands B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1, with minimal effects on MHC-I. This occurred at the level of protein synthesis, could be mediated by Nsp1 and Nsp14, and correlated with a reduction in NK cell activation. This identifies a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 host-shutoff antagonises innate immunity. Later in the disease process, strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed. These responses were sustained for at least 6 months in most patients, and led to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Depletion of spike-specific antibodies confirmed their dominant role in neutralisation, but these antibodies played only a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies to other proteins, including ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid. In contrast, ADNKA induced following vaccination was focussed solely on spike, was weaker than ADNKA following natural infection, and was not boosted by the second dose. These insights have important implications for understanding disease progression, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine design.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 host-shutoff impacts innate NK cell functions, but antibody-dependent NK activity is strongly activated through non-spike antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the importance of privacy, many Internet protocols are nowadays designed with privacy in mind (e.g., using TLS for confidentiality).

Among responders, 58.9% had pain: 30.1% migraine, 15.7% pain with NC, and 13.1% other types of pain. Migraine was more common in patients with PA than in the general population (30.1% vs 21.3%, p=0.010) and attacks received appropriate treatment for less than 20% of these patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of chronic migraine was much higher than in the general population (6.8% vs 2.2%, p=0.003). Neuropathic pain was also more frequent in PA patients than in the general population (15.8% vs 6.9%, p<0.001).

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of influenza vaccinations among pediatric patients seen in U.S. health centers, and to explore potential disparities in vaccination coverage among subpopulations. Funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, these health centers provide primary and preventive care to underserved and vulnerable individuals and families in order to reduce health disparities based on economic, geographic, or cultural barriers. METHODS: Cross-sectional data, analyzed in 2019, came from the most recent waves of the Health Center Patient Survey (2009, 2014). The sample consisted of children ages 2C17 years receiving care from HRSA-funded health centers. The outcome of interest was self- or parent-reported receipt of influenza vaccine in the past year. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted prevalence rate ratios for the association between demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty level, urban/rural residence, geographic region), health-related variables (receipt of well-child check-up, asthma diagnosis), and influenza vaccination. RESULTS: Influenza vaccination coverage among pediatric health center patients increased from 46.6% in 2009 to 67.8% in 2014. In the adjusted model for 2014, there were few statistically significant differences in vaccination coverage among subpopulation groups, however American Indian/Alaska Native children had 31% increased vaccination coverage compared with non-Hispanic White children (aPRR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02C1.60) and children living in the South had 26% decreased vaccination coverage compared with those living in the Northeast (aPRR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54C0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination coverage among pediatric health center patients in 2014 exceeded the national average (as of 2018C2019), and few differences were found among at-risk subpopulations. HRSA-funded health centers are well-positioned to further increase the vaccination rate among children living in underserved communities.","output":"Influenza vaccination among U.S. pediatric patients receiving care from federally funded health centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]it is difficult to confidently extrapolate scientific knowledge about pre-COVID-19 WFH to the current experience in which massive numbers of people have been forced to work from home.

OBJECTIVE: This single centre cross-section study aimed to grade the severity of pneumonia by bed-side lung ultrasound (LUS). METHODS: A scoring system discriminates 5 levels of lung opacities: A-lines (0 points),&#8805;3 B-Line (1 point), coalescent B-Lines (2 points), marked pleural disruptions (3 points), consolidations (4 points). LUS (convex 1-5aMHz probe) was performed at 6 defined regions for each hemithorax either in supine or prone position. A lung aeration score (LAS, maximum 4 points) was allocated for each patient by calculating the arithmetic mean of the examined lung areas. Score levels were correlated with ventilation parameters and laboratory markers. RESULTS: LAS of 20 patients with ARDS reached from 2.58 to 3.83 and was highest in the lateral right lobe (Mean 3.67).

However, this bioactivity mechanism is not much known. Here, the role of sialic acid in OVM anti-virus activity has been studied by ELISA with lectin or ligand. Structural changes of OVM after removing sialic acid were analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. OVM could be binding to the hemagglutinin (HA) of avian influenza viruses H(5)N(1) and H(1)N(1), this binding was specific and required the involvement of sialic acid. When sialic acid was removed, the binding was significantly reduced 71.5% and 64.35%, respectively. Therefore, sialic acid was proved as a recognition site which avian influenza virus bound to. Meanwhile, the endogenous fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity of OVM removing sialic acid were increased and the secondary structure tended to shift to random coil. This indicated that OVM molecules were in an unfolded state and spatial conformation disorder raising weakly. Remarkably, free sialic acid strongly promoted OVM binding to HA and thereby enhanced the interaction. It may contribute to the inhibition of host cell infection, agglutinate viruses.

We aimed to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number for Jodhpur, India and to use it for prediction of epidemic size for next one month. Methods: Contact tracing of SARSCoV2 infected individuals was done to obtain the serial intervals. Aggregate and instantaneous R0 values were derived and epidemic projection was done using R software v4.0.0. Results: From among 79 infector infectee pairs, the estimated median and 95 percentile values of serial interval were 5.98 days (95% CI 5.39 to 6.65) and 13.17 days (95% CI 11.27 to 15.57), respectively.

We calculated and assessed the consistency of maternal and child health service coverage estimates from RHIS data, using census-based and health service-based denominators in Sierra Leone. METHODS: We used Sierra Leone 2016 RHIS data to calculate coverage of first antenatal care contact (ANC1), institutional delivery and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus 3 (DPT3) immunization service provision. For each indicator, national and district level coverages were calculated using denominators derived from two census-based and three health service-based methods. We compared the coverage estimates from RHIS data to estimates from MICS 2017. We considered the agreement adequate when estimates from RHIS fell within the 95% confidence interval of the survey estimate. RESULTS: We found an overall poor consistency of the coverage estimates calculated from the census-based methods. ANC1 and institutional delivery coverage estimates from these methods were greater than 100% in about half of the fourteen districts, and only 3 of the 14 districts had estimates consistent with the survey data. Health service-based methods generated better estimates. For institutional delivery coverage, five districts met the agreement criteria using BCG service-based method. We found better agreement for DPT3 coverage estimates using DPT1 service-based method as national coverage was close to survey data, and estimates were consistent for 8 out of 14 districts. DPT3 estimates were consistent in almost half of the districts (6/14) using ANC1 service-based method. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted the challenge in determining an appropriate denominator for RHIS-based coverage estimates. Systematic and transparent data quality check and correction, as well as rigorous approaches to determining denominators are key considerations to generate accurate coverage statistics using RHIS data.

Owing to the recommendation to prioritize high-risk populations for vaccination, further data are warranted. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use and safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In January 2021, mass SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of high-risk populations, including patients with cancer, was initiated in Israel. This cohort study prospectively enrolled and followed up patients with cancer and healthy participants between January 15 and March 14, 2021. The study was conducted at the Division of Oncology of Rambam Health Care Campus, the major tertiary (referral) medical center of northern Israel. Participants included 232 patients with cancer who were receiving active treatment after the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and 261 healthy, age-matched health care workers who served as controls. EXPOSURES: Serum samples were collected after each vaccine dose and in cases of seronegativity. Questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics and adverse reactions were administered at serum collection. A regulatory agenciesCapproved assay was used to assess IgG at all time points. Patients electronic medical records were reviewed for documentation of COVID-19 infection and results of blood cell counts, liver enzyme levels, and imaging studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seroconversion rate after the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and documented COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Of the 232 patients undergoing treatment for cancer, 132 were men (57%); mean (SD) age was 66 (12.09) years. After the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, 29% (n = 25) patients were seropositive compared with 84% (n = 220) of the controls (P < .001). After the second dose, the seropositive rate reached 86% (n = 187) in the patients. Testing rate ratios per 1000 person-days after the first dose were 12.5 (95% CI, 3.4-45.7) for the patients and 48.5 (95% CI, 37.2-63.2) for the controls. Patients undergoing chemotherapy showed reduced immunogenicity (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.98). In seronegative patients, the rate of documented absolute leukopenia reached 39%. No COVID-19 cases were documented throughout the study period; however, 2 cases in the patient cohort were noted immediately after the first dose. Reported adverse events were similar to data in former trials comprising mostly healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine appeared to be safe and achieve satisfactory serologic status in patients with cancer. There was a pronounced lag in antibody production compared with the rate in noncancer controls; however, seroconversion occurred in most patients after the second dose. Future real-world data are warranted to determine the long-term efficacy of the vaccine with regard to type of anticancer treatment.","output":"Serologic Status and Toxic Effects of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 Vaccine in Patients Undergoing Treatment for Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first wave of COVID-19 pandemic management implied to remain at home in order to reduce the spread of the infection. Several patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with biologics had to go to the hospital to perform intravenous (i.v.) therapies, whereas patients treated with subcutaneous (s.c.) ones could remain at home. Since immumodulatory therapies as well as the access to high-risk places like hopitals have been associated to an increased risk of infections, we have investigated whether patients hospitalized or treated at home showed similar levels of anxiety related to the pandemic situation. METHODS: We conducted a survey including consecutive IBD patients treated with biologics at three Italian referral centers referring to the first lockdown period. We included consecutive adult patients in clinical and biochemical remission treated with biologics, administered i.v. or s.c. Patients experiencing a disease flare during these months were excluded from the study, in order to avoid potential biases related to disease activity. Patients underwent the normally scheduled clinical visits, performed at home by using phone or video calls for patients treated with s.c. drugs and only in specific cases (i.e. suspected COVID symptoms) for patients treated with i.v. ones. We administered to all patients the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and other 11 questions, specifically related to COVID and its implications. Group differences in continuous and nominal variables were tested by KruskalCWallis test and Fisher exact test, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 189 IBD patients were recruited, 112 (59.3%) treated with i.v. drugs and 77 (40.7%) with s.c. ones. The two groups of patients had similar scores in the 14 single items of the HADS questionnaire (p>0.10 for all). The total HADS score obtained by the sum of all items was also almost identical between groups (37.1  2.8 vs 37.2  2.8; p=0.98). In patients treated with i.v. drugs receiving a televisit (n=17), the rates of satisfaction about telemedicine (58.8%) and the lack of in-person care (33.3%) were significantly lower compared with those treated with s.c. drugs (94.8% and 92.2%, respectively; both p<0.0005). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there is no need to convert patients from i.v. to s.c. therapy, since the risk of infection as well as of disease relapse due to stressful events are similar in both groups. Moreover, the hospitalization for drug administration does not affect the the psychological status of the patients. Interestingly, patients used to coming to the hospital have more need for in-person contact than patients used to be treated at home, suggesting that the choice of telemedicine should be personalized.","output":"P506 The Impact of Anxiety in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Treated With Biologics during COVID Lockdown.

Barriers have included medicolegal issues surrounding provider reimbursement, interstate licensure, and malpractice liability as well as technological challenges. Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited typical evaluation of patients with neurologic issues and resulted in a surge in demand for virtual medical visits. Meanwhile, federal and state governments took action to facilitate the rapid implementation of telehealth programs, placing a temporary lift on medicolegal barriers that had previously limited its expansion. This created a unique opportunity for widespread telehealth use to meet the surge in demand for remote medical care. After initial hurdles and challenges, our experience with telemedicine in neurosurgery at Penn Medicine has been overall positive from both the provider and the patients' perspective. One of the unique challenges we face is guiding patients to appropriately set up devices in a way that enables an effective neuroexamination. However, we argue that an accurate and comprehensive neurologic examination can be conducted through a telemedicine platform, despite minor weaknesses inherent to absence of physical presence. In addition, certain neurosurgical visits such as postoperative checks, vascular pathology, and brain tumors inherently lend themselves to easier evaluation through telehealth visits. In the era of COVID-19 and beyond, telemedicine remains a promising and effective approach to continue neurologic patient care.","output":"Telemedicine in the Era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Neurosurgical Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused a \\"Hunger Games\\" like run for emergency funding that risks detracting away from other diseases that ravage humanity","output":"Bandwagoning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"April 2021 is here, one year and a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic.

We highlight that, after in vitro stimulation with ZIKV CD4 megapool (ZIKV MP), we found a lower frequency of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells (Th17), especially in the mothers, confirmed by the decrease in IL-17 production in the supernatant. However, a higher frequency of CD4+ IL-17+ IFN-+ T cells (Th1Th17) responding to the ZIKV MP was observed in the cells of the mothers and children but not in those of the non-pregnant women.

Our objective was to explore COVID-19 preparedness of US HHAs and compare results by urban/rural location. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Using a stratified random sample of 978 HHAs, we conducted a 22-item online survey from April 10 to 17, 2020. METHODS: Summary statistics were computed; open-ended narrative responses were synthesized using qualitative methods. RESULTS: Similar to national data, most responding HHAs (n = 121, 12% response rate) were for-profit and located in the South. Most HHAs had infectious disease outbreaks included in their emergency preparedness plan (76%), a staff member in charge of outbreak/disaster preparedness (84%), and had provided their staff with COVID-19 education and training (97%). More urban HHAs had cared for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 patients than rural HHAs, but urban HHAs had less capacity to test for COVID-19 than rural HHAs (9% vs 21%). Most (69%) experienced patient census declines and had a current and/or anticipated supply shortage. Rural agencies were affected less than urban agencies. HHAs have already rationed (69%) or implemented extended use (55%) or limited reuse (61%) of personal protective equipment (PPE). Many HHAs reported accessing supplemental PPE from state/local resources, donations, and do-it-yourself efforts; more rural HHAs had accessed these additional resources compared with urban HHAs. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This survey reveals challenges that HHAs are having in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among urban agencies. Of greatest concern are the declines in patient census, which drastically affect agency revenue, and the shortages of PPE and disinfectants.

In this report, we describe a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and became a MERS-CoV superspreader, igniting a recent multihospital outbreak in Riyadh. MATERIAL AND RESULTS: Between May 31 and June 15, 2017, 44 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from 3 simultaneous clusters from 3 health care facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, including 11 fatal cases. Out of the total reported cases, 29 cases were reported from King Saud Medical City. The cluster at King Saud Medical City was ignited by a single superspreader patient who presented with acute renal failure. After 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hemodialysis sessions he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. One hundred twenty contacts who had direct unprotected exposure were screened. Among those contacts, 9 out of 107 health care workers (5 nurses, 3 physicians, and 1 paramedic) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: This hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure, which leads to delayed suspicion of MERS-CoV and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures.

In this study, soils (surface, SS; bottom, BS) and stream sediments (SD) from forested/deforested areas of IRW were analyzed with the aim of (1) evaluating the major sources of TE (mainly As, Ba, Cd, Cu, Co, Cr, Hg, Mo, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn), and (2) examining the soil-sediment TE link related to land-use change and/or geologic factors. Compositional data analysis (CoDA) was used to eliminate data closure issues and the centred log-ratio (clr) transformation yielded better results in Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The TE distribution pattern was significantly different (p < 0.05) between forested and deforested areas, but in both areas the TE distribution pattern is significantly correlated between SS, BS, and SD, indicating a strong lithogenic control. PCA (clr-transformed) identified the major geochemical bedrock signature as Fe-Ti-V-Cu-Cr-Ni, which is nearly similar in soil and sediments. The more accentuated enrichment and the maximum number of anomalies of these elements were found in the Carajs Basin and are highly coincident with mineral deposits/local lithologies without clear indication of anthropogenic contamination from point sources. Besides geogenic factors, deforestation is also affecting TE distribution in the basin. In deforested areas, Mn was significantly enriched in the surface horizon. Furthermore, linear regression analysis shows stronger TE relationships between soils and sediments in deforested areas than in forested ones, reflecting higher erosion in the former. This could be the reason for the relatively higher enrichment of TE (e.g., Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Ni) in deforested sediments. The TE contamination using regional background values provides more accurate results than worldwide reference values. Thus, the former should be considered to for a more realistic environmental risk assessment in IRW and other forest ecosystems in the Brazilian Amazon.","output":"Soil-sediment linkage and trace element contamination in forested/deforested areas of the Itacainas River Watershed, Brazil: To what extent land-use change plays a role?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compliment Xu et al.

Specific antibodies (Abs) of the main isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) were characterised by immunostaining of samples which had been previously incubated with nitrocellulose sheets coated with SMP, HSPI or HSF extracts. Plasma collected before feeding experimental diets showed very little specific Abs. By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P < 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22C32 and 38C42 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17C23 and 26C38 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally.

A systematic search of the literature was conducted by screening EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, and CENTRAL for relevant publications. In total, 73 studies were included that sought to identify risk factors associated with the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Risk factors were divided into seven subcategories: genetic, dietary and nutrition, gastric atrophy, infection and microbiome, metabolic, epidemiological and environmental and other risk factors. Risk factors from each subcategory were summarized and explored with mechanistic explanations for these associations. This review highlights several current risk factors of ESCC. These risk factors were explored, and explanations dissected. Most studies focused on investigating genetic and dietary and nutritional factors, whereas this review identified other potential risk factors that have yet to be fully explored. Furthermore, there is a lack of literature on the association of these risk factors with tumor factors and disease prognosis. Further research to validate these results and their effects on tumor biology is absolutely necessary.","output":"Risk Factors of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma beyond Alcohol and Smoking."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess faculty and staff beliefs about returning to campus as well as their mental health and healthy lifestyle behaviors.

To date, more than 25 EBOV outbreaks have been documented, the majority of which have occurred in Central Africa. The rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (ERVEBO), a live attenuated vaccine, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to combat EBOV. Because of the several drawbacks of live attenuated vaccines, multi-epitope vaccines probably appear to be safer than live attenuated vaccines. In this work, we employed immunoinformatics tools to design a multi-epitope vaccine against EBOV. We collected sequences of VP35, VP24, VP30, VP40, GP, and NP proteins from the NCBI database. T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes from target proteins were identified and tested for antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and conservancy. The selected epitopes were then linked together in the vaccine's primary structure using appropriate linkers, and the 50S ribosomal L7/L12 (Locus RL7 MYCTU) sequence was added as an adjuvant to the vaccine construct's N-terminal. The physicochemical, antigenicity, and allergenicity parameters of the vaccine were all found to be satisfactory. The 3D model of the vaccine was predicted, refined, and validated. The vaccine construct had a stable and strong interaction with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) based on molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation (MD) analysis. The results of codon optimization and in silico cloning revealed that the proposed vaccine was highly expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The findings of this study are promising; however, experimental validations should be carried out to confirm these findings.","output":"Designing a novel multi?epitope vaccine against Ebola virus using reverse vaccinology approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After two pandemics in less than a decade, it is clear that the fight against microbes is failing, and one of the reasons is the inefficacy of disposable protective masks. This project intends to evaluate the possibility of the impregnation of copper particles as an active element to eliminate viruses and bacteria, which in contact with cotton conventional masks have a survival rate of up to 72 h. In contact with copper particles, those microorganisms survive, approximately, for 1 h. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to evaluate a production process of impregnation of copper particles in nonwoven fabric (TNT). To do so, we isolated copper particles from copper sulfate solution with constant heating, simultaneously impregnating pieces of TNT cut from commercial disposable protective masks. We performed SEM and EDS analysis to evaluate the impregnation and particle sizes. Visually, the pieces were partially impregnated which was confirmed by the SEM images where one can see only some fibers covered by the particles. Also, it is possible to notice that the size of the particles was at microscale with some agglomeration. The EDS confirmed 1.1% by mass of copper particles in the sample. The procedure was easy to follow and at a low-cost being, therefore, possible to be implemented after some parameter adjustments. ? 2022 IEEE.","output":"Copper Nanoparticles Impregnation in anti-Coronavirus Covid'19 Disposable Protective Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as the type of hyperglycemia diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy, presenting with intermediate glucose levels between normal levels for pregnancy and glucose levels diagnostic of diabetes in the non-pregnant state. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze studies of prevalence of GDM in European countries at regional and sub-regional levels, according to age, trimester, body weight, and GDM diagnostic criteria. Methods: Systematic search was conducted in five databases to retrieve studies from 2014 to 2019 reporting the prevalence of GDM in Europe. Two authors have independently screened titles and abstracts and full text according to eligibility using Covidence software. A random-effects model was used to quantify weighted GDM prevalence estimates. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: From the searched databases, 133 research reports were deemed eligible and included in the meta-analysis. The research reports yielded 254 GDM-prevalence studies that tested 15,572,847 pregnant women between 2014 and 2019. The 133 research reports were from 24 countries in Northern Europe (44.4%), Southern Europe (27.1%), Western Europe (24.1%), and Eastern Europe (4.5%). The overall weighted GDM prevalence in the 24 European countries was estimated at 10.9% (95% CI: 10.0-11.8, I2 : 100%). The weighted GDM prevalence was highest in the Eastern Europe (31.5%, 95% CI: 19.8-44.6, I2 : 98.9%), followed by in Southern Europe (12.3%, 95% CI: 10.9-13.9, I2 : 99.6%), Western Europe (10.7%, 95% CI: 9.5-12.0, I2 : 99.9%), and Northern Europe (8.9%, 95% CI: 7.9-10.0, I2 : 100). GDM prevalence was 2.14-fold increased in pregnant women with maternal age 30 years (versus 15-29 years old), 1.47-fold if the diagnosis was made in the third trimester (versus second trimester), and 6.79- fold in obese and 2.29-fold in overweight women (versus normal weight). Conclusions: In Europe, GDM is significant in pregnant women, around 11%, with the highest prevalence in pregnant women of Eastern European countries (31.5%).

Despite considerable effort and ample experimental data, the role of neuroinflammation related to systemic inflammation is still unsettled. While the implication of microglia is well recognized, the exact contribution of peripheral monocytes/macrophages is still largely unknown, especially concerning their role in the various stages of AD. OBJECTIVES: AD develops over decades and its clinical manifestation is preceded by subjective memory complaints (SMC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI); thus, the question arises how the peripheral innate immune response changes with the progression of the disease. Therefore, to further investigate the roles of monocytes/macrophages in the progression of AD we assessed their phenotypes and functions in patients at SMC, MCI and AD stages and compared them with cognitively healthy controls. We also conceptualised an idealised mathematical model to explain the functionality of monocytes/macrophages along the progression of the disease. RESULTS: We show that there are distinct phenotypic and functional changes in monocyte and macrophage populations as the disease progresses. Higher free radical production upon stimulation could already be observed for the monocytes of SMC patients. The most striking results show that activation of peripheral monocytes (hyperactivation) is the strongest in the MCI group, at the prodromal stage of the disease. Monocytes exhibit significantly increased chemotaxis, free radical production, and cytokine production in response to TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the peripheral innate immune system is activated during the progression from SMC through MCI to AD, with the highest levels of activation being in MCI subjects and the lowest in AD patients. Some of these parameters may be used as biomarkers, but more holistic immune studies are needed to find the best period of the disease for clinical intervention.

Digital self-care interventions have the potential to reduce health disparities, by providing personalised low-cost reusable resources that can increase access to health interventions. However, if under-served groups are unable to access or use digital technologies, Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) might make no difference, or worse, exacerbate health inequity. STUDY AIMS: To gain insights into how and why people with T2D access and use DHTs and how experiences vary between individuals and social groups. METHODS: A purposive sample of people with experience of using a DHT to help them self-care for T2D were recruited through diabetes and community groups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person and over the phone. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: A diverse sample of 21 participants were interviewed. Health care practitioners were not viewed as a good source of information about DHTs that could support T2D. Instead participants relied on their digital skills and social networks to learn about what DHTs are available and helpful. The main barriers to accessing and using DHT described by the participants were availability of DHTs from the NHS, cost and technical proficiency. However, some participants described how they were able to draw on social resources such as their social networks and social status to overcome these barriers. Participants were motivated to use DHTs because they provided self-care support, a feeling of control over T2D, and personalised advice or feedback. The selection of technology was also guided by participants preferences and what they valued in relation to DHTs and self-care support, and these in turn were influenced by age and gender. CONCLUSION: This research indicates that low levels of digital skills and high cost of digital health interventions can create barriers to the access and use of DHTs to support the self-care of T2D. However, social networks and social status can be leveraged to overcome some of these challenges. If digital interventions are to decrease rather than exacerbate health inequalities, these barriers and facilitators to access and use must be considered when DHTs are developed and implemented.

Increased rates of COVID-19 infection in EMS providers after patient care exposure, and notably after performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), have been reported. With an already strained workforce seeing rising call volumes and increased risk for AGP-requiring patient presentations, development of novel devices for the protection of EMS providers is of great importance.Based on the concept of a negative pressure room, the AerosolVE BioDome is designed to encapsulate the patient and contain aerosolized infectious particles produced during AGPs, making the cabin of an EMS vehicle safer for providers. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the tent in mitigating simulated infectious particle spread in varied EMS transport platforms during AGP utilization. METHODS Fifteen healthy volunteers were enrolled and distributed amongst three EMS vehicles: a ground ambulance, an aeromedical-configured helicopter, and an aeromedical-configured jet. Sodium chloride particles were used to simulate infectious particles and particle counts were obtained in numerous locations close to the tent and around the patient compartment. Counts near the tent were compared to ambient air with and without use of AGPs (non-rebreather mask, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] mask, and high-flow nasal cannula [HFNC]). RESULTS For all transport platforms, with the tent fan off, the particle generator alone, and with all AGPs produced particle counts inside the tent significantly higher than ambient particle counts (P <.0001). With the tent fan powered on, particle counts near the tent, where EMS providers are expected to be located, showed no significant elevation compared to baseline ambient particle counts during the use of the particle generator alone or with use of any of the AGPs across all transport platforms. CONCLUSION Development of devices to improve safety for EMS providers to allow for use of all available therapies to treat patients while reducing risk of communicable respiratory disease transmission is of paramount importance. The AerosolVE BioDome demonstrated efficacy in creating a negative pressure environment and workspace around the patient and provided significant filtration of simulated respiratory droplets, thus making the confined space of transport vehicles potentially safer for EMS personnel.","output":"Novel Negative Pressure Procedural Tent Reduces Aerosolized Particles in a Simulated Prehospital Setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.

But the tumor proportion score (TPS) of PD-L1 was challenging owing to invasive sampling and intertumoral heterogeneity. There was a strong demand for the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system to measure PD-L1 expression signature (ES) non-invasively. METHODS: We developed an AI system using deep learning (DL), radiomics and combination models based on computed tomography (CT) images of 1,135 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with PD-L1 status. The deep learning feature was obtained through a 3D ResNet as the feature map extractor and the specialized classifier was constructed for the prediction and evaluation tasks. Then, a Cox proportional-hazards model combined with clinical factors and PD-L1 ES was utilized to evaluate prognosis in survival cohort. RESULTS: The combination model achieved a robust high-performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.950 (95% CI, 0.938C0.960), 0.934 (95% CI, 0.906C0.964), and 0.946 (95% CI, 0.933C0.958), for predicting PD-L1ES <1%, 1C49%, and 50% in validation cohort, respectively. Additionally, when combination model was trained on multi-source features the performance of overall survival evaluation (C-index: 0.89) could be superior compared to these of the clinical model alone (C-index: 0.86). CONCLUSION: A non-invasive measurement using deep learning was proposed to access PD-L1 expression and survival outcomes of NSCLC.

Previous researchers confused their own models' assumptions that these risks were independent with the idea that their analyses validated the presence of independent risks. This study avoids this pitfall. METHODS Cross-sectional analyses of the 2014-2019 National Health Interview Surveys (N=175,546) were conducted in 2020. RESULTS Logistic regressions found that e-cigarette use was associated with having had a myocardial infarction, but this association significantly varied on the basis of one's smoking history. With a host of demographic and clinical variables controlled, e-cigarette use was associated with lifetime myocardial infarction occurrence only among current smokers. A counterfactual analysis first removed all (current or former) e-cigarette?using respondents who had suffered a myocardial infarction without a history of smoking. The independent-effects model used in previous research misleadingly indicated that daily vaping increases never smokers odds of having had a myocardial infarction by 1.55 (95% CI=1.11, 2.15), even though no such myocardial infarction sufferers remained in the analyzed data. The association between myocardial infarction and vaping daily has shown a significant annual decline (AOR=0.81, 95% CI=0.67, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS There is no reliable evidence that e-cigarette use is associated with ever having had a myocardial infarction among never smokers. Contrary to concerns that the harms associated with e-cigarettes are only now emerging after more years of possible product use, the only evidence of time-dependent variation in the association between e-cigarette use and myocardial infarction ran counter to this possibility.

Here, we used SARS-CoV-2 to infect mammalian cells and observed the incorporation of N protein into SGs, which resulted in markedly impaired self-disassembly but stimulated cell cellular clearance of SGs.

Methods: We searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for pre-prints published prior to 05/05/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status. We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status, and (if available) cycle threshold values and/or duration of viral shedding by symptom status. We computed estimates of the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect meta-analysis. Findings: We screened 270 studies and included 6.

Cells used for the analyzes included four IL-2-dependent continuous T-cell lines (104-C1, 104-C7, MCH5-4 and DB FeTs) which arose from long-term passage, followed by limiting dilution cloning of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); two IL-2-independent T-cell lines (104-C1DL and MCH5-4DL) which originated from two of the IL-2-dependent lines, 104-C1 and MCH5-4; respectively; Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK); G355-5 brain-derived glial cells; and the T-cell lymphoma line, 3201. Cells were infected with FIV-PPR, FIV-34TF10, FIV 34TF10orf2rep, and a variant arising from FIV-PPR during ex vivo passage on 104-C1DL cells, termed FIV-PPRglial. Infection of the IL-2-dependent T-cell line, 104-C1, by FIV-PPR resulted in the specific and distinct upregulation of cytokine expression. In particular, these cells doubled their expression of the pleiotropic cytokines, interleukin-4 and interleukin-12 after FIV infection. Interferon- production also increased after infection with FIV whereas, TNF expression remained constant. Also, a marked upregulation of MHC class II expression was noted post infection of MCH5-4 and 104-C1 cells with FIV-PPR. Similar results were obtained after infection with FIV-34TF10orf2rep, indicating that the upregulation of cytokine expression is not an isolate-specific phenomenon.

Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues replication of HKU5-CoV, a second MERS-like group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate emergence potential of CoVs and offer a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains. Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.","output":"Trypsin treatment unlocks barrier for zoonotic coronaviruses infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In crises, citizens show changes in their information behavior, which is mediated by trust in sources, personal relations, online and offline news outlets and information and communication technologies such as apps and social media.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats received subcutaneous methylone (6, 12, or 24 mg/kg) or saline vehicle (n = 16/dose), and subgroups were decapitated after 40 or 120 minutes. Plasma and prefrontal cortex were analyzed for concentrations of methylone and its metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Frontal cortex and dorsal striatum were analyzed for dopamine, 5-HT, and their metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection. Brain and plasma concentrations of methylone and its metabolites rose with increasing methylone dose, but brain methylone and MDC concentrations were greater than dose-proportional. Brain-to-plasma ratios for methylone and MDC were &#8805; 3 (range 3-12), whereas those for HHMC and HMMC were &#8804; 0.2 (range 0.01-0.2).

While there is growing interest in solving the problem, much of the work to date focuses on attitudes of distrust among members of underrepresented communities. However, there is also a pressing need to understand existing barriers within the cultural and structural context of researchers and research staff. METHODS: This study adopted a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design to allow for a focused examination of barriers to inclusive research recruitment among researchers and staff. Barriers first identified from an initial quantitative investigation (web-based survey; n = 279) were further explored through qualitative methods (key informant interviews; n = 26). Participants were investigators and research team members in both phases of the study. RESULTS: The survey revealed a paradoxical disconnect between participants reported belief in the abstract value of diversity in research participation (87.1% important/extremely important) and belief in it as an important goal in their own specific research (38.3% important/extremely important). Interviews reveal that researchers and staff perceive many barriers to the recruitment of members of underrepresented groups and hold a general view of diversity in research as an impractical, even unattainable, goal. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial that principal investigators not only understand the consequences of the continued exclusion of marginalized groups from research but also implement strategies to reverse this trend and communicate with research staff on the issue. While individual bias does play a role (ex: a priori assumptions about the willingness or ability of members of underrepresented groups to participate), these behaviors are part of a larger context of systemic racism.","output":"Theres not much we can do researcher-level barriers to the inclusion of underrepresented participants in translational research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The focus of national governments and the medical profession on the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in neglect of care for children with new onset illnesses.

Human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged in East China in March 2013. In contrast to seasonal influenza A viruses, H7N9 infections showed a strong sex bias. Over the five epidemic waves in China, ~70% of all H7N9 cases were observed in men. Thus, in this human cohort, we retrospectively analyzed sex hormones as well as inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in men and women infected with avian H7N9 influenza. Methods. We systematically analyzed the underlying correlation based on established human cohorts of two age groups (18-49 years and []50 years) including laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases as well as seasonal influenza cases, H7N9 close contacts and poultry workers as controls in dependency on sex. The level of testosterone, estradiol and cytokines/chemokines were measured in all study participants. We compared the levels of sex hormones, cytokines/chemokines by sex and disease outcome. Findings. We included H7N9 cases (n=98), close contacts (n=71), poultry workers (n=108) and mild seasonal influenza cases (n=53) in this study. Samples were collected between 2014 and 2017. All control groups showed similar median age within H7N9 cases except for the seasonal influenza group with a younger median age. In H7N9 infected men, testosterone levels were strongly reduced compared to male H7N9 virus-negative close contacts or males with seasonal influenza. Low testosterone levels in H7N9 infected men correlated with high inflammatory cytokine levels, e.g. IL-6, and lethal outcome in those 18-49 years of age. No significant differences were detected in estradiol levels in H7N9 infected men. In H7N9 infected women ([] 50 years), estradiol levels were significantly elevated compared to H7N9 virus-negative close contacts. However, increased estradiol levels did not significantly correlate with lethal outcome in women albeit a slight tendency towards poor outcome could be detected. Interpretation. This study provides evidence that low testosterone levels in H7N9 influenza infected men correlate with inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses and lethal outcome. Thus, treatment of H7N9 influenza virus infected patients should consider sex-specific mitigation strategies.","output":"Low testosterone and high cytokine levels correlate with lethal H7N9 infections in men: a retrospective cohort study from 98 H7N9 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Epidemiological and animal studies provide compelling indications that environmental and engineered nanomaterials (NMs) pose a risk for pregnancy, fetal development and offspring health later in life. Understanding the origin and mechanisms underlying NM-induced developmental toxicity will be a cornerstone in the protection of sensitive populations and the design of safe and sustainable nanotechnology applications. MAIN BODY Direct toxicity originating from NMs crossing the placental barrier is frequently assumed to be the key pathway in developmental toxicity. However, placental transfer of particles is often highly limited, and evidence is growing that NMs can also indirectly interfere with fetal development. Here, we outline current knowledge on potential indirect mechanisms in developmental toxicity of NMs. SHORT CONCLUSION Until now, research on developmental toxicity has mainly focused on the biodistribution and placental translocation of NMs to the fetus to delineate underlying processes. Systematic research addressing NM impact on maternal and placental tissues as potential contributors to mechanistic pathways in developmental toxicity is only slowly gathering momentum. So far, maternal and placental oxidative stress and inflammation, activation of placental toll-like receptors (TLRs), impairment of placental growth and secretion of placental hormones, and vascular factors have been suggested to mediate indirect developmental toxicity of NMs. Therefore, NM effects on maternal and placental tissue function ought to be comprehensively evaluated in addition to placental transfer in the design of future studies of developmental toxicity and risk assessment of NM exposure during pregnancy.","output":"Recent insights on indirect mechanisms in developmental toxicity of nanomaterials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Viral gastroenteritis is a major health problem with significant morbidity and economic consequences. Viral gastroenteritis is caused by a number of viruses, including norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, and sapovirus.

Most laboratories now offer norovirus real-time PCR testing however the availability of other assays is variable. Commercial methods for the detection of inflectional intestinal disease (IID) are available but these can be expensive and are not commonly used. This paper describes the development of a single multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of adenovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus and sapovirus from stool samples.

Methods: Four hundred and forty two nose and throat swabs were collected in viral transport medium, and were tested with Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST v2. Multiplex RT-PCR and single RT-PCR were used as references. Results: Overall, sensitivity of the Luminex against reference assays was 91.8%, 95% CI 88.1-94.7 (270/294), whilst 112/6336 (1.8%, 95% CI, 1.4-2.1) of pathogens were detected by the Luminex, but not by reference assays. Frequency of pathogens detected by Luminex and reference assays was 379 and 292, respectively. The diagnostic yield was 66.7% (295/442, 95%CI 62.1-71.1%) for the Luminex assay and 54.1% (239/442, 95% CI, 49.3-58.8%) for reference assays.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1stC6(th)year medical students, at a university in Southern Thailand; from September to October 2021. The participants completed online questionnaires; including, demographic data, Global Physical Activity, PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 questionnaire. The association between PA levels and mental health was assessed using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 325 medical students, 42.8% were males and 51.1% were clinical medical students. The prevalence of moderate to severe depression and anxiety was 31% and 12.9%. In total, 49.7% of participants had low PA levels. Pre-clinical students had a higher risk of depression (OR 2.11 p-value 0.001) and anxiety (OR 2.20 p-value 0.045) than clinical students. We also found that moderate or high PA levels were not a significant factor with mental health status (p-value of depression 0.447, 0.823 and p-value of anxiety 0.362, p-value 0.574, respectively). CONCLUSION: There were a lot of medical students with moderate to severe depression and anxiety, and about half of those had low PA levels; especially, pre-clinical students that learned online study activities. There was no significant association between PA levels and mental health status.

IMS uses the Internet of Things (IoT) platform for handling data as well as Interoperability and Communication among the devices and components in the IMS. Moreover, IMS includes a personal cloud server for computing and storing the acquired data of PV systems. The IMS also consists of a web monitor system via some open-source and lightweight software that displays the information to multiple users. The IMS uses deep ensemble models for fault detection and power prediction in PV systems. A remarkable ability of the IMS is the prediction of the output power of the PV system to increase energy yield and identify malfunctions in PV plants. To this end, a long short-term memory (LSTM) ensemble neural network is developed to predict the output power of PV systems under different environmental conditions. On the other hand, the IMS uses machine learning-based models to detect numerous faults in PV systems. The fault diagnostic of IMS is based on the following stages. Firstly, major features are elicited through an analysis of CurrentCVoltage (ICV) characteristic curve under different faulty and normal events. Second, an ensemble learning model including Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for detecting and classifying fault events. To enhance the performance in the process of fault detection, a feature selection algorithm is also applied. A PV system has been designed and implemented for testing and validating the IMS under real conditions. IMS is an interoperable, scalable, and replicable solution for holistic monitoring of PV plant from data acquisition, storing, pre-and post-processing to malfunction and failure diagnosis, performance and energy yield assessment, and output power prediction.","output":"Cloud Computing and IoT Based Intelligent Monitoring System for Photovoltaic Plants Using Machine Learning Techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We hypothesised that cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could have affected SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including generating reduced susceptibility in children.

We estimated a duration of immunity to seasonal HCoVs of 7.3 years (95%CI 6.8 - 7.9) and show that, while cross-protection between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the age distribution, it is insufficient to explain the age pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales.

Serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair, and the incubation period are key parameters in determining the control strategies for COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate surveillance of HCWs and estimate the serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS A total of 149 HCWs and 36 certain infector-infectee pairs between 19th March 2020 and 1st November 2020 in a university hospital were included in the study. Epidemiological characteristics were recorded. Serial interval and incubation period were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models. RESULTS Forty HCWs (26.8%) were detected via contact-based surveillance. Of 100 HCWs epidemiologically linked with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 36 (36%) had contact with a colleague. The median serial interval was 3.93 days (95% CI: 3.17-4.83). Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% had developed symptoms 13.71 (95% CI: 9.39-18.73) days after symptom onset of the primary case.

Since 2016, in our teaching hospital of Terni, an ASP has been implemented in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, with the daily-ICU round strategy and particular attention to infection control measures.

In March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) arrived and the same ICU was reserved only for COVID-19 patients. In our retrospective observational study, we analyzed the bimonthly incidence of CRE colonization patients and the incidence of CRE acquisition in our ICU during the period of January 2019 to June 2020. In consideration of the great attention and training of all staff on infection control measures in the COVID-19 era, we would have expected a clear reduction in CRE acquisition, but this did not happen. In fact, the incidence of CRE acquisition went from 6.7% in 2019 to 50% in MarchCApril 2020. We noted that 67% of patients that had been changed in posture with prone position were colonized by CRE, while only 37% of patients that had not been changed in posture were colonized by CRE.

However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. In this observational population-based study we examined intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. Methods: In November, 2020 we analyzed longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 US adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study (UAS) using multinomial logistic regresion. Participants reporting being willing, undecided and unwilling to get vaccinated against coronavirus across 13 assessments conducted from April-October, 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against the coronavirus were also assessed on a four-point Likert scale. Results: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the portion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RRR=2.47, 95% CI: 2.04-3.00;unwilling: RRR=1.92, 95% CI:1.67-2.20), Black participants (undecided: RRR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.73-2.74;unwilling: RRR=1.98, 95% CI:1.63-2.42), and females (undecided: RRR=1.41, 95% CI:1.20-1.65;unwilling: RRR=1.29, 95% CI:1.14-1.46).

The FBSED method is used to decompose CXI and CCTI into sub-band images (SBIs).

Deep features from each channel are fused to get a feature vector. Different classifiers are used to classify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other viral and bacterial pneumonia and healthy subjects with the extracted feature vector. The different combinations of channels have also been analyzed to make the process computationally efficient. For CXI and CCTI databases, the best performance has been obtained with only one and four channels, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated using 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation processes. The average accuracy for the CXI database was 100% for both 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation processes, and for the CCTI database, it is 97.6% for the 5-fold cross-validation process.

Research Design & Methods: We use qualitative information from surveys that cover about 24 000 organisations and 5100 households in all Russian regions. The total economic sentiment indicator (TESI) combines information on 18 survey-based indicators. Cross-correlation analysis, Hodrick-Prescott filtering, and a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with dummy variables are used as the research methods. Findings: The study confirms an almost synchronous cyclic conformity of the gross domestic product (GDP) growth and TESI dynamics for the period of 1998-2020. Probable GDP growth until the end of 2021 is estimated based on the expected impulses in the TESI dynamics, including those due to the sudden impact of the coronavirus. Implications & Recommendations: Assessments of business and household activity are reliable and available much earlier than quantitative statistics on GDP growth. Therefore, we advise to use them as an early warning system about economic growth and take them into account in policymaking.

MDSCs are reported to be abundant in the lungs of active tuberculosis (TB) patients. We sought to perform an in-depth study of MDSCs during latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB (ATB) using the nonhuman primate (NHP) model of pulmonary TB. We found a higher proportion of granulocytic, polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) in the lungs of ATB animals compared to those with LTBI or naive control animals. Active disease in the lung, but not LTBI, was furthermore associated with higher proliferation, expansion, and immunosuppressive capabilities of PMN-MDSCs, as shown by enhanced expression of Ki67, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), interleukin-10 (IL-10), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). These immunosuppressive PMN-MDSCs specifically localized to the lymphocytic cuff at the periphery of the granulomas in animals with ATB. Conversely, these cells were scarcely distributed in interstitial lung tissue and the inner core of granulomas. This spatial regulation suggests an important immunomodulatory role of PMN-MDSCs by restricting T cell access to the TB granuloma core and can potentially explain dysfunctional anti-TB responses in active granuloma. Our results raise the possibility that the presence of MDSCs can serve as a biomarker for ATB, while their disappearance can indicate successful therapy.

In the past, we were limited to routine clinical data and published clinical trials. Today, we deal with massive, multiple data streams and easy access to new tests, ideas, and capabilities to process them. Whereas in the past getting information for decision\\\\making was a challenge, now, it is how to analyze, evaluate and prioritize all that is readily available through the multitude of data\\\\collecting devices. Clinicians must become adept with the tools needed to deal with the era of big data, requiring a major change in how we learn to make decisions. Major change is often met with resistance and questions about value. A Learning Health System is an enabler to encourage the development of such tools and demonstrate value in improved decision\\\\making. METHODS: We describe how we are developing a Biomedical Informatics program to help our medical institution's evolution as an academic Learning Health System, including strategy, training for house staff and examples of the role of informatics from operations to research. RESULTS: We described an array of learning health system implementations and educational programs to improve healthcare and prepare a cadre of physicians with basic information technology skills. The programs have been well accepted with, for example, increasing interest and enrollment in the educational programs. CONCLUSIONS: We are now in an era when large volumes of a wide variety of data are readily available. The challenge is not so much in the acquisition of data, but in assessing the quality, relevance and value of the data. The data we can get may not be the data we need. In the past, sources of data were limited, and trial results published in journals were the major source of evidence for decision making. The advent of powerful analytics systems has changed the concept of evidence. Clinicians will have to develop the skills necessary to work in the era of big data. It is not reasonable to expect that all clinicians will also be data scientists.

We discuss how the underlying dynamics depends on the carrying capacity K: from a simple dynamics to a more complex. This can also help in understanding the appearance of more complicated dynamics, for example, chaos and periodic oscillations, for large values of K. It is also presented that pathogens can invade in population and their invasion depends on the carrying capacity K which shows that the progression of disease in population depends on carrying capacity. More specifically, we establish all possible scenarios (the so-called transition diagrams) describing an evolution of an (always unique) locally stable equilibrium state (with only non-negative compartments) for fixed fundamental parameters (density independent transmission and vital rates) as a function of the carrying capacity K. An important implication of our results is the following important observation. Note that one can regard the value of K as the natural size (the capacity) of a habitat. From this point of view, an isolation of individuals (the strategy which showed its efficiency for COVID-19 in various countries) into smaller resp. larger groups can be modelled by smaller resp. bigger values of K. Then we conclude that the infection dynamics becomes more complex for larger groups, as it fairly maybe expected for values of the reproduction number [Formula: see text] . We show even more, that for the values [Formula: see text] there are several (in fact four different) distinguished scenarios where the infection complexity (the number of nonzero infected classes) arises with growing K.
